1
0:00:12.534,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Back in 2003,

2
0:00:15.654,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the UK government carried out a survey.

3
0:00:19.314,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And it was a survey that measured levels of numeracy

4
0:00:22.487,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in the population.

5
0:00:23.748,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And they were shocked to find out

6
0:00:25.415,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that for every 100 working age adults in the country,

7
0:00:28.803,000 --> 0:00:31,000
47 of them lacked Level 1 numeracy skills.

8
0:00:32.712,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now, Level 1 numeracy skills -- that's low-end GCSE score.

9
0:00:37.23,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's the ability to deal with fractions, percentages and decimals.

10
0:00:40.502,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So this figure prompted a lot of hand-wringing in Whitehall.

11
0:00:45.154,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Policies were changed,

12
0:00:46.806,000 --> 0:00:47,000
investments were made,

13
0:00:48.552,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and then they ran the survey again in 2011.

14
0:00:51.614,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So can you guess what happened to this number?

15
0:00:55.841,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It went up to 49.

16
0:00:57.309,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:58.782,000 --> 0:01:,000
And in fact, when I reported this figure in the FT,

18
0:01:01.255,000 --> 0:01:02,000
one of our readers joked and said,

19
0:01:02.95,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"This figure is only shocking to 51 percent of the population."

20
0:01:06.735,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:09.045,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But I preferred, actually, the reaction of a schoolchild

22
0:01:12.226,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when I presented at a school this information,

23
0:01:15.345,000 --> 0:01:16,000
who raised their hand and said,

24
0:01:16.9,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"How do we know that the person who made that number

25
0:01:19.44,000 --> 0:01:2,000
isn't one of the 49 percent either?"

26
0:01:21.279,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:22.557,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So clearly, there's a numeracy issue,

28
0:01:26.631,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because these are important skills for life,

29
0:01:28.765,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and a lot of the changes that we want to introduce in this century

30
0:01:32.656,000 --> 0:01:34,000
involve us becoming more comfortable with numbers.

31
0:01:35.121,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, it's not just an English problem.

32
0:01:36.993,000 --> 0:01:4,000
OECD this year released some figures looking at numeracy in young people,

33
0:01:41.947,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and leading the way, the USA --

34
0:01:44.751,000 --> 0:01:48,000
nearly 40 percent of young people in the US have low numeracy.

35
0:01:49.445,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, England is there too,

36
0:01:50.766,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but there are seven OECD countries with figures above 20 percent.

37
0:01:56.323,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That is a problem, because it doesn't have to be that way.

38
0:01:59.106,000 --> 0:02:01,000
If you look at the far end of this graph,

39
0:02:01.138,000 --> 0:02:03,000
you can see the Netherlands and Korea are in single figures.

40
0:02:04.122,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So there's definitely a numeracy problem that we want to address.

41
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, as useful as studies like these are,

42
0:02:12.284,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I think we risk herding people inadvertently into one of two categories;

43
0:02:17.708,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that there are two kinds of people:

44
0:02:19.508,000 --> 0:02:23,000
those people that are comfortable with numbers, that can do numbers,

45
0:02:23.881,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and the people who can't.

46
0:02:26.141,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And what I'm trying to talk about here today

47
0:02:28.266,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is to say that I believe that is a false dichotomy.

48
0:02:31.332,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's not an immutable pairing.

49
0:02:33.224,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I think you don't have to have tremendously high levels of numeracy

50
0:02:36.896,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to be inspired by numbers,

51
0:02:38.648,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and that should be the starting point to the journey ahead.

52
0:02:42.207,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And one of the ways in which we can begin that journey, for me,

53
0:02:46.542,000 --> 0:02:47,000
is looking at statistics.

54
0:02:48.292,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, I am the first to acknowledge that statistics has got somewhat

55
0:02:51.811,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of an image problem.

56
0:02:53.153,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:54.224,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's the part of mathematics

58
0:02:55.78,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that even mathematicians don't particularly like,

59
0:02:58.863,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because whereas the rest of maths is all about precision and certainty,

60
0:03:02.899,000 --> 0:03:04,000
statistics is almost the reverse of that.

61
0:03:05.613,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But actually, I was a late convert to the world of statistics myself.

62
0:03:10.292,000 --> 0:03:12,000
If you'd asked my undergraduate professors

63
0:03:12.398,000 --> 0:03:16,000
what two subjects would I be least likely to excel in after university,

64
0:03:17.181,000 --> 0:03:19,000
they'd have told you statistics and computer programming,

65
0:03:19.972,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and yet here I am, about to show you some statistical graphics

66
0:03:22.935,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that I programmed.

67
0:03:24.565,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So what inspired that change in me?

68
0:03:26.344,000 --> 0:03:29,000
What made me think that statistics was actually an interesting thing?

69
0:03:30.016,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's really because statistics are about us.

70
0:03:32.689,000 --> 0:03:34,000
If you look at the etymology of the word statistics,

71
0:03:35.295,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it's the science of dealing with data

72
0:03:37.928,000 --> 0:03:39,000
about the state or the community that we live in.

73
0:03:40.382,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So statistics are about us as a group,

74
0:03:43.76,000 --> 0:03:44,000
not us as individuals.

75
0:03:45.459,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I think as social animals,

76
0:03:46.953,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we share this fascination about how we as individuals relate to our groups,

77
0:03:50.921,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to our peers.

78
0:03:52.333,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And statistics in this way are at their most powerful

79
0:03:55.467,000 --> 0:03:56,000
when they surprise us.

80
0:03:57.297,000 --> 0:04:,000
And there's been some really wonderful surveys carried out recently

81
0:04:00.528,000 --> 0:04:01,000
by Ipsos MORI in the last few years.

82
0:04:02.266,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They did a survey of over 1,000 adults in the UK,

83
0:04:04.998,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and said, for every 100 people in England and Wales,

84
0:04:08.802,000 --> 0:04:09,000
how many of them are Muslim?

85
0:04:10.696,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now the average answer from this survey,

86
0:04:13.366,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which was supposed to be representative of the total population, was 24.

87
0:04:16.802,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That's what people thought.

88
0:04:20.502,000 --> 0:04:23,000
British people think 24 out of every 100 people in the country are Muslim.

89
0:04:24.165,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Now, official figures reveal that figure to be about five.

90
0:04:29.552,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So there's this big variation between what we think, our perception,

91
0:04:33.563,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and the reality as given by statistics.

92
0:04:35.625,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I think that's interesting.

93
0:04:37.193,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What could possibly be causing that misperception?

94
0:04:41.032,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I was so thrilled with this study,

95
0:04:42.91,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I started to take questions out in presentations. I was referring to it.

96
0:04:46.414,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, I did a presentation

97
0:04:47.656,000 --> 0:04:49,000
at St. Paul's School for Girls in Hammersmith,

98
0:04:49.99,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and I had an audience rather like this,

99
0:04:52.154,000 --> 0:04:55,000
except it was comprised entirely of sixth-form girls.

100
0:04:56.046,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I said, "Girls,

101
0:04:59.418,000 --> 0:05:03,000
how many teenage girls do you think the British public think

102
0:05:03.985,000 --> 0:05:04,000
get pregnant every year?"

103
0:05:05.757,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And the girls were apoplectic when I said

104
0:05:09.273,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the British public think that 15 out of every 100 teenage girls

105
0:05:13.21,000 --> 0:05:14,000
get pregnant in the year.

106
0:05:15.249,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And they had every right to be angry,

107
0:05:17.504,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because in fact, I'd have to have closer to 200 dots

108
0:05:20.286,000 --> 0:05:21,000
before I could color one in,

109
0:05:21.88,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in terms of what the official figures tell us.

110
0:05:24.419,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And rather like numeracy, this is not just an English problem.

111
0:05:28.243,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Ipsos MORI expanded the survey in recent years to go across the world.

112
0:05:32.771,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And so, they asked Saudi Arabians,

113
0:05:35.745,000 --> 0:05:37,000
for every 100 adults in your country,

114
0:05:38.29,000 --> 0:05:4,000
how many of them are overweight or obese?

115
0:05:42.346,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And the average answer from the Saudis was just over a quarter.

116
0:05:48.222,000 --> 0:05:49,000
That's what they thought.

117
0:05:49.448,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Just over a quarter of adults are overweight or obese.

118
0:05:52.04,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The official figures show, actually, it's nearer to three-quarters.

119
0:05:56.845,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:58.325,000 --> 0:06:,000
So again, a big variation.

121
0:06:00.641,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And I love this one: they asked in Japan, they asked the Japanese,

122
0:06:05.111,000 --> 0:06:06,000
for every 100 Japanese people,

123
0:06:07.095,000 --> 0:06:09,000
how many of them live in rural areas?

124
0:06:10.341,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The average was about a 50-50 split, just over halfway.

125
0:06:15.266,000 --> 0:06:19,000
They thought 56 out of every 100 Japanese people lived in rural areas.

126
0:06:19.437,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The official figure is seven.

127
0:06:22.079,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So extraordinary variations, and surprising to some,

128
0:06:26.553,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but not surprising to people who have read the work

129
0:06:28.966,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of Daniel Kahneman, for example, the Nobel-winning economist.

130
0:06:33.382,000 --> 0:06:38,000
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky, spent years researching this disjoint

131
0:06:38.498,000 --> 0:06:41,000
between what people perceive and the reality,

132
0:06:41.667,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the fact that people are actually pretty poor intuitive statisticians.

133
0:06:45.442,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And there are many reasons for this.

134
0:06:47.226,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Individual experiences, certainly, can influence our perceptions,

135
0:06:50.365,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but so, too, can things like the media reporting things by exception,

136
0:06:54.347,000 --> 0:06:55,000
rather than what's normal.

137
0:06:56.675,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Kahneman had a nice way of referring to that.

138
0:06:58.825,000 --> 0:07:,000
He said, "We can be blind to the obvious" --

139
0:07:00.934,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so we've got the numbers wrong --

140
0:07:02.596,000 --> 0:07:04,000
"but we can be blind to our blindness about it."

141
0:07:04.942,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And that has enormous repercussions for decision making.

142
0:07:08.232,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So at the statistics office while this was all going on,

143
0:07:11.108,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I thought this was really interesting.

144
0:07:13.044,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I said, this is clearly a global problem,

145
0:07:15.078,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but maybe geography is the issue here.

146
0:07:17.537,000 --> 0:07:2,000
These were questions that were all about, how well do you know your country?

147
0:07:21.47,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So in this case, it's how well do you know 64 million people?

148
0:07:25.487,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Not very well, it turns out. I can't do that.

149
0:07:28.243,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So I had an idea,

150
0:07:29.591,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which was to think about this same sort of approach

151
0:07:32.738,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but to think about it in a very local sense.

152
0:07:34.867,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Is this a local?

153
0:07:36.082,000 --> 0:07:37,000
If we reframe the questions and say,

154
0:07:38.047,000 --> 0:07:4,000
how well do you know your local area,

155
0:07:40.193,000 --> 0:07:42,000
would your answers be any more accurate?

156
0:07:43.637,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So I devised a quiz:

157
0:07:45.423,000 --> 0:07:46,000
How well do you know your area?

158
0:07:48.274,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's a simple Web app.

159
0:07:50.187,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You put in a post code

160
0:07:51.394,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and then it will ask you questions based on census data

161
0:07:54.125,000 --> 0:07:55,000
for your local area.

162
0:07:56.125,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I was very conscious in designing this.

163
0:07:58.272,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I wanted to make it open to the widest possible range of people,

164
0:08:02.405,000 --> 0:08:04,000
not just the 49 percent who can get the numbers.

165
0:08:05.257,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I wanted everyone to engage with it.

166
0:08:07.036,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So for the design of the quiz,

167
0:08:08.585,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I was inspired by the isotypes

168
0:08:12.224,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of Otto Neurath from the 1920s and '30s.

169
0:08:14.85,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, these are methods for representing numbers

170
0:08:19.222,000 --> 0:08:2,000
using repeating icons.

171
0:08:21.46,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And the numbers are there, but they sit in the background.

172
0:08:24.649,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So it's a great way of representing quantity

173
0:08:27.396,000 --> 0:08:29,000
without resorting to using terms like "percentage,"

174
0:08:30.404,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"fractions" and "ratios."

175
0:08:31.658,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So here's the quiz.

176
0:08:34.13,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The layout of the quiz is,

177
0:08:35.801,000 --> 0:08:37,000
you have your repeating icons on the left-hand side there,

178
0:08:38.644,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and a map showing you the area we're asking you questions about

179
0:08:41.791,000 --> 0:08:42,000
on the right-hand side.

180
0:08:42.982,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There are seven questions.

181
0:08:44.287,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Each question, there's a possible answer between zero and a hundred,

182
0:08:48.204,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and at the end of the quiz,

183
0:08:49.577,000 --> 0:08:52,000
you get an overall score between zero and a hundred.

184
0:08:52.819,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And so because this is TEDxExeter,

185
0:08:54.927,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I thought we would have a quick look at the quiz

186
0:08:57.276,000 --> 0:08:59,000
for the first few questions of Exeter.

187
0:08:59.609,000 --> 0:09:,000
And so the first question is:

188
0:09:01.038,000 --> 0:09:03,000
For every 100 people, how many are aged under 16?

189
0:09:04.604,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, I don't know Exeter very well at all, so I had a guess at this,

190
0:09:08.228,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but it gives you an idea of how this quiz works.

191
0:09:10.813,000 --> 0:09:13,000
You drag the slider to highlight your icons,

192
0:09:14.543,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and then just click "Submit" to answer,

193
0:09:16.802,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and we animate away the difference between your answer and reality.

194
0:09:20.489,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And it turns out, I was a pretty terrible guess: five.

195
0:09:24.969,000 --> 0:09:25,000
How about the next question?

196
0:09:26.417,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is asking about what the average age is,

197
0:09:28.597,000 --> 0:09:3,000
so the age at which half the population are younger

198
0:09:31.066,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and half the population are older.

199
0:09:32.764,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And I thought 35 -- that sounds middle-aged to me.

200
0:09:36.138,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:40.026,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Actually, in Exeter, it's incredibly young,

202
0:09:42.156,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and I had underestimated the impact of the university in this area.

203
0:09:46.718,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The questions get harder as you go through.

204
0:09:48.773,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So this one's now asking about homeownership:

205
0:09:51.775,000 --> 0:09:54,000
For every 100 households, how many are owned with a mortgage or loan?

206
0:09:55.498,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I hedged my bets here,

207
0:09:56.802,000 --> 0:09:59,000
because I didn't want to be more than 50 out on the answer.

208
0:09:59.924,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:01.968,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And actually, these get harder, these questions,

210
0:10:04.458,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because when you're in an area, when you're in a community,

211
0:10:07.341,000 --> 0:10:12,000
things like age -- there are clues to whether a population is old or young.

212
0:10:12.615,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Just by looking around the area, you can see it.

213
0:10:14.984,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Something like homeownership is much more difficult to see,

214
0:10:18.399,000 --> 0:10:2,000
so we revert to our own heuristics,

215
0:10:21.031,000 --> 0:10:25,000
our own biases about how many people we think own their own homes.

216
0:10:25.506,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now the truth is, when we published this quiz,

217
0:10:29.18,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the census data that it's based on was already a few years old.

218
0:10:32.74,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We've had online applications that allow you to put in a post code

219
0:10:36.333,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and get statistics back for years.

220
0:10:38.451,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So in some senses,

221
0:10:39.664,000 --> 0:10:42,000
this was all a little bit old and not necessarily new.

222
0:10:43.237,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But I was interested to see what reaction we might get

223
0:10:46.9,000 --> 0:10:48,000
by gamifying the data in the way that we have,

224
0:10:49.641,000 --> 0:10:5,000
by using animation

225
0:10:51.072,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and playing on the fact that people have their own preconceptions.

226
0:10:55.328,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It turns out, the reaction was, um ...

227
0:11:00.148,000 --> 0:11:01,000
was more than I could have hoped for.

228
0:11:02.1,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It was a long-held ambition of mine to bring down a statistics website

229
0:11:05.505,000 --> 0:11:06,000
due to public demand.

230
0:11:06.937,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

231
0:11:08.761,000 --> 0:11:11,000
This URL contains the words "statistics," "gov" and "UK,"

232
0:11:12.249,000 --> 0:11:15,000
which are three of people's least favorite words in a URL.

233
0:11:15.515,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And the amazing thing about this was that the website came down

234
0:11:19.524,000 --> 0:11:21,000
at quarter to 10 at night,

235
0:11:21.641,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because people were actually engaging with this data

236
0:11:24.876,000 --> 0:11:25,000
of their own free will,

237
0:11:26.439,000 --> 0:11:28,000
using their own personal time.

238
0:11:28.498,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I was very interested to see

239
0:11:31.009,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that we got something like a quarter of a million people

240
0:11:34.746,000 --> 0:11:37,000
playing the quiz within the space of 48 hours of launching it.

241
0:11:38.042,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And it sparked an enormous discussion online, on social media,

242
0:11:41.993,000 --> 0:11:43,000
which was largely dominated

243
0:11:44.054,000 --> 0:11:47,000
by people having fun with their misconceptions,

244
0:11:48.071,000 --> 0:11:51,000
which is something that I couldn't have hoped for any better,

245
0:11:51.154,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in some respects.

246
0:11:52.338,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I also liked the fact that people started sending it to politicians.

247
0:11:55.588,000 --> 0:11:57,000
How well do you know the area you claim to represent?

248
0:11:58.201,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Laughter)

249
0:11:59.387,000 --> 0:12:,000
And then just to finish,

250
0:12:01.812,000 --> 0:12:03,000
going back to the two kinds of people,

251
0:12:04.166,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I thought it would be really interesting to see

252
0:12:06.447,000 --> 0:12:08,000
how people who are good with numbers would do on this quiz.

253
0:12:09.286,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The national statistician of England and Wales, John Pullinger,

254
0:12:12.326,000 --> 0:12:14,000
you would expect he would be pretty good.

255
0:12:15.344,000 --> 0:12:17,000
He got 44 for his own area.

256
0:12:17.817,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Laughter)

257
0:12:20.309,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Jeremy Paxman -- admittedly, after a glass of wine -- 36.

258
0:12:25.871,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Even worse.

259
0:12:27.356,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It just shows you that the numbers can inspire us all.

260
0:12:30.581,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They can surprise us all.

261
0:12:31.865,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So very often, we talk about statistics

262
0:12:33.928,000 --> 0:12:34,000
as being the science of uncertainty.

263
0:12:35.914,000 --> 0:12:36,000
My parting thought for today is:

264
0:12:37.72,000 --> 0:12:4,000
actually, statistics is the science of us.

265
0:12:40.779,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And that's why we should be fascinated by numbers.

266
0:12:43.591,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Thank you very much.

267
0:12:44.805,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.042,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My name is Glenn,

2
0:00:14.542,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm 25,

3
0:00:16.083,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I don't know my real last name.

4
0:00:19.542,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's not uncommon in America.

5
0:00:21.917,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Most black people in this country are walking around

6
0:00:24.917,000 --> 0:00:25,000
with a slave owner's last name.

7
0:00:27.458,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Black history has been systemically erased and altered for centuries.

8
0:00:32.75,000 --> 0:00:33,000
As I give this talk,

9
0:00:34.042,000 --> 0:00:38,000
there are more than 700 Confederate monuments standing nationwide.

10
0:00:38.792,000 --> 0:00:4,000
These were erected to honor Confederate soldiers

11
0:00:41.583,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who fought to maintain slavery --

12
0:00:43.458,000 --> 0:00:44,000
mostly in the South --

13
0:00:44.792,000 --> 0:00:46,000
from the 1890s to the 1950s,

14
0:00:47.292,000 --> 0:00:51,000
when Jim Crow laws enforcing racial segregation were in full effect.

15
0:00:52.625,000 --> 0:00:56,000
To this day, black people are forced to confront monuments of slaveholders

16
0:00:57.25,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in our public spaces.

17
0:00:59.417,000 --> 0:01:02,000
These memorials are a physical representation of a system

18
0:01:02.917,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that is actively working to define whose lives matter

19
0:01:06.667,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and whose lives do not.

20
0:01:08.625,000 --> 0:01:1,000
If we are going to disrupt the narrative,

21
0:01:10.917,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we have to start at the origin.

22
0:01:13.375,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Genocide, slavery and patriarchy started in the Americas

23
0:01:18.292,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with Christopher Columbus.

24
0:01:20.542,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Most people in the United States know about his voyage of 1492.

25
0:01:25.167,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Fewer people know that an estimated 250,000 indigenous Arawaks were wiped out

26
0:01:31.583,000 --> 0:01:33,000
within two years of his arrival.

27
0:01:34.083,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Even fewer people know

28
0:01:35.417,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that Columbus admitted in a letter written to Doña Juana de la Torre

29
0:01:40.042,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that "nine and 10-year-old girls were in high demand,

30
0:01:43.583,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and for girls of all ages a good price must be paid."

31
0:01:47.208,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Yet New York City's Columbus Circle has had him perched 76 feet high

32
0:01:52.042,000 --> 0:01:54,000
next to Central Park since 1892.

33
0:01:55.75,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I started Movers and Shakers,

34
0:01:58.25,000 --> 0:01:59,000
a nonprofit,

35
0:01:59.542,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to get the statue removed.

36
0:02:01.875,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Movers and Shakers is a group of activists, artists,

37
0:02:05.917,000 --> 0:02:09,000
educators and engineers focused on using immersive technology

38
0:02:10.208,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to highlight the narratives of the oppressed.

39
0:02:12.875,000 --> 0:02:14,000
In our campaign to knock Columbus off his pedestal,

40
0:02:15.875,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we engaged in a visually provocative form of activism.

41
0:02:20.208,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We created an augmented reality installation

42
0:02:22.458,000 --> 0:02:24,000
on the true story of Christopher Columbus

43
0:02:25.083,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and used it to host teach-ins in Columbus Circle and Times Square.

44
0:02:30.333,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Many see the controversy around the statue

45
0:02:33.167,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as tension between the Italian-American community

46
0:02:36.667,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and the indigenous community.

47
0:02:38.75,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The reality is that most black people are here in this country

48
0:02:43.25,000 --> 0:02:44,000
as a result of the atrocities

49
0:02:45.167,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that were kicked off by Christopher Columbus.

50
0:02:48.667,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So we ended up holding a slave auction in Union Square

51
0:02:53.167,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to tie into the genesis of the transatlantic slave trade.

52
0:02:57.667,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I ran the New York City Marathon in chains to spread awareness to this issue.

53
0:03:03.875,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I was also arrested in Giants Stadium for hosting a slave reenactment

54
0:03:07.75,000 --> 0:03:09,000
at their football team's home opener.

55
0:03:11.833,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We gave it everything that we had,

56
0:03:15.167,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but in the end,

57
0:03:16.542,000 --> 0:03:18,000
New York City decided to keep the statue,

58
0:03:19.125,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and New York State unanimously voted to make it a landmark.

59
0:03:23.125,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The news was devastating,

60
0:03:25.833,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but it opened up another door.

61
0:03:27.875,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We realized that with augmented reality

62
0:03:30.333,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you don't need permission from the government

63
0:03:32.667,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to put up a monument or to make a statement.

64
0:03:36.042,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You can just do it.

65
0:03:37.875,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So New York City right now

66
0:03:39.208,000 --> 0:03:43,000
currently has more than 150 statues of men and six of women

67
0:03:43.667,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and currently acknowledges slaveholders in public spaces as well.

68
0:03:47.125,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So we decided, why not just put up a bunch of AR monuments

69
0:03:50.042,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of women and people of color throughout the city?

70
0:03:53.333,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Typically, monuments are created

71
0:03:55.333,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to commemorate the achievements of the deceased,

72
0:03:58.708,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but with augmented reality, we can reroute the rules.

73
0:04:02.458,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We started with sports.

74
0:04:04.458,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Colin Kaepernick.

75
0:04:06.083,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He was the starting quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers,

76
0:04:09.458,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and he wanted to use his platform

77
0:04:11.083,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to highlight the injustice of systemic racism.

78
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So he consulted a Green Beret on the most respectful way to do this,

79
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and he decided to take a knee during the national anthem.

80
0:04:21.333,000 --> 0:04:23,000
He lost his contract with the 49ers,

81
0:04:23.667,000 --> 0:04:25,000
he was blackballed by every NFL owner,

82
0:04:26.458,000 --> 0:04:28,000
he was criticized by millions

83
0:04:28.708,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and even the president of the United States

84
0:04:30.791,000 --> 0:04:31,000
decided to insult him.

85
0:04:32.583,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It may be decades before Colin Kaepernick is adequately respected for his courage,

86
0:04:39.25,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so our team decided to do this.

87
0:04:42.458,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now anyone that walks by Trump Tower can see Colin Kaepernick take a knee

88
0:04:47.792,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in augmented reality,

89
0:04:49.375,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and there's nothing they can do about it.

90
0:04:51.375,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:53.292,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Representation matters.

92
0:04:55.958,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Serena Williams proved to the world

93
0:04:58.583,000 --> 0:05:,000
that a black girl from Compton can dominate a sport

94
0:05:01.583,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that's traditionally played at exclusive country clubs.

95
0:05:04.833,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Let's celebrate her now.

96
0:05:07.208,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Jackie Robinson.

97
0:05:08.708,000 --> 0:05:1,000
He broke the color barrier

98
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and empowered many black athletes to play in Major League Baseball.

99
0:05:15.5,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We're going to take this monument of him and put it in Ebbets Field

100
0:05:18.708,000 --> 0:05:2,000
so that anyone can see him swing for the fences

101
0:05:21.042,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.

102
0:05:23.5,000 --> 0:05:24,000
With augmented reality,

103
0:05:25.167,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we have the power to tell stories in public spaces that need to be told.

104
0:05:30.75,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The achievements of people like Frida Kahlo, Audre Lorde,

105
0:05:34.917,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Toussaint Louverture,

106
0:05:36.75,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Madam C.J. Walker --

107
0:05:38.75,000 --> 0:05:4,000
this should be common knowledge.

108
0:05:41.5,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Our vision is a "Pokémon Go" for a contextualized history.

109
0:05:46.208,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Augmented reality can also be used as a tool to support organizations

110
0:05:50.792,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that are fighting against systemic oppression.

111
0:05:54.125,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In 2019 we will release our free smartphone app

112
0:05:56.917,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with augmented reality monuments and content.

113
0:05:59.583,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You can take your smartphone and hold it over any one-dollar bill

114
0:06:02.958,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and see a scene in augmented reality

115
0:06:04.75,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that illustrates the injustice of cash bail.

116
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You can then click on the screen

117
0:06:09.583,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and be directed to the donation page of The Bail Project,

118
0:06:13.292,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a fund that raises money for people who cannot afford bail.

119
0:06:17.542,000 --> 0:06:18,000
With augmented reality,

120
0:06:19.042,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we the people have the power

121
0:06:22.208,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to highlight the narratives of the oppressed

122
0:06:24.417,000 --> 0:06:26,000
when institutions refuse to do so.

123
0:06:27.542,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We can use this tool to highlight the systemic implications

124
0:06:31.917,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of erasing someone's history.

125
0:06:34.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And more concretely,

126
0:06:35.833,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we can use this technology as a way to support initiatives

127
0:06:39.292,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that are fighting against systemic racism.

128
0:06:42.5,000 --> 0:06:46,000
With AR, we have the power to reimagine a world

129
0:06:47.167,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that prioritizes justice over oppression.

130
0:06:50.792,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Thank you.

131
0:06:52.083,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause and cheers)

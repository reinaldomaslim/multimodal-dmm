1
0:00:13.619,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Ten years ago,

2
0:00:15.089,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I got a phone call that changed my life.

3
0:00:18.897,000 --> 0:00:21,000
At the time, I was cardiologist at UCLA,

4
0:00:22.849,000 --> 0:00:25,000
specializing in cardiac imaging techniques.

5
0:00:26.286,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The call came from a veterinarian at the Los Angeles Zoo.

6
0:00:31.815,000 --> 0:00:33,000
An elderly female chimpanzee

7
0:00:34.469,000 --> 0:00:36,000
had woken up with a facial droop

8
0:00:37.292,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and the veterinarians were worried that she'd had a stroke.

9
0:00:40.628,000 --> 0:00:43,000
They asked if I'd come to the zoo

10
0:00:43.653,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and image the animal's heart

11
0:00:45.601,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to look for a possible cardiac cause.

12
0:00:49.291,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, to be clear, North American zoos are staffed

13
0:00:52.929,000 --> 0:00:56,000
by highly qualified, board-certified veterinarians

14
0:00:57.058,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who take outstanding care of their animal patients.

15
0:01:01.727,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But occasionally, they do reach into the human medical community,

16
0:01:05.813,000 --> 0:01:09,000
particularly for some speciality consultation,

17
0:01:10.414,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I was one of the lucky physicians who was invited in to help.

18
0:01:16.233,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I had a chance to rule out a stroke in this chimpanzee

19
0:01:22.736,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and make sure that this gorilla didn't have a torn aorta,

20
0:01:28.8,000 --> 0:01:32,000
evaluate this macaw for a heart murmur,

21
0:01:33.587,000 --> 0:01:4,000
make sure that this California sea lion's paricardium wasn't inflamed,

22
0:01:41.056,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and in this picture, I'm listening to the heart of a lion

23
0:01:45.314,000 --> 0:01:48,000
after a lifesaving, collaborative procedure

24
0:01:48.931,000 --> 0:01:5,000
with veterinarians and physicians

25
0:01:51.848,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where we drained 700 cc's of fluid from the sac

26
0:01:56.165,000 --> 0:02:,000
in which this lion's heart was contained.

27
0:02:00.569,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And this procedure, which I have done on many human patients,

28
0:02:05.382,000 --> 0:02:14,000
was identical, with the exception of that paw and that tail.

29
0:02:14.733,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now most of the time, I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians,

30
0:02:21.124,000 --> 0:02:26,000
discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments

31
0:02:26.158,000 --> 0:02:29,000
for my human patients,

32
0:02:29.599,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but some of the time, I was working at the Los Angeles Zoo

33
0:02:32.677,000 --> 0:02:37,000
with veterinarians, discussing symptoms and diagnoses and treatments

34
0:02:38.122,000 --> 0:02:4,000
for their animal patients.

35
0:02:40.748,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And occasionally, on the very same day,

36
0:02:45.841,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I went on rounds at UCLA Medical Center

37
0:02:49.62,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and at the Los Angeles Zoo.

38
0:02:52.523,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And here's what started coming into very clear focus for me.

39
0:02:58.861,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Physicians and veterinarians were essentially taking care

40
0:03:03.167,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of the same disorders in their animal and human patients:

41
0:03:08.337,000 --> 0:03:12,000
congestive heart failure, brain tumors,

42
0:03:12.85,000 --> 0:03:2,000
leukemia, diabetes, arthritis, ALS, breast cancer,

43
0:03:21.101,000 --> 0:03:26,000
even psychiatric syndromes like depression, anxiety,

44
0:03:26.241,000 --> 0:03:32,000
compulsions, eating disorders and self-injury.

45
0:03:32.788,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, I've got a confession to make.

46
0:03:35.666,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Even though I studied comparative physiology and evolutionary biology

47
0:03:42.515,000 --> 0:03:44,000
as an undergrad --

48
0:03:44.598,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I had even written my senior thesis on Darwinian theory --

49
0:03:49.136,000 --> 0:03:51,000
learning about the significant overlap

50
0:03:51.856,000 --> 0:03:53,000
between the disorders of animals and humans,

51
0:03:54.592,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it came as a much needed wake-up call for me.

52
0:04:00.311,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So I started wondering, with all of these overlaps,

53
0:04:04.799,000 --> 0:04:09,000
how was it that I had never thought to ask a veterinarian,

54
0:04:10.317,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or consult the veterinary literature,

55
0:04:12.844,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for insights into one of my human patients?

56
0:04:17.173,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Why had I never, nor had any of my physician friends and colleagues

57
0:04:23.324,000 --> 0:04:28,000
whom I asked, ever attended a veterinary conference?

58
0:04:30.327,000 --> 0:04:36,000
For that matter, why was any of this a surprise?

59
0:04:36.443,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I mean, look, every single physician accepts some biological connection

60
0:04:42.588,000 --> 0:04:44,000
between animals and humans.

61
0:04:45.488,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Every medication that we prescribe or that we've taken ourselves

62
0:04:50.257,000 --> 0:04:52,000
or we've given to our families

63
0:04:52.891,000 --> 0:04:55,000
has first been tested on an animal.

64
0:04:56.471,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But there's something very different

65
0:04:58.227,000 --> 0:05:04,000
about giving an animal a medication or a human disease

66
0:05:04.832,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and the animal developing congestive heart failure

67
0:05:08.777,000 --> 0:05:14,000
or diabetes or breast cancer on their own.

68
0:05:15.324,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now, maybe some of the surprise

69
0:05:17.955,000 --> 0:05:2,000
comes from the increasing separation in our world

70
0:05:21.539,000 --> 0:05:24,000
between the urban and the nonurban.

71
0:05:25.423,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You know, we hear about these city kids

72
0:05:28.121,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who think that wool grows on trees

73
0:05:32.192,000 --> 0:05:36,000
or that cheese comes from a plant.

74
0:05:36.256,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Well, today's human hospitals,

75
0:05:38.989,000 --> 0:05:44,000
increasingly, are turning into these gleaming cathedrals of technology.

76
0:05:45.81,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And this creates a psychological distance between the human patients

77
0:05:50.717,000 --> 0:05:52,000
who are being treated there

78
0:05:53.437,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and animal patients who are living in oceans

79
0:05:57.934,000 --> 0:06:,000
and farms and jungles.

80
0:06:01.452,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But I think there's an even deeper reason.

81
0:06:06.561,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Physicians and scientists, we accept intellectually that our species,

82
0:06:13.294,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Homo sapiens, is merely one species,

83
0:06:17.035,000 --> 0:06:22,000
no more unique or special than any other.

84
0:06:22.506,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But in our hearts, we don't completely believe that.

85
0:06:28.572,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I feel it myself when I'm listening to Mozart

86
0:06:32.866,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or looking at pictures of the Mars Rover on my MacBook.

87
0:06:38.266,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I feel that tug of human exceptionalism,

88
0:06:43.812,000 --> 0:06:47,000
even as I recognize the scientifically isolating cost

89
0:06:48.37,000 --> 0:06:54,000
of seeing ourselves as a superior species, apart.

90
0:06:54.746,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Well, I'm trying these days.

91
0:06:57.979,000 --> 0:07:01,000
When I see a human patient now, I always ask,

92
0:07:02.441,000 --> 0:07:06,000
what do the animal doctors know about this problem that I don't know?

93
0:07:07.283,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And, might I be taking better care of my human patient

94
0:07:12.745,000 --> 0:07:17,000
if I saw them as a human animal patient?

95
0:07:19.858,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Here are a few examples of the kind of exciting connections

96
0:07:24.095,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that this kind of thinking has led me to.

97
0:07:28.057,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Fear-induced heart failure.

98
0:07:30.894,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Around the year 2000,

99
0:07:33.398,000 --> 0:07:4,000
human cardiologists "discovered" emotionally induced heart failure.

100
0:07:40.898,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It was described in a gambling father who had lost his life's savings

101
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
with a roll of the dice,

102
0:07:49.152,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in a bride who'd been left at the alter.

103
0:07:53.823,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But it turns out, this "new" human diagnosis

104
0:07:58.464,000 --> 0:08:02,000
was neither new, nor was it uniquely human.

105
0:08:02.939,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Veterinarians had been diagnosing, treating and even preventing

106
0:08:08.867,000 --> 0:08:11,000
emotionally induced symptoms in animals

107
0:08:12.746,000 --> 0:08:17,000
ranging from monkeys to flamingos, from to deer to rabbits,

108
0:08:18.65,000 --> 0:08:21,000
since the 1970s.

109
0:08:22.968,000 --> 0:08:25,000
How many human lives might have been saved

110
0:08:26.334,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if this veterinary knowledge had been put into the hands

111
0:08:29.939,000 --> 0:08:32,000
of E.R. docs and cardiologists?

112
0:08:35.055,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Self-injury.

113
0:08:37.517,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Some human patients harm themselves.

114
0:08:41.652,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Some pluck out patches of hair,

115
0:08:45.352,000 --> 0:08:48,000
others actually cut themselves.

116
0:08:50.242,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Some animal patients also harm themselves.

117
0:08:54.064,000 --> 0:08:57,000
There are birds that pluck out feathers.

118
0:08:57.544,000 --> 0:09:04,000
There are stallions that repetitively bite their flanks until they bleed.

119
0:09:05.313,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But veterinarians have very specific and very effective ways

120
0:09:10.485,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of treating and even preventing self-injury

121
0:09:14.904,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in their self-injuring animals.

122
0:09:18.686,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Shouldn't this veterinary knowledge be put into the hands

123
0:09:21.733,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of psychotherapists and parents and patients

124
0:09:25.459,000 --> 0:09:27,000
struggling with self-injury?

125
0:09:29.497,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis.

126
0:09:34.332,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Sometimes, soon after giving birth,

127
0:09:37.467,000 --> 0:09:39,000
some women become depressed,

128
0:09:39.891,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and sometimes they become seriously depressed and even psychotic.

129
0:09:44.197,000 --> 0:09:46,000
They may neglect their newborn,

130
0:09:46.761,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and in some extreme cases,

131
0:09:48.937,000 --> 0:09:51,000
even harm the child.

132
0:09:52.086,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Equine veterinarians also know that occasionally,

133
0:09:56.312,000 --> 0:09:59,000
a mare, soon after giving birth,

134
0:09:59.433,000 --> 0:10:02,000
will neglect the foal, refusing to nurse,

135
0:10:02.646,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and in some instances, kick the foal, even to death.

136
0:10:09.018,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But veterinarians have devised

137
0:10:11.823,000 --> 0:10:16,000
an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome

138
0:10:17.296,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that involves increasing oxytocin in the mare.

139
0:10:21.561,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Oxytocin is the bonding hormone,

140
0:10:24.946,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and this leads to renewed interest,

141
0:10:27.635,000 --> 0:10:3,000
on the part of the mare, in her foal.

142
0:10:31.065,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Shouldn't this information

143
0:10:33.121,000 --> 0:10:36,000
be put into the hands of ob/gyn's

144
0:10:36.461,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and family doctors and patients

145
0:10:39.794,000 --> 0:10:44,000
who are struggling with postpartum depression and psychosis?

146
0:10:47.306,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Well, despite all of this promise,

147
0:10:49.653,000 --> 0:10:56,000
unfortunately the gulf between our fields remains large.

148
0:10:57.461,000 --> 0:11:02,000
To explain it, I'm afraid I'm going to have to air some dirty laundry.

149
0:11:02.99,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Some physicians can be real snobs

150
0:11:07.095,000 --> 0:11:09,000
about doctors who are not M.D.'s.

151
0:11:09.649,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I'm talking about dentists and optometrists and psychologists,

152
0:11:15.975,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but maybe especially animal doctors.

153
0:11:20.202,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Of course, most physicians don't realize that it is harder

154
0:11:24.075,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to get into vet school these days than medical school,

155
0:11:28.458,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and that when we go to medical school,

156
0:11:30.742,000 --> 0:11:32,000
we learn everything there is to know

157
0:11:33.355,000 --> 0:11:36,000
about one species, Homo sapiens,

158
0:11:36.478,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but veterinarians need to learn about health and disease

159
0:11:40.785,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish and birds.

160
0:11:45.763,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So I don't blame the vets for feeling annoyed

161
0:11:50.447,000 --> 0:11:55,000
by my profession's condescension and ignorance.

162
0:11:56.412,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But here's one from the vets:

163
0:11:59.152,000 --> 0:12:02,000
What do you call a veterinarian

164
0:12:02.559,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who can only take care of one species?

165
0:12:08.416,000 --> 0:12:11,000
A physician. (Laughter)

166
0:12:11.737,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Closing the gap has become a passion for me,

167
0:12:17.946,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and I'm doing this through programs

168
0:12:20.547,000 --> 0:12:23,000
like Darwin on Rounds at UCLA,

169
0:12:23.689,000 --> 0:12:28,000
where we're bringing animal experts and evolutionary biologists

170
0:12:29.236,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and embedding them on our medical teams

171
0:12:33.388,000 --> 0:12:36,000
with our interns and our residents.

172
0:12:37.326,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And through Zoobiquity conferences,

173
0:12:41.033,000 --> 0:12:45,000
where we bring medical schools together with veterinary schools

174
0:12:45.252,000 --> 0:12:47,000
for collabortive discussions

175
0:12:47.392,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of the shared diseases and disorders

176
0:12:50.193,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of animal and human patients.

177
0:12:54.319,000 --> 0:12:56,000
At Zoobiquity conferences,

178
0:12:57.162,000 --> 0:13:02,000
participants learn how treating breast cancer in a tiger

179
0:13:02.582,000 --> 0:13:04,000
can help us better treat breast cancer

180
0:13:05.535,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in a kindergarten teacher;

181
0:13:08.846,000 --> 0:13:12,000
how understanding polycystic overies in a Holstein cow

182
0:13:13.709,000 --> 0:13:15,000
can help us better take care

183
0:13:15.943,000 --> 0:13:19,000
of a dance instructor with painful periods;

184
0:13:20.503,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and how better understanding the treatment of separation anxiety

185
0:13:25.152,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in a high-strung Sheltie

186
0:13:27.561,000 --> 0:13:34,000
can help an anxious young child struggling with his first days of school.

187
0:13:34.962,000 --> 0:13:39,000
In the United States and now internationally, at Zoobiquity conferences

188
0:13:40.207,000 --> 0:13:46,000
physicians and veterinarians check their attitudes and their preconceptions

189
0:13:47.076,000 --> 0:13:53,000
at the door and come together as colleagues,

190
0:13:53.1,000 --> 0:13:58,000
as peers, as doctors.

191
0:13:58.965,000 --> 0:14:03,000
After all, we humans are animals, too,

192
0:14:04.385,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and it's time for us physicians to embrace

193
0:14:07.845,000 --> 0:14:11,000
our patients' and our own animal natures

194
0:14:12.392,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and join veterinarians

195
0:14:14.53,000 --> 0:14:18,000
in a species-spanning approach to health.

196
0:14:19.518,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Because it turns out,

197
0:14:21.731,000 --> 0:14:26,000
some of the best and most humanistic medicine

198
0:14:26.929,000 --> 0:14:31,000
is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human.

199
0:14:32.469,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And one of the best ways we can take care

200
0:14:35.851,000 --> 0:14:4,000
of the human patient is by paying close attention

201
0:14:40.952,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to how all the other patients on the planet

202
0:14:44.655,000 --> 0:14:5,000
live, grow, get sick and heal.

203
0:14:51.312,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Thank you.

204
0:14:53.897,000 --> 0:14:55,000
(Applause).

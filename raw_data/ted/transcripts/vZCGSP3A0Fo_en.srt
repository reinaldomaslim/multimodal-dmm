0:00:13.841,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 2019, humanity received a warning:

2
0:00:17.689,000 --> 0:00:19,000
30 of the world's leading scientists released the results

3
0:00:20.425,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of a massive three-year study into global agriculture

4
0:00:23.931,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and declared that meat production is destroying our planet

5
0:00:27.596,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and jeopardizing global health.

6
0:00:29.804,000 --> 0:00:3,000
One of the study's authors explained

7
0:00:31.582,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that "humanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet ...

8
0:00:35.15,000 --> 0:00:39,000
[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution."

9
0:00:40.935,000 --> 0:00:42,000
As somebody who's spent the last two decades

10
0:00:43.1,000 --> 0:00:46,000
advocating a shift away from industrial meat production,

11
0:00:46.212,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I wanted to believe that this clarion call was going to make a difference.

12
0:00:50.164,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The thing is, I've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades.

13
0:00:55.75,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Here's 2018 from the journal "Nature,"

14
0:00:59.276,000 --> 0:01:02,000
2017 from "Bioscience Journal,"

15
0:01:02.375,000 --> 0:01:05,000
2016 from the National Academy of Sciences.

16
0:01:06.367,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The main point of these studies tends to be climate change.

17
0:01:10.146,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But antibiotic resistance represents just as big of a threat.

18
0:01:14.64,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We are feeding massive doses of antibiotics to farm animals.

19
0:01:18.382,000 --> 0:01:22,000
These antibiotics are then mutating into superbugs

20
0:01:22.407,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that threaten to render antibiotics obsolete

21
0:01:25.45,000 --> 0:01:27,000
within all of our lifetimes.

22
0:01:27.985,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You want a scare?

23
0:01:29.185,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Google: "the end of working antibiotics."

24
0:01:32.589,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm going to get one thing out of the way:

25
0:01:34.643,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I am not here to tell anybody what to eat.

26
0:01:37.539,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Individual action is great,

27
0:01:39.459,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but antibiotic resistance and climate change --

28
0:01:42.184,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they require more.

29
0:01:44.212,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Besides, convincing the world to eat less meat hasn't worked.

30
0:01:48.918,000 --> 0:01:52,000
For 50 years, environmentalists, global health experts and animal activists

31
0:01:53.61,000 --> 0:01:56,000
have been begging the public to eat less meat.

32
0:01:57.194,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And yet, per capita meat consumption

33
0:01:59.274,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is as high as it's been in recorded history.

34
0:02:03.378,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The average North American last year ate more than 200 pounds of meat.

35
0:02:07.724,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I didn't eat any.

36
0:02:09.261,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:10.515,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Which means somebody out there ate 400 pounds of meat.

38
0:02:13.599,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:15.71,000 --> 0:02:16,000
On our current trajectory,

40
0:02:17.439,000 --> 0:02:21,000
we're going to need to be producing 70 to 100 percent more meat by 2050.

41
0:02:22.151,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This requires a global solution.

42
0:02:25.317,000 --> 0:02:28,000
What we need to do is we need to produce the meat that people love,

43
0:02:29.294,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but we need to produce it in a whole new way.

44
0:02:32.465,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I've got a couple of ideas.

45
0:02:34.347,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Idea number one: let's grow meat from plants.

46
0:02:37.813,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Instead of growing plants, feeding them to animals,

47
0:02:40.286,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and all of that inefficiency,

48
0:02:41.744,000 --> 0:02:43,000
let's grow those plants, let's biomimic meat with them,

49
0:02:44.673,000 --> 0:02:45,000
let's make plant-based meat.

50
0:02:46.968,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Idea number two: for actual animal meat,

51
0:02:49.83,000 --> 0:02:51,000
let's grow it directly from cells.

52
0:02:52.002,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Instead of growing live animals, let's grow the cells directly.

53
0:02:55.967,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It takes six weeks to grow a chicken to slaughter weight.

54
0:02:58.75,000 --> 0:03:,000
Grow the cells directly, you can get that same growth

55
0:03:01.298,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in six days.

56
0:03:03.693,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is what that looks like at scale.

57
0:03:07.237,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's your friendly neighborhood meat brewery.

58
0:03:09.941,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:12.86,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I want to make two points about this.

60
0:03:14.683,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The first one is, we believe we can do it.

61
0:03:16.829,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In recent years, some companies have been producing meat from plants

62
0:03:20.831,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that consumers cannot distinguish from actual animal meat,

63
0:03:24.902,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and there are now dozens of companies growing actual animal meat

64
0:03:28.677,000 --> 0:03:29,000
directly from cells.

65
0:03:30.582,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This plant-based and cell-based meat

66
0:03:32.794,000 --> 0:03:34,000
gives consumers everything that they love about meat --

67
0:03:35.431,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the taste, the texture and so on --

68
0:03:37.464,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but with no need for antibiotics

69
0:03:39.561,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and with a fraction of the adverse impact on the climate.

70
0:03:43.352,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And because these two technologies are so much more efficient,

71
0:03:46.529,000 --> 0:03:47,000
at production scale

72
0:03:47.996,000 --> 0:03:49,000
these products will be cheaper.

73
0:03:50.94,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But one quick point about that --

74
0:03:52.728,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it's not going to be easy.

75
0:03:54.603,000 --> 0:03:57,000
These plant-based companies have spent small fortunes on their burgers,

76
0:03:58.53,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and cell-based meat has not yet been commercialized at all.

77
0:04:02.685,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So we're going to need all hands on deck

78
0:04:04.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to make these the global meat industry.

79
0:04:07.979,000 --> 0:04:09,000
For starters, we need the present meat industry.

80
0:04:11.156,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We don't want to disrupt the meat industry,

81
0:04:13.386,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we want to transform it.

82
0:04:15.412,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We need their economies of scale,

83
0:04:17.139,000 --> 0:04:2,000
their global supply chain, their marketing expertise

84
0:04:20.347,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and their massive consumer base.

85
0:04:22.962,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We also need governments.

86
0:04:24.806,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Governments spend tens of billions of dollars every single year

87
0:04:28.374,000 --> 0:04:29,000
on research and development

88
0:04:30.034,000 --> 0:04:32,000
focused on global health and the environment.

89
0:04:33.007,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They should be putting some of that money into optimizing and perfecting

90
0:04:36.943,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the production of plant-based and cell-based meat.

91
0:04:41.673,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Look, tens of thousands of people died from antibiotic-resistant superbugs

92
0:04:46.99,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in North America just last year.

93
0:04:50.004,000 --> 0:04:55,000
By 2050, that number is going to be 10 million per year globally.

94
0:04:56.091,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And climate change represents an existential threat

95
0:05:00.043,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to huge portions of our global family,

96
0:05:03.223,000 --> 0:05:06,000
including some of the poorest people on the face of the planet.

97
0:05:07.396,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Climate change, antibiotic resistance -- these are global emergencies.

98
0:05:12.263,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Meat production is exacerbating these emergencies on a global scale.

99
0:05:17.43,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But we are not going to decrease meat consumption

100
0:05:20.063,000 --> 0:05:22,000
unless we give consumers alternatives

101
0:05:22.605,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that cost the same or less and that taste the same or better.

102
0:05:27.637,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We have the solution.

103
0:05:29.412,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Let's make meat from plants. Let's grow it directly from cells.

104
0:05:33.417,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's past time that we mobilize the resources that are necessary

105
0:05:37.414,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to create the next global agricultural revolution.

106
0:05:42.252,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Thank you.

107
0:05:43.436,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.64,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, before I became a dermatologist,

3
0:00:18.047,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I started in general medicine,

4
0:00:20.599,000 --> 0:00:22,000
as most dermatologists do in Britain.

5
0:00:22.815,000 --> 0:00:24,000
At the end of that time, I went off to Australia,

6
0:00:24.863,000 --> 0:00:25,000
about 20 years ago.

7
0:00:26.759,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What you learn when you go to Australia

8
0:00:28.88,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is the Australians are very competitive.

9
0:00:31.606,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And they are not magnanimous in victory.

10
0:00:33.663,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And that happened a lot:

11
0:00:35.727,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"You pommies, you can't play cricket, rugby."

12
0:00:38.159,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I could accept that.

13
0:00:40.277,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But moving into work --

14
0:00:42.607,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and we have each week what's called a journal club,

15
0:00:45.145,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when you'd sit down with the other doctors

16
0:00:47.603,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and you'd study a scientific paper

17
0:00:49.723,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in relation to medicine.

18
0:00:51.564,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And after week one, it was about cardiovascular mortality,

19
0:00:54.313,000 --> 0:00:57,000
a dry subject -- how many people die of heart disease,

20
0:00:57.993,000 --> 0:00:58,000
what the rates are.

21
0:00:59.377,000 --> 0:01:,000
And they were competitive about this:

22
0:01:01.353,000 --> 0:01:04,000
"You pommies, your rates of heart disease are shocking."

23
0:01:04.449,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And of course, they were right.

24
0:01:06.345,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Australians have about a third less heart disease than we do --

25
0:01:10.326,000 --> 0:01:13,000
less deaths from heart attacks, heart failure, less strokes --

26
0:01:14.117,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they're generally a healthier bunch.

27
0:01:16.177,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And of course they said this was because of

28
0:01:17.868,000 --> 0:01:19,000
their fine moral standing, their exercise,

29
0:01:19.932,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because they're Australians and we're weedy pommies, and so on.

30
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But it's not just Australia that has better health than Britain.

31
0:01:29.031,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Within Britain, there is a gradient of health --

32
0:01:32.559,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and this is what's called standardized mortality,

33
0:01:34.495,000 --> 0:01:36,000
basically your chances of dying.

34
0:01:36.583,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is looking at data from the paper about 20 years ago,

35
0:01:39.927,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but it's true today.

36
0:01:41.402,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Comparing your rates of dying 50 degrees north --

37
0:01:44.492,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that's the South, that's London and places --

38
0:01:46.759,000 --> 0:01:49,000
by latitude, and 55 degrees --

39
0:01:50.111,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the bad news is that's here, Glasgow.

40
0:01:52.495,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'm from Edinburgh. Worse news, that's even Edinburgh.

41
0:01:55.343,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:59.467,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So what accounts for this horrible space here

43
0:02:02.773,000 --> 0:02:04,000
between us up here in southern Scotland

44
0:02:04.977,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and the South?

45
0:02:05.987,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Now, we know about smoking,

46
0:02:07.405,000 --> 0:02:09,000
deep-fried Mars bars, chips -- the Glasgow diet.

47
0:02:10.107,000 --> 0:02:11,000
All of these things.

48
0:02:11.435,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But this graph is after taking into account

49
0:02:14.227,000 --> 0:02:16,000
all of these known risk factors.

50
0:02:16.291,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is after accounting for smoking, social class, diet,

51
0:02:20.06,000 --> 0:02:21,000
all those other known risk factors.

52
0:02:21.803,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We are left with this missing space

53
0:02:24.027,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of increased deaths the further north you go.

54
0:02:27.887,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now, sunlight, of course, comes into this.

55
0:02:30.524,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And vitamin D has had a great deal of press,

56
0:02:32.844,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and a lot of people get concerned about it.

57
0:02:34.846,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And we need vitamin D. It's now a requirement that children have a certain amount.

58
0:02:38.838,000 --> 0:02:4,000
My grandmother grew up in Glasgow,

59
0:02:41.07,000 --> 0:02:44,000
back in the 1920s and '30s when rickets was a real problem

60
0:02:44.656,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and cod liver oil was brought in.

61
0:02:46.854,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city.

62
0:02:50.798,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I as a child was fed cod liver oil by my grandmother.

63
0:02:54.718,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I distinctly -- nobody forgets cod liver oil.

64
0:02:57.742,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But an association: The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are,

65
0:03:02.524,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the less heart disease they have, the less cancer.

66
0:03:05.851,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin D is very good for you.

67
0:03:09.693,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And it is, to prevent rickets and so on.

68
0:03:11.987,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But if you give people vitamin D supplements,

69
0:03:14.707,000 --> 0:03:17,000
you don't change that high rate of heart disease.

70
0:03:18.139,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great.

71
0:03:21.867,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So what I'm going to suggest is that vitamin D is not the only story in town.

72
0:03:26.724,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It's not the only reason preventing heart disease.

73
0:03:30.035,000 --> 0:03:34,000
High vitamin D levels, I think, are a marker for sunlight exposure,

74
0:03:34.404,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and sunlight exposure, in methods I'm going to show,

75
0:03:37.619,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is good for heart disease.

76
0:03:40.058,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Anyway, I came back from Australia,

77
0:03:42.019,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and despite the obvious risks to my health, I moved to Aberdeen.

78
0:03:45.515,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:48.067,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now, in Aberdeen, I started my dermatology training.

80
0:03:51.218,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But I also became interested in research,

81
0:03:53.163,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and in particular I became interested in this substance, nitric oxide.

82
0:03:56.338,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now these three guys up here,

83
0:03:57.714,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Furchgott, Ignarro and Murad,

84
0:03:59.284,000 --> 0:04:02,000
won the Nobel Prize for medicine back in 1998.

85
0:04:02.546,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And they were the first people to describe

86
0:04:04.689,000 --> 0:04:07,000
this new chemical transmitter, nitric oxide.

87
0:04:08.034,000 --> 0:04:11,000
What nitric oxide does is it dilates blood vessels,

88
0:04:11.059,000 --> 0:04:12,000
so it lowers your blood pressure.

89
0:04:12.93,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It also dilates the coronary arteries, so it stops angina.

90
0:04:17.097,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And what was remarkable about it

91
0:04:18.483,000 --> 0:04:22,000
was in the past when we think of chemical messengers within the body,

92
0:04:22.554,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we thought of complicated things like estrogen and insulin,

93
0:04:25.724,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or nerve transmission.

94
0:04:27.194,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Very complex processes with very complex chemicals

95
0:04:30.489,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that fit into very complex receptors.

96
0:04:32.777,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And here's this incredibly simple molecule,

97
0:04:35.138,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a nitrogen and an oxygen that are stuck together,

98
0:04:38.476,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and yet these are hugely important for [unclear] our low blood pressure,

99
0:04:43.106,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for neurotransmission, for many, many things,

100
0:04:45.712,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but particularly cardiovascular health.

101
0:04:49.114,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I started doing research, and we found, very excitingly,

102
0:04:52.416,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that the skin produces nitric oxide.

103
0:04:55.026,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So it's not just in the cardiovascular system it arises.

104
0:04:57.923,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It arises in the skin.

105
0:04:59.79,000 --> 0:05:,000
Well, having found that and published that,

106
0:05:01.656,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I thought, well, what's it doing?

107
0:05:03.712,000 --> 0:05:04,000
How do you have low blood pressure in your skin?

108
0:05:05.192,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It's not the heart. What do you do?

109
0:05:07.283,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So I went off to the States, as many people do if they're going to do research,

110
0:05:11.354,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I spent a few years in Pittsburgh. This is Pittsburgh.

111
0:05:15.091,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I was interested in these really complex systems.

112
0:05:17.704,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We thought that maybe nitric oxide affected cell death,

113
0:05:21.745,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and how cells survive, and their resistance to other things.

114
0:05:24.225,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I first off started work in cell culture, growing cells,

115
0:05:27.592,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and then I was using knockout mouse models --

116
0:05:29.712,000 --> 0:05:3,000
mice that couldn't make the gene.

117
0:05:31.449,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We worked out a mechanism, which -- NO was helping cells survive.

118
0:05:35.859,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I then moved back to Edinburgh.

119
0:05:39.68,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And in Edinburgh, the experimental animal we use is the medical student.

120
0:05:42.462,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's a species close to human,

121
0:05:44.52,000 --> 0:05:45,000
with several advantages over mice:

122
0:05:46.422,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They're free, you don't shave them, they feed themselves,

123
0:05:49.878,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and nobody pickets your office saying,

124
0:05:51.998,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"Save the lab medical student."

125
0:05:54.398,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So they're really an ideal model.

126
0:05:57.661,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But what we found

127
0:05:59.622,000 --> 0:06:03,000
was that we couldn't reproduce in man the data we had shown in mice.

128
0:06:04.239,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It seemed we couldn't turn off the production

129
0:06:07.479,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of nitric oxide in the skin of humans.

130
0:06:10.559,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We put on creams that blocked the enzyme that made it,

131
0:06:13.351,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we injected things. We couldn't turn off the nitric oxide.

132
0:06:17.735,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And the reason for this, it turned out, after two or three years' work,

133
0:06:20.999,000 --> 0:06:24,000
was that in the skin we have huge stores

134
0:06:25.047,000 --> 0:06:28,000
not of nitric oxide, because nitric oxide is a gas,

135
0:06:28.135,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and it's released -- (Poof!) -- and in a few seconds it's away,

136
0:06:31.287,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but it can be turned into these forms of nitric oxide --

137
0:06:34.511,000 --> 0:06:37,000
nitrate, NO3; nitrite, NO2; nitrosothiols.

138
0:06:38.143,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And these are more stable,

139
0:06:39.559,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and your skin has got really large stores of NO.

140
0:06:43.719,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And we then thought to ourselves, with those big stores,

141
0:06:46.544,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I wonder if sunlight might activate those stores

142
0:06:49.855,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and release them from the skin,

143
0:06:51.599,000 --> 0:06:54,000
where the stores are about 10 times as big as what's in the circulation.

144
0:06:54.991,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation,

145
0:06:57.831,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system?

146
0:07:03.071,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Well, I'm an experimental dermatologist,

147
0:07:05.599,000 --> 0:07:06,000
so what we did was we thought

148
0:07:06.904,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we'd have to expose our experimental animals to sunlight.

149
0:07:10.431,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And so what we did was we took a bunch of volunteers

150
0:07:14.511,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and we exposed them to ultraviolet light.

151
0:07:17.209,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So these are kind of sunlamps.

152
0:07:18.938,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Now, what we were careful to do was,

153
0:07:21.634,000 --> 0:07:23,000
vitamin D is made by ultraviolet B rays

154
0:07:24.594,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and we wanted to separate our story from the vitamin D story.

155
0:07:28.57,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So we used ultraviolet A, which doesn't make vitamin D.

156
0:07:32.417,000 --> 0:07:34,000
When we put people under a lamp

157
0:07:34.698,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for the equivalent of about 30 minutes of sunshine in summer in Edinburgh,

158
0:07:39.774,000 --> 0:07:41,000
what we produced was, we produced a rise

159
0:07:42.314,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in circulating nitric oxide.

160
0:07:44.306,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So we put patients with these subjects under the UV,

161
0:07:47.154,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and their NO levels do go up,

162
0:07:49.57,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and their blood pressure goes down.

163
0:07:51.706,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Not by much, as an individual level,

164
0:07:54.083,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but enough at a population level

165
0:07:56.45,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population.

166
0:08:00.17,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And when we shone UV at them,

167
0:08:02.594,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or when we warmed them up to the same level as the lamps,

168
0:08:06.256,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but didn't actually let the rays hit the skin, this didn't happen.

169
0:08:09.518,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So this seems to be a feature of ultraviolet rays hitting the skin.

170
0:08:13.382,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, we're still collecting data.

171
0:08:15.206,000 --> 0:08:16,000
A few good things here:

172
0:08:16.654,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This appeared to be more marked in older people.

173
0:08:19.801,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I'm not sure exactly how much.

174
0:08:21.414,000 --> 0:08:22,000
One of the subjects here was my mother-in-law,

175
0:08:23.187,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and clearly I do not know her age.

176
0:08:26.139,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But certainly in people older than my wife,

177
0:08:29.571,000 --> 0:08:32,000
this appears to be a more marked effect.

178
0:08:32.704,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And the other thing I should mention

179
0:08:33.955,000 --> 0:08:35,000
was there was no change in vitamin D.

180
0:08:36.011,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is separate from vitamin D.

181
0:08:38.131,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So vitamin D is good for you -- it stops rickets,

182
0:08:39.667,000 --> 0:08:41,000
it prevents calcium metabolism, important stuff.

183
0:08:41.907,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But this is a separate mechanism from vitamin D.

184
0:08:44.939,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now, one of the problems with looking at blood pressure

185
0:08:47.515,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is your body does everything it can

186
0:08:49.067,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to keep your blood pressure at the same place.

187
0:08:50.65,000 --> 0:08:51,000
If your leg is chopped off and you lose blood,

188
0:08:52.299,000 --> 0:08:54,000
your body will clamp down, increase the heart rate,

189
0:08:55.204,000 --> 0:08:57,000
do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up.

190
0:08:57.428,000 --> 0:08:59,000
That is an absolutely fundamental physiological principle.

191
0:09:00.404,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So what we've next done

192
0:09:02.211,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is we've moved on to looking at blood vessel dilatation.

193
0:09:05.867,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So we've measured -- this is again,

194
0:09:07.364,000 --> 0:09:12,000
notice no tail and hairless, this is a medical student.

195
0:09:12.692,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In the arm, you can measure blood flow in the arm

196
0:09:15.31,000 --> 0:09:18,000
by how much it swells up as some blood flows into it.

197
0:09:18.542,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And what we've shown is that doing a sham irradiation --

198
0:09:22.017,000 --> 0:09:23,000
this is the thick line here --

199
0:09:23.486,000 --> 0:09:25,000
this is shining UV on the arm so it warms up

200
0:09:25.886,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but keeping it covered so the rays don't hit the skin.

201
0:09:28.71,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There is no change in blood flow, in dilatation of the blood vessels.

202
0:09:32.622,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But the active irradiation,

203
0:09:34.471,000 --> 0:09:37,000
during the UV and for an hour after it,

204
0:09:37.823,000 --> 0:09:39,000
there is dilation of the blood vessels.

205
0:09:39.92,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This is the mechanism by which you lower blood pressure,

206
0:09:42.52,000 --> 0:09:44,000
by which you dilate the coronary arteries also,

207
0:09:44.896,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to let the blood be supplied with the heart.

208
0:09:46.607,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So here, further data that ultraviolet -- that's sunlight --

209
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system.

210
0:09:55.879,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So we thought we'd just kind of model --

211
0:09:58.222,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Different amounts of UV hit different parts of the Earth at different times of year,

212
0:10:04.471,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so you can actually work out those stores of nitric oxide --

213
0:10:08.495,000 --> 0:10:1,000
the nitrates, nitrites, nitrosothiols in the skin --

214
0:10:10.751,000 --> 0:10:12,000
cleave to release NO.

215
0:10:13.623,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Different wavelengths of light have different activities of doing that.

216
0:10:17.448,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So you can look at the wavelengths of light that do that.

217
0:10:19.527,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And you can look -- So, if you live on the equator, the sun comes straight overhead,

218
0:10:23.512,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it comes through a very thin bit of atmosphere.

219
0:10:25.328,000 --> 0:10:27,000
In winter or summer, it's the same amount of light.

220
0:10:27.767,000 --> 0:10:29,000
If you live up here, in summer

221
0:10:30.28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the sun is coming fairly directly down,

222
0:10:32.936,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but in winter it's coming through a huge amount of atmosphere,

223
0:10:36.243,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and much of the ultraviolet is weeded out,

224
0:10:39.464,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and the range of wavelengths that hit the Earth

225
0:10:41.816,000 --> 0:10:43,000
are different from summer to winter.

226
0:10:44.144,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So what you can do is you can multiply those data

227
0:10:46.086,000 --> 0:10:47,000
by the NO that's released

228
0:10:48.079,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and you can calculate how much nitric oxide

229
0:10:51.263,000 --> 0:10:54,000
would be released from the skin into the circulation.

230
0:10:54.432,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Now, if you're on the equator here --

231
0:10:56.432,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that's these two lines here, the red line and the purple line --

232
0:10:59.859,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the amount of nitric oxide that's released is the area under the curve,

233
0:11:04.256,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it's the area in this space here.

234
0:11:06.287,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So if you're on the equator, December or June,

235
0:11:08.984,000 --> 0:11:11,000
you've got masses of NO being released from the skin.

236
0:11:12.24,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So Ventura is in southern California.

237
0:11:14.704,000 --> 0:11:16,000
In summer, you might as well be at the equator.

238
0:11:16.92,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's great. Lots of NO is released.

239
0:11:18.976,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Ventura mid-winter, well, there's still a decent amount.

240
0:11:22.919,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Edinburgh in summer, the area beneath the curve is pretty good,

241
0:11:26.88,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but Edinburgh in winter, the amount of NO that can be released

242
0:11:31.095,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is next to nothing, tiny amounts.

243
0:11:34.953,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So what do we think?

244
0:11:36.758,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We're still working at this story,

245
0:11:38.35,000 --> 0:11:39,000
we're still developing it, we're still expanding it.

246
0:11:40.262,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We think it's very important.

247
0:11:41.91,000 --> 0:11:44,000
We think it probably accounts for a lot of the north-south health divide within Britain,

248
0:11:45.503,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's of relevance to us.

249
0:11:47.134,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We think that the skin --

250
0:11:48.822,000 --> 0:11:5,000
well, we know that the skin has got very large stores

251
0:11:51.71,000 --> 0:11:53,000
of nitric oxide as these various other forms.

252
0:11:53.934,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We suspect a lot of these come from diet,

253
0:11:55.807,000 --> 0:11:57,000
green leafy vegetables, beetroot, lettuce

254
0:11:58.078,000 --> 0:12:01,000
has a lot of these nitric oxides that we think go to the skin.

255
0:12:01.398,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We think they're then stored in the skin,

256
0:12:03.542,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and we think the sunlight releases this

257
0:12:05.942,000 --> 0:12:07,000
where it has generally beneficial effects.

258
0:12:08.575,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And this is ongoing work, but dermatologists --

259
0:12:11.054,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I mean, I'm a dermatologist.

260
0:12:12.774,000 --> 0:12:14,000
My day job is saying to people, "You've got skin cancer,

261
0:12:15.302,000 --> 0:12:16,000
it's caused by sunlight, don't go in the sun."

262
0:12:17.182,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I actually think a far more important message

263
0:12:19.918,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is that there are benefits as well as risks to sunlight.

264
0:12:23.342,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Yes, sunlight is the major alterable risk factor for skin cancer,

265
0:12:29.095,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but deaths from heart disease are a hundred times higher

266
0:12:31.966,000 --> 0:12:32,000
than deaths from skin cancer.

267
0:12:33.918,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And I think that we need to be more aware of,

268
0:12:36.567,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and we need to find the risk-benefit ratio.

269
0:12:38.646,000 --> 0:12:39,000
How much sunlight is safe,

270
0:12:40.118,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and how can we finesse this best for our general health?

271
0:12:44.318,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So, thank you very much indeed.

272
0:12:46.498,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.844,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So this is a talk about gene drives,

2
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
but I'm going to start by telling you a brief story.

3
0:00:18.621,000 --> 0:00:21,000
20 years ago, a biologist named Anthony James

4
0:00:21.868,000 --> 0:00:23,000
got obsessed with the idea of making mosquitos

5
0:00:24.211,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that didn't transmit malaria.

6
0:00:27.683,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It was a great idea, and pretty much a complete failure.

7
0:00:32.596,000 --> 0:00:34,000
For one thing, it turned out to be really hard

8
0:00:35.28,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to make a malaria-resistant mosquito.

9
0:00:38.286,000 --> 0:00:41,000
James managed it, finally, just a few years ago,

10
0:00:41.937,000 --> 0:00:43,000
by adding some genes that make it impossible

11
0:00:44.032,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for the malaria parasite to survive inside the mosquito.

12
0:00:47.551,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But that just created another problem.

13
0:00:50.043,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now that you've got a malaria-resistant mosquito,

14
0:00:52.909,000 --> 0:00:55,000
how do you get it to replace all the malaria-carrying mosquitos?

15
0:00:58.107,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There are a couple options,

16
0:00:59.604,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but plan A was basically to breed up

17
0:01:01.651,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a bunch of the new genetically-engineered mosquitos

18
0:01:04.762,000 --> 0:01:05,000
release them into the wild

19
0:01:06.112,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and hope that they pass on their genes.

20
0:01:08.673,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The problem was that you'd have to release

21
0:01:10.811,000 --> 0:01:14,000
literally 10 times the number of native mosquitos to work.

22
0:01:15.135,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So in a village with 10,000 mosquitos,

23
0:01:17.246,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you release an extra 100,000.

24
0:01:20.229,000 --> 0:01:21,000
As you might guess,

25
0:01:21.403,000 --> 0:01:23,000
this was not a very popular strategy with the villagers.

26
0:01:24.181,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:26.963,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Then, last January, Anthony James got an email

28
0:01:30.691,000 --> 0:01:31,000
from a biologist named Ethan Bier.

29
0:01:33.4,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Bier said that he and his grad student Valentino Gantz

30
0:01:36.283,000 --> 0:01:38,000
had stumbled on a tool that could not only guarantee

31
0:01:39.251,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that a particular genetic trait would be inherited,

32
0:01:41.949,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but that it would spread incredibly quickly.

33
0:01:44.734,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If they were right, it would basically solve the problem

34
0:01:47.424,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that he and James had been working on for 20 years.

35
0:01:50.45,000 --> 0:01:54,000
As a test, they engineered two mosquitos to carry the anti-malaria gene

36
0:01:55.132,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and also this new tool, a gene drive,

37
0:01:57.315,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which I'll explain in a minute.

38
0:01:59.506,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Finally, they set it up so that any mosquitos

39
0:02:01.863,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that had inherited the anti-malaria gene

40
0:02:03.825,000 --> 0:02:06,000
wouldn't have the usual white eyes, but would instead have red eyes.

41
0:02:08.682,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That was pretty much just for convenience

42
0:02:10.756,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so they could tell just at a glance which was which.

43
0:02:14.192,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So they took their two anti-malarial, red-eyed mosquitos

44
0:02:16.973,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and put them in a box with 30 ordinary white-eyed ones,

45
0:02:19.656,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and let them breed.

46
0:02:21.383,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In two generations, those had produced 3,800 grandchildren.

47
0:02:26.217,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That is not the surprising part.

48
0:02:28.716,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is the surprising part:

49
0:02:30.662,000 --> 0:02:32,000
given that you started with just two red-eyed mosquitos

50
0:02:33.593,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and 30 white-eyed ones,

51
0:02:34.951,000 --> 0:02:36,000
you expect mostly white-eyed descendants.

52
0:02:38.514,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Instead, when James opened the box,

53
0:02:41.562,000 --> 0:02:44,000
all 3,800 mosquitos had red eyes.

54
0:02:45.315,000 --> 0:02:47,000
When I asked Ethan Bier about this moment,

55
0:02:47.379,000 --> 0:02:5,000
he became so excited that he was literally shouting into the phone.

56
0:02:51.886,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's because getting only red-eyed mosquitos

57
0:02:54.073,000 --> 0:02:56,000
violates a rule that is the absolute cornerstone of biology,

58
0:02:57.045,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Mendelian genetics.

59
0:02:58.912,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I'll keep this quick,

60
0:03:00.105,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but Mendelian genetics says when a male and a female mate,

61
0:03:02.893,000 --> 0:03:04,000
their baby inherits half of its DNA from each parent.

62
0:03:05.559,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So if our original mosquito was aa and our new mosquito is aB,

63
0:03:09.178,000 --> 0:03:1,000
where B is the anti-malarial gene,

64
0:03:11.004,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the babies should come out in four permutations:

65
0:03:13.415,000 --> 0:03:15,000
aa, aB, aa, Ba.

66
0:03:16.884,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Instead, with the new gene drive,

67
0:03:19.197,000 --> 0:03:2,000
they all came out aB.

68
0:03:21.9,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Biologically, that shouldn't even be possible.

69
0:03:24.476,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So what happened?

70
0:03:26.709,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The first thing that happened

71
0:03:28.177,000 --> 0:03:31,000
was the arrival of a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR in 2012.

72
0:03:32.701,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Many of you have probably heard about CRISPR,

73
0:03:34.835,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so I'll just say briefly that CRISPR is a tool that allows researchers

74
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to edit genes very precisely, easily and quickly.

75
0:03:41.533,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria.

76
0:03:45.286,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Basically, there's a protein that acts like a scissors

77
0:03:47.936,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and cuts the DNA,

78
0:03:49.194,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and there's an RNA molecule that directs the scissors

79
0:03:51.701,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to any point on the genome you want.

80
0:03:53.443,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The result is basically a word processor for genes.

81
0:03:56.157,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You can take an entire gene out, put one in,

82
0:03:58.807,000 --> 0:04:,000
or even edit just a single letter within a gene.

83
0:04:01.646,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And you can do it in nearly any species.

84
0:04:05.328,000 --> 0:04:08,000
OK, remember how I said that gene drives originally had two problems?

85
0:04:09.835,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The first was that it was hard to engineer a mosquito

86
0:04:12.979,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to be malaria-resistant.

87
0:04:14.39,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That's basically gone now, thanks to CRISPR.

88
0:04:17.117,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But the other problem was logistical.

89
0:04:19.307,000 --> 0:04:2,000
How do you get your trait to spread?

90
0:04:22.196,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This is where it gets clever.

91
0:04:24.943,000 --> 0:04:27,000
A couple years ago, a biologist at Harvard named Kevin Esvelt

92
0:04:28.569,000 --> 0:04:29,000
wondered what would happen

93
0:04:29.943,000 --> 0:04:32,000
if you made it so that CRISPR inserted not only your new gene

94
0:04:33.594,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but also the machinery that does the cutting and pasting.

95
0:04:37.233,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In other words, what if CRISPR also copied and pasted itself.

96
0:04:42.145,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You'd end up with a perpetual motion machine for gene editing.

97
0:04:46.458,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And that's exactly what happened.

98
0:04:49.037,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This CRISPR gene drive that Esvelt created

99
0:04:51.939,000 --> 0:04:54,000
not only guarantees that a trait will get passed on,

100
0:04:55.606,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but if it's used in the germline cells,

101
0:04:58.068,000 --> 0:05:,000
it will automatically copy and paste your new gene

102
0:05:00.668,000 --> 0:05:02,000
into both chromosomes of every single individual.

103
0:05:03.743,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's like a global search and replace,

104
0:05:06.164,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or in science terms, it makes a heterozygous trait homozygous.

105
0:05:11.045,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So, what does this mean?

106
0:05:13.68,000 --> 0:05:15,000
For one thing, it means we have a very powerful,

107
0:05:16.428,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but also somewhat alarming new tool.

108
0:05:20.576,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Up until now, the fact that gene drives didn't work very well

109
0:05:23.489,000 --> 0:05:24,000
was actually kind of a relief.

110
0:05:25.425,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Normally when we mess around with an organism's genes,

111
0:05:28.131,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we make that thing less evolutionarily fit.

112
0:05:30.504,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So biologists can make all the mutant fruit flies they want

113
0:05:33.361,000 --> 0:05:34,000
without worrying about it.

114
0:05:34.638,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If some escape, natural selection just takes care of them.

115
0:05:38.75,000 --> 0:05:41,000
What's remarkable and powerful and frightening about gene drives

116
0:05:41.997,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is that that will no longer be true.

117
0:05:45.092,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Assuming that your trait does not have a big evolutionary handicap,

118
0:05:48.68,000 --> 0:05:5,000
like a mosquito that can't fly,

119
0:05:50.783,000 --> 0:05:53,000
the CRISPR-based gene drive will spread the change relentlessly

120
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
until it is in every single individual in the population.

121
0:05:59.101,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, it isn't easy to make a gene drive that works that well,

122
0:06:02.014,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but James and Esvelt think that we can.

123
0:06:05.339,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The good news is that this opens the door to some remarkable things.

124
0:06:09.187,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If you put an anti-malarial gene drive

125
0:06:11.115,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in just 1 percent of Anopheles mosquitoes,

126
0:06:13.339,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the species that transmits malaria,

127
0:06:15.488,000 --> 0:06:19,000
researchers estimate that it would spread to the entire population in a year.

128
0:06:20.178,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So in a year, you could virtually eliminate malaria.

129
0:06:23.455,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In practice, we're still a few years out from being able to do that,

130
0:06:27.351,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but still, a 1,000 children a day die of malaria.

131
0:06:30.093,000 --> 0:06:32,000
In a year, that number could be almost zero.

132
0:06:32.966,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The same goes for dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fever.

133
0:06:37.211,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And it gets better.

134
0:06:39.215,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Say you want to get rid of an invasive species,

135
0:06:41.715,000 --> 0:06:43,000
like get Asian carp out of the Great Lakes.

136
0:06:44.434,000 --> 0:06:46,000
All you have to do is release a gene drive

137
0:06:46.482,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that makes the fish produce only male offspring.

138
0:06:49.386,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In a few generations, there'll be no females left, no more carp.

139
0:06:53.608,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In theory, this means we could restore hundreds of native species

140
0:06:56.711,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that have been pushed to the brink.

141
0:06:59.41,000 --> 0:07:02,000
OK, that's the good news,

142
0:07:02.721,000 --> 0:07:03,000
this is the bad news.

143
0:07:05.07,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Gene drives are so effective

144
0:07:07.122,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that even an accidental release could change an entire species,

145
0:07:10.971,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and often very quickly.

146
0:07:13.178,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Anthony James took good precautions.

147
0:07:15.328,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He bred his mosquitos in a bio-containment lab

148
0:07:17.518,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and he also used a species that's not native to the US

149
0:07:20.13,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so that even if some did escape,

150
0:07:21.709,000 --> 0:07:24,000
they'd just die off, there'd be nothing for them to mate with.

151
0:07:24.748,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But it's also true that if a dozen Asian carp with the all-male gene drive

152
0:07:28.795,000 --> 0:07:31,000
accidentally got carried from the Great Lakes back to Asia,

153
0:07:32.748,000 --> 0:07:35,000
they could potentially wipe out the native Asian carp population.

154
0:07:37.93,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And that's not so unlikely, given how connected our world is.

155
0:07:40.866,000 --> 0:07:42,000
In fact, it's why we have an invasive species problem.

156
0:07:43.912,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And that's fish.

157
0:07:45.428,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Things like mosquitos and fruit flies,

158
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
there's literally no way to contain them.

159
0:07:50.024,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They cross borders and oceans all the time.

160
0:07:53.754,000 --> 0:07:55,000
OK, the other piece of bad news

161
0:07:55.96,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is that a gene drive might not stay confined

162
0:07:58.302,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to what we call the target species.

163
0:08:00.556,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That's because of gene flow,

164
0:08:02.079,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which is a fancy way of saying that neighboring species

165
0:08:04.7,000 --> 0:08:05,000
sometimes interbreed.

166
0:08:05.972,000 --> 0:08:08,000
If that happens, it's possible a gene drive could cross over,

167
0:08:09.147,000 --> 0:08:11,000
like Asian carp could infect some other kind of carp.

168
0:08:11.698,000 --> 0:08:14,000
That's not so bad if your drive just promotes a trait, like eye color.

169
0:08:15.437,000 --> 0:08:17,000
In fact, there's a decent chance that we'll see

170
0:08:17.708,000 --> 0:08:19,000
a wave of very weird fruit flies in the near future.

171
0:08:21.39,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But it could be a disaster

172
0:08:22.677,000 --> 0:08:24,000
if your drive is deigned to eliminate the species entirely.

173
0:08:26.351,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The last worrisome thing is that the technology to do this,

174
0:08:29.903,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to genetically engineer an organism and include a gene drive,

175
0:08:33.618,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is something that basically any lab in the world can do.

176
0:08:36.976,000 --> 0:08:37,000
An undergraduate can do it.

177
0:08:39.209,000 --> 0:08:42,000
A talented high schooler with some equipment can do it.

178
0:08:44.526,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now, I'm guessing that this sounds terrifying.

179
0:08:47.351,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:49.581,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Interestingly though, nearly every scientist I talk to

181
0:08:52.495,000 --> 0:08:55,000
seemed to think that gene drives were not actually that frightening or dangerous.

182
0:08:56.4,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Partly because they believe that scientists will be

183
0:08:59.052,000 --> 0:09:01,000
very cautious and responsible about using them.

184
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:02.318,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So far, that's been true.

186
0:09:04.302,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But gene drives also have some actual limitations.

187
0:09:07.022,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So for one thing, they work only in sexually reproducing species.

188
0:09:10.704,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So thank goodness, they can't be used to engineer viruses or bacteria.

189
0:09:14.156,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Also, the trait spreads only with each successive generation.

190
0:09:17.37,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So changing or eliminating a population

191
0:09:19.387,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is practical only if that species has a fast reproductive cycle,

192
0:09:22.737,000 --> 0:09:24,000
like insects or maybe small vertebrates like mice or fish.

193
0:09:26.438,000 --> 0:09:28,000
In elephants or people, it would take centuries

194
0:09:28.723,000 --> 0:09:3,000
for a trait to spread widely enough to matter.

195
0:09:32.079,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Also, even with CRISPR, it's not that easy to engineer a truly devastating trait.

196
0:09:38.079,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Say you wanted to make a fruit fly

197
0:09:39.832,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that feeds on ordinary fruit instead of rotting fruit,

198
0:09:42.411,000 --> 0:09:44,000
with the aim of sabotaging American agriculture.

199
0:09:45.068,000 --> 0:09:46,000
First, you'd have to figure out

200
0:09:46.622,000 --> 0:09:48,000
which genes control what the fly wants to eat,

201
0:09:49.418,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which is already a very long and complicated project.

202
0:09:52.489,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Then you'd have to alter those genes to change the fly's behavior

203
0:09:55.817,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to whatever you'd want it to be,

204
0:09:57.379,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which is an even longer and more complicated project.

205
0:10:00.204,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And it might not even work,

206
0:10:01.546,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because the genes that control behavior are complex.

207
0:10:04.064,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So if you're a terrorist and have to choose

208
0:10:06.096,000 --> 0:10:08,000
between starting a grueling basic research program

209
0:10:08.478,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that will require years of meticulous lab work and still might not pan out,

210
0:10:12.029,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or just blowing stuff up?

211
0:10:13.4,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You'll probably choose the later.

212
0:10:15.498,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This is especially true because at least in theory,

213
0:10:17.942,000 --> 0:10:2,000
it should be pretty easy to build what's called a reversal drive.

214
0:10:21.1,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That's one that basically overwrites the change made by the first gene drive.

215
0:10:24.822,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So if you don't like the effects of a change,

216
0:10:27.14,000 --> 0:10:29,000
you can just release a second drive that will cancel it out,

217
0:10:29.997,000 --> 0:10:3,000
at least in theory.

218
0:10:33.374,000 --> 0:10:34,000
OK, so where does this leave us?

219
0:10:36.604,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We now have the ability to change entire species at will.

220
0:10:41.017,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Should we?

221
0:10:42.552,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Are we gods now?

222
0:10:45.972,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I'm not sure I'd say that.

223
0:10:48.094,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But I would say this:

224
0:10:50.329,000 --> 0:10:51,000
first, some very smart people

225
0:10:52.211,000 --> 0:10:54,000
are even now debating how to regulate gene drives.

226
0:10:55.598,000 --> 0:10:57,000
At the same time, some other very smart people

227
0:10:58.186,000 --> 0:11:,000
are working hard to create safeguards,

228
0:11:00.321,000 --> 0:11:03,000
like gene drives that self-regulate or peter out after a few generations.

229
0:11:04.644,000 --> 0:11:05,000
That's great.

230
0:11:06.313,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But this technology still requires a conversation.

231
0:11:10.059,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And given the nature of gene drives,

232
0:11:11.813,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that conversation has to be global.

233
0:11:14.131,000 --> 0:11:16,000
What if Kenya wants to use a drive but Tanzania doesn't?

234
0:11:17.241,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Who decides whether to release a gene drive that can fly?

235
0:11:22.874,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I don't have the answer to that question.

236
0:11:25.618,000 --> 0:11:27,000
All we can do going forward, I think,

237
0:11:27.65,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is talk honestly about the risks and benefits

238
0:11:30.508,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and take responsibility for our choices.

239
0:11:33.817,000 --> 0:11:36,000
By that I mean, not just the choice to use a gene drive,

240
0:11:37.754,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but also the choice not to use one.

241
0:11:41.111,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Humans have a tendency to assume that the safest option

242
0:11:44.112,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is to preserve the status quo.

243
0:11:46.905,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But that's not always the case.

244
0:11:49.711,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Gene drives have risks, and those need to be discussed,

245
0:11:53.136,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but malaria exists now and kills 1,000 people a day.

246
0:11:56.977,000 --> 0:11:59,000
To combat it, we spray pesticides that do grave damage to other species,

247
0:12:00.565,000 --> 0:12:01,000
including amphibians and birds.

248
0:12:03.668,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So when you hear about gene drives in the coming months,

249
0:12:06.556,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and trust me, you will be hearing about them,

250
0:12:08.834,000 --> 0:12:09,000
remember that.

251
0:12:10.402,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It can be frightening to act,

252
0:12:12.446,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but sometimes, not acting is worse.

253
0:12:16.746,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.75,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's deeply painful

2
0:00:15.708,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to face what's happening on our planet right now.

3
0:00:20.333,000 --> 0:00:21,000
From forests burning,

4
0:00:23.083,000 --> 0:00:24,000
ocean plastic,

5
0:00:25.292,000 --> 0:00:28,000
species just gone each day,

6
0:00:28.542,000 --> 0:00:29,000
displacement.

7
0:00:31.417,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's easy to feel totally overwhelmed.

8
0:00:36.208,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Maybe a bit helpless.

9
0:00:39.167,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Powerless.

10
0:00:41.458,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Angry.

11
0:00:43.333,000 --> 0:00:44,000
On fire.

12
0:00:46.375,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Numb.

13
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Disconnected.

14
0:00:51.167,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Perhaps all of the above.

15
0:00:54.958,000 --> 0:00:57,000
These messy and complicated feelings,

16
0:00:58.458,000 --> 0:01:,000
they make total sense.

17
0:01:01.917,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I wish that someone had said this to me 30 years ago.

18
0:01:06.792,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I was a college freshman taking environmental studies,

19
0:01:11.458,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which is basically a semester of really bad news

20
0:01:17.375,000 --> 0:01:21,000
about all the ways that humans have profoundly damaged

21
0:01:22.042,000 --> 0:01:23,000
our beautiful earth.

22
0:01:25.167,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I felt like I had been dropped into a dark tunnel,

23
0:01:29.542,000 --> 0:01:31,000
given no tools to get out

24
0:01:32.083,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and yet expected to carry on with my everyday life

25
0:01:35.375,000 --> 0:01:37,000
as if things were normal.

26
0:01:37.958,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But once you're exposed to that kind of information,

27
0:01:40.792,000 --> 0:01:42,000
things are not normal anymore.

28
0:01:43.833,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I was anxious, I was terrified,

29
0:01:48.083,000 --> 0:01:5,000
no one was talking about this,

30
0:01:50.583,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I almost dropped out of school, for real.

31
0:01:54.833,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But instead, I signed up for a field study in California,

32
0:01:59.458,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and we were backpacking together as a small group for two months,

33
0:02:04.417,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which I know sounds very intense.

34
0:02:07.167,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it was, but what I found is that we talked a lot.

35
0:02:12.083,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We talked about how we were feeling

36
0:02:14.167,000 --> 0:02:15,000
about the world,

37
0:02:15.625,000 --> 0:02:16,000
openly and honestly,

38
0:02:16.958,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and no one told me at any point to be more positive

39
0:02:20.333,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or more hopeful.

40
0:02:22.542,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Not once.

41
0:02:24.875,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And surprisingly, I found myself feeling better.

42
0:02:29.5,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I actually felt like I could face these issues

43
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that had seemed so insurmountable

44
0:02:34.875,000 --> 0:02:36,000
more head on.

45
0:02:37.083,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I had this epiphany:

46
0:02:39.167,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What if by understanding ourselves

47
0:02:42.167,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and one another,

48
0:02:43.833,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we could find our way through this crisis

49
0:02:46.25,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in a new and different way?

50
0:02:48.333,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You know, what if psychology actually held

51
0:02:50.458,000 --> 0:02:52,000
a missing key to unlocking action

52
0:02:53.125,000 --> 0:02:57,000
on the greatest challenges facing our planet right now?

53
0:02:57.208,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So when I got back from the field study,

54
0:02:59.167,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I focused on clinical psychology,

55
0:03:01.542,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I researched the relationships

56
0:03:03.542,000 --> 0:03:08,000
between trauma and grief and creativity.

57
0:03:08.958,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And the paradox at the heart of, I think, all of this

58
0:03:11.917,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is how do we stay present

59
0:03:14.792,000 --> 0:03:17,000
with what's really painful,

60
0:03:17.833,000 --> 0:03:19,000
how do we stay connected

61
0:03:19.917,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in the face of what's threatening and overwhelming and scary?

62
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And it turns out that psychology knows a lot about these things.

63
0:03:29.708,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Truly, a lot.

64
0:03:32.292,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But I wasn't hearing any of this being referenced

65
0:03:34.833,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in my environmental studies class,

66
0:03:37.333,000 --> 0:03:39,000
or the climate action meetings I started going to,

67
0:03:40.333,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or the international conferences,

68
0:03:42.5,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where everyone is asking:

69
0:03:44.208,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Why aren't we acting faster, and what's it going to take?

70
0:03:48.208,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And so this has become my mission of sorts,

71
0:03:51.958,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which is that I take insights from psychology

72
0:03:54.875,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I translate them into resources and tools

73
0:03:58.167,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to support those working on the frontlines to turn things around.

74
0:04:02.625,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that means for anyone, by the way.

75
0:04:04.542,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We're all on the frontlines right now.

76
0:04:06.875,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And it's my belief,

77
0:04:08.167,000 --> 0:04:1,000
after years of straddling these worlds

78
0:04:10.708,000 --> 0:04:12,000
between environment and climate and psychology,

79
0:04:13.333,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that this actually is a missing ingredient in our work

80
0:04:17.292,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that can exponentially accelerate our capacities to be creative

81
0:04:22.167,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and resilient and capable and skillful and courageous

82
0:04:25.792,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and all those things that the world is needing from us right now.

83
0:04:29.833,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I'm going to share three concepts with you

84
0:04:32.792,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that I found particularly game-changing

85
0:04:34.833,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and how I make sense of this moment

86
0:04:37.75,000 --> 0:04:38,000
for us as humans.

87
0:04:39.5,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And the first is something called our window of tolerance.

88
0:04:44.75,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So Dr. Dan Siegel has described us all as having a window.

89
0:04:49.208,000 --> 0:04:51,000
How much stress can we tolerate

90
0:04:51.625,000 --> 0:04:52,000
while staying connected

91
0:04:53.292,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and what clinicians would call "integrated."

92
0:04:55.75,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Integrated, where we can actually

93
0:04:57.833,000 --> 0:04:59,000
be in touch with our thoughts and feelings

94
0:04:59.917,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and not just get kind of co-opted.

95
0:05:03.125,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And we all have a threshold.

96
0:05:05.208,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And what happens when we experience stress

97
0:05:08.167,000 --> 0:05:1,000
beyond what we can tolerate?

98
0:05:10.708,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We tend to go into the edges of our window.

99
0:05:14.583,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And on one hand,

100
0:05:16.125,000 --> 0:05:18,000
we might go into a sort of collapse,

101
0:05:18.708,000 --> 0:05:2,000
what's called a chaotic response,

102
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which looks like depression, despair,

103
0:05:24.167,000 --> 0:05:25,000
kind of a shutting down.

104
0:05:25.792,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And on the other side of this window is a more rigid response:

105
0:05:30.292,000 --> 0:05:31,000
denial,

106
0:05:31.75,000 --> 0:05:32,000
anger,

107
0:05:33.125,000 --> 0:05:34,000
rigid.

108
0:05:35.125,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And so when that happens,

109
0:05:36.625,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we actually lose our capacity to be integrated,

110
0:05:39.333,000 --> 0:05:4,000
resilient, adaptive,

111
0:05:40.708,000 --> 0:05:42,000
all those things that we want to be.

112
0:05:43.708,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And this is totally normal,

113
0:05:45.083,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but it's happening all around the world right now, right?

114
0:05:49.125,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We're all vacillating between these different feelings and emotions.

115
0:05:53.167,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And so with something like climate change,

116
0:05:55.875,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with every new scientific report,

117
0:05:59.375,000 --> 0:06:,000
documentary,

118
0:06:01.375,000 --> 0:06:04,000
connecting the dots between, you know, what we're doing

119
0:06:04.667,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the impact it's having,

120
0:06:06.208,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it can collectively be pushing us outside of our window of tolerance.

121
0:06:10.125,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And we lose that capacity, right?

122
0:06:13.458,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So, over the years, I've interviewed hundreds of people

123
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
from all backgrounds and political affiliations,

124
0:06:20.125,000 --> 0:06:22,000
from the Midwest US to China,

125
0:06:22.5,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and I talked to people about how are we feeling

126
0:06:25.375,000 --> 0:06:26,000
about what's happening.

127
0:06:26.667,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Not what opinions or beliefs.

128
0:06:28.792,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What are we feeling

129
0:06:30.083,000 --> 0:06:32,000
about what's going on with your local environment,

130
0:06:32.441,000 --> 0:06:34,000
with your water, your soil, the big picture.

131
0:06:35.125,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And what I hear from people

132
0:06:37.292,000 --> 0:06:39,000
almost across the board, I'm telling you,

133
0:06:39.708,000 --> 0:06:4,000
is a bind.

134
0:06:41.083,000 --> 0:06:44,000
People tell me at some point in the conversation,

135
0:06:44.917,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"I care very deeply about what's happening,

136
0:06:47.083,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I'm incredibly freaked out.

137
0:06:49.458,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I'm scared,

138
0:06:51.208,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I love this land, I love the birds,"

139
0:06:54.167,000 --> 0:06:55,000
whatever that is,

140
0:06:56.792,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"But I feel like my actions are insignificant.

141
0:07:00.25,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And I don't know where to start.

142
0:07:02.625,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And I'm also --"

143
0:07:03.917,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I hear between the lines of what people say --

144
0:07:06.125,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"I'm really scared to change.

145
0:07:07.875,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Really scared of any change, it's so --

146
0:07:09.792,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I can't even think about it, it's like, unthinkable."

147
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And this is the second concept,

148
0:07:14.583,000 --> 0:07:16,000
which is something called a double bind.

149
0:07:17.5,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And a double bind is when we feel sort of like, damned if you do,

150
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and damned if you don't,

151
0:07:23.583,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and you're just kind of stuck there.

152
0:07:26.167,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's a very intolerable human experience.

153
0:07:29.708,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And we will do anything we can to get rid of it and just push it away.

154
0:07:34.417,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And so all that care and concern,

155
0:07:37.167,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it's there, it just goes down, it goes underground.

156
0:07:40.625,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But what happens is,

157
0:07:41.958,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it looks like people don't care, it looks like apathy.

158
0:07:45.875,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And so a lot of folks who are seeing the urgency of the situation

159
0:07:49.583,000 --> 0:07:51,000
are like, "We've got to motivate you.

160
0:07:52.333,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We've got to get you psyched."

161
0:07:54.958,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And we become cheerleaders for solutions.

162
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Or like, "Here's the facts, this is happening, wake up."

163
0:08:03.625,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And these things are actually not inherently bad,

164
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
because we need solutions and we need to face the facts.

165
0:08:10.542,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But inadvertently, this can backfire

166
0:08:14.708,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and lead to more numbing and inaction,

167
0:08:16.667,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which is very perplexing for a lot of people.

168
0:08:19.375,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's like, what the heck is going on, right?

169
0:08:22.958,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And so, this is because of this, you know,

170
0:08:27.5,000 --> 0:08:3,000
it's not really touching what's going on underneath.

171
0:08:31.042,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So imagine that you go see a therapist,

172
0:08:34.708,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and you've got a double bind.

173
0:08:36.375,000 --> 0:08:38,000
You're feeling really stuck,

174
0:08:38.417,000 --> 0:08:41,000
you know you've got to change

175
0:08:41.625,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and the therapist starts shouting at you

176
0:08:44.083,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and saying, "Don’t you see what's happening?

177
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:48,000
If you don't act now,

178
0:08:48.625,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you're going to face terrifying consequences.

179
0:08:51.417,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Don’t you care?

180
0:08:53.208,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What's wrong with you?

181
0:08:54.625,000 --> 0:08:56,000
What's it going to take?"

182
0:08:56.875,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Or you see a therapist and you're feeling actually sad

183
0:09:00.292,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and grief.

184
0:09:02.208,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And this therapist says,

185
0:09:03.583,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"You know, don't think about it too much.

186
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Here's some simple things you can do.

187
0:09:08.458,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Simple positive things."

188
0:09:09.75,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And sends you on your way.

189
0:09:12.792,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So if it were me,

190
0:09:14.458,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I would fire this therapist immediately,

191
0:09:18.958,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because a good therapist practices something called attunement.

192
0:09:23.75,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I love this concept so much.

193
0:09:26.042,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Attunement, right, the word "to tune."

194
0:09:29.583,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And attunement is when we're feeling in sync,

195
0:09:33.042,000 --> 0:09:35,000
when we feel understood

196
0:09:35.708,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and we feel accepted for exactly where we are.

197
0:09:40.083,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And we feel that, you know,

198
0:09:41.917,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we're in relationship with the world in a way that makes sense,

199
0:09:44.958,000 --> 0:09:45,000
no one's trying to change us

200
0:09:46.667,000 --> 0:09:48,000
or shame us or judge us.

201
0:09:49.292,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Right?

202
0:09:50.583,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And attunement takes skill.

203
0:09:52.125,000 --> 0:09:53,000
When the stakes are high,

204
0:09:53.875,000 --> 0:09:58,000
let me tell you, it's very hard to want to attune with anything,

205
0:09:59.583,000 --> 0:10:02,000
when we're facing such urgent threats.

206
0:10:02.625,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But the paradox of the moment we're in

207
0:10:05.333,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is that when we are more in tune in our window of tolerance,

208
0:10:10.208,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we are so much more capable of solving problems,

209
0:10:14.125,000 --> 0:10:16,000
being creative, being adaptive,

210
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:18,000
being flexible,

211
0:10:18.875,000 --> 0:10:2,000
being our brilliant selves, right?

212
0:10:22.708,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So what if our climate and environmental work

213
0:10:25.958,000 --> 0:10:27,000
was informed by these concepts, right,

214
0:10:28.5,000 --> 0:10:3,000
of window of tolerance,

215
0:10:31.292,000 --> 0:10:32,000
lot of double binds

216
0:10:33.292,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and attunement?

217
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So it can look like a whole lot of things.

218
0:10:38.208,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So I'm asked all the time,

219
0:10:39.5,000 --> 0:10:42,000
"OK, Renee, this sounds awesome for a clinical context,

220
0:10:43.083,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we don't have time for this."

221
0:10:44.792,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And that is absolutely not true.

222
0:10:47.042,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Because we can bring attunement

223
0:10:49.958,000 --> 0:10:54,000
into every aspect of our work on this issue.

224
0:10:55.333,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And it starts with ourselves.

225
0:10:58.958,000 --> 0:11:02,000
You actually can't do attunement unless you're in touch with yourself,

226
0:11:03.083,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I'm sorry to break it to you.

227
0:11:04.75,000 --> 0:11:05,000
There's no way around it.

228
0:11:06.125,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It's from the inside out.

229
0:11:08.042,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And so it starts with actually tuning in to "how am I feeling?"

230
0:11:13.125,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And being compassionate.

231
0:11:14.708,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I know it's easy to say

232
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but really being compassionate,

233
0:11:17.501,000 --> 0:11:19,000
it's like, these are hard issues.

234
0:11:19.583,000 --> 0:11:21,000
This is a hard moment to be a human being,

235
0:11:21.607,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we're waking up.

236
0:11:23.167,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I'm not a bad person.

237
0:11:25.167,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What's going on,

238
0:11:26.458,000 --> 0:11:28,000
bring curiosity into our own experience,

239
0:11:28.792,000 --> 0:11:3,000
which then allows us to attune socially,

240
0:11:31.458,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that's the next way we can apply this,

241
0:11:34.125,000 --> 0:11:36,000
is attuning, whether it's in small groups

242
0:11:36.25,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or one-on-one,

243
0:11:37.542,000 --> 0:11:43,000
campaigning, strategy, classrooms, movie theaters,

244
0:11:43.583,000 --> 0:11:44,000
parks.

245
0:11:44.958,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Where we can give each other permission to just be who we are,

246
0:11:48.583,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and again, this allows us to move

247
0:11:50.542,000 --> 0:11:53,000
into the higher level functioning.

248
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The executive function, the prefrontal cortex,

249
0:11:57.042,000 --> 0:12:01,000
when we feel that our nervous system can calm down

250
0:12:01.292,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and we are understood by the other.

251
0:12:04.5,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And the third way is leading with attunement.

252
0:12:09.25,000 --> 0:12:11,000
As leaders and influencers,

253
0:12:11.333,000 --> 0:12:14,000
showing up as human, as real,

254
0:12:15.25,000 --> 0:12:16,000
saying, "You know what?

255
0:12:16.542,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I am really scared.

256
0:12:20.375,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I don't know what all the answers are."

257
0:12:22.875,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Can you imagine leaders saying that?

258
0:12:25.292,000 --> 0:12:26,000
"I don't know.

259
0:12:27.333,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But here we are, and we're all needed.

260
0:12:30.25,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And we're in this together.

261
0:12:32.583,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And we can do this."

262
0:12:34.167,000 --> 0:12:37,000
That's a very different message than just, "We can do this," right.

263
0:12:37.667,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's like, "Here we are.

264
0:12:39.208,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I'm scared, but this is happening."

265
0:12:42.75,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So here's the thing,

266
0:12:45.125,000 --> 0:12:46,000
all of this work exists,

267
0:12:46.542,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we have the tools to create these conditions

268
0:12:50.417,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that can allow us to show up

269
0:12:53.917,000 --> 0:12:55,000
as our brilliant selves.

270
0:12:56.917,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I know, without doubt, 100 percent,

271
0:13:00.625,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that each one of us has the capacity

272
0:13:04.042,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to meet these challenges with the ingenuity

273
0:13:06.5,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and brilliance and bravery that we as humans have.

274
0:13:10.292,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We just need to cultivate the conditions together.

275
0:13:13.708,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We need each other.

276
0:13:15.583,000 --> 0:13:16,000
To support each other

277
0:13:17.458,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and allow ourselves to really meet this.

278
0:13:20.458,000 --> 0:13:21,000
That's what we need, so ...

279
0:13:23.625,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Let's take a deep breath.

280
0:13:27.333,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Have compassion for ourselves

281
0:13:29.583,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and one another in this moment, time in history,

282
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
so we collectively process these painful truths,

283
0:13:36.917,000 --> 0:13:37,000
these difficult realities.

284
0:13:40.333,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Let's do this together.

285
0:13:42.958,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The world is ready for us to do this.

286
0:13:47.875,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And we can do this.

287
0:13:50.958,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Thank you.

288
0:13:52.25,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
You know, we're going to do things a little differently.

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And at the same time, we're going to look at just images

4
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that --

5
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
snapshots from Second Life. So hopefully this will be fascinating.

6
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures

7
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that you see on screen that come from there.

8
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,

9
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively

10
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a little bit more and think and ask questions.

11
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
You know, I guess the first question is,

12
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
why build a virtual world at all?

13
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I think the answer to that is always going to be

14
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
at least driven to a certain extent by the people

15
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
initially crazy enough to start the project, you know.

16
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So I can give you a little bit of first background just on me

17
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager

18
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.

19
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,

20
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and then later, programming computers, when I was really young.

21
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I was just always trying to make things.

22
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,

23
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and just anything I could do with my hands or with wood

24
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or electronics or metal or anything else.

25
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so, for example -- and it's a great Second Life thing -- I had a bedroom.

26
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
And every kid, you know, as a teenager, has got his bedroom he retreats to --

27
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up

28
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
rather than opened, like on Star Trek.

29
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling

30
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,

31
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling.

32
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I built -- I put a garage-door opener up in the attic

33
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that would pull this door up.

34
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house

35
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and the displeasure of my parents.

36
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The thing that was always striking to me was that we as people

37
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
could have so many really amazing ideas about things we'd like to do,

38
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but are so often unable, in the real world, to actually do those things --

39
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to actually cobble together the materials

40
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and go through the actual execution phase of building something

41
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that you imagine from a design perspective.

42
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around

43
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I was doing computer programming and just, you know,

44
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
just generally trying to run my own little company

45
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers,

46
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing

47
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that you would really want to do with the Internet and with computers

48
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
would be to use the Internet and connected computers

49
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics

50
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and the rules of how things went together --

51
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things,

52
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff.

53
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And so for me that was the thing that was so enticing.

54
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I just wanted this place where you could build things.

55
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And so I think you see that in the genesis

56
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important.

57
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology

58
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.

59
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It is a -- sort of a great human progress.

60
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create

61
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in as shared and social a way as possible.

62
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I think that Second Life and virtual worlds more generally

63
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
represent the best we can do to achieve that right now.

64
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You know, another way to look at that,

65
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,

66
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.

67
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.

68
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
If you think about going into space, it's a fascinating thing.

69
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So many movies, so many kids, we all sort of

70
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
dream about exploring space. Now, why is that?

71
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Stop for a moment and ask, why that conceit?

72
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Why do we as people want to do that?

73
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I think there's a couple of things. It's what we see in the movies --

74
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you know, it's this dream that we all share.

75
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
One is that if you went into space you'd be able to begin again.

76
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In some sense, you would become someone else in that journey,

77
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because there wouldn't be -- you'd leave society and life as you know it, behind.

78
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And so inevitably, you would transform yourself --

79
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
irreversibly, in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration.

80
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense

81
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that if you travel far enough, you can find out there --

82
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
oh, yeah -- you have no idea what you're going to find

83
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
once you get there, into space.

84
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's going to be different than here.

85
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth

86
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that anything is going to be possible.

87
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So that's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of

88
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible.

89
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I think that if you really sit and think about it,

90
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
virtual worlds, and where we're going

91
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
with more and more computing technology,

92
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
represent essentially the likely, really tactically possible

93
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
version of space exploration.

94
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space,

95
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything

96
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and everything, and probably anything could happen there.

97
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You know, to give you a size idea about scale, you know,

98
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of --

99
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.

100
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
In fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:

101
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
everybody's very excited,

102
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next

103
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
from moment to moment, and then there's despair

104
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.

105
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Everything that's happening with Second Life

106
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.

107
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We always play a game at the office where you can take any article

108
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life"

109
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
with "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet."

110
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You can find exactly the same articles

111
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
written about everything that people are observing.

112
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
To give you an idea of scale, Second Life is about 20,000 CPUs at this point.

113
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It's about 20,000 computers connected together

114
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in three facilities in the United States right now,

115
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself --

116
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
there's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,

117
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
so the kind of, active population is something like a smallish city.

118
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The space itself is about 10 times the size of San Francisco,

119
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and it's about as densely built out.

120
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So it gives you an idea of scale. Now, it's expanding very rapidly --

121
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
about five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.

122
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And so of course, radically unlike the real world,

123
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding

124
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
very, very quickly, and historically exponentially.

125
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here

126
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
by the amount of content that's in there,

127
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and I think that amount is critical.

128
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It was critical with the virtual world

129
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that it be this space of truly infinite possibility.

130
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We're very sensitive to that as humans.

131
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space

132
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and you know when you can't.

133
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Second Life today is this 20,000 machines,

134
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,

135
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
an object would be something like this, possibly interactive.

136
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time;

137
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they have code attached to them.

138
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there

139
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and that's very important.

140
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
If anybody plays, like, World of Warcraft,

141
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
World of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.

142
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Second Life, by comparison, has about 100 terabytes

143
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of user-created data, making it about 25,000 times larger.

144
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So again, like the Internet compared to AOL,

145
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,

146
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
what's happening here is something very different,

147
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because the sheer scale of what people can do

148
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.

149
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The last big thought is that it is almost certainly true

150
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that whatever this is going to evolve into

151
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.

152
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And let me justify that with two statements.

153
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Generically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,

154
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
create and consume information.

155
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data-driven.

156
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information.

157
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Everything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have,

158
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is kind of us flowing through a sea of information

159
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and interacting with it in different ways.

160
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The Web puts information in the form of text and images.

161
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The topology, the geography of the Web is text-to-text links for the most part.

162
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
That's one way of organizing information,

163
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world

164
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that I think are the important ways that they're very different

165
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web.

166
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The first is that, as I said, the --

167
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
well, the first difference for virtual worlds is that

168
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
information is presented to you in the virtual world

169
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
using the most powerful iconic symbols

170
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that you can possibly use with human beings.

171
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,

172
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but a picture of this is a universal symbol.

173
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it.

174
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's also more memorable if I show you that picture,

175
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and I show you C-H-A-I-R on a piece of paper.

176
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You can do tests that show that you'll remember

177
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better.

178
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory,

179
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives,

180
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you maximally both excite, stimulate,

181
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
are able to remember, transfer and manipulate data.

182
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And so virtual worlds are the best way

183
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
for us to essentially organize and experience information.

184
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And I think that's something that people have talked about for 20 years --

185
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
you know, that 3D, that lifelike environments

186
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
are really important in some magical way to us.

187
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But the second thing -- and I think this one is less obvious --

188
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is that the experience of creating, consuming, exploring that information

189
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social.

190
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
You are always there with other people.

191
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And we as humans are social creatures and must, or are aided by,

192
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
or enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others.

193
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's essential to us. You can't escape it.

194
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
When you're on Amazon.com and you're looking for digital cameras or whatever,

195
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
you're on there right now, when you're on the site, with like 5,000 other people,

196
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but you can't talk to them.

197
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras

198
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
on the same page as you, and ask them,

199
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
"Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it."

200
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
That experience of like, shopping together, just as a simple example,

201
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is an example of how as social creatures

202
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
we want to experience information in that way.

203
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So that second point, that we inherently experience information together

204
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or want to experience it together,

205
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is critical to essentially, kind of,

206
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
this trend of where we're going to use technology to connect us.

207
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And so I think, again, that it's likely that in the next decade or so

208
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings

209
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that we kind of use the electronics of the Internet, if you will,

210
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to be together, to consume information.

211
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
You know, mapping in India -- that's such a great example.

212
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time.

213
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Asking for advice, rather than any possible way

214
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that you could just statically organize a map.

215
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So I think that's another big point.

216
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I think that wherever this is all going,

217
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
whether it's Second Life or its descendants, or something broader

218
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that happens all around the world at a lot of different points --

219
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
this is what we're going to see the Internet used for,

220
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,

221
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information

222
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,

223
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.

224
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Big idea, but I think highly defensible.

225
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So let me stop there and bring John back,

226
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.

227
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Thank you. John. That's great.

228
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
(Applause)

229
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
John Hockenberry: Why is the creation, the impulse to create Second Life,

230
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
not a utopian impulse?

231
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Like for example, in the 19th century,

232
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds

233
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
were explicitly utopian.

234
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Philip Rosedale: I think that's great. That's such a deep question. Yeah.

235
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.

236
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The answer is no, and I think the reason why is because

237
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.

238
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
That idea of infinite possibility, that magic of anything can happen,

239
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
only happens in an environment

240
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
where you really know that there's a fundamental freedom

241
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
at the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,

242
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
if you will, that make up the virtual world.

243
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,

244
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,

245
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,

246
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it?

247
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody,

248
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
even if you mean well when you build them.

249
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And what's more, human society, when it's controlled,

250
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
when you set out a grand scheme of rules,

251
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
a new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever,

252
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond,

253
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
you know -- I always laughingly say -- the Mall of America, you know,

254
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
which is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecture

255
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that, you know, has been built.

256
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
JH: The Kremlin was pretty big.

257
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
PR: The Kremlin, yeah. That's true. The whole complex.

258
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
JH: Give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning

259
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use

260
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
in the creation of their avatars or in communicating

261
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that people actually in practice said, no, I'm not interested in that at all,

262
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and name something that you didn't come up with

263
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that almost immediately people began to demand.

264
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
PR: I'm sure I can think of multiple examples of both of those.

265
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life --

266
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I was really passionate about it.

267
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody

268
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
and have a more private conversation,

269
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.

270
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat.

271
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design.

272
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective,

273
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately --

274
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I think we've now turned it off, if I remember.

275
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
We finally gave up, took it out of the code.

276
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this,

277
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
which is great relative to the utopian idea.

278
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Second Life originally had 16 simulators. It now has 20,000.

279
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
So when it only had 16,

280
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
it was only about as big as this college campus.

281
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub,

282
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
we put a disco where you could dance,

283
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to,

284
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.

285
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And we laid out the zoning, but of course,

286
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
people could build all around it however they wanted to.

287
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
And what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea

288
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
that we had put out in the zoning concept, basically,

289
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
was instantly and thoroughly ignored,

290
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and like, two months into the whole thing,

291
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
-- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time --

292
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life,

293
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco --

294
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
because I had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it

295
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and put houses on it. And I sold it to them --

296
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I mean, we transferred ownership and they had a big party

297
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and blew up the entire building.

298
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
And I remember that that was just so telling, you know,

299
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.

300
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular --

301
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
JH: CBGB's has to close eventually, you know. That's the rule.

302
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
PR: Exactly. And it -- but it closed on day one, basically, in Internet time.

303
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
You know, an example of something -- pregnancy.

304
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
You can have a baby in Second Life.

305
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
This is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life,

306
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course --

307
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Second Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab --

308
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.

309
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
There is no attempt to structure the experience,

310
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.

311
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know,

312
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
taking two avatars and merging them, or something.

313
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
But people built the ability to have babies and care for babies

314
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so --

315
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I mean, that's a pretty fascinating example of, you know,

316
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
what goes on in the overall economy.

317
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.

318
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
I didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.

319
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
When people are given the opportunity to create in the world,

320
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
there's really two things they want.

321
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
One is fair ownership of the things they create.

322
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
And then the second one is -- if they feel like it,

323
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and they're not going to do it in every case, but in many they are --

324
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
they want to actually be able to sell that creation

325
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
as a way of providing for their own livelihood.

326
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
True on the Web -- also true in Second Life.

327
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
And so the existence of an economy is critical.

328
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
JH: Questions for Philip Rosedale? Right here.

329
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Audience: Well, first an observation, which is that you look like a character.)

330
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
JH: The observation is, Philip has been accused of looking like a character,

331
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
an avatar, in Second Life.

332
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Respond, and then we'll get the rest of your question.

333
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:24,000
PR: But I don't look like my avatar.

334
0:19:24.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
(Laughter)

335
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
How many people here know what my avatar looks like?

336
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
That's probably not very many.

337
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
JH: Are you ripping off somebody else's avatar with that, sort of --

338
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
PR: No, no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar --

339
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
a female avatar -- that I used to be once in a while.

340
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps.

341
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Spiky hair -- spikier than this. Kind of orange hair.

342
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character.

343
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
So, very cool.

344
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
JH: And your question?

345
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:20:,000
(Audience: [Unclear].)

346
0:20:00.16,000 --> 0:20:06,000
JH: The question is, there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in Second Life.

347
0:20:06.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
It doesn't seem to have its own culture,

348
0:20:08.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and the sort of differences that exist in the real world

349
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
aren't translated into the Second Life map.

350
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
PR: Well, first of all, we're very early,

351
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
so this has only been going on for a few years.

352
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
And so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior

353
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
that you see in emerging societies.

354
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
So a fair criticism -- is what it is -- of Second Life today is that

355
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome, from a cultural standpoint.

356
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
That said, the evolution of, and the nuanced interaction that creates culture,

357
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world,

358
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
and in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life,

359
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
65 percent of the people there are not in the United States,

360
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:54,000
and in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages.

361
0:20:54.16,000 --> 0:20:56,000
In fact, one of the ways to make money in Second Life

362
0:20:56.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body

363
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and they basically, kind of, pop up on your screen

364
0:21:03.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish

365
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:09,000
or one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly

366
0:21:09.16,000 --> 0:21:14,000
translate spoken -- I'm sorry -- typed text between individuals.

367
0:21:14.16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
And so, the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot

368
0:21:18.16,000 --> 0:21:21,000
that's happening inside Second Life is quite --

369
0:21:21.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
I think, quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms

370
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:28,000
in the real world we've ever been able to achieve.

371
0:21:28.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
So, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge,

372
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:35,000
but we still have some years to wait while that happens,

373
0:21:35.16,000 --> 0:21:37,000
as you would naturally expect.

374
0:21:37.16,000 --> 0:21:4,000
JH: Other questions? Right here.

375
0:21:40.16,000 --> 0:21:42,000
(Audience: What's your demographic?)

376
0:21:42.16,000 --> 0:21:44,000
JH: What's your demographic?

377
0:21:44.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
PR: So, the question is, what's the demographic.

378
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:51,000
So, the average age of a person in Second Life is 32,

379
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:56,000
however, the use of Second Life increases dramatically

380
0:21:56.16,000 --> 0:22:01,000
as your physical age increases. So as you go from age 30 to age 60 --

381
0:22:01.16,000 --> 0:22:03,000
and there are many people in their sixties using Second Life --

382
0:22:03.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
this is also not a sharp curve -- it's very, very distributed --

383
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
usage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percent

384
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not --

385
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:18,000
many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life

386
0:22:18.16,000 --> 0:22:23,000
is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing --

387
0:22:23.16,000 --> 0:22:26,000
I'm just speaking broadly and critically --

388
0:22:26.16,000 --> 0:22:28,000
it's not very appealing to people that play online video games,

389
0:22:28.16,000 --> 0:22:32,000
because the graphics are not yet equivalent to --

390
0:22:32.16,000 --> 0:22:33,000
I mean, these are very nice pictures,

391
0:22:33.16,000 --> 0:22:35,000
but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent

392
0:22:35.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4.

393
0:22:39.16,000 --> 0:22:42,000
So average age: 32. I mentioned

394
0:22:42.16,000 --> 0:22:44,000
65 percent of the users are not in the United States.

395
0:22:44.16,000 --> 0:22:47,000
The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad.

396
0:22:47.16,000 --> 0:22:5,000
There's users from, you know, virtually every country in the world now in Second Life.

397
0:22:50.16,000 --> 0:22:54,000
The dominant ones are -- if you take the UK and Europe,

398
0:22:54.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
together they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life.

399
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
In terms of psychographic --

400
0:23:00.16,000 --> 0:23:05,000
oh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life,

401
0:23:05.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
so about 45 percent of the people online right now on Second Life are women.

402
0:23:10.16,000 --> 0:23:12,000
Women use Second Life, though,

403
0:23:12.16,000 --> 0:23:15,000
about 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do,

404
0:23:15.16,000 --> 0:23:17,000
meaning that more men sign up than women,

405
0:23:17.16,000 --> 0:23:2,000
and more women stay and use it than men.

406
0:23:20.16,000 --> 0:23:22,000
So that's another demographic fact.

407
0:23:22.16,000 --> 0:23:27,000
In terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life

408
0:23:27.16,000 --> 0:23:31,000
are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think,

409
0:23:31.16,000 --> 0:23:33,000
when you go in and talk to them and meet them, and I would, you know,

410
0:23:33.16,000 --> 0:23:35,000
challenge you to just do this and find out.

411
0:23:35.16,000 --> 0:23:38,000
But it's not a bunch of programmers.

412
0:23:38.16,000 --> 0:23:42,000
It's not easy to describe as a demographic.

413
0:23:42.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the people

414
0:23:46.16,000 --> 0:23:5,000
who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay?

415
0:23:50.16,000 --> 0:23:53,000
Maybe a little bit like that: in other words, people who are early adopters.

416
0:23:53.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
They tend to be creative. They tend to be entrepreneurial.

417
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:24:,000
A lot of them -- about 55,000 people so far -- are cash-flow positive:

418
0:24:00.16,000 --> 0:24:03,000
they're making money from what -- I mean, real-world money --

419
0:24:03.16,000 --> 0:24:07,000
from what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build --

420
0:24:07.16,000 --> 0:24:1,000
still a creative, building things, build-your-own-business

421
0:24:10.16,000 --> 0:24:12,000
type of an orientation. So, that's it.

422
0:24:12.16,000 --> 0:24:14,000
JH: You describe yourself, Philip, as someone who was really creative

423
0:24:14.16,000 --> 0:24:18,000
when you were young and, you know, liked to make things.

424
0:24:18.16,000 --> 0:24:21,000
I mean, it's not often that you hear somebody

425
0:24:21.16,000 --> 0:24:23,000
describe themselves as really creative.

426
0:24:23.16,000 --> 0:24:27,000
I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student

427
0:24:27.16,000 --> 0:24:3,000
who spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible?

428
0:24:30.16,000 --> 0:24:31,000
(Laughter)

429
0:24:31.16,000 --> 0:24:35,000
PR: I was a -- there were times I was a C student. You know, it's funny.

430
0:24:35.16,000 --> 0:24:37,000
When I got to college -- I studied physics in college --

431
0:24:37.16,000 --> 0:24:39,000
and I got really -- it was funny,

432
0:24:39.16,000 --> 0:24:44,000
because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time.

433
0:24:44.16,000 --> 0:24:49,000
I was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy.

434
0:24:49.16,000 --> 0:24:51,000
Moved around a bunch -- had that experience too.

435
0:24:51.16,000 --> 0:24:54,000
So I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world,

436
0:24:54.16,000 --> 0:24:57,000
and obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something.

437
0:24:57.16,000 --> 0:25:,000
JH: So you're on your fifth life at this point?

438
0:25:00.16,000 --> 0:25:06,000
PR: If you count, yeah, cities. So -- but I did --

439
0:25:06.16,000 --> 0:25:1,000

440
0:25:10.16,000 --> 0:25:14,000
I wasn't, like, an obsessed -- you know, get A's kind of guy.

441
0:25:14.16,000 --> 0:25:16,000
I was going to say, I had a great social experience

442
0:25:16.16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
when I went to college that I hadn't had before,

443
0:25:18.16,000 --> 0:25:21,000
a more fraternal experience, where I met six or seven other guys

444
0:25:21.16,000 --> 0:25:24,000
who I studied physics with, and I was very competitive with them,

445
0:25:24.16,000 --> 0:25:28,000
so then I started to get A's. But you're right: I wasn't an A student.

(Audience: In the pamphlet, there's a statement -- )

448
0:25:33.16,000 --> 0:25:35,000
JH: You want to paraphrase that?

449
0:25:35.16,000 --> 0:25:37,000
PR: Yeah, so let me restate that.

450
0:25:37.16,000 --> 0:25:4,000
So, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement

451
0:25:40.16,000 --> 0:25:44,000
that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones --

452
0:25:44.16,000 --> 0:25:48,000
our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities --

453
0:25:48.16,000 --> 0:25:51,000
and that in fact, much of human life and human experience

454
0:25:51.16,000 --> 0:25:54,000
may move into the digital realm.

455
0:25:54.16,000 --> 0:25:57,000
And then that's kind of a horrifying thought, of course.

456
0:25:57.16,000 --> 0:26:01,000
That's a frightening change, frightening disruption.

457
0:26:01.16,000 --> 0:26:04,000
I guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I --

458
0:26:04.16,000 --> 0:26:06,000
JH: What's your response to the people who would say, that's horrifying?

459
0:26:06.16,000 --> 0:26:08,000
(Audience: If someone would say to you, I find that disturbing,

460
0:26:08.16,000 --> 0:26:1,000
what would be your response?)

461
0:26:10.16,000 --> 0:26:13,000
PR: Well, I'd say a couple of things.

462
0:26:13.16,000 --> 0:26:16,000
One is, it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was.

463
0:26:16.16,000 --> 0:26:2,000
That is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.

464
0:26:20.16,000 --> 0:26:25,000
So, no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior

465
0:26:25.16,000 --> 0:26:28,000
or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes

466
0:26:28.16,000 --> 0:26:3,000
from connecting us together,

467
0:26:30.16,000 --> 0:26:32,000
because the basic motive that people have --

468
0:26:32.16,000 --> 0:26:36,000
to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energy

469
0:26:36.16,000 --> 0:26:39,000
into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.

470
0:26:39.16,000 --> 0:26:44,000
So this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change.

471
0:26:44.16,000 --> 0:26:48,000
Obviously, I'm the optimist and a big believer in what's going on here,

472
0:26:48.16,000 --> 0:26:52,000
but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober,

473
0:26:52.16,000 --> 0:26:55,000
disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side,

474
0:26:55.16,000 --> 0:26:57,000
has to conclude, based on the data,

475
0:26:57.16,000 --> 0:26:59,000
that with those kinds of economic forces at play,

476
0:26:59.16,000 --> 0:27:02,000
there is definitely going to be a sea change,

477
0:27:02.16,000 --> 0:27:05,000
and that change is going to be intensely disruptive

478
0:27:05.16,000 --> 0:27:09,000
relative to our concept of our very lives and being,

479
0:27:09.16,000 --> 0:27:11,000
and our identities, as well.

480
0:27:11.16,000 --> 0:27:13,000
I don't think we can get away from those changes.

481
0:27:13.16,000 --> 0:27:16,000
I think generally, we were talking about this --

482
0:27:16.16,000 --> 0:27:22,000
I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it,

483
0:27:22.16,000 --> 0:27:26,000
being -- surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak,

484
0:27:26.16,000 --> 0:27:29,000
is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it,

485
0:27:29.16,000 --> 0:27:34,000
because of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it,

486
0:27:34.16,000 --> 0:27:37,000
the sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today.

487
0:27:37.16,000 --> 0:27:43,000
It puts challenges on us to rise to. We must be better than ourselves, in many ways.

488
0:27:43.16,000 --> 0:27:46,000
We must learn things and, you know, be more tolerant,

489
0:27:46.16,000 --> 0:27:52,000
and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative, perhaps,

490
0:27:52.16,000 --> 0:27:54,000
than we are typically in our real lives.

491
0:27:54.16,000 --> 0:27:56,000
And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds,

492
0:27:56.16,000 --> 0:28:,000
then these changes, though scary -- and, I say, inevitable --

493
0:28:00.16,000 --> 0:28:02,000
are ultimately for the better,

494
0:28:02.16,000 --> 0:28:05,000
and therefore something that we should ride out.

495
0:28:05.16,000 --> 0:28:09,000
But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this,

496
0:28:09.16,000 --> 0:28:12,000
other than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts

497
0:28:12.16,000 --> 0:28:15,000
because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.

498
0:28:15.16,000 --> 0:28:17,000
JH: Philip Rosedale, thank you very much.

499
0:28:17.16,000 --> 0:28:22,000

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
We all make decisions every day; we want to know

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
exactly the right thing at all possible times,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that would be a tremendous gift.

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It turns out that, in fact, the world was given this gift in 1738

8
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.

9
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,

10
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I also want to explain to you why it is

11
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.

12
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, this is Bernoulli's gift. This is a direct quote.

13
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.

14
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But the simple English translation -- much less precise,

15
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:

16
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The expected value of any of our actions --

17
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that is, the goodness that we can count on getting --

18
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is the product of two simple things:

19
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,

20
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and the value of that gain to us.

21
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In a sense, what Bernoulli was saying is,

22
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
if we can estimate and multiply these two things,

23
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we will always know precisely how we should behave.

24
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, this simple equation, even for those of you

25
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.

26
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play

27
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,

28
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,

29
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,

30
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know

31
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,

32
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that multiplies to five, and that's more

33
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.

34
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.

35
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, the idea is simple when we're applying it to coin tosses,

36
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.

37
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
People are horrible at estimating both of these things,

38
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.

39
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide

40
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
what the right thing is to do, and those are

41
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,

42
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and errors in estimating the value of their own success.

43
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, let me talk about the first one first.

44
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:

45
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.

46
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades

47
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
or of flipping a heads.

48
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply

49
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --

50
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I should say, lose more -- gambling

51
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
than on all other forms of entertainment combined.

52
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.

53
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The way people figure odds

54
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.

55
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think

56
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
there are more dogs or pigs on leashes

57
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
observed in any particular day in Oxford.

58
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.

59
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is

60
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you quickly reviewed in memory the times

61
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.

62
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,

63
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed

64
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,

65
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
then dogs on leashes are more probable.

66
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.

67
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, for example, here's a word puzzle.

68
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Are there more four-letter English words

69
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with R in the third place or R in the first place?

70
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,

71
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,

72
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.

73
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language

74
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with R in the third than the first place.

75
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind

76
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.

77
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.

78
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.

79
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's like the dictionary;

80
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
it's hard to look things up by the third letter.

81
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So, this is an example of how this idea that

82
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the quickness with which things come to mind

83
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
can give you a sense of their probability --

84
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
how this idea could lead you astray. It's not just puzzles, though.

85
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds

86
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that they will die in a variety of interesting ways --

87
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
these are estimates of number of deaths per year

88
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
per 200 million U.S. citizens.

89
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked

90
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.

91
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Compare these to the actual numbers.

92
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now, you see a very interesting pattern here, which is first of all,

93
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.

94
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Two things are vastly underestimated:

95
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?

96
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper

97
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"

98
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It's not interesting because it's so common.

99
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances

100
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
of news stories or newsreels where we've seen

101
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck

102
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.

103
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.

104
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,

105
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we vastly underestimate them.

106
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Indeed, this is kind of like the Sesame Street game

107
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say

108
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool

109
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.

110
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination

111
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of all three of the others that you see on the slide.

112
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The lottery is an excellent example, of course -- an excellent test-case

113
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
of people's ability to compute probabilities.

114
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery --

115
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery

116
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff

117
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
by investing your money in a lottery ticket

118
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
are approximately equivalent to flushing the money

119
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
directly down the toilet -- which, by the way,

120
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.

121
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Why in the world would anybody ever play the lottery?

122
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,

123
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,

124
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --

125
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.

126
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.

127
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews

128
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
with everybody who lost?

129
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Indeed, if we required that television stations run

130
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
a 30-second interview with each loser

131
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers

132
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years

133
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of your undivided attention just to watch them say,

134
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."

135
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --

136
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss,

137
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"

138
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.

139
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Look, I can prove this to you: here's a little lottery.

140
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.

141
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.

142
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,

143
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?

144
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.

145
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars;

146
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.

147
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."

148
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, a slightly different version of this lottery:

149
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
imagine that the nine tickets are all owned

150
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
by one fat guy named Leroy.

151
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.

152
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.

153
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,

154
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.

155
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?

156
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"

157
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.

158
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy

159
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
changes your decision to play,

160
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.

161
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, estimating odds, as difficult as it may seem, is a piece of cake

162
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
compared to trying to estimate value:

163
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,

164
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
how much pleasure it will give us.

165
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I want to talk now about errors in value.

166
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?

167
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Most of you have the intuition that it's not --

168
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you wouldn't pay that for it.

169
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But in fact, to decide whether a Big Mac is worth 25 dollars requires

170
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that you ask one, and only one question, which is:

171
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What else can I do with 25 dollars?

172
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia

173
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
and realized that they're not going to serve you any food,

174
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened

175
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches

176
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is wafting over the seat, you think,

177
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.

178
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!

179
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.

180
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
On the other hand, if you're visiting an underdeveloped country,

181
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.

182
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,

183
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
before I'd even told you anything about the context?

184
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac

185
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,

186
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment

187
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to other possible investments, you compared to the past.

188
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And this is a systematic error people make.

189
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.

190
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This is an error, and I can prove it to you by showing

191
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.

192
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
For example, this is, of course,

193
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
one of the most delicious tricks in marketing,

194
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is to say something used to be higher,

195
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.

196
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
When people are asked about these two different jobs:

197
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,

198
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
a job where you're getting a salary cut each year,

199
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and one in which you're getting a salary increase,

200
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact

201
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
they're all told they make much less money. Why?

202
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse

203
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher

204
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in the declining period. Here's another nice example.

205
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Here's a $2,000 Hawaiian vacation package; it's now on sale for 1,600.

206
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?

207
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:

208
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,

209
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
so you decide to mull it over for a week.

210
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --

211
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.

212
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500

213
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
for something that was 700 last week.

214
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This tendency to compare to the past

215
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,

216
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good

217
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.

218
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Here's another example of how comparing to the past

219
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
can befuddle our decisions.

220
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Imagine that you're going to the theater.

221
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
You're on your way to the theater.

222
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.

223
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
You also have a 20-dollar bill.

224
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
When you arrive at the theater,

225
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.

226
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?

227
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Most people answer, no.

228
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.

229
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You're on your way to the theater,

230
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.

231
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.

232
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?

233
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.

234
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?

235
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Now, just in case you're not getting it,

236
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
here's a schematic of what happened, OK?

237
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
(Laughter)

238
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Along the way, you lost something.

239
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.

240
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.

241
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What the hell difference should it make?

242
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,

243
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I'm not paying twice for the same thing.

244
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --

245
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.

246
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems

247
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that behavioral economists and psychologists identify

248
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
in people's attempts to assign value.

249
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,

250
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we still make certain kinds of mistakes.

251
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.

252
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
One of the things we know about comparison:

253
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.

254
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were

255
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,

256
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
didn't seem like such a great guy.

257
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.

258
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Laughter)

259
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.

260
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Now, retailers knew this long before anybody else did, of course,

261
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and they use this wisdom to help you --

262
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
spare you the undue burden of money.

263
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop

264
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and you had to buy a bottle of wine,

265
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?

266
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Most people don't want the most expensive,

267
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
they don't want the least expensive.

268
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.

269
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item

270
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that nobody will ever buy on the shelf,

271
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.

272
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So I'm telling you something you already knew:

273
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
namely, that comparison changes the value of things.

274
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Here's why that's a problem:

275
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,

276
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.

277
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value,

278
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,

279
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.

280
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil

281
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
our attempts to make rational decisions.

282
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Let me just give you an example.

283
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.

284
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked

285
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
the simplest of all questions:

286
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?

287
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.

288
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room

289
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.

290
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change

291
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.

292
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Namely, those who are looking at Spam

293
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
think potato chips are going to be quite tasty;

294
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
those who are looking at Godiva chocolate

295
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
think they won't be nearly so tasty.

296
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?

297
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that

298
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,

299
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
what's sitting in the corner of the room

300
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.

301
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison

302
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that then does not carry through and change their experience.

303
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You've all experienced this yourself, even if you've never come

304
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:

305
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
You want to buy a car stereo.

306
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,

307
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.

308
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?

309
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Most people say they would.

310
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price

311
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.

312
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo,

313
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.

314
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.

315
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.

316
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town

317
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?

318
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
This kind of thinking drives economists crazy, and it should.

319
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! --

320
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
doesn't know where it came from.

321
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
It doesn't know what you saved it on.

322
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,

323
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,

324
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.

325
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks

326
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.

327
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager

328
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,

329
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.

330
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Now, you can see, this is the problem of shifting comparisons,

331
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks

332
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to the purchase that you're making,

333
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.

334
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
You've all had this experience.

335
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
If you're an American, for example, you've probably traveled in France.

336
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And at some point you may have met a couple

337
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
from your own hometown, and you thought,

338
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.

339
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me

340
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,

341
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,

342
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,

343
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and what do you find?

344
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Compared to your regular friends,

345
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,

346
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself

347
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.

348
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Now, you have exactly the same problem when you shop for a stereo.

349
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers --

350
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,

351
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:

352
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
the big ones sound a little better.

353
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And so you buy them, and you bring them home,

354
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and you entirely violate the décor of your house.

355
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store

356
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
is a comparison you'll never make again.

357
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,

358
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"

359
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
which you can't even remember hearing.

360
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
The problem of shifting comparisons is even more difficult

361
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
when these choices are arrayed over time.

362
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
People have a lot of trouble making decisions

363
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
about things that will happen at different points in time.

364
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered

365
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
is that by and large people use two simple rules.

366
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:27,000
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem

367
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and then a third, hard, problem.

368
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Here's the first easy problem:

369
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:34,000
You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?

370
0:18:34.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?

371
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,

372
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
we believe more is better than less.

373
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Here's the second problem:

374
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?

375
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Again, an easy decision,

376
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
because we all know that now is better than later.

377
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.

378
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:01,000
For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.

379
0:19:01.33,000 --> 0:19:04,000
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain

380
0:19:04.33,000 --> 0:19:07,000
by waiting, but you have to be patient.

381
0:19:07.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?

382
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.

383
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:17,000
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred

384
0:19:17.33,000 --> 0:19:21,000
or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification

385
0:19:21.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.

386
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is

387
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing

388
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.

389
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:39,000
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months --

390
0:19:39.33,000 --> 0:19:42,000
or 60 dollars in 13 months.

391
0:19:42.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
What do we find now?

392
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:46,000
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,

393
0:19:46.33,000 --> 0:19:48,000
they might as well wait 13.

394
0:19:48.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
What makes this dynamic inconsistency happen?

395
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.

396
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:58,000
This is just a graph showing the results that I just suggested

397
0:19:58.33,000 --> 0:20:,000
you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,

398
0:20:00.33,000 --> 0:20:03,000
people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher

399
0:20:03.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now

400
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:09,000
or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay --

401
0:20:09.33,000 --> 0:20:13,000
but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision

402
0:20:13.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
off into the future a year.

403
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:2,000
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?

404
0:20:20.33,000 --> 0:20:21,000
These guys can tell us.

405
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
What you see here are two lads,

406
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.

407
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:3,000
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,

408
0:20:30.33,000 --> 0:20:32,000
and I want you to notice two things.

409
0:20:32.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.

410
0:20:38.33,000 --> 0:20:41,000
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.

411
0:20:41.33,000 --> 0:20:44,000
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,

412
0:20:44.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.

413
0:20:48.33,000 --> 0:20:51,000
Here are the results of what I just showed you.

414
0:20:51.33,000 --> 0:20:53,000
This is the subjective height --

415
0:20:53.33,000 --> 0:20:56,000
the height you saw of these guys at various points.

416
0:20:56.33,000 --> 0:20:58,000
And I want you to see that two things are true.

417
0:20:58.33,000 --> 0:21:01,000
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;

418
0:21:01.33,000 --> 0:21:03,000
and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.

419
0:21:03.33,000 --> 0:21:09,000
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.

420
0:21:09.33,000 --> 0:21:12,000
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,

421
0:21:12.33,000 --> 0:21:14,000
but at a far distance

422
0:21:14.33,000 --> 0:21:17,000
their normal, their true, relations are preserved.

423
0:21:17.33,000 --> 0:21:22,000
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.

424
0:21:22.33,000 --> 0:21:27,000
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you:

425
0:21:27.33,000 --> 0:21:29,000
60 now or 50 in a month?

426
0:21:29.33,000 --> 0:21:3,000
And these are subjective values,

427
0:21:30.33,000 --> 0:21:32,000
and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.

428
0:21:32.33,000 --> 0:21:34,000
People always think more is better than less:

429
0:21:34.33,000 --> 0:21:36,000
60 is always better than 50,

430
0:21:36.33,000 --> 0:21:38,000
and they always think now is better than later:

431
0:21:38.33,000 --> 0:21:41,000
the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.

432
0:21:41.33,000 --> 0:21:44,000
Watch what happens when we drop some out.

433
0:21:44.33,000 --> 0:21:47,000
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.

434
0:21:47.33,000 --> 0:21:51,000
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now

435
0:21:51.33,000 --> 0:21:54,000
over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.

436
0:21:54.33,000 --> 0:21:58,000
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that

437
0:21:58.33,000 --> 0:22:02,000
when people get to the future, they will change their minds.

438
0:22:02.33,000 --> 0:22:05,000
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,

439
0:22:05.33,000 --> 0:22:08,000
what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?

440
0:22:08.33,000 --> 0:22:11,000
I'll take the 50 dollars now.

441
0:22:11.33,000 --> 0:22:14,000
Well, the question with which I'd like to end is this:

442
0:22:14.33,000 --> 0:22:17,000
If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?

443
0:22:17.33,000 --> 0:22:2,000
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence

444
0:22:20.33,000 --> 0:22:26,000
of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.

445
0:22:26.33,000 --> 0:22:28,000
The answer to this question, I think, is an answer you've already heard

446
0:22:28.33,000 --> 0:22:3,000
in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:

447
0:22:30.33,000 --> 0:22:34,000
namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world

448
0:22:34.33,000 --> 0:22:36,000
than the one in which we are living.

449
0:22:36.33,000 --> 0:22:38,000
They were evolved for a world

450
0:22:38.33,000 --> 0:22:4,000
in which people lived in very small groups,

451
0:22:40.33,000 --> 0:22:43,000
rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,

452
0:22:43.33,000 --> 0:22:46,000
had rather short lives in which there were few choices

453
0:22:46.33,000 --> 0:22:51,000
and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.

454
0:22:51.33,000 --> 0:22:56,000
Bernoulli's gift, Bernoulli's little formula, allows us, it tells us

455
0:22:56.33,000 --> 0:23:01,000
how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.

456
0:23:01.33,000 --> 0:23:05,000
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains

457
0:23:05.33,000 --> 0:23:1,000
why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.

458
0:23:10.33,000 --> 0:23:12,000
We are the only species on this planet

459
0:23:12.33,000 --> 0:23:16,000
that has ever held its own fate in its hands.

460
0:23:16.33,000 --> 0:23:18,000
We have no significant predators,

461
0:23:18.33,000 --> 0:23:2,000
we're the masters of our physical environment;

462
0:23:20.33,000 --> 0:23:23,000
the things that normally cause species to become extinct

463
0:23:23.33,000 --> 0:23:26,000
are no longer any threat to us.

464
0:23:26.33,000 --> 0:23:31,000
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us

465
0:23:31.33,000 --> 0:23:33,000
are our own decisions.

466
0:23:33.33,000 --> 0:23:37,000
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because

467
0:23:37.33,000 --> 0:23:41,000
we could not take advantage of the gift given to us

468
0:23:41.33,000 --> 0:23:44,000
by a young Dutch fellow in 1738,

469
0:23:44.33,000 --> 0:23:48,000
because we underestimated the odds of our future pains

470
0:23:48.33,000 --> 0:23:52,000
and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.

471
0:23:52.33,000 --> 0:23:53,000
Thank you.

472
0:23:53.33,000 --> 0:24:03,000
(Applause)

473
0:24:03.33,000 --> 0:24:06,000
Chris Anderson: That was remarkable.

474
0:24:06.33,000 --> 0:24:11,000
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.

475
0:24:11.33,000 --> 0:24:14,000
Bill Lyell: Would you say that this mechanism

476
0:24:14.33,000 --> 0:24:18,000
is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,

477
0:24:18.33,000 --> 0:24:22,000
and is there some way that we could counteract that?

478
0:24:22.33,000 --> 0:24:23,000
Dan Gilbert: I actually was consulting recently

479
0:24:23.33,000 --> 0:24:26,000
with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes

480
0:24:26.33,000 --> 0:24:3,000
that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.

481
0:24:30.33,000 --> 0:24:33,000
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name

482
0:24:33.33,000 --> 0:24:37,000
based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,

483
0:24:37.33,000 --> 0:24:39,000
and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask

484
0:24:39.33,000 --> 0:24:42,000
what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,

485
0:24:42.33,000 --> 0:24:45,000
rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to

486
0:24:45.33,000 --> 0:24:48,000
stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.

487
0:24:48.33,000 --> 0:24:54,000
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --

488
0:24:54.33,000 --> 0:24:59,000
and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.

489
0:24:59.33,000 --> 0:25:01,000
We already know, for example, in the United States,

490
0:25:01.33,000 --> 0:25:05,000
more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --

491
0:25:05.33,000 --> 0:25:07,000
because they were scared -- and driving on highways,

492
0:25:07.33,000 --> 0:25:09,000
than were killed in 9/11. OK?

493
0:25:09.33,000 --> 0:25:11,000
If I told you that there was a plague

494
0:25:11.33,000 --> 0:25:14,000
that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,

495
0:25:14.33,000 --> 0:25:17,000
you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.

496
0:25:17.33,000 --> 0:25:2,000
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering

497
0:25:20.33,000 --> 0:25:22,000
whether they should get the kind of play,

498
0:25:22.33,000 --> 0:25:24,000
the kind of coverage, that they do.

499
0:25:24.33,000 --> 0:25:27,000
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood

500
0:25:27.33,000 --> 0:25:29,000
that they'll be hurt in these various ways,

501
0:25:29.33,000 --> 0:25:31,000
and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.

502
0:25:31.33,000 --> 0:25:33,000
CA: Dan, I'd like to hear more on this. So, you're saying

503
0:25:33.33,000 --> 0:25:37,000
that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?

504
0:25:37.33,000 --> 0:25:38,000
Talk more about it.

505
0:25:38.33,000 --> 0:25:41,000
DG: It's out-sized. I mean, look.

506
0:25:41.33,000 --> 0:25:43,000
If Australia disappears tomorrow,

507
0:25:43.33,000 --> 0:25:45,000
terror is probably the right response.

508
0:25:45.33,000 --> 0:25:5,000
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,

509
0:25:50.33,000 --> 0:25:53,000
when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,

510
0:25:53.33,000 --> 0:25:55,000
more people than that were killed

511
0:25:55.33,000 --> 0:25:58,000
by not using their seatbelts in the same country.

512
0:25:58.33,000 --> 0:25:59,000
Is terror the right response?

513
0:25:59.33,000 --> 0:26:03,000
CA: What causes the bug? Is it the drama of the event --

514
0:26:03.33,000 --> 0:26:04,000
that it's so spectacular?

515
0:26:04.33,000 --> 0:26:07,000
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?

516
0:26:07.33,000 --> 0:26:08,000
What is it?

517
0:26:08.33,000 --> 0:26:11,000
DG: Yes. It's a number of things, and you hit on several of them.

518
0:26:11.33,000 --> 0:26:13,000
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us --

519
0:26:13.33,000 --> 0:26:16,000
it's not a tree falling on us by accident.

520
0:26:16.33,000 --> 0:26:19,000
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.

521
0:26:19.33,000 --> 0:26:22,000
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --

522
0:26:22.33,000 --> 0:26:25,000
as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.

523
0:26:25.33,000 --> 0:26:27,000
So there are a number of things that together

524
0:26:27.33,000 --> 0:26:3,000
make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down

525
0:26:30.33,000 --> 0:26:34,000
the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it

526
0:26:34.33,000 --> 0:26:37,000
they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,

527
0:26:37.33,000 --> 0:26:39,000
who want these things to be

528
0:26:39.33,000 --> 0:26:43,000
as spectacular as they possibly can.

529
0:26:43.33,000 --> 0:26:49,000
CA: I mean, what would it take to persuade our culture to downplay it?

530
0:26:49.33,000 --> 0:26:5,000
DG: Well, go to Israel. You know,

531
0:26:50.33,000 --> 0:26:52,000
go to Israel. And a mall blows up,

532
0:26:52.33,000 --> 0:26:55,000
and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later --

533
0:26:55.33,000 --> 0:26:58,000
at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall

534
0:26:58.33,000 --> 0:27:,000
when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel

535
0:27:00.33,000 --> 0:27:03,000
and the wedding that was planned was still going on.

536
0:27:03.33,000 --> 0:27:04,000
And as the Israeli mother said,

537
0:27:04.33,000 --> 0:27:08,000
she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."

538
0:27:08.33,000 --> 0:27:09,000
I mean, this is a society that has learned --

539
0:27:09.33,000 --> 0:27:11,000
and there are others too -- that has learned to live

540
0:27:11.33,000 --> 0:27:16,000
with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,

541
0:27:16.33,000 --> 0:27:19,000
shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.

542
0:27:19.33,000 --> 0:27:22,000
CA: But is there a rational fear that actually,

543
0:27:22.33,000 --> 0:27:25,000
the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that

544
0:27:25.33,000 --> 0:27:26,000
the Big One is to come?

545
0:27:26.33,000 --> 0:27:3,000
DG: Yes, of course. So, if we knew that this was the worst attack

546
0:27:30.33,000 --> 0:27:34,000
there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people --

547
0:27:34.33,000 --> 0:27:36,000
we would probably not be nearly so frightened.

548
0:27:36.33,000 --> 0:27:38,000
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere

549
0:27:38.33,000 --> 0:27:42,000
as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."

550
0:27:42.33,000 --> 0:27:44,000
That's not my point at all.

551
0:27:44.33,000 --> 0:27:46,000
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,

552
0:27:46.33,000 --> 0:27:5,000
our distress about things that happen, about threats,

553
0:27:50.33,000 --> 0:27:53,000
should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats

554
0:27:53.33,000 --> 0:27:55,000
and threats to come.

555
0:27:55.33,000 --> 0:27:58,000
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.

556
0:27:58.33,000 --> 0:28:,000
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today --

557
0:28:00.33,000 --> 0:28:02,000
how many people do you know got up and said,

558
0:28:02.33,000 --> 0:28:06,000
Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.

559
0:28:06.33,000 --> 0:28:08,000
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.

560
0:28:08.33,000 --> 0:28:1,000
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.

561
0:28:10.33,000 --> 0:28:12,000
There are no guns going off.

562
0:28:12.33,000 --> 0:28:14,000
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,

563
0:28:14.33,000 --> 0:28:16,000
which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?

564
0:28:16.33,000 --> 0:28:2,000
(Laughter)

565
0:28:20.33,000 --> 0:28:22,000
(Applause)

566
0:28:22.33,000 --> 0:28:24,000
That's a tough one.

567
0:28:24.33,000 --> 0:28:25,000
CA: There's no question.

568
0:28:25.33,000 --> 0:28:29,000
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,

569
0:28:29.33,000 --> 0:28:32,000
unless someone can show that there's, you know,

570
0:28:32.33,000 --> 0:28:36,000
terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.

571
0:28:36.33,000 --> 0:28:38,000
The latest I've read, seen, thought

572
0:28:38.33,000 --> 0:28:42,000
is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.

573
0:28:42.33,000 --> 0:28:44,000
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,

574
0:28:44.33,000 --> 0:28:46,000
but with poverty it's a bit --

575
0:28:46.33,000 --> 0:28:49,000
DG: Even if that were true, still more people die from poverty.

576
0:28:53.33,000 --> 0:28:54,000
CA: We've evolved to get all excited

577
0:28:54.33,000 --> 0:28:57,000
about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,

578
0:28:57.33,000 --> 0:29:,000
in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease

579
0:29:00.33,000 --> 0:29:02,000
and systems that cause poverty and so forth,

580
0:29:02.33,000 --> 0:29:06,000
and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy

581
0:29:06.33,000 --> 0:29:08,000
into worrying about those things?

582
0:29:08.33,000 --> 0:29:1,000
People died; so be it.

583
0:29:10.33,000 --> 0:29:12,000
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.

584
0:29:12.33,000 --> 0:29:14,000
And so we evolved these responses.

585
0:29:14.33,000 --> 0:29:15,000
Is that what happened?

586
0:29:15.33,000 --> 0:29:18,000
DG: Well, you know, the people who are most skeptical

587
0:29:18.33,000 --> 0:29:2,000
about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything

588
0:29:20.33,000 --> 0:29:22,000
are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.

589
0:29:22.33,000 --> 0:29:25,000
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific

590
0:29:25.33,000 --> 0:29:27,000
in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for

591
0:29:27.33,000 --> 0:29:29,000
an evolutionary explanation, you might say

592
0:29:29.33,000 --> 0:29:33,000
that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared

593
0:29:33.33,000 --> 0:29:34,000
of stuff that's new and different.

594
0:29:34.33,000 --> 0:29:36,000
And there's a good reason to be,

595
0:29:36.33,000 --> 0:29:37,000
because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?

596
0:29:37.33,000 --> 0:29:4,000
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely

597
0:29:40.33,000 --> 0:29:43,000
to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.

598
0:29:43.33,000 --> 0:29:46,000
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,

599
0:29:46.33,000 --> 0:29:48,000
our general tendency is to orient towards

600
0:29:48.33,000 --> 0:29:53,000
that which is new and novel is activated.

601
0:29:53.33,000 --> 0:29:55,000
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism

602
0:29:55.33,000 --> 0:29:57,000
as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.

603
0:30:01.33,000 --> 0:30:06,000
Jay Walker: You know, economists love to talk about

604
0:30:06.33,000 --> 0:30:1,000
the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect

605
0:30:10.33,000 --> 0:30:13,000
you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,

606
0:30:13.33,000 --> 0:30:14,000
which is the error of value.

607
0:30:14.33,000 --> 0:30:15,000
I know, because I've interviewed

608
0:30:15.33,000 --> 0:30:17,000
about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.

609
0:30:17.33,000 --> 0:30:21,000
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.

610
0:30:21.33,000 --> 0:30:23,000
That's what you think it is. All right?

611
0:30:23.33,000 --> 0:30:26,000
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,

612
0:30:26.33,000 --> 0:30:3,000
so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,

613
0:30:30.33,000 --> 0:30:33,000
and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?

614
0:30:33.33,000 --> 0:30:37,000
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.

615
0:30:37.33,000 --> 0:30:4,000
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning

616
0:30:40.33,000 --> 0:30:44,000
releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling

617
0:30:44.33,000 --> 0:30:46,000
until the drawing indicates you've lost.

618
0:30:46.33,000 --> 0:30:49,000
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,

619
0:30:49.33,000 --> 0:30:52,000
you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money

620
0:30:52.33,000 --> 0:30:55,000
down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.

621
0:30:55.33,000 --> 0:30:57,000
Now, economists tend to --

622
0:30:57.33,000 --> 0:31:,000
(Applause)

623
0:31:00.33,000 --> 0:31:01,000
-- economists tend to view the world

624
0:31:01.33,000 --> 0:31:03,000
through their own lenses, which is:

625
0:31:03.33,000 --> 0:31:05,000
this is just a bunch of stupid people.

626
0:31:05.33,000 --> 0:31:09,000
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.

627
0:31:09.33,000 --> 0:31:12,000
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,

628
0:31:12.33,000 --> 0:31:15,000
we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.

629
0:31:15.33,000 --> 0:31:2,000
(Applause)

630
0:31:20.33,000 --> 0:31:23,000
DG: Well, no, it's a great point. It remains to be seen

631
0:31:23.33,000 --> 0:31:27,000
whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled

632
0:31:27.33,000 --> 0:31:3,000
by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,

633
0:31:30.33,000 --> 0:31:33,000
people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,

634
0:31:33.33,000 --> 0:31:35,000
even though they don't feel great during the drawing.

635
0:31:35.33,000 --> 0:31:37,000
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.

636
0:31:37.33,000 --> 0:31:4,000
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,

637
0:31:40.33,000 --> 0:31:43,000
which is why they prefer that to the flushing.

638
0:31:43.33,000 --> 0:31:46,000
But certainly I see your point: that there can be

639
0:31:46.33,000 --> 0:31:5,000
some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.

640
0:31:50.33,000 --> 0:31:53,000
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.

641
0:31:53.33,000 --> 0:31:56,000
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.

642
0:31:56.33,000 --> 0:31:58,000
CA: Last question.

643
0:31:58.33,000 --> 0:32:01,000
Aubrey de Grey: My name's Aubrey de Grey, from Cambridge.

644
0:32:01.33,000 --> 0:32:05,000
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills --

645
0:32:05.33,000 --> 0:32:07,000
I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it,

646
0:32:07.33,000 --> 0:32:08,000
as we'll all hear tomorrow.

647
0:32:08.33,000 --> 0:32:11,000
I very much resonate with what you're saying,

648
0:32:11.33,000 --> 0:32:13,000
because it seems to me that the problem

649
0:32:13.33,000 --> 0:32:16,000
with getting people interested in doing anything about aging

650
0:32:16.33,000 --> 0:32:19,000
is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer

651
0:32:19.33,000 --> 0:32:22,000
or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?

652
0:32:22.33,000 --> 0:32:25,000
(Laughter)

653
0:32:25.33,000 --> 0:32:26,000
DG: For you or for them?

654
0:32:26.33,000 --> 0:32:27,000
AdG: In persuading them.

655
0:32:27.33,000 --> 0:32:29,000
DG: Ah, for you in persuading them.

656
0:32:29.33,000 --> 0:32:32,000
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.

657
0:32:32.33,000 --> 0:32:36,000
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work

658
0:32:36.33,000 --> 0:32:39,000
is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.

659
0:32:39.33,000 --> 0:32:42,000
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future

660
0:32:42.33,000 --> 0:32:45,000
and the near future is that we imagine the near future

661
0:32:45.33,000 --> 0:32:47,000
much more vividly than the far future.

662
0:32:47.33,000 --> 0:32:51,000
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail

663
0:32:51.33,000 --> 0:32:53,000
that people put into the mental representations

664
0:32:53.33,000 --> 0:32:55,000
of near and far future, people begin to make decisions

665
0:32:55.33,000 --> 0:32:57,000
about the two in the same way.

666
0:32:57.33,000 --> 0:33:02,000
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65

667
0:33:02.33,000 --> 0:33:03,000
is a question that's very different than,

668
0:33:03.33,000 --> 0:33:07,000
imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,

669
0:33:07.33,000 --> 0:33:09,000
what will you look like, how much hair will you have,

670
0:33:09.33,000 --> 0:33:1,000
who will you be living with.

671
0:33:10.33,000 --> 0:33:13,000
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,

672
0:33:13.33,000 --> 0:33:15,000
suddenly we feel like it might be important to save

673
0:33:15.33,000 --> 0:33:18,000
so that that guy has a little retirement money.

674
0:33:18.33,000 --> 0:33:2,000
But these are tricks around the margins.

675
0:33:20.33,000 --> 0:33:23,000
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,

676
0:33:23.33,000 --> 0:33:25,000
which is to say, "I'm here today,

677
0:33:25.33,000 --> 0:33:28,000
and so now is more important than later."

678
0:33:28.33,000 --> 0:33:3,000
CA: Dan, thank you. Members of the audience,

679
0:33:30.33,000 --> 0:33:31,000
that was a fantastic session. Thank you.

680
0:33:31.33,000 --> 0:33:33,000
(Applause)

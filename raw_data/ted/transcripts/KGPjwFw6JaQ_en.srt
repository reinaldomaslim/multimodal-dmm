1
0:00:12.579,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I came back to my home of Rwanda

2
0:00:17.333,000 --> 0:00:21,000
two years after the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.

3
0:00:22.333,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The country was devastated.

4
0:00:25.168,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The children I was caring for in the hospitals

5
0:00:28.62,000 --> 0:00:31,000
were dying from treatable conditions,

6
0:00:31.664,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because we didn't have equipment or medicine to save them.

7
0:00:39.586,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I was tempted to pack my bag and run away.

8
0:00:45.075,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But I debated with myself.

9
0:00:47.568,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And because I'm really dedicated to social justice and equity,

10
0:00:53.633,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and there were only five pediatricians in total

11
0:00:57.942,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for millions of children in Rwanda,

12
0:01:02.197,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I decided to stay.

13
0:01:05.05,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But among the people who have motivated my decision to stay,

14
0:01:11.433,000 --> 0:01:14,000
there were some fantastic women of Rwanda,

15
0:01:15.427,000 --> 0:01:21,000
some women who had faced the genocide and survived it.

16
0:01:23.355,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They had to overcome unbelievable pain and suffering.

17
0:01:29.617,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Some of them were raising children conceived through rape.

18
0:01:37.301,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Others were dying slowly with HIV

19
0:01:41.499,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and forgave the perpetrators, who voluntarily infected them

20
0:01:47.166,000 --> 0:01:49,000
using HIV and rape as a weapon.

21
0:01:51.937,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So, they inspired me.

22
0:01:54.373,000 --> 0:01:55,000
If they can do that,

23
0:01:55.953,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I can stay and try to do my best.

24
0:02:00.336,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Those ladies were really activists

25
0:02:04.439,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of peace and reconciliation.

26
0:02:07.201,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They show us a way to rebuild a country

27
0:02:10.612,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for our children and grandchildren to have, one day,

28
0:02:14.629,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a place they can call home, with pride.

29
0:02:19.691,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And you can ask yourself

30
0:02:24.318,000 --> 0:02:28,000
where this shift of mindset has brought our country.

31
0:02:30.288,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Today in Rwanda,

32
0:02:32.279,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we have the highest percentage of women in parliament.

33
0:02:39.823,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Applause)

34
0:02:42.085,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Wait till I tell you the percentage --

35
0:02:44.958,000 --> 0:02:46,000
sixty-one percent.

36
0:02:47.085,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Applause)

37
0:02:50.173,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Today, we have the best campaign for the vaccination of children

38
0:02:55.839,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with, among our success, 93 percent of our girls vaccinated against HPV --

39
0:03:02.982,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Applause)

40
0:03:04.854,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to protect them against cervical cancer.

41
0:03:08.567,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In this country, it's 54.

42
0:03:11.305,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

43
0:03:13.425,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We have reduced child mortality by 75 percent,

44
0:03:18.429,000 --> 0:03:2,000
maternal mortality by 80 percent.

45
0:03:21.659,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In early 2000s,

46
0:03:23.54,000 --> 0:03:26,000
there were nine women who were dying every day

47
0:03:27.529,000 --> 0:03:3,000
around delivery and pregnancy.

48
0:03:31.006,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Today, it's around two.

49
0:03:33.517,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's an unfinished agenda.

50
0:03:35.382,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We still have a long way to go.

51
0:03:37.62,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Two is still too much.

52
0:03:42.915,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But, do I believe that those results

53
0:03:49.217,000 --> 0:03:54,000
are because we had a big number of women

54
0:03:54.376,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in power positions?

55
0:03:56.749,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I do.

56
0:03:57.947,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:59.622,000 --> 0:04:,000
There is -- yes --

58
0:04:00.902,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Applause)

59
0:04:02.515,000 --> 0:04:04,000
there is a study in the developing world

60
0:04:05.139,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that shows that if you improve the status of women,

61
0:04:10.879,000 --> 0:04:13,000
you improve the status of the community where they live.

62
0:04:15.601,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Up to 47 percent of decrease in child mortality.

63
0:04:21.574,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And even in this country where we are now,

64
0:04:24.399,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it's true.

65
0:04:26.018,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There is a study by a lady called Patricia Homan,

66
0:04:30.434,000 --> 0:04:34,000
who projected that if women and men

67
0:04:34.998,000 --> 0:04:38,000
were at parity in state legislatures,

68
0:04:39.18,000 --> 0:04:44,000
there would be a drop of 14.5 percent in child mortality --

69
0:04:44.449,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in America!

70
0:04:46.99,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So we know that women,

71
0:04:51.434,000 --> 0:04:54,000
when they use their skills in leadership positions,

72
0:04:55.294,000 --> 0:04:58,000
they enhance the entire population they are in charge of.

73
0:05:00.093,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And imagine what would happen

74
0:05:03.498,000 --> 0:05:07,000
if women were at parity with men all over the world.

75
0:05:08.252,000 --> 0:05:1,000
What a huge benefit we could expect.

76
0:05:11.79,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Hmm?

77
0:05:13.282,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Oh, yeah.

78
0:05:14.457,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Applause)

79
0:05:16.044,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Because in general,

80
0:05:18.361,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we have a different style of leadership:

81
0:05:21.457,000 --> 0:05:22,000
more inclusive,

82
0:05:23.188,000 --> 0:05:24,000
more empathetic,

83
0:05:24.958,000 --> 0:05:26,000
more caring for little children.

84
0:05:28.45,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And this makes the difference.

85
0:05:32.294,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Unfortunately, this ideal doesn't exist in the world,

86
0:05:37.865,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and the difference between men and women in leadership positions

87
0:05:43.39,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is too big.

88
0:05:45.768,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Gender inequity is the norm in the majority of professions,

89
0:05:50.968,000 --> 0:05:52,000
even in global health.

90
0:05:55.38,000 --> 0:06:,000
I have learned that if we focus on women's education,

91
0:06:02.11,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we improve their life positively

92
0:06:05.459,000 --> 0:06:07,000
as well as the well-being of their community.

93
0:06:08.793,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This is why now I dedicate my life to education.

94
0:06:14.658,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And this is totally aligned with my sense of equity

95
0:06:20.253,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and my pursuit of social justice,

96
0:06:23.514,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because if you want to increase access to health services,

97
0:06:30.069,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you need first to increase access to health education.

98
0:06:34.538,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So with friends and partners, we are building a beautiful university

99
0:06:39.427,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in the rural north of Rwanda.

100
0:06:41.895,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We educate our students

101
0:06:45.176,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to provide quality, equitable, holistic care

102
0:06:51.256,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to everyone, leaving no one out,

103
0:06:55.034,000 --> 0:06:59,000
focusing on the vulnerable, especially women and children,

104
0:07:00.28,000 --> 0:07:03,000
who are historically the last to be served.

105
0:07:05.284,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We transform them into leaders

106
0:07:07.616,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and give them managerial skills and advocacy skills

107
0:07:11.832,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for them to be smooth changemakers

108
0:07:15.69,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in the society where they will be,

109
0:07:17.832,000 --> 0:07:19,000
so that they can build health systems

110
0:07:20.451,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that allow them to care about the vulnerable where they are.

111
0:07:25.235,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And it's really transformative.

112
0:07:28.234,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Because currently,

113
0:07:32.362,000 --> 0:07:34,000
medical education, for example,

114
0:07:34.458,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is given in institutions based in cities,

115
0:07:38.8,000 --> 0:07:44,000
focused on quality health services and skills, clinical skills,

116
0:07:46.65,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to be given in institutions.

117
0:07:50.498,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We also focus on quality clinical skills

118
0:07:55.422,000 --> 0:08:,000
but with biosocial approach to the condition of patient,

119
0:08:00.93,000 --> 0:08:05,000
for care to be given in communities where the people live,

120
0:08:06.137,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with hospitalization only when necessary.

121
0:08:11.066,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And also,

122
0:08:12.292,000 --> 0:08:18,000
after four to seven years of clinical education in cities,

123
0:08:18.434,000 --> 0:08:21,000
young graduates don't want to go back to rural area.

124
0:08:23.729,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So this is why we have built the University of Global Health Equity,

125
0:08:30.38,000 --> 0:08:33,000
an initiative of Partners in Health, called UGHE,

126
0:08:34.22,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in the rural north of Rwanda.

127
0:08:37.172,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Applause)

128
0:08:42.982,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Our students

129
0:08:45.61,000 --> 0:08:47,000
are meant to go and change the world.

130
0:08:49.498,000 --> 0:08:53,000
They will come from all over -- it's a global university --

131
0:08:53.712,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and will get the medical education for free

132
0:08:56.927,000 --> 0:08:57,000
at one condition:

133
0:08:58.928,000 --> 0:09:02,000
they have to serve the vulnerable across the world

134
0:09:02.999,000 --> 0:09:04,000
during six to nine years.

135
0:09:05.07,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They will keep the salary for themselves and their families

136
0:09:08.609,000 --> 0:09:12,000
but turn the education we give in quality clinical services,

137
0:09:12.712,000 --> 0:09:13,000
especially for the vulnerable.

138
0:09:15.839,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And doing so,

139
0:09:19.022,000 --> 0:09:24,000
they sign an agreement at the start that they will do that,

140
0:09:24.347,000 --> 0:09:26,000
a binding agreement.

141
0:09:26.419,000 --> 0:09:27,000
We don't want money.

142
0:09:27.99,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We have to go and mobilize the money.

143
0:09:30.919,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But they will turn this in quality service delivery for all.

144
0:09:39.426,000 --> 0:09:4,000
For this, of course,

145
0:09:41.077,000 --> 0:09:44,000
we need a strong gender equity agenda.

146
0:09:45.141,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And in all our classes, master's course,

147
0:09:48.656,000 --> 0:09:5,000
minimum of 50 percent of women.

148
0:09:52.474,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

149
0:09:56.261,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And I'm proud to say

150
0:09:58.309,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that for the medical school that started five months ago,

151
0:10:02.507,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we have enrolled 70 percent girls.

152
0:10:06.049,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

153
0:10:09.358,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This is a statement against the current inequity

154
0:10:13.517,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for women to access medical education in our continent.

155
0:10:20.245,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I believe in women's education.

156
0:10:25.071,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is why I applaud African ladies who go all over the world

157
0:10:30.164,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to increase their education, their skills and their knowledge.

158
0:10:33.712,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But I hope they will bring that back to Africa

159
0:10:37.095,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to build the continent

160
0:10:39.355,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and make the continent a strong continent,

161
0:10:42.196,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because I'm sure

162
0:10:45.101,000 --> 0:10:48,000
a stronger Africa will make the world stronger.

163

0:10:57.088,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Twenty-three years ago,

165
0:10:59.422,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I went back to Rwanda,

166
0:11:02.517,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to a broken Rwanda,

167
0:11:04.342,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that now is still a poor country

168
0:11:06.604,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but shining with a bright future.

169
0:11:10.667,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And I am full of joy to have come back,

170
0:11:13.487,000 --> 0:11:15,000
even if some days were very difficult,

171
0:11:15.798,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and even if some days I was depressed, because I didn't find a solution

172
0:11:19.968,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and people were dying,

173
0:11:21.362,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or things were not moving enough.

174
0:11:25.519,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But I'm so proud to have contributed to improve my community.

175
0:11:30.995,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And this makes me full of joy.

176
0:11:34.395,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So, African women from the diaspora,

177
0:11:39.418,000 --> 0:11:4,000
if you hear me,

178
0:11:41.093,000 --> 0:11:43,000
never forget your homeland.

179
0:11:44.955,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And when you are ready, come back home.

180
0:11:49.645,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I did so.

181
0:11:51.971,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It has fulfilled my life.

182
0:11:54.889,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So, come back home.

183
0:11:57.802,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Thank you.

184
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000

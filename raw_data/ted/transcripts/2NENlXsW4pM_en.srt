1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I wanted to be a rock star.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I dreamed of it, and that's all I dreamed of.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
To be more accurate, I wanted to be a pop star.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This was in the late '80s.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And mostly I wanted to be the fifth member

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of Depeche Mode or Duran Duran.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They wouldn't have me.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I didn't read music, but I played synthesizers and drum machines.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And I grew up in this little farming town in northern Nevada.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I was certain that's what my life would be.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And when I went to college at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
when I was 18,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was stunned to find

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that there was not a Pop Star 101,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or even a degree program for that interest.

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And the choir conductor there

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
knew that I sang

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and invited me to come and join the choir.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I said, "Yes, I would love to do that. It sounds great."

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And I left the room and said, "No way."

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The choir people in my high school were pretty geeky,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and there was no way I was going to have anything to do with those people.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And about a week later, a friend of mine came to me and said,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Listen, you've got to join choir.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
At the end of the semester, we're taking a trip to Mexico,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
all expenses paid.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And the soprano section is just full of hot girls."

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And so I figured for Mexico and babes,

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I could do just about anything.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I went to my first day in choir,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I sat down with the basses

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and sort of looked over my shoulder

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to see what they were doing.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They opened their scores, the conductor gave the downbeat,

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and boom, they launched into the Kyrie

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
from the "Requiem" by Mozart.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In my entire life I had seen in black and white,

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The most transformative experience I've ever had --

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and people singing, people together,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the shared vision.

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I felt for the first time in my life

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that I was part of something bigger than myself.

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And there were a lot of cute girls in the soprano section, as it turns out.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I decided to write a piece for choir

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a couple of years later

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as a gift to this conductor

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
who had changed my life.

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I had learned to read music by then, or slowly learning to read music.

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And that piece was published,

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and then I wrote another piece, and that got published.

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And then I started conducting,

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and I ended up doing my master's degree at the Juilliard School.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I find myself now in the unlikely position

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of standing in front of all of you

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
as a professional classical composer and conductor.

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Well a couple of years ago,

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a friend of mine emailed me

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a link, a YouTube link,

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and said, "You have got to see this."

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And it was this young woman who had posted a fan video to me,

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
singing the soprano line

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to a piece of mine called "Sleep."

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Video) Britlin Losee: Hi Mr. Eric Whitacre.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
My name is Britlin Losee,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and this is a video

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that I'd like to make for you.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Here's me singing "Sleep."

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm a little nervous, just to let you know.

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000

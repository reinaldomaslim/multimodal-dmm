1
0:00:14.134,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When I was a kid,

2
0:00:15.317,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I experienced something so powerful,

3
0:00:17.849,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I spent the rest of my life searching for it,

4
0:00:20.947,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and in all the wrong places.

5
0:00:23.327,000 --> 0:00:25,000
What I experienced wasn't virtual reality.

6
0:00:26.633,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It was music.

7
0:00:28.251,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And this is where the story begins.

8
0:00:31.797,000 --> 0:00:32,000
That's me,

9
0:00:33.191,000 --> 0:00:34,000
listening to the Beatles' "White Album."

10
0:00:35.161,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And the look on my face is the feeling

11
0:00:38.353,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that I've been searching for ever since.

12
0:00:41.938,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Music goes straight to the emotional vein,

13
0:00:44.548,000 --> 0:00:45,000
into your bloodstream

14
0:00:46.178,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and right into your heart.

15
0:00:48.157,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It deepens every experience.

16
0:00:51.717,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Fellas?

17
0:00:53.454,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Music)

18
0:00:59.472,000 --> 0:01:01,000
This is the amazing McKenzie Stubbert

19
0:01:01.648,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and Joshua Roman.

20
0:01:03.551,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Music --

21
0:01:04.738,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Applause)

22
0:01:05.956,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Yeah.

23
0:01:08.63,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Music makes everything have more emotional resonance.

24
0:01:13.229,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Let's see how it does for this talk.

25
0:01:15.825,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The right piece of music at the right time fuses with us

26
0:01:19.593,000 --> 0:01:2,000
on a cellular level.

27
0:01:21.382,000 --> 0:01:23,000
When I hear that one song

28
0:01:24.502,000 --> 0:01:25,000
from that one summer

29
0:01:26.488,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with that one girl,

30
0:01:28.48,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'm instantly transported back there again.

31
0:01:31.963,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Hey, Stacey.

32
0:01:34.908,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Here's a part of the story, though, where I got a little greedy.

33
0:01:38.21,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I thought if I added more layers on top of the music,

34
0:01:42.394,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I could make the feelings even more powerful.

35
0:01:45.67,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So I got into directing music videos.

36
0:01:49.432,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This is what they looked like.

37
0:01:54.429,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That's my brother, Jeff.

38
0:01:56.799,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Sorry about this, Jeff.

39
0:01:58.145,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:59.256,000 --> 0:02:,000
Here's me, just so we're even.

41
0:02:02.682,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Incredible moves.

42
0:02:04.444,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Should've been a dancer.

43
0:02:05.809,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:06.955,000 --> 0:02:07,000
These experiments grew,

45
0:02:08.291,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and in time, started to look more like this.

46
0:02:13.852,000 --> 0:02:15,000
In both, I'm searching for the same thing, though,

47
0:02:16.516,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to capture that lightning in a bottle.

48
0:02:20.192,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Except, I'm not.

49
0:02:21.889,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Adding moving pictures over the music added narrative dimension, yes,

50
0:02:26.261,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but never quite equated the power

51
0:02:28.809,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that just raw music had for me on its own.

52
0:02:32.795,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is not a great thing to realize when you've devoted your life

53
0:02:35.973,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and professional career to becoming a music video director.

54
0:02:38.836,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I kept asking myself, did I take the wrong path?

55
0:02:42.353,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So I started thinking: if I could involve you, the audience, more,

56
0:02:46.228,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I might be able to make you feel something more as well.

57
0:02:49.901,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So Aaron Koblin and I began auditioning new technologies

58
0:02:53.11,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that could put more of you inside of the work,

59
0:02:56.272,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like your childhood home in "The Wilderness Downtown,"

60
0:03:00.75,000 --> 0:03:03,000
your hand-drawn portraits, in "The Johnny Cash Project,"

61
0:03:05.581,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and your interactive dreams

62
0:03:07.791,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in "3 Dreams of Black."

63
0:03:11.469,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We were pushing beyond the screen,

64
0:03:13.45,000 --> 0:03:14,000
trying to connect more deeply

65
0:03:15.455,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to people's hearts and imaginations.

66
0:03:18.745,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But it wasn't quite enough.

67
0:03:21.258,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It still didn't have the raw experiential power of pure music for me.

68
0:03:27.443,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So I started chasing a new technology

69
0:03:29.528,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that I only had read about in science fiction.

70
0:03:32.826,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And after years of searching, I found a prototype.

71
0:03:35.871,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It was a project from Nonny de la Peña in Mark Bolas's lab in USC.

72
0:03:41.102,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when I tried it, I knew I'd found it.

73
0:03:45.095,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I could taste the lightning.

74
0:03:47.334,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It was called virtual reality.

75
0:03:50.047,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This was it five years ago when I ran into it.

76
0:03:53.53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
This is what it looks like now.

77
0:03:56.846,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I quickly started building things in this new medium,

78
0:04:00.775,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and through that process we realized something:

79
0:04:03.664,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that VR is going to play an incredibly important role

80
0:04:07.105,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the history of mediums.

81
0:04:09.681,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In fact, it's going to be the last one.

82
0:04:13.39,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I mean this because it's the first medium that actually makes the jump

83
0:04:17.029,000 --> 0:04:2,000
from our internalization of an author's expression

84
0:04:20.341,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of an experience,

85
0:04:22.035,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to our experiencing it firsthand.

86
0:04:25.691,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You look confused. I'll explain. Don't worry.

87
0:04:27.879,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:29.83,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If we go back to the origins of mediums,

89
0:04:33.044,000 --> 0:04:34,000
by all best guesses,

90
0:04:34.432,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it starts around a fire, with a good story.

91
0:04:37.986,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Our clan leader is telling us

92
0:04:39.475,000 --> 0:04:42,000
about how he hunted the woolly mammoth on the tundra that day.

93
0:04:44.069,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We hear his words

94
0:04:46.09,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and translate them into our own internal truths.

95
0:04:50.839,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The same thing happens

96
0:04:52.028,000 --> 0:04:54,000
when we look at the cave painting version of the story,

97
0:04:56.241,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the book about the mammoth hunt,

98
0:04:58.472,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the play,

99
0:05:00.109,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the radio broadcast,

100
0:05:01.749,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the television show

101
0:05:03.582,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or the movie.

102
0:05:05.532,000 --> 0:05:08,000
All of these mediums require what we call "suspension of disbelief,"

103
0:05:09.288,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because there's a translation gap between the reality of the story

104
0:05:13.37,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and our consciousness interpreting the story

105
0:05:16.816,000 --> 0:05:17,000
into our reality.

106
0:05:19.081,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I'm using the word "consciousness" as a feeling of reality that we get

107
0:05:23.181,000 --> 0:05:26,000
from our senses experiencing the world around us.

108
0:05:28.58,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Virtual reality bridges that gap.

109
0:05:31.985,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, you are on the tundra hunting with the clan leader.

110
0:05:36.222,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Or you are the clan leader.

111
0:05:38.6,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Or maybe you're even the woolly mammoth.

112
0:05:41.326,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:46.218,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So here's what special about VR.

114
0:05:48.726,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In all other mediums,

115
0:05:50.329,000 --> 0:05:52,000
your consciousness interprets the medium.

116
0:05:53.044,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In VR, your consciousness is the medium.

117
0:05:58.399,000 --> 0:06:,000
So the potential for VR is enormous.

118
0:06:00.857,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But where are we now?

119
0:06:02.555,000 --> 0:06:04,000
What is the current state of the art?

120
0:06:06.318,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well,

121
0:06:08.746,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we are here.

122
0:06:10.724,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We are the equivalent of year one of cinema.

123
0:06:13.896,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This is the Lumière Brothers film

124
0:06:15.546,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that allegedly sent a theater full of people running for their lives

125
0:06:18.929,000 --> 0:06:2,000
as they thought a train was coming toward them.

126
0:06:22.136,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Similar to this early stage of this medium,

127
0:06:25.436,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in VR, we also have to move past the spectacle

128
0:06:29.001,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and into the storytelling.

129
0:06:30.911,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It took this medium decades

130
0:06:32.682,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to figure out its preferred language of storytelling,

131
0:06:35.364,000 --> 0:06:36,000
in the form of a feature film.

132
0:06:37.164,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In VR today, we're more learning grammar

133
0:06:40.542,000 --> 0:06:41,000
than writing language.

134
0:06:42.88,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We've made 15 films in the last year at our VR company, Vrse,

135
0:06:46.455,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and we've learned a few things.

136
0:06:48.801,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We found that we have a unique, direct path into your senses,

137
0:06:52.14,000 --> 0:06:54,000
your emotions, even your body.

138
0:06:55.897,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So let me show you some things.

139
0:06:57.596,000 --> 0:06:58,000
For the purpose of this demo,

140
0:06:59.018,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we're going to take every direction that you could possibly look,

141
0:07:02.107,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and stretch it into this giant rectangle.

142
0:07:05.083,000 --> 0:07:06,000
OK, here we go.

143
0:07:09.642,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So, first: camera movement is tricky in VR.

144
0:07:13.947,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Done wrong, it can actually make you sick.

145
0:07:16.93,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We found if you move the camera at a constant speed in a straight line,

146
0:07:21.453,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you can actually get away with it, though.

147
0:07:23.694,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The first day in film school,

148
0:07:25.445,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they told me you have to learn every single rule

149
0:07:28.056,000 --> 0:07:29,000
before you can break one.

150
0:07:29.838,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We have not learned every single rule.

151
0:07:32.036,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We've barely learned any at all,

152
0:07:33.588,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but we're already trying to break them

153
0:07:35.429,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to see what kind of creative things we can accomplish.

154
0:07:37.982,000 --> 0:07:4,000
In this shot here, where we're moving up off the ground, I added acceleration.

155
0:07:41.718,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I did that because I wanted to give you a physical sensation

156
0:07:44.575,000 --> 0:07:45,000
of moving up off the ground.

157
0:07:45.982,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In VR, I can give that to you.

158
0:07:49.797,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Music)

159
0:07:55.882,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Not surprisingly, music matters a lot in this medium as well.

160
0:07:59.842,000 --> 0:08:,000
It guides us how to feel.

161
0:08:02.354,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In this project we made with the New York Times, Zach Richter

162
0:08:05.699,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and our friend, JR,

163
0:08:07.478,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we take you up in a helicopter,

164
0:08:09.387,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and even though you're flying 2,000 feet above Manhattan,

165
0:08:13.349,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you don't feel afraid.

166
0:08:14.961,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You feel triumphant for JR's character.

167
0:08:19.022,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The music guides you there.

168
0:08:20.525,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Music)

169
0:08:29.364,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Contrary to popular belief,

170
0:08:30.995,000 --> 0:08:32,000
there is composition in virtual reality,

171
0:08:33.685,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but it's completely different than in film,

172
0:08:35.77,000 --> 0:08:36,000
where you have a rectangular frame.

173
0:08:37.519,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Composition is now where your consciousness exists

174
0:08:40.055,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and how the world moves around you.

175
0:08:42.927,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In this film, "Waves of Grace," which was a collaboration between Vrse,

176
0:08:46.315,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the United Nations, Gabo Arora, and Imraan Ismail,

177
0:08:49.248,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we also see the changing role of the close-up in virtual reality.

178
0:08:53.139,000 --> 0:08:57,000
A close-up in VR means you're actually close up to someone.

179
0:08:57.954,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It brings that character inside of your personal space,

180
0:09:00.621,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a space that we'd usually reserve for the people that we love.

181
0:09:04.49,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And you feel an emotional closeness to the character

182
0:09:07.684,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because of what you feel to be a physical closeness.

183
0:09:16.639,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Directing VR is not like directing for the rectangle.

184
0:09:21.002,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It's more of a choreography of the viewer's attention.

185
0:09:24.864,000 --> 0:09:26,000
One tool we can use to guide your attention

186
0:09:27.482,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is called "spatialized sound."

187
0:09:28.939,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I can put a sound anywhere in front of you, to left or right,

188
0:09:31.931,000 --> 0:09:32,000
even behind you,

189
0:09:33.334,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and when you turn your head, the sound will rotate accordingly.

190
0:09:36.354,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So I can use that to direct your attention to where I want you to see.

191
0:09:40.308,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Next time you hear someone singing over your shoulder,

192
0:09:42.91,000 --> 0:09:43,000
it might be Bono.

193
0:09:44.195,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:50.539,000 --> 0:09:52,000
VR makes us feel like we are part of something.

195
0:09:54.459,000 --> 0:09:57,000
For most of human history, we lived in small family units.

196
0:09:57.992,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We started in caves,

197
0:09:59.527,000 --> 0:10:02,000
then moved to clans and tribes, then villages and towns,

198
0:10:02.984,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and now we're all global citizens.

199
0:10:06.211,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But I believe that we are still hardwired to care the most

200
0:10:10.035,000 --> 0:10:12,000
about the things that are local to us.

201
0:10:13.325,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And VR makes anywhere and anyone feel local.

202
0:10:18.307,000 --> 0:10:2,000
That's why it works as an empathy machine.

203
0:10:20.839,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Our film "Clouds Over Sidra" takes you to a Syrian refugee camp,

204
0:10:24.087,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and instead of watching a story about people over there,

205
0:10:28.662,000 --> 0:10:31,000
it's now a story about us here.

206
0:10:34.386,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But where do we go from here?

207
0:10:36.432,000 --> 0:10:38,000
The tricky thing is that with all previous mediums,

208
0:10:38.913,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the format is fixed at its birth.

209
0:10:42.182,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Film has been a sequence of rectangles,

210
0:10:44.095,000 --> 0:10:46,000
from Muybridge and his horses to now.

211
0:10:47.377,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The format has never changed.

212
0:10:49.654,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But VR as a format, as a medium,

213
0:10:54.37,000 --> 0:10:55,000
isn't complete yet.

214
0:10:56.767,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's not using physical celluloid or paper or TV signals.

215
0:10:59.99,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It actually employs what we use to make sense of the world.

216
0:11:04.642,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We're using your senses as the paints on the canvas,

217
0:11:08.569,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but only two right now.

218
0:11:11.653,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Eventually, we can see if we will have all of our human senses employed,

219
0:11:15.517,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and we will have agency to live the story in any path we choose.

220
0:11:20.575,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And we call it virtual reality right now,

221
0:11:23.055,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but what happens when we move past simulated realities?

222
0:11:27.345,000 --> 0:11:28,000
What do we call it then?

223
0:11:29.503,000 --> 0:11:31,000
What if instead of verbally telling you about a dream,

224
0:11:32.363,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I could let you live inside that dream?

225
0:11:35.86,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What if instead of just experiencing visiting some reality on Earth,

226
0:11:39.511,000 --> 0:11:43,000
you could surf gravitational waves on the edge of a black hole,

227
0:11:43.961,000 --> 0:11:45,000
or create galaxies from scratch,

228
0:11:46.761,000 --> 0:11:49,000
or communicate with each other not using words

229
0:11:49.869,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but using our raw thoughts?

230
0:11:53.254,000 --> 0:11:55,000
That's not a virtual reality anymore.

231
0:11:56.052,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And honestly I don't know what that's called.

232
0:11:58.884,000 --> 0:12:,000
But I hope you see where we're going.

233
0:12:02.629,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But here I am, intellectualizing a medium I'm saying is experiential.

234
0:12:06.839,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So let's experience it.

235
0:12:08.845,000 --> 0:12:11,000
In your hands, you hopefully hold a piece of cardboard.

236
0:12:13.143,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Let's open the flap.

237
0:12:14.8,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Tap on the power button to unlock the phone.

238
0:12:18.145,000 --> 0:12:19,000
For the people watching at home,

239
0:12:19.793,000 --> 0:12:2,000
we're going to put up a card right now

240
0:12:21.653,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to show you how to download this experience on your phone yourself,

241
0:12:24.907,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and even get a Google cardboard of your own to try it with.

242
0:12:29.275,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We played in cardboard boxes as kids,

243
0:12:31.826,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and as adults, I'm hoping we can all find a little bit of that lightning

244
0:12:36.434,000 --> 0:12:38,000
by sticking our head in one again.

245
0:12:41.615,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You're about to participate

246
0:12:43.068,000 --> 0:12:47,000
in the largest collective VR viewing in history.

247
0:12:48.236,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And in that classic old-timey style of yesteryear,

248
0:12:51.878,000 --> 0:12:53,000
we're all going to watch something

249
0:12:54.133,000 --> 0:12:55,000
at the exact same time, together.

250
0:12:57.019,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Let's hope it works.

251
0:12:58.466,000 --> 0:13:,000
What's the countdown look like? I can't see.

252
0:13:04.564,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Audience: ...15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9,

253
0:13:11.582,000 --> 0:13:17,000
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

254
0:13:22.327,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Birds singing)

(Train engine)

Audience: (Shreiks)

257
0:14:03.285,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Video) JR: Let me tell you

258
0:14:04.599,000 --> 0:14:06,000
how I shot the cover of the New York Times Magazine,

259
0:14:07.1,000 --> 0:14:09,000
"Walking New York."

260
0:14:18.577,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I just got strapped on outside the helicopter,

261
0:14:22.011,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and I had to be perfectly vertical so I could grab it.

262
0:14:26.279,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And when I was perfectly above --

263
0:14:27.921,000 --> 0:14:29,000
you know, with the wind, we had to redo it a few times --

264
0:14:30.682,000 --> 0:14:31,000
then I kept shooting.

265
0:14:39.598,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Video) Woman's voice: Dear Lord,

266
0:14:41.9,000 --> 0:14:42,000
protect us from evil,

267
0:14:44.654,000 --> 0:14:45,000
for you are the Lord,

268
0:14:47.044,000 --> 0:14:48,000
the light.

269
0:14:53.824,000 --> 0:14:55,000
You who gave us life took it away.

270
0:14:58.191,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Let your will be done.

271
0:15:00.941,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Please bring peace to the many who have lost loved ones.

272
0:15:05.529,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Help us to live again.

273
0:15:10.564,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Music)

274
0:15:29.066,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Video) (Children's voices)

275
0:15:31.504,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Child's voice: There are more kids in Zaatari than adults right now.

276
0:15:41.924,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Sometimes I think

277
0:15:43.977,000 --> 0:15:45,000
we are the ones in charge.

278
0:15:51.41,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Chris Milk: How was it?

279
0:15:52.809,000 --> 0:15:55,000
(Applause)

280
0:15:56.548,000 --> 0:15:58,000
That was a cheap way of getting you to do a standing ovation.

281
0:15:59.501,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I just made you all stand. I knew you'd applaud at the end.

282
0:16:02.333,000 --> 0:16:03,000
(Applause)

283
0:16:03.998,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I believe that everyone on Earth needs to experience

284
0:16:07.841,000 --> 0:16:08,000
what you just experienced.

285
0:16:10.036,000 --> 0:16:13,000
That way we can collectively start to shape this,

286
0:16:13.227,000 --> 0:16:14,000
not as a tech platform

287
0:16:15.025,000 --> 0:16:16,000
but as a humanity platform.

288
0:16:17.498,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And to that end, in November of last year,

289
0:16:20.706,000 --> 0:16:23,000
the New York Times and Vrse made a VR project called "The Displaced."

290
0:16:24.016,000 --> 0:16:26,000
It launched with one million Google Cardboards

291
0:16:26.386,000 --> 0:16:29,000
sent out to every Sunday subscriber with their newspaper.

292
0:16:29.883,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But a funny thing happened that Sunday morning.

293
0:16:32.425,000 --> 0:16:33,000
A lot of people got them

294
0:16:33.771,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that were not the intended recipients on the mailing label.

295
0:16:38.001,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And we started seeing this all over Instagram.

296
0:16:45.059,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Look familiar?

297
0:16:48.252,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Music led me on a path

298
0:16:50.419,000 --> 0:16:53,000
of searching for what seemed like the unattainable

299
0:16:53.492,000 --> 0:16:54,000
for a very long time.

300
0:16:55.466,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Now, millions of kids just had the same formative experience

301
0:16:59.461,000 --> 0:17:,000
in their childhood

302
0:17:01.226,000 --> 0:17:03,000
that I had in mine.

303
0:17:04.316,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Only I think this one

304
0:17:06.569,000 --> 0:17:07,000
surpasses it.

305
0:17:08.358,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Let's see

306
0:17:09.859,000 --> 0:17:1,000
where this

307
0:17:11.573,000 --> 0:17:12,000
leads them.

308
0:17:13.384,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Thank you.

309
0:17:14.559,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

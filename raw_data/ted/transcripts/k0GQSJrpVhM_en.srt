1
0:00:12.912,000 --> 0:00:13,000
At some point in our lives,

2
0:00:14.882,000 --> 0:00:16,000
almost every one of us will have our heart broken.

3
0:00:18.831,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school.

4
0:00:23.227,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She would meet her future husband

5
0:00:25.088,000 --> 0:00:26,000
by age 27,

6
0:00:26.745,000 --> 0:00:27,000
get engaged a year later

7
0:00:28.556,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and get married a year after that.

8
0:00:31.576,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But when Kathy turned 27, she didn't find a husband.

9
0:00:35.54,000 --> 0:00:37,000
She found a lump in her breast.

10
0:00:38.295,000 --> 0:00:41,000
She went through many months of harsh chemotherapy

11
0:00:41.427,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and painful surgeries,

12
0:00:43.225,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and then just as she was ready to jump back into the dating world,

13
0:00:47.753,000 --> 0:00:49,000
she found a lump in her other breast

14
0:00:50.147,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and had to do it all over again.

15
0:00:53.225,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Kathy recovered, though,

16
0:00:54.458,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and she was eager to resume her search for a husband

17
0:00:57.417,000 --> 0:00:59,000
as soon as her eyebrows grew back in.

18
0:01:00.531,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When you're going on first dates in New York City,

19
0:01:02.949,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you need to be able to express a wide range of emotions.

20
0:01:05.96,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:07.367,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Soon afterwards, she met Rich and fell in love.

22
0:01:10.583,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The relationship was everything she hoped it would be.

23
0:01:14.614,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Six months later,

24
0:01:15.902,000 --> 0:01:17,000
after a lovely weekend in New England,

25
0:01:18.401,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Rich made reservations at their favorite romantic restaurant.

26
0:01:22.877,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Kathy knew he was going to propose,

27
0:01:24.827,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and she could barely contain her excitement.

28
0:01:28.701,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night.

29
0:01:31.766,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He broke up with her.

30
0:01:33.639,000 --> 0:01:35,000
As deeply as he cared for Kathy -- and he did --

31
0:01:36.82,000 --> 0:01:37,000
he simply wasn't in love.

32
0:01:39.465,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Kathy was shattered.

33
0:01:41.433,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Her heart was truly broken, and she now faced yet another recovery.

34
0:01:46.959,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But five months after the breakup,

35
0:01:49.539,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Kathy still couldn't stop thinking about Rich.

36
0:01:52.758,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Her heart was still very much broken.

37
0:01:56.126,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The question is:

38
0:01:57.786,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Why?

39
0:01:59.244,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Why was this incredibly strong and determined woman

40
0:02:03.364,000 --> 0:02:05,000
unable to marshal the same emotional resources

41
0:02:06.296,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that got her through four years of cancer treatments?

42
0:02:10.619,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Why do so many of us flounder

43
0:02:12.922,000 --> 0:02:14,000
when we're trying to recover from heartbreak?

44
0:02:16.075,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Why do the same coping mechanisms

45
0:02:18.104,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that get us through all kinds of life challenges

46
0:02:21.252,000 --> 0:02:24,000
fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken?

47
0:02:25.886,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In over 20 years of private practice,

48
0:02:28.346,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I have seen people of every age and background

49
0:02:31.35,000 --> 0:02:33,000
face every manner of heartbreak,

50
0:02:33.999,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and what I've learned is this:

51
0:02:36.93,000 --> 0:02:38,000
when your heart is broken,

52
0:02:39.404,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the same instincts you ordinarily rely on

53
0:02:42.318,000 --> 0:02:46,000
will time and again lead you down the wrong path.

54
0:02:46.808,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you.

55
0:02:51.445,000 --> 0:02:53,000
For example, we know from studies of heartbroken people

56
0:02:54.349,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that having a clear understanding of why the relationship ended

57
0:02:57.799,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is really important for our ability to move on.

58
0:03:01.39,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Yet time and again,

59
0:03:03.031,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when we are offered a simple and honest explanation

60
0:03:06.412,000 --> 0:03:08,000
like the one Rich offered Kathy,

61
0:03:08.748,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we reject it.

62
0:03:10.78,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Heartbreak creates such dramatic emotional pain,

63
0:03:14.722,000 --> 0:03:17,000
our mind tells us the cause must be equally dramatic.

64
0:03:18.865,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And that gut instinct is so powerful,

65
0:03:21.345,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it can make even the most reasonable and measured of us

66
0:03:24.605,000 --> 0:03:27,000
come up with mysteries and conspiracy theories

67
0:03:28.028,000 --> 0:03:29,000
where none exist.

68
0:03:30.017,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Kathy became convinced something must have happened

69
0:03:32.815,000 --> 0:03:34,000
during her romantic getaway with Rich

70
0:03:34.946,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that soured him on the relationship,

71
0:03:36.892,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and she became obsessed with figuring out what that was.

72
0:03:40.445,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so she spent countless hours

73
0:03:42.358,000 --> 0:03:45,000
going through every minute of that weekend in her mind,

74
0:03:45.909,000 --> 0:03:48,000
searching her memory for clues that were not there.

75
0:03:50.333,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Kathy's mind tricked her into initiating this wild goose chase.

76
0:03:54.259,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But what compelled her to commit to it for so many months?

77
0:03:59.729,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Heartbreak is far more insidious than we realize.

78
0:04:03.577,000 --> 0:04:07,000
There is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another,

79
0:04:08.05,000 --> 0:04:1,000
even when we know it's going to make us feel worse.

80
0:04:11.813,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Brain studies have shown

81
0:04:13.466,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that the withdrawal of romantic love

82
0:04:15.983,000 --> 0:04:18,000
activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated

83
0:04:19.493,000 --> 0:04:24,000
when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids.

84
0:04:25.364,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Kathy was going through withdrawal.

85
0:04:27.938,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And since she could not have the heroin of actually being with Rich,

86
0:04:31.752,000 --> 0:04:35,000
her unconscious mind chose the methadone of her memories with him.

87
0:04:37.07,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Her instincts told her she was trying to solve a mystery,

88
0:04:40.012,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but what she was actually doing

89
0:04:41.966,000 --> 0:04:42,000
was getting her fix.

90
0:04:45.061,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is what makes heartbreak so difficult to heal.

91
0:04:49.417,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Addicts know they're addicted.

92
0:04:51.449,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They know when they're shooting up.

93
0:04:53.583,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But heartbroken people do not.

94
0:04:56.65,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But you do now.

95
0:04:58.587,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And if your heart is broken, you cannot ignore that.

96
0:05:02.649,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You have to recognize that, as compelling as the urge is,

97
0:05:06.49,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with every trip down memory lane, every text you send,

98
0:05:09.925,000 --> 0:05:12,000
every second you spend stalking your ex on social media,

99
0:05:13.432,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you are just feeding your addiction,

100
0:05:15.596,000 --> 0:05:16,000
deepening your emotional pain

101
0:05:17.41,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and complicating your recovery.

102
0:05:20.907,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey.

103
0:05:23.718,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's a fight, and your reason is your strongest weapon.

104
0:05:27.91,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There is no breakup explanation that's going to feel satisfying.

105
0:05:31.728,000 --> 0:05:33,000
No rationale can take away the pain you feel.

106
0:05:34.591,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So don't search for one, don't wait for one,

107
0:05:37.275,000 --> 0:05:4,000
just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself

108
0:05:40.348,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and then put the question to rest,

109
0:05:42.292,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because you need that closure to resist the addiction.

110
0:05:46.857,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And you need something else as well:

111
0:05:50.437,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you have to be willing to let go,

112
0:05:53.629,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to accept that it's over.

113
0:05:56.281,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Otherwise, your mind will feed on your hope

114
0:05:58.869,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and set you back.

115
0:06:01.543,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Hope can be incredibly destructive when your heart is broken.

116
0:06:07.278,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Heartbreak is a master manipulator.

117
0:06:10.305,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite

118
0:06:13.982,000 --> 0:06:15,000
of what we need in order to recover

119
0:06:16.032,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is remarkable.

120
0:06:17.908,000 --> 0:06:2,000
One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken

121
0:06:21.822,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is to idealize the person who broke it.

122
0:06:24.741,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We spend hours remembering their smile,

123
0:06:27.696,000 --> 0:06:29,000
how great they made us feel,

124
0:06:29.862,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that time we hiked up the mountain and made love under the stars.

125
0:06:34.909,000 --> 0:06:37,000
All that does is make our loss feel more painful.

126
0:06:38.937,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We know that.

127
0:06:40.217,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Yet we still allow our mind to cycle through one greatest hit after another,

128
0:06:45.139,000 --> 0:06:49,000
like we were being held hostage by our own passive-aggressive Spotify playlist.

129
0:06:49.761,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:54.022,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Heartbreak will make those thoughts pop into your mind.

131
0:06:57.096,000 --> 0:07:,000
And so to avoid idealizing, you have to balance them out

132
0:07:00.926,000 --> 0:07:03,000
by remembering their frown, not just their smile,

133
0:07:04.426,000 --> 0:07:06,000
how bad they made you feel,

134
0:07:06.567,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the fact that after the lovemaking, you got lost coming down the mountain,

135
0:07:10.253,000 --> 0:07:12,000
argued like crazy and didn't speak for two days.

136
0:07:14.417,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What I tell my patients is to compile an exhaustive list

137
0:07:18.672,000 --> 0:07:2,000
of all the ways the person was wrong for you,

138
0:07:21.093,000 --> 0:07:23,000
all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves,

139
0:07:23.605,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and then keep it on your phone.

140
0:07:25.997,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:27.496,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And once you have your list,

142
0:07:29.175,000 --> 0:07:3,000
you have to use it.

143
0:07:30.97,000 --> 0:07:32,000
When I hear even a hint of idealizing

144
0:07:33.613,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or the faintest whiff of nostalgia in a session,

145
0:07:36.73,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I go, "Phone, please."

146
0:07:38.738,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:41.098,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Your mind will try to tell you they were perfect.

148
0:07:43.64,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But they were not, and neither was the relationship.

149
0:07:46.379,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And if you want to get over them, you have to remind yourself of that,

150
0:07:50.24,000 --> 0:07:51,000
frequently.

151
0:07:52.361,000 --> 0:07:54,000
None of us is immune to heartbreak.

152
0:07:55.689,000 --> 0:08:,000
My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old senior executive in a software company.

153
0:08:01.208,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Five years after his wife died,

154
0:08:03.529,000 --> 0:08:05,000
he finally felt ready to start dating again.

155
0:08:06.654,000 --> 0:08:07,000
He soon met Sharon,

156
0:08:07.916,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and a whirlwind romance ensued.

157
0:08:10.469,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They introduced each other to their adult children after one month,

158
0:08:13.903,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and they moved in together after two.

159
0:08:16.865,000 --> 0:08:18,000
When middle-aged people date, they don't mess around.

160
0:08:20.405,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's like "Love, Actually" meets "The Fast and the Furious."

161
0:08:23.702,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:26.495,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Miguel was happier than he had been in years.

163
0:08:29.539,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But the night before their first anniversary,

164
0:08:32.317,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Sharon left him.

165
0:08:34.169,000 --> 0:08:37,000
She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children,

166
0:08:38.162,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and she didn't want a long-distance relationship.

167
0:08:41.404,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Miguel was totally blindsided and utterly devastated.

168
0:08:46.66,000 --> 0:08:48,000
He barely functioned at work for many, many months,

169
0:08:49.629,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and he almost lost his job as a result.

170
0:08:52.804,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Another consequence of heartbreak is that feeling alone and in pain

171
0:08:56.643,000 --> 0:08:59,000
can significantly impair our intellectual functioning,

172
0:08:59.722,000 --> 0:09:03,000
especially when performing complex tasks involving logic and reasoning.

173
0:09:04.518,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It temporarily lowers our IQ.

174
0:09:08.535,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But it wasn't just the intensity of Miguel's grief

175
0:09:11.766,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that confused his employers;

176
0:09:13.685,000 --> 0:09:14,000
it was the duration.

177
0:09:15.986,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Miguel was confused by this as well

178
0:09:18.29,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and really quite embarrassed by it.

179
0:09:20.519,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"What's wrong with me?" he asked me in our session.

180
0:09:23.14,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"What adult spends almost a year getting over a one-year relationship?"

181
0:09:27.804,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Actually, many do.

182
0:09:31.053,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks of traditional loss and grief:

183
0:09:36.068,000 --> 0:09:38,000
insomnia, intrusive thoughts,

184
0:09:38.536,000 --> 0:09:39,000
immune system dysfunction.

185
0:09:40.513,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression.

186
0:09:45.702,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury.

187
0:09:49.056,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It impacts us in a multitude of ways.

188
0:09:52.174,000 --> 0:09:54,000
For example, Sharon was both very social

189
0:09:55.405,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and very active.

190
0:09:56.811,000 --> 0:09:58,000
She had dinners at the house every week.

191
0:09:59.425,000 --> 0:10:02,000
She and Miguel went on camping trips with other couples.

192
0:10:02.468,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Although Miguel was not religious,

193
0:10:04.385,000 --> 0:10:06,000
he accompanied Sharon to church every Sunday,

194
0:10:06.587,000 --> 0:10:08,000
where he was welcomed into the congregation.

195
0:10:09.85,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend;

196
0:10:12.24,000 --> 0:10:14,000
he lost his entire social life,

197
0:10:15.025,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the supportive community of Sharon's church.

198
0:10:17.487,000 --> 0:10:19,000
He lost his identity as a couple.

199
0:10:20.575,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now, Miguel recognized the breakup had left this huge void in his life,

200
0:10:24.745,000 --> 0:10:26,000
but what he failed to recognize

201
0:10:27.53,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is that it left far more than just one.

202
0:10:30.67,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And that is crucial,

203
0:10:32.491,000 --> 0:10:36,000
not just because it explains why heartbreak could be so devastating,

204
0:10:37.5,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but because it tells us how to heal.

205
0:10:40.934,000 --> 0:10:42,000
To fix your broken heart,

206
0:10:43.103,000 --> 0:10:46,000
you have to identify these voids in your life and fill them,

207
0:10:46.986,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and I mean all of them.

208
0:10:48.587,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The voids in your identity:

209
0:10:50.34,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you have to reestablish who you are and what your life is about.

210
0:10:54.012,000 --> 0:10:55,000
The voids in your social life,

211
0:10:55.748,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the missing activities, even the empty spaces on the wall

212
0:10:58.848,000 --> 0:10:59,000
where pictures used to hang.

213
0:11:01.339,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But none of that will do any good

214
0:11:03.159,000 --> 0:11:06,000
unless you prevent the mistakes that can set you back,

215
0:11:06.43,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the unnecessary searches for explanations,

216
0:11:09.43,000 --> 0:11:13,000
idealizing your ex instead of focusing on how they were wrong for you,

217
0:11:13.661,000 --> 0:11:16,000
indulging thoughts and behaviors that still give them a starring role

218
0:11:17.506,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in this next chapter of your life

219
0:11:19.141,000 --> 0:11:2,000
when they shouldn't be an extra.

220
0:11:22.548,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Getting over heartbreak is hard,

221
0:11:24.891,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but if you refuse to be misled by your mind and you take steps to heal,

222
0:11:29.379,000 --> 0:11:31,000
you can significantly minimize your suffering.

223
0:11:32.078,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And it won't just be you who benefit from that.

224
0:11:34.522,000 --> 0:11:36,000
You'll be more present with your friends,

225
0:11:36.601,000 --> 0:11:38,000
more engaged with your family,

226
0:11:39.236,000 --> 0:11:42,000
not to mention the billions of dollars of compromised productivity

227
0:11:43.063,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in the workplace that could be avoided.

228
0:11:46.451,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So if you know someone who is heartbroken,

229
0:11:49.273,000 --> 0:11:5,000
have compassion,

230
0:11:50.856,000 --> 0:11:53,000
because social support has been found to be important for their recovery.

231
0:11:55.293,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And have patience,

232
0:11:57.082,000 --> 0:12:,000
because it's going to take them longer to move on than you think it should.

233
0:12:01.646,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And if you're hurting,

234
0:12:03.732,000 --> 0:12:04,000
know this:

235
0:12:05.335,000 --> 0:12:08,000
it's difficult, it is a battle within your own mind,

236
0:12:08.449,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and you have to be diligent to win.

237
0:12:10.673,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But you do have weapons.

238
0:12:12.502,000 --> 0:12:13,000
You can fight.

239
0:12:14.2,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And you will heal.

240
0:12:16.631,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Thank you.

241
0:12:17.844,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We've known about fusion since 1920,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and the British Association for the Advancement of Science

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
conjectured that that's why the sun shines.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I've always been very worried about resource.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I don't know about you, but

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
when my mother gave me food,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I always sorted the ones I disliked

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from the ones I liked.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I ate the disliked ones first,

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because the ones you like, you want to save.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And as a child you're always worried about resource.

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And once it was sort of explained to me

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
how fast we were using up the world's resources,

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I got very upset,

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
about as upset as I did when I realized

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that the Earth will only last about five billion years

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
before it's swallowed by the sun.

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Big events in my life,

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a strange child.

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The countries that make a lot of money out of energy

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
have something underneath them.

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country --

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
oil, gas, sorry.

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Gas, I'm probably the only person

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who really enjoys it when Mister Putin

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We're really dominated now

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.

35
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty

36
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
in the Third World, in the developing world,

37
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
we're using energy faster and faster.

38
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And those resources are going away.

39
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And the way we'll make energy in the future

40
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is not from resource,

41
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it's really from knowledge.

42
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
If you look 50 years into the future,

43
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the way we probably will be making energy

44
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is probably one of these three,

45
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
with some wind, with some other things,

46
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but these are going to be the base load energy drivers.

47
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar.

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the base load energy supply for the world.

50
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Fission.

51
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.

52
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations,

53
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and probably more after that.

54
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is.

55
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Because they know that that is one sure way

56
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to do carbon-free energy.

57
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is,

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the perfect energy source is one

59
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that doesn't take up much space,

60
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
has a virtually inexhaustible supply,

61
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere,

62
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste:

63
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
it's fusion.

64
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases.

65
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Fusion is very hard to do.

66
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We've been trying for 50 years.

67
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.

68
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.

69
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I was a strange child.

71
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason.

72
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.

73
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's a medium-sized nucleus.

74
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.

75
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.

76
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But small atoms want to join together,

77
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
small nuclei want to join together

78
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to make bigger ones to go towards iron.

79
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And you can get energy out this way.

80
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And indeed that's exactly what stars do.

81
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium

82
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and then helium together to make carbon,

83
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of

84
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
are made in the middle of stars.

85
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But it's a hard process to do

86
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,

87
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
almost by definition.

88
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And there is one reaction

89
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.

90
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:

91
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,

92
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which you can get from seawater,

93
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.

94
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.

95
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And you push them together and they repel.

96
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But when you get them close enough,

97
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
something called the strong force starts to act

98
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and pulls them together.

99
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, most of the time they repel.

100
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point

101
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the strong force grips them together.

102
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
For a moment they become helium 5,

103
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
because they've got five particles inside them.

104
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together

105
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
makes helium 5.

106
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out

107
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and lots of energy comes out.

108
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees,

109
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
things will be rattling around so fast

110
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that every time they collide in just the right configuration,

111
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
this will happen, and it will release energy.

112
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And that energy is what powers fusion.

113
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And it's this reaction that we want to do.

114
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
There is one trickiness about this reaction.

115
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,

116
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.

117
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's pretty hot.

118
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The trickiness about the reaction is that

119
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
tritium doesn't exist in nature.

120
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You have to make it from something else.

121
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,

122
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that's lithium 6, plus a neutron,

123
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
will give you more helium, plus tritium.

124
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And that's the way you make your tritium.

125
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,

126
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.

127
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, why the hell would we bother to do this?

128
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This is basically why we would bother to do it.

129
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
If you just plot how much fuel

130
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we've got left, in units of

131
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
present world consumption.

132
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And as you go across there you see

133
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way,

134
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is the lowest estimate of existing resources.

135
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.

136
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And as you go across there you will see

137
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years

138
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of fossil fuels left.

139
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,

140
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.

141
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And then we get to uranium.

142
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And with current reactor technology

143
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we really don't have very much uranium.

144
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water,

145
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which is the yellow line,

146
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to make conventional nuclear power stations

147
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
actually do very much for us.

148
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government

149
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,

150
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and do all those kind of things.

151
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology.

152
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.

153
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The big thing, on the right,

154
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is the lithium we have in the world.

155
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.

156
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.

157
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.

158
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Is it cost-competitive?

159
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We make estimates of what we think it would cost

160
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to actually make a fusion power plant.

161
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And we get within about the same price

162
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
as current electricity.

163
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So, how would we make it?

164
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees.

165
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And, in fact, we've done this.

166
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We hold it with a magnetic field.

167
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,

168
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
right in the middle is 150 million degrees.

169
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.

170
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And in fact we can make fusion happen.

171
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And just down the road, this is JET.

172
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.

173
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,

174
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?

175
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We can do fusion. In the center of this device

176
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.

177
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again

178
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and break all those records.

179
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.

180
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.

181
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.

182
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is the device we're building now.

183
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It gets very expensive to do this research.

184
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top

185
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?

186
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You can't. You have to do it in a very big device.

187
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
More than half the world's population is involved in building this device

188
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.

189
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Seven nations are involved in building this.

190
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.

191
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But that's not electricity yet.

192
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We have to get to this.

193
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We have to get to a power plant.

194
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We have to start putting electricity on the grid

195
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in this very complex technology.

196
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.

197
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.

198
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I wish this were different. We really need it now.

199
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We're going to have a problem with power

200
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in the next five years in this country.

201
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So 2030 looks like an infinity away.

202
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,

203
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
get fusion to happen.

204
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.

205
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But this is what we're aiming at,

206
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
sometime in the 2030s --

207
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.

208
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000

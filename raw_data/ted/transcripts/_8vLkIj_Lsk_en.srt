I was not one of those kids

3
0:00:13.476,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that knew exactly what they wanted to do when they were growing up.

4
0:00:16.673,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In the last 15 years of my career,

5
0:00:18.331,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I've been an English teacher, attorney, video game creator

6
0:00:21.129,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and now, a toilet paper salesman,

7
0:00:22.741,000 --> 0:00:24,000
selling millions of rolls of toilet paper a year.

0:00:28.428,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Life is about finding the intersection of what you really, really love

10
0:00:31.763,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with what you're really, really good at.

11
0:00:33.704,000 --> 0:00:35,000
As simple as it sounds, it's really not that easy to find.

12
0:00:36.57,000 --> 0:00:38,000
After a brief stint as an English teacher,

13
0:00:38.599,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I went to law school and ended up becoming an attorney

14
0:00:41.158,000 --> 0:00:42,000
at a big law firm here in New York City.

15
0:00:43.097,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Like most Americans, for the next two, three years,

16
0:00:45.522,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I was holding on to my job for dear life,

17
0:00:47.51,000 --> 0:00:5,000
working really late hours at a job that I thought maybe I was good at

18
0:00:50.842,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but certainly not one that I really loved.

19
0:00:52.875,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I then came upon the epiphany

20
0:00:54.302,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that it takes years if not tens of thousands of hours

21
0:00:57.152,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to get really good at something.

22
0:00:58.707,000 --> 0:01:,000
I really didn't have a lot of time to waste.

23
0:01:00.786,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This talk isn't for those looking to quit their job

24
0:01:03.232,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because they don't like their boss or they had a long day at work.

25
0:01:06.358,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is for those that are ready to make the completely scary leap

26
0:01:09.481,000 --> 0:01:1,000
into a brand-new career.

27
0:01:10.663,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So as you think about making a career change,

28
0:01:12.786,000 --> 0:01:13,000
here are a few tips I hope you consider

29
0:01:14.625,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and a few things I've picked up along the way.

30
0:01:16.802,000 --> 0:01:19,000
First, there's three things to think about before you're ready to move on.

31
0:01:20.307,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Number one: professional life is about learning.

32
0:01:22.622,000 --> 0:01:24,000
If you're not even interested in learning anymore,

33
0:01:24.98,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that's a huge red flag

34
0:01:26.155,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that there might not be a future for you in that industry.

35
0:01:28.908,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Number two: career changes are often gut-driven.

36
0:01:31.183,000 --> 0:01:32,000
If you constantly have sleepless nights

37
0:01:33.076,000 --> 0:01:35,000
where you're wide awake staring at the ceiling thinking,

38
0:01:35.726,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"Oh, man. I can't live with myself if I never try to make this change

39
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or if I don't even actually investigate it,"

40
0:01:41.084,000 --> 0:01:42,000
then trust your gut.

41
0:01:42.259,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It might be time for that career change.

42
0:01:44.195,000 --> 0:01:45,000
On the flip side,

43
0:01:45.37,000 --> 0:01:47,000
one reason to not move on is short-term pain.

44
0:01:47.5,000 --> 0:01:48,000
If you don't like your boss

45
0:01:48.812,000 --> 0:01:5,000
or people at the office are grating on you,

46
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that's actually not a good reason to absolutely change your career,

47
0:01:54.01,000 --> 0:01:55,000
because when you do change a career,

48
0:01:55.752,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you generally have to start from the bottom,

49
0:01:57.829,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and you'll probably feel a lot of short-term pain,

50
0:02:00.203,000 --> 0:02:02,000
whether it's through a lack of salary or lack of a title.

51
0:02:02.897,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Pain at any job is inevitable.

52
0:02:04.579,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So now you're convinced that it's time to change your career.

53
0:02:07.518,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Then there's three things to do immediately.

54
0:02:09.678,000 --> 0:02:11,000
First: network, network, network.

55
0:02:12.372,000 --> 0:02:14,000
No one ever builds a career without a good mentor

56
0:02:15.129,000 --> 0:02:16,000
or a good support network.

57
0:02:16.406,000 --> 0:02:18,000
What I mean by networking is getting all the great advice

58
0:02:19.252,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that you can possibly get.

59
0:02:20.632,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Technology has made it so simple to reach out to new people

60
0:02:23.461,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to say, "Hey, I'm thinking about making a career change.

61
0:02:26.131,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Do you have just five minutes to chat with me?"

62
0:02:28.354,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That passion and that hunger and that ability to be a sponge

63
0:02:31.372,000 --> 0:02:32,000
really attracts awesome mentors

64
0:02:32.892,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and people willing to give you their time

65
0:02:34.875,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to give you some good advice.

66
0:02:36.296,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So go out there and meet new people.

67
0:02:38.042,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The second thing you need to do immediately

68
0:02:40.083,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is shore up your finances.

69
0:02:41.592,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The reality is, when you change your career,

70
0:02:43.671,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you'll either start with a job with a lower title

71
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or lower pay or maybe even no pay,

72
0:02:48.232,000 --> 0:02:5,000
especially if you're starting your own business.

73
0:02:50.509,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So going out there and making sure your finances are in order

74
0:02:53.4,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to make the transition less painful

75
0:02:55.099,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is really, really important.

76
0:02:56.464,000 --> 0:02:59,000
For me personally, as I made the transition from being an attorney

77
0:02:59.602,000 --> 0:03:,000
over to a video game creator,

78
0:03:01.172,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I wanted to have at least six to 12 months of personal runway in the bank.

79
0:03:04.714,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Six to 12 months might not be the right number for you,

80
0:03:07.535,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but be honest with yourself on what that number should be.

81
0:03:10.287,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Number three, if you're not ready to make the full jump right at this moment,

82
0:03:14.731,000 --> 0:03:15,000
then get your side hustle on.

83
0:03:16.139,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Side hustles could be anything from volunteering with an organization

84
0:03:19.512,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that's in the new industry you want to go into,

85
0:03:21.733,000 --> 0:03:23,000
could be starting your business part-time on the weekends.

86
0:03:24.486,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's a free way to get a taste to see if you really love something.

87
0:03:27.722,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So you're ready to make the move

88
0:03:29.278,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or maybe you already made the move.

89
0:03:30.975,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Here are three things you should think about doing, right now.

90
0:03:33.907,000 --> 0:03:36,000
One: do not -- I repeat -- do not burn bridges.

91
0:03:37.262,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You spent years building those bridges,

92
0:03:39.144,000 --> 0:03:4,000
why burn them now?

93
0:03:40.318,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The world is such a small place,

94
0:03:41.982,000 --> 0:03:43,000
especially with all these online platforms,

95
0:03:44.006,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that, believe me, you will see these people again

96
0:03:46.562,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and probably in the most inopportune times.

97
0:03:48.942,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Number two: take stock of what you've learned

98
0:03:51.282,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in your previous career or careers.

99
0:03:53.122,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Most likely, a lot of those things are really applicable

100
0:03:55.766,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to your new job and your new career,

101
0:03:57.505,000 --> 0:04:,000
whether it's interacting with people, playing on a team

102
0:04:00.682,000 --> 0:04:02,000
or dealing with jerks and assholes.

103
0:04:02.882,000 --> 0:04:04,000
All those things are really universally applicable.

104
0:04:05.294,000 --> 0:04:07,000
You'll find jerks no matter what industry you're in;

105
0:04:07.754,000 --> 0:04:09,000
no one's immune to it, everyone's got to figure it out,

106
0:04:10.361,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and you probably know how to do it already.

107
0:04:12.391,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Lastly, when you start your new job, you're going to be nervous.

108
0:04:15.434,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But don't worry, take a deep breath,

109
0:04:17.456,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because this is what I want to tell you:

110
0:04:19.394,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you're part of a new team now,

111
0:04:20.858,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and everyone around you is rooting for your success,

112
0:04:23.822,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because your success is their success.

113
0:04:26.103,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So welcome to your new career.

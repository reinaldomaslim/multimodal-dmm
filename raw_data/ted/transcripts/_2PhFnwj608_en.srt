1
0:00:12.982,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As a child growing up in Nigeria,

2
0:00:15.657,000 --> 0:00:17,000
books sparked my earliest imagination,

3
0:00:19.088,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but films, films transported me

4
0:00:23.524,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to magical places with flying cars,

5
0:00:27.162,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to infinite space with whole universes of worlds to discover.

6
0:00:31.413,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And my journey of discovery has led to many places and possibilities,

7
0:00:34.896,000 --> 0:00:37,000
all linked with ideas and imagination.

8
0:00:39.213,000 --> 0:00:41,000
A decade and a half ago,

9
0:00:41.253,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I moved from working in law and technology in New York

10
0:00:44.352,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to financing, producing and distributing films

11
0:00:48.472,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in Nairobi, Lagos and Johannesburg.

12
0:00:52.677,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I've been privileged to see firsthand how in Africa,

13
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
film powerfully explores the marvelous and the mundane,

14
0:01:01.224,000 --> 0:01:05,000
how it conveys infinite possibilities and fundamental truths.

15
0:01:06.552,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Afrofuturist films like "Pumzi,"

16
0:01:09.115,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Wanuri Kahiu's superb sci-fi flick,

17
0:01:13.056,000 --> 0:01:17,000
paint brilliant pictures of Africa's future,

18
0:01:17.176,000 --> 0:01:19,000
while Rungano Nyoni's "I Am Not A Witch"

19
0:01:20.041,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and Akin Omotoso's "Vaya"

20
0:01:22.097,000 --> 0:01:24,000
show us and catalogue our present.

21
0:01:25.358,000 --> 0:01:3,000
These filmmakers offer nuanced snapshots of Africa's imagined and lived reality,

22
0:01:31.065,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in contrast to some of the images of Africa that come from outside,

23
0:01:35.493,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the perspectives that accompany all of these images,

24
0:01:38.788,000 --> 0:01:41,000
whether sympathetic or dismissive, shape or distort

25
0:01:43.383,000 --> 0:01:44,000
how people see Africa.

26
0:01:47.065,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And the truth is,

27
0:01:49.352,000 --> 0:01:51,000
many people think Africa is screwed up.

28
0:01:53.134,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Images play a big part of the reason why.

29
0:01:59.015,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Many tropes about Africa persist from pictures,

30
0:02:03.038,000 --> 0:02:06,000
pictures of famine in Ethiopia 30 years ago,

31
0:02:06.761,000 --> 0:02:09,000
pictures of the Biafran war half a century ago.

32
0:02:11.132,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But on a continent where the average age is 17,

33
0:02:16.434,000 --> 0:02:18,000
these tragic events seem almost prehistoric.

34
0:02:20.168,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Their images are far removed

35
0:02:22.818,000 --> 0:02:26,000
from how people in Africa's many countries see themselves and their neighbors.

36
0:02:28.021,000 --> 0:02:32,000
For them, these images do not represent their reality.

37
0:02:32.113,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So what is Africa's reality,

38
0:02:34.228,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or rather, which of Africa's many realities do we choose to focus on?

39
0:02:39.053,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Do we accept Emmanuel Macron's imagination of Africa in 2017

40
0:02:45.149,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as a place in which all women have seven or eight children?

41
0:02:50.807,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Or do we instead rely on the UN's account

42
0:02:54.062,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that only one of Africa's 54 countries has a fertility rate as high as seven?

43
0:02:59.843,000 --> 0:03:,000
Do we focus on the fact

44
0:03:01.61,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that infant mortality and life expectancy in Africa today

45
0:03:05.423,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is roughly comparable to the US a hundred years ago,

46
0:03:08.432,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or do we focus on progress,

47
0:03:11.011,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the fact that Africa has cut infant mortality in half

48
0:03:14.266,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in the last four decades

49
0:03:15.559,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and has raised life expectancy by 10 years since the year 2000?

50
0:03:21.556,000 --> 0:03:22,000
These dueling perspectives

51
0:03:25.327,000 --> 0:03:26,000
are all accurate.

52
0:03:26.517,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Well, aside from Macron's. He's just wrong.

53
0:03:28.827,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:30.716,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But one version makes it easy to dismiss Africa as hopeless,

55
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
while the other fuels hope that a billion people

56
0:03:38.558,000 --> 0:03:4,000
can continue to make progress towards prosperity.

57
0:03:43.609,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The fact that Africans

58
0:03:45.237,000 --> 0:03:48,000
do not have the luxury of turning their gaze elsewhere,

59
0:03:48.673,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the fact that we must make progress

60
0:03:51.188,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or live with the consequence of failure,

61
0:03:53.681,000 --> 0:03:56,000
are the reason we must continue to tell our own stories

62
0:03:56.737,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and show our own images,

63
0:03:58.571,000 --> 0:04:02,000
with honesty and primarily to an African audience,

64
0:04:02.652,000 --> 0:04:04,000
because the image that matters most

65
0:04:05.183,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is the image of Africa in African imaginations.

66
0:04:11.931,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, honesty requires that we acknowledge

67
0:04:14.654,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that Africa is behind the rest of the world

68
0:04:16.694,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and needs to move swiftly to catch up.

69
0:04:20.044,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But thinking of a way forward,

70
0:04:21.99,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I'd like us to engage in a thought exercise.

71
0:04:25.37,000 --> 0:04:26,000
What if we could go back a hundred years,

72
0:04:27.363,000 --> 0:04:29,000
say to the US in 1917,

73
0:04:29.949,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but we could take with us all the modern ideas,

74
0:04:33.549,000 --> 0:04:35,000
innovations, inventions that we have today?

75
0:04:37.557,000 --> 0:04:39,000
What could we achieve with this knowledge?

76
0:04:40.161,000 --> 0:04:44,000
How richly could we improve quality of life and living conditions for people?

77
0:04:46.355,000 --> 0:04:48,000
How widely could we spread prosperity?

78
0:04:50.594,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Imagine if a hundred years ago,

79
0:04:52.532,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the education system had all the knowledge we have today,

80
0:04:55.769,000 --> 0:04:56,000
including how best to teach.

81
0:04:58.778,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And doctors and scientists knew all we do

82
0:05:01.925,000 --> 0:05:04,000
about public health measures, surgery techniques,

83
0:05:05.941,000 --> 0:05:08,000
DNA sequencing, cancer research and treatment?

84
0:05:09.01,000 --> 0:05:12,000
If we had access then to modern semiconductors,

85
0:05:12.828,000 --> 0:05:14,000
computers, mobile devices, the internet?

86
0:05:16.151,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Just imagine.

87
0:05:17.802,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If we did, we could take a quantum leap forward, couldn't we.

88
0:05:22.532,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Well, Africa can take a leap of that magnitude today.

89
0:05:27.1,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There's enough untapped innovation

90
0:05:30.187,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to move Africa a century forward in living conditions

91
0:05:34.339,000 --> 0:05:36,000
if the will and commitment is there.

92
0:05:37.58,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is not just a possibility; it's an imperative for Africa's future,

93
0:05:42.375,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a future that will see Africa's population double

94
0:05:46.003,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to two and a half billion people in just three decades,

95
0:05:49.681,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a future that will see Africa have the world's largest workforce,

96
0:05:55.019,000 --> 0:05:59,000
just as the idea of work itself is being radically reconsidered.

97
0:06:00.467,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now taking the leap forward isn't that far-fetched.

98
0:06:03.131,000 --> 0:06:05,000
There are tons of examples that demonstrate the potential

99
0:06:06.118,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for change in Africa.

100
0:06:09.044,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Just 20 years ago,

101
0:06:11.782,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Nigeria had fewer than half a million working phone lines.

102
0:06:14.949,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Today it has a hundred million mobile phone subscriptions,

103
0:06:18.045,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and this mobile miracle is mirrored in every African country.

104
0:06:21.999,000 --> 0:06:25,000
There are over three quarters of a billion mobile phones in use in Africa today,

105
0:06:26.717,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and this has spurred justified excitement about leapfrogging,

106
0:06:30.623,000 --> 0:06:33,000
about bringing the sharing economy, artificial intelligence,

107
0:06:34.591,000 --> 0:06:36,000
autonomous machines to Africa.

108
0:06:38.686,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And this is all promising,

109
0:06:40.655,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but we need to think about sequencing.

110
0:06:44.504,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Forget putting the cart before the horse.

111
0:06:47.217,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You can't put the self-driving car before the roads.

112
0:06:51.502,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

113
0:06:56.677,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's a whole infrastructural and logical layer to innovation

114
0:07:00.13,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that we take for granted,

115
0:07:02.448,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but we have to triage for Africa,

116
0:07:05.046,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because some of the biggest infrastructure gaps

117
0:07:08.3,000 --> 0:07:09,000
are for things that are so basic

118
0:07:09.912,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that Westerners rarely have to think about them.

119
0:07:13.772,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So let's explore this.

120
0:07:18.008,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Imagine your internet access went off for a day,

121
0:07:23.158,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and when it came back,

122
0:07:25.183,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it only stayed on for three hours at a time,

123
0:07:27.493,000 --> 0:07:29,000
with random 15-hour outages?

124
0:07:31.027,000 --> 0:07:32,000
How would your life change?

125
0:07:33.773,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now replace internet access with electricity.

126
0:07:38.363,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Think of your fridges, your TVs, your microwaves,

127
0:07:40.935,000 --> 0:07:41,000
just sitting idly for days.

128
0:07:43.389,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now extend this nightmare to government offices,

129
0:07:47.221,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to businesses, to schools,

130
0:07:50.896,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to hospitals.

131
0:07:54.991,000 --> 0:07:56,000
This, or worse,

132
0:07:57.555,000 --> 0:08:,000
is the type of access that hundreds of millions of Africans

133
0:08:00.782,000 --> 0:08:01,000
have to electricity,

134
0:08:03.372,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and to water,

135
0:08:05.687,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and to healthcare,

136
0:08:07.769,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and to sanitation,

137
0:08:09.748,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and to education.

138
0:08:12.183,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We must fix this.

139
0:08:14.789,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We must fix this because ensuring widespread and affordable access

140
0:08:18.804,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to decent infrastructure and services

141
0:08:21.798,000 --> 0:08:22,000
isn't just low-hanging fruit:

142
0:08:24.183,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it's fundamental to achieving the hundred-year leap.

143
0:08:28.673,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And when we fix it,

144
0:08:30.563,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we might find some unexpected benefits.

145
0:08:35.093,000 --> 0:08:38,000
One unexpected benefit of the mobile miracle

146
0:08:38.863,000 --> 0:08:42,000
was that it led to what is perhaps the greatest cultural resurgence

147
0:08:43.03,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that Africa has seen in a generation:

148
0:08:45.522,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the rebirth of African popular music.

149
0:08:49.162,000 --> 0:08:52,000
For musicians like P-Square,

150
0:08:53.098,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Bongo Maffin

151
0:08:55.764,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and Wizkid,

152
0:08:57.134,000 --> 0:09:,000
mobile phones paved the path to local dominance

153
0:09:00.873,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and global stardom.

154
0:09:04.634,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And the impact isn't limited just to music.

155
0:09:08.128,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It extends to film, too.

156
0:09:10.226,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Beautiful, engaging films

157
0:09:12.838,000 --> 0:09:14,000
like these stills of "Pumzi,"

158
0:09:15.259,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"Vaya," and "I Am Not A Witch" show.

159
0:09:19.515,000 --> 0:09:22,000
For while its external image might be dated,

160
0:09:22.949,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Africa continues to evolve, as does African film.

161
0:09:26.92,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now, every now and again, the rest of the world catches on,

162
0:09:30.642,000 --> 0:09:34,000
perhaps with Djo Munga's hard-hitting "Viva Riva!"

163
0:09:34.976,000 --> 0:09:36,000
with Newton Aduaka's intense "Ezra,"

164
0:09:37.719,000 --> 0:09:39,000
or with Abderrahmane Sissako's poetic "Timbuktu."

165
0:09:41.14,000 --> 0:09:45,000
With mobile, Africans are discovering more and more of these films,

166
0:09:45.496,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and what that means is that it really matters less in Kinshasa or Cotonou

167
0:09:50.826,000 --> 0:09:52,000
what Cannes thinks of African film,

168
0:09:53.518,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or if those opinions are informed or fair.

169
0:09:58.113,000 --> 0:10:,000
Who really cares what the "New York Times" thinks?

170
0:10:01.565,000 --> 0:10:05,000
What matters is that Africans are validating African art and ideas,

171
0:10:06.225,000 --> 0:10:08,000
both critically and commercially,

172
0:10:08.591,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that they are watching what they want,

173
0:10:10.623,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and that African filmmakers are connecting with their core audiences.

174
0:10:15.881,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And this is important.

175
0:10:18.48,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's important because film can illuminate and inspire.

176
0:10:22.59,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Film can bring visions of the future to us here in the present.

177
0:10:26.8,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Films can serve as a conveyor belt for hope.

178
0:10:30.953,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And film can change perspectives faster than we can build roads.

179
0:10:36.171,000 --> 0:10:37,000
In just over a decade,

180
0:10:38.165,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Nigeria's film industry, Africa's largest,

181
0:10:40.959,000 --> 0:10:44,000
has taken the country's words and languages

182
0:10:45.897,000 --> 0:10:48,000
into the vocabulary and imaginations of millions

183
0:10:49.747,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in many other African countries.

184
0:10:52.099,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It has torn down borders,

185
0:10:54.108,000 --> 0:10:56,000
perhaps in the most effective way since the Berlin Conference

186
0:10:57.01,000 --> 0:11:,000
sowed linguistic and geographic division across Africa.

187
0:11:00.572,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Film does speak a universal language,

188
0:11:03.12,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and boy, Nigerian film speaks it loudly.

189
0:11:06.845,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Making Africa's hundred-year leap

190
0:11:09.044,000 --> 0:11:12,000
will require that Africans summon the creativity to generate ideas

191
0:11:13.916,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and find the openness to accept and adapt ideas from anywhere else in the world

192
0:11:18.424,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to solve our pervasive problems.

193
0:11:21.121,000 --> 0:11:22,000
With focus on investment,

194
0:11:23.098,000 --> 0:11:26,000
films can help drive that change in Africa's people,

195
0:11:26.479,000 --> 0:11:29,000
a change that is necessary to make the hundred-year leap,

196
0:11:29.607,000 --> 0:11:32,000
a change that will help create a prosperous Africa,

197
0:11:33.265,000 --> 0:11:35,000
an Africa that is dramatically better than it is today.

198
0:11:37.609,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Thank you.

199
0:11:38.784,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Asante sana.

200
0:11:39.959,000 --> 0:11:42,000

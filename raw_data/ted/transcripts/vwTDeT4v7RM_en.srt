2
0:00:16.69,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Good evening.

3
0:00:17.734,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We are in this wonderful

4
0:00:19.669,000 --> 0:00:2,000
open-air amphitheater

5
0:00:21.549,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and we are enjoying ourselves

6
0:00:23.303,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in that mild evening

7
0:00:25.005,000 --> 0:00:26,000
temperature tonight,

8
0:00:26.293,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but when Qatar will host

9
0:00:30.61,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the football World Cup

10
0:00:32.152,000 --> 0:00:33,000
10 years from now,

11
0:00:33.997,000 --> 0:00:34,000
2022,

12
0:00:35.469,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we already heard it will be

13
0:00:36.701,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in the hot, very hot and sunny

14
0:00:40.349,000 --> 0:00:42,000
summer months of June and July.

15
0:00:42.693,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And when Qatar has been assigned

16
0:00:45.006,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to the World Cup all, many

17
0:00:46.637,000 --> 0:00:47,000
people around the world have been

18
0:00:48.538,000 --> 0:00:49,000
wondering, how would it be

19
0:00:49.889,000 --> 0:00:51,000
possible that football players

20
0:00:52.112,000 --> 0:00:54,000
show spectacular football,

21
0:00:54.273,000 --> 0:00:55,000
run around in this desert

22
0:00:55.478,000 --> 0:00:56,000
climate? How would it be

23
0:00:57.009,000 --> 0:00:59,000
possible that spectators sit,

24
0:00:59.904,000 --> 0:01:01,000
enjoy themselves in open-air

25
0:01:02.896,000 --> 0:01:05,000
stadia in this hot environment?

26
0:01:06.105,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Together with the architects of

27
0:01:07.746,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Albert Speer & Partner, our engineers

28
0:01:09.688,000 --> 0:01:1,000
from Transsolar have been

29
0:01:11.544,000 --> 0:01:12,000
supporting, have been developing

30
0:01:13.328,000 --> 0:01:16,000
open-air stadia based on 100 percent

31
0:01:16.991,000 --> 0:01:2,000
solar power, on 100 percent solar cooling.

32
0:01:21.425,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Let me tell you about that,

33
0:01:22.832,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but let me start with comfort.

34
0:01:24.496,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Let me start with the aspect

35
0:01:25.807,000 --> 0:01:26,000
of comfort, because many people

36
0:01:27.513,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are confusing

37
0:01:30.535,000 --> 0:01:32,000
ambient temperature

38
0:01:32.689,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with thermal comfort.

39
0:01:34.417,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We are used to looking at charts like

40
0:01:35.945,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that, and you see this red line

41
0:01:37.936,000 --> 0:01:38,000
showing the air temperature

42
0:01:39.288,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in June and July, and yes, that's right,

43
0:01:40.77,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it's picking up to 45 degrees C.

44
0:01:43.041,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's actually very hot.

45
0:01:45.881,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But air temperature is not

46
0:01:48.4,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the full set of climatic

47
0:01:50.001,000 --> 0:01:52,000
parameters which define comfort.

48
0:01:52.414,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Let me show you analysis

49
0:01:54.305,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a colleague of mine did looking

50
0:01:57.833,000 --> 0:01:59,000
on different football, World Cups,

51
0:02:00.409,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Olympic Games around the world,

52
0:02:02.321,000 --> 0:02:03,000
looking on the comfort

53
0:02:03.617,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and analyzing the comfort

54
0:02:05.048,000 --> 0:02:07,000
people have perceived at these

55
0:02:07.848,000 --> 0:02:08,000
different sport activities,

56
0:02:09.552,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and let me start with Mexico.

57
0:02:11.401,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Mexico temperature has been, air

58
0:02:12.97,000 --> 0:02:13,000
temperature has been something between

59
0:02:14.674,000 --> 0:02:17,000
15, up to 30 degrees C, and people

60
0:02:17.721,000 --> 0:02:18,000
enjoyed themselves.

61
0:02:19.497,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It was a very comfortable game

62
0:02:21.369,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in Mexico City. Have a look.

63
0:02:23.664,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Orlando, same kind of stadium,

64
0:02:26.097,000 --> 0:02:28,000
open-air stadium. People have

65
0:02:28.658,000 --> 0:02:3,000
been sitting in the strong sun,

66
0:02:31.402,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in the very high humidity

67
0:02:33.249,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in the afternoon, and they

68
0:02:34.364,000 --> 0:02:35,000
did not enjoy. It was not comfortable.

69
0:02:36.17,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The air temperature was not too high, but it was not

70
0:02:38.137,000 --> 0:02:4,000
comfortable during these games.

71
0:02:40.985,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What about Seoul? Seoul, because

72
0:02:42.68,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of broadcast rights, all the

73
0:02:45.112,000 --> 0:02:46,000
games have been in the late

74
0:02:46.417,000 --> 0:02:47,000
afternoon. Sun has already been

75
0:02:47.944,000 --> 0:02:49,000
set, so the games have been

76
0:02:50.337,000 --> 0:02:52,000
perceived as comfortable.

77
0:02:52.897,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What about Athens? Mediterranean

78
0:02:55.761,000 --> 0:02:57,000
climate, but in the sun it was

79
0:02:58.05,000 --> 0:03:,000
not comfortable. They didn't perceive comfort.

80
0:03:00.776,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And we know that from Spain,

81
0:03:02.417,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we know that "sol y sombra."

82
0:03:04.929,000 --> 0:03:06,000
If you have a ticket, and you

83
0:03:07.097,000 --> 0:03:08,000
get a ticket for the shade,

84
0:03:08.809,000 --> 0:03:1,000
you pay more, because you're

85
0:03:11.017,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in a more comfortable environment.

86
0:03:14.778,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What about Beijing?

87
0:03:16.057,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It's again, sun in the day

88
0:03:18.721,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and high humidity,

89
0:03:20.449,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and it was not comfortable.

90
0:03:21.712,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So if I overlay, and if you

91
0:03:22.992,000 --> 0:03:23,000
overlay all these comfort

92
0:03:24.681,000 --> 0:03:25,000
envelopes, what we see is,

93
0:03:26.6,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in all these places, air temperature has

94
0:03:28.856,000 --> 0:03:31,000
been ranging something from 25

95
0:03:32.69,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to 35, and if you go on

96
0:03:34.594,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the line, 30, of 30 degrees C

97
0:03:37.353,000 --> 0:03:38,000
ambient temperatures. If you

98
0:03:38.802,000 --> 0:03:39,000
go along that line you see

99
0:03:40.455,000 --> 0:03:42,000
there has been all kind of

100
0:03:42.976,000 --> 0:03:44,000
comfort, all kinds of perceived

101
0:03:45.209,000 --> 0:03:46,000
outdoor comfort, ranging from

102
0:03:47.018,000 --> 0:03:48,000
very comfortable

103
0:03:48.203,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to very uncomfortable.

104
0:03:50.074,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So why is that?

105
0:03:52.923,000 --> 0:03:53,000
This is because there are

106
0:03:54.619,000 --> 0:03:56,000
more parameters influencing

107
0:03:56.706,000 --> 0:03:57,000
our thermal comfort, which is

108
0:03:58.612,000 --> 0:04:,000
the sun, the direct sun,

109
0:04:01.005,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the diffuse sun, which is wind,

110
0:04:03.493,000 --> 0:04:05,000
strong wind, mild wind, which is

111
0:04:06.181,000 --> 0:04:08,000
air humidity, which is

112
0:04:08.467,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the radiant temperature of the

113
0:04:10.696,000 --> 0:04:12,000
surroundings where we are in.

114
0:04:12.803,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And this is air temperature.

115
0:04:14.484,000 --> 0:04:14,000
All these parameters go into

116
0:04:15.463,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the comfort feeling of our

117
0:04:17.517,000 --> 0:04:18,000
human body, and scientists

118
0:04:19.15,000 --> 0:04:21,000
have developed a parameter,

119
0:04:21.503,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which is the perceived

120
0:04:23.006,000 --> 0:04:25,000
temperature, where all these

121
0:04:25.131,000 --> 0:04:27,000
parameters go in and help

122
0:04:27.387,000 --> 0:04:29,000
designers to understand

123
0:04:30.294,000 --> 0:04:32,000
which is the driving parameter

124
0:04:32.428,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that I feel comfort or that

125
0:04:34.06,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I don't feel comfort.

126
0:04:35.539,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Which is the driving parameter

127
0:04:37.172,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which gives me a perceived

128
0:04:38.524,000 --> 0:04:4,000
temperature? And these parameters,

129
0:04:41.184,000 --> 0:04:42,000
these climatic parameters are

130
0:04:42.852,000 --> 0:04:46,000
related to the human metabolism.

131
0:04:47.012,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Because of our metabolism,

132
0:04:49.251,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we as human beings,

133
0:04:51.204,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we produce heat.

134
0:04:52.844,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I'm excited, I'm talking to you,

135
0:04:54.359,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I'm probably producing

136
0:04:56.005,000 --> 0:04:57,000
150 watts

137
0:04:57.116,000 --> 0:04:58,000
at the moment. You are sitting,

138
0:04:58.452,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you are relaxed, you're looking

139
0:05:00.14,000 --> 0:05:01,000
at me. It's probably 100

140
0:05:01.487,000 --> 0:05:02,000
watts each person is producing,

141
0:05:03.421,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and we need to get rid of that

142
0:05:05.42,000 --> 0:05:06,000
energy. I need, with my body,

143
0:05:07.171,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to get rid of the energy, and

144
0:05:08.673,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the harder it is for myself,

145
0:05:10.644,000 --> 0:05:12,000
for my body, to get rid of the

146
0:05:12.724,000 --> 0:05:14,000
energy, the less comfort I feel.

147
0:05:14.963,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That's it. And if I don't

148
0:05:17.279,000 --> 0:05:18,000
get rid of the energy,

149
0:05:18.421,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I will die.

150
0:05:19.86,000 --> 0:05:23,000
If we overlay what happens

151
0:05:24.212,000 --> 0:05:26,000
during the football World Cup,

152
0:05:26.46,000 --> 0:05:27,000
what will happen in June, July,

153
0:05:28.229,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we will see, yes, air

154
0:05:29.156,000 --> 0:05:3,000
temperature will be much higher,

155
0:05:31.036,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but because the games and

156
0:05:32.692,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the plays will be in the afternoon,

157
0:05:35.212,000 --> 0:05:36,000
it's probably the same comfort

158
0:05:37.045,000 --> 0:05:38,000
rating we've found in other

159
0:05:38.692,000 --> 0:05:39,000
places which has perceived

160
0:05:40.188,000 --> 0:05:41,000
as non-comfortable.

161
0:05:41.899,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So we sat together with a team

162
0:05:44.043,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which prepared the Bid Book, or goal,

163
0:05:46.373,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that we said, let's aim

164
0:05:49.148,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for perceived temperature,

165
0:05:51.107,000 --> 0:05:53,000
for outdoor comfort in this range,

166
0:05:53.75,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which is perceived with a

167
0:05:55.421,000 --> 0:05:58,000
temperature of 32 degrees

168
0:05:58.624,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Celsius perceived temperature,

169
0:06:00.245,000 --> 0:06:02,000
which is extremely comfortable.

170
0:06:02.405,000 --> 0:06:04,000
People would feel really fine

171
0:06:04.998,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in an open outdoor environment.

172
0:06:06.892,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But what does it mean?

173
0:06:08.851,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If we just look on what happens,

174
0:06:10.9,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we see, temperature's too high.

175
0:06:13.011,000 --> 0:06:15,000
If we apply the best architectural design,

176
0:06:15.804,000 --> 0:06:16,000
climate engineering design,

177
0:06:17.268,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we won't get much better.

178
0:06:19.371,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So we need to do something active.

179
0:06:22.092,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We need, for instance, to bring

180
0:06:23.962,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in radiant cooling technology,

181
0:06:26.058,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and we need to combine this

182
0:06:27.947,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with so-called soft conditioning.

183
0:06:30.164,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And how does it look like in a stadium?

184
0:06:31.6,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So the stadium has a few

185
0:06:33.928,000 --> 0:06:34,000
elements which create that

186
0:06:35.673,000 --> 0:06:36,000
outdoor comfort. First of all,

187
0:06:36.915,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it's shading. It needs

188
0:06:39.151,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to protect where the people

189
0:06:41.465,000 --> 0:06:42,000
are sitting against strong

190
0:06:43.129,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and warm wind.

191
0:06:44.328,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But that's not all what we need

192
0:06:45.967,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to do. We need to use

193
0:06:48.978,000 --> 0:06:5,000
active systems.

194
0:06:51.147,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Instead of blowing a hurricane

195
0:06:53.587,000 --> 0:06:55,000
of chilled air through the stadium,

196
0:06:55.962,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we can use radiant

197
0:06:57.71,000 --> 0:06:59,000
cooling technologies, like a

198
0:06:59.744,000 --> 0:07:01,000
floor heating system where water

199
0:07:01.944,000 --> 0:07:03,000
pipes are embedded in the floor.

200
0:07:04.327,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And just by using cold water

201
0:07:06.145,000 --> 0:07:07,000
going through the water pipes,

202
0:07:07.473,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you can release the heat

203
0:07:09.129,000 --> 0:07:11,000
which is absorbed during the day

204
0:07:11.209,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in the stadium, so you can

205
0:07:12.446,000 --> 0:07:13,000
create that comfort, and then by

206
0:07:14.329,000 --> 0:07:16,000
adding dry air instead of

207
0:07:16.889,000 --> 0:07:18,000
down-chilled air, the spectators

208
0:07:19.121,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and the football players can

209
0:07:21.003,000 --> 0:07:23,000
adjust to their individual

210
0:07:23.336,000 --> 0:07:24,000
comfort needs, to their

211
0:07:25.113,000 --> 0:07:26,000
individual energy balance.

212
0:07:26.769,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They can adjust and find

213
0:07:28.746,000 --> 0:07:3,000
their comfort they need to find.

214
0:07:31.121,000 --> 0:07:35,000
There are 12 stadia probably

215
0:07:35.577,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to come, but there are

216
0:07:37.537,000 --> 0:07:39,000
32 training pitches where

217
0:07:39.856,000 --> 0:07:4,000
all the individual countries

218
0:07:41.553,000 --> 0:07:42,000
are going to train.

219
0:07:42.737,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We applied the same concept:

220
0:07:44.634,000 --> 0:07:46,000
shading of the training pitch,

221
0:07:46.864,000 --> 0:07:48,000
using a shelter against wind,

222
0:07:49.704,000 --> 0:07:5,000
then using the grass.

223
0:07:51.593,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Natural-watered lawn is a

224
0:07:54.113,000 --> 0:07:55,000
very good cooling source

225
0:07:55.592,000 --> 0:07:56,000
stabilizing temperature,

226
0:07:56.809,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and using dehumidified air to

227
0:07:58.745,000 --> 0:07:59,000
create comfort.

228
0:07:59.824,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But even the best passive design

229
0:08:03.698,000 --> 0:08:03,000
wouldn't help.

230
0:08:04.444,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We need active system.

231
0:08:05.454,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And how do we do that?

232
0:08:06.504,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Our idea for the bid was

233
0:08:08.872,000 --> 0:08:09,000
100 percent solar cooling,

234
0:08:10.609,000 --> 0:08:12,000
based on the idea that we use

235
0:08:12.704,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the roof of the stadia,

236
0:08:14.344,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we cover the roofs of the stadia

237
0:08:16.287,000 --> 0:08:17,000
with PV systems.

238
0:08:17.879,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We don't borrow any energy

239
0:08:20.439,000 --> 0:08:21,000
from history.

240
0:08:21.863,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We are not using fossil energies.

241
0:08:23.656,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We are not borrowing energy

242
0:08:25.472,000 --> 0:08:26,000
from our neighbors.

243
0:08:26.528,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We're using energy we can harvest

244
0:08:28.648,000 --> 0:08:3,000
on our roofs, and also on the

245
0:08:31.408,000 --> 0:08:33,000
training pitches, which will be

246
0:08:33.495,000 --> 0:08:35,000
covered with large, flexible

247
0:08:36.167,000 --> 0:08:37,000
membranes, and we will see

248
0:08:37.88,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in the next years an industry

249
0:08:39.584,000 --> 0:08:4,000
coming up with flexible

250
0:08:40.767,000 --> 0:08:41,000
photovoltaics, giving

251
0:08:42.392,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the possibilities of shading

252
0:08:44.169,000 --> 0:08:45,000
against strong sun and producing

253
0:08:45.849,000 --> 0:08:47,000
electric energy in the same time.

254
0:08:48.344,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And this energy now is

255
0:08:50.055,000 --> 0:08:51,000
harvested throughout the year,

256
0:08:51.687,000 --> 0:08:52,000
sent into the grid,

257
0:08:53.255,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is replacing fossils

258
0:08:55.24,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in the grid, and when I need it

259
0:08:57.391,000 --> 0:08:59,000
for the cooling, I take it

260
0:09:00.288,000 --> 0:09:01,000
back from the grid and I

261
0:09:02.105,000 --> 0:09:04,000
use the solar energy

262
0:09:04.472,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which I have brought to the grid

263
0:09:06.544,000 --> 0:09:07,000
back when I need

264
0:09:07.832,000 --> 0:09:07,000
it for the solar cooling.

265
0:09:08.664,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I can do that in the first

266
0:09:10.087,000 --> 0:09:11,000
year and I can balance that

267
0:09:11.135,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in the next 10, and the next

268
0:09:12.439,000 --> 0:09:13,000
20 years, this energy,

269
0:09:14.304,000 --> 0:09:16,000
which is necessary to condition

270
0:09:16.927,000 --> 0:09:17,000
a World Cup in Qatar,

271
0:09:18.626,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the next 20 years, this energy

272
0:09:20.585,000 --> 0:09:22,000
goes into the grid of Qatar.

273
0:09:23.166,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So this -- (Applause)

274
0:09:24.379,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

275
0:09:25.483,000 --> 0:09:27,000
This is not only useful

276
0:09:28.164,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for stadia. We can use that also

277
0:09:30.139,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in open-air places and streets,

278
0:09:32.548,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and we've been working on

279
0:09:33.731,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the City of the Future

280
0:09:35.1,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in Masdar, which is in the

281
0:09:36.487,000 --> 0:09:37,000
United Emirates, Abu Dhabi.

282
0:09:37.747,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And I had the pleasure to work

283
0:09:39.459,000 --> 0:09:4,000
on the central plaza.

284
0:09:40.763,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And the same idea to use there,

285
0:09:42.898,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to create outdoor conditions

286
0:09:44.604,000 --> 0:09:45,000
which are perceived

287
0:09:45.755,000 --> 0:09:46,000
as comfortable. People enjoy

288
0:09:47.011,000 --> 0:09:49,000
going there instead of going

289
0:09:49.211,000 --> 0:09:5,000
into a shopping mall, which is

290
0:09:50.98,000 --> 0:09:51,000
chilled down and which is

291
0:09:52.164,000 --> 0:09:54,000
cooled. We wanted to create

292
0:09:54.243,000 --> 0:09:55,000
an outdoor space

293
0:09:55.78,000 --> 0:09:56,000
which is so comfortable that

294
0:09:57.747,000 --> 0:09:58,000
people can go there in the

295
0:09:59.324,000 --> 0:10:01,000
early afternoon, even in these

296
0:10:01.448,000 --> 0:10:02,000
sunny and hot summer months,

297
0:10:03.44,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and they can enjoy and meet there

298
0:10:04.786,000 --> 0:10:05,000
with their families. (Applause)

299
0:10:06.592,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And the same concept:

300
0:10:07.939,000 --> 0:10:08,000
shade against the sun,

301
0:10:09.376,000 --> 0:10:1,000
shade against the wind,

302
0:10:10.647,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and use, use and take advantage

303
0:10:14.471,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of the sun you can harvest

304
0:10:17.184,000 --> 0:10:18,000
on your footprint.

305
0:10:18.279,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And these beautiful umbrellas.

306
0:10:20.288,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So I'd like to encourage you

307
0:10:24.576,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to pay attention to your

308
0:10:26.944,000 --> 0:10:27,000
thermal comfort, to your

309
0:10:28.608,000 --> 0:10:29,000
thermal environment,

310
0:10:29.655,000 --> 0:10:31,000
tonight and tomorrow,

311
0:10:32.344,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and if you'd like to learn more

312
0:10:34.151,000 --> 0:10:35,000
about that, I invite you

313
0:10:35.273,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to go to our website.

314
0:10:36.552,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We uploaded a very simple

315
0:10:38.696,000 --> 0:10:4,000
perceived temperature calculator

316
0:10:40.808,000 --> 0:10:4,000
where you can check out

317
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:42,000
about your outdoor comfort.

318
0:10:43.215,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And I also hope that you

319
0:10:46.687,000 --> 0:10:47,000
share the idea that

320
0:10:48.009,000 --> 0:10:5,000
if engineers and designers

321
0:10:50.015,000 --> 0:10:51,000
can use all these different

322
0:10:51.527,000 --> 0:10:52,000
climatic parameters,

323
0:10:53.488,000 --> 0:10:56,000
it will be possible to create

324
0:10:56.495,000 --> 0:10:59,000
really good and comfortable

325
0:10:59.584,000 --> 0:11:,000
outdoor conditions,

326
0:11:00.864,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to change our thermal perception

327
0:11:03.993,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that we feel comfortable

328
0:11:05.871,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in an outdoor environment,

329
0:11:07.959,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and we can do that

330
0:11:10.351,000 --> 0:11:11,000
with the best passive design,

331
0:11:12.215,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but also using the energy source

332
0:11:15.391,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of the site in Qatar which is

333
0:11:18.375,000 --> 0:11:18,000

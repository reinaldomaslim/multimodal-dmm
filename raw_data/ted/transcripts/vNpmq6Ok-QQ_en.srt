2
0:00:13.267,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Allow me to start this talk with a question to everyone.

3
0:00:17.795,000 --> 0:00:19,000
You know that all over the world,

4
0:00:20.057,000 --> 0:00:22,000
people fight for their freedom,

5
0:00:22.852,000 --> 0:00:24,000
fight for their rights.

6
0:00:25.058,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Some battle oppressive governments.

7
0:00:28.219,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Others battle oppressive societies.

8
0:00:32.955,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Which battle do you think is harder?

9
0:00:36.811,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Allow me to try to answer this question

10
0:00:39.283,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in the few coming minutes.

11
0:00:42.363,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Let me take you back two years ago in my life.

12
0:00:48.179,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It was the bedtime of my son, Aboody.

13
0:00:51.135,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He was five at the time.

14
0:00:53.819,000 --> 0:00:55,000
After finishing his bedtime rituals,

15
0:00:56.259,000 --> 0:01:,000
he looked at me and he asked a question:

16
0:01:00.341,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"Mommy, are we bad people?"

17
0:01:03.572,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I was shocked.

18
0:01:06.032,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Why do you say such things, Aboody?"

19
0:01:09.189,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Earlier that day, I noticed some bruises

20
0:01:11.524,000 --> 0:01:13,000
on his face when he came from school.

21
0:01:14.107,000 --> 0:01:15,000
He wouldn't tell me what happened.

22
0:01:16.073,000 --> 0:01:2,000
[But now] he was ready to tell.

23
0:01:20.136,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"Two boys hit me today in school.

24
0:01:22.947,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They told me, 'We saw your mom on Facebook.

25
0:01:26.316,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You and your mom should be put in jail.'"

26
0:01:31.102,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I've never been afraid to tell Aboody anything.

27
0:01:34.243,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I've been always a proud woman of my achievements.

28
0:01:38.947,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But those questioning eyes of my son

29
0:01:41.162,000 --> 0:01:43,000
were my moment of truth,

30
0:01:43.987,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when it all came together.

31
0:01:47.74,000 --> 0:01:51,000
You see, I'm a Saudi woman who had been put in jail

32
0:01:52.158,000 --> 0:01:54,000
for driving a car in a country

33
0:01:54.293,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where women are not supposed to drive cars.

34
0:01:59.248,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Just for giving me his car keys,

35
0:02:01.639,000 --> 0:02:04,000
my own brother was detained twice,

36
0:02:05.495,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and he was harassed to the point he had

37
0:02:07.108,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to quit his job as a geologist,

38
0:02:09.096,000 --> 0:02:12,000
leave the country with his wife and two-year-old son.

39
0:02:12.43,000 --> 0:02:14,000
My father had to sit in a Friday sermon

40
0:02:14.528,000 --> 0:02:17,000
listening to the imam condemning women drivers

41
0:02:18.2,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and calling them prostitutes

42
0:02:20.168,000 --> 0:02:22,000
amongst tons of worshippers,

43
0:02:22.504,000 --> 0:02:26,000
some of them our friends and family of my own father.

44
0:02:26.816,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I was faced with an organized defamation campaign

45
0:02:30.4,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in the local media combined with false rumors

46
0:02:33.382,000 --> 0:02:35,000
shared in family gatherings, in the streets

47
0:02:36.24,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and in schools.

48
0:02:38.984,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It all hit me.

49
0:02:41.328,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It came into focus that those kids

50
0:02:43.522,000 --> 0:02:45,000
did not mean to be rude to my son.

51
0:02:45.816,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They were just influenced by the adults around them.

52
0:02:49.886,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And it wasn't about me, and it wasn't a punishment

53
0:02:53.355,000 --> 0:02:56,000
for taking the wheel and driving a few miles.

54
0:02:57.169,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It was a punishment for daring to challenge

55
0:03:00.018,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the society's rules.

56
0:03:03.715,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But my story goes beyond this moment of truth of mine.

57
0:03:08.252,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Allow me to give you a briefing

58
0:03:12.048,000 --> 0:03:14,000
about my story.

59
0:03:14.24,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It was May, 2011,

60
0:03:16.276,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I was complaining to a work colleague

61
0:03:18.235,000 --> 0:03:19,000
about the harassments I had to face

62
0:03:20.069,000 --> 0:03:21,000
trying to find a ride back home,

63
0:03:21.857,000 --> 0:03:24,000
although I have a car and an international driver's license.

64
0:03:25.341,000 --> 0:03:27,000
As long as I've known, women in Saudi Arabia

65
0:03:27.466,000 --> 0:03:29,000
have been always complaining about the ban,

66
0:03:29.952,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but it's been 20 years since anyone

67
0:03:32.368,000 --> 0:03:34,000
tried to do anything about it,

68
0:03:34.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a whole generation ago.

69
0:03:36.6,000 --> 0:03:38,000
He broke the good/bad news in my face.

70
0:03:38.736,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"But there is no law banning you from driving."

71
0:03:41.893,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I looked it up, and he was right.

72
0:03:44.097,000 --> 0:03:46,000
There wasn't an actual law in Saudi Arabia.

73
0:03:46.776,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It was just a custom and traditions

74
0:03:48.916,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that are enshrined in rigid religious fatwas

75
0:03:52.932,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and imposed on women.

76
0:03:54.936,000 --> 0:03:57,000
That realization ignited the idea of June 17,

77
0:03:58.024,000 --> 0:04:,000
where we encouraged women to take the wheel

78
0:04:00.465,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and go drive.

79
0:04:03.193,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It was a few weeks later, we started receiving all these

80
0:04:07.048,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"Man wolves will rape you if you go and drive."

81
0:04:10.254,000 --> 0:04:12,000
A courageous woman, her name is Najla Hariri,

82
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:14,000
she's a Saudi woman in the city of Jeddah,

83
0:04:15.52,000 --> 0:04:16,000
she drove a car and she announced

84
0:04:17.134,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but she didn't record a video.

85
0:04:18.863,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We needed proof.

86
0:04:20.723,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So I drove. I posted a video on YouTube.

87
0:04:23.584,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And to my surprise,

88
0:04:25.495,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it got hundreds of thousands of views the first day.

89
0:04:28.384,000 --> 0:04:29,000
What happened next, of course?

90
0:04:30.09,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I started receiving threats

91
0:04:31.984,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to be killed, raped, just to stop this campaign.

92
0:04:36.546,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The Saudi authorities remained very quiet.

93
0:04:40.158,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That really creeped us out.

94
0:04:42.338,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was in the campaign with other Saudi women

95
0:04:44.465,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and even men activists.

96
0:04:46.418,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We wanted to know how the authorities

97
0:04:48.882,000 --> 0:04:51,000
would respond on the actual day, June 17,

98
0:04:52.49,000 --> 0:04:53,000
when women go out and drive.

99
0:04:54.219,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So this time I asked my brother

100
0:04:56.277,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to come with me and drive by a police car.

101
0:04:58.368,000 --> 0:05:,000
It went fast. We were arrested,

102
0:05:01.122,000 --> 0:05:04,000
signed a pledge not to drive again, released.

103
0:05:04.806,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Arrested again, he was sent to detention for one day,

104
0:05:08.018,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I was sent to jail.

105
0:05:10.281,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I wasn't sure why I was sent there,

106
0:05:11.906,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because I didn't face any charges in the interrogation.

107
0:05:15.083,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But what I was sure of was my innocence.

108
0:05:17.37,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I didn't break a law, and I kept my abaya

109
0:05:19.835,000 --> 0:05:22,000
— it's a black cloak we wear in Saudi Arabia before we leave the house —

110
0:05:23.711,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and my fellow prisoners kept asking me to take it off,

111
0:05:26.693,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but I was so sure of my innocence, I kept saying,

112
0:05:29.366,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"No, I'm leaving today."

113
0:05:31.591,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Outside the jail, the whole country went into a frenzy,

114
0:05:35.047,000 --> 0:05:37,000
some attacking me badly,

115
0:05:37.351,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and others supportive and even collecting signatures

116
0:05:41.076,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in a petition to be sent to the king to release me.

117
0:05:45.319,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I was released after nine days.

118
0:05:47.103,000 --> 0:05:49,000
June 17 comes.

119
0:05:49.789,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The streets were packed with police cars

120
0:05:52.479,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and religious police cars,

121
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but some hundred brave Saudi women

122
0:05:56.943,000 --> 0:05:58,000
broke the ban and drove that day.

123
0:05:58.975,000 --> 0:06:01,000
None were arrested. We broke the taboo.

124
0:06:02.063,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

125
0:06:12.407,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So I think by now, everyone knows that we can't drive,

126
0:06:15.799,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or women are not allowed to drive, in Saudi Arabia,

127
0:06:17.984,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but maybe few know why.

128
0:06:20.282,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Allow me to help you answer this question.

129
0:06:22.866,000 --> 0:06:25,000
There was this official study

130
0:06:26.002,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that was presented to the Shura Council --

131
0:06:28.046,000 --> 0:06:3,000
it's the consultative council appointed

132
0:06:30.31,000 --> 0:06:31,000
by the king in Saudi Arabia —

133
0:06:32.293,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and it was done by a local professor,

134
0:06:34.334,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a university professor.

135
0:06:35.652,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He claims it's done based on a UNESCO study.

136
0:06:40.015,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And the study states,

137
0:06:43.007,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the percentage of rape, adultery,

138
0:06:46.799,000 --> 0:06:49,000
illegitimate children, even drug abuse,

139
0:06:50.239,000 --> 0:06:53,000
prostitution in countries where women drive

140
0:06:53.327,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is higher than countries where women don't drive.

141
0:06:56.849,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:58.186,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I know, I was like this, I was shocked.

143
0:06:59.689,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I was like, "We are the last country in the world

144
0:07:02.809,000 --> 0:07:03,000
where women don't drive."

145
0:07:04.762,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So if you look at the map of the world,

146
0:07:06.928,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that only leaves two countries:

147
0:07:08.621,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Saudi Arabia, and the other society is the rest of the world.

148
0:07:13.007,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We started a hashtag on Twitter mocking the study,

149
0:07:16.095,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and it made headlines around the world.

150
0:07:18.563,000 --> 0:07:19,000
[BBC News: 'End of virginity' if women drive, Saudi cleric warns]

151
0:07:20.327,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:21.592,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And only then we realized it's so empowering

153
0:07:24.263,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to mock your oppressor.

154
0:07:25.727,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It strips it away of its strongest weapon: fear.

155
0:07:30.226,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This system is based on ultra-conservative

156
0:07:33.83,000 --> 0:07:34,000
traditions and customs

157
0:07:35.737,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that deal with women as if they are inferior

158
0:07:38.984,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and they need a guardian to protect them,

159
0:07:41.481,000 --> 0:07:43,000
so they need to take permission from this guardian,

160
0:07:43.685,000 --> 0:07:45,000
whether verbal or written, all their lives.

161
0:07:45.851,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We are minors until the day we die.

162
0:07:48.307,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And it becomes worse when it's enshrined in religious fatwas

163
0:07:52.213,000 --> 0:07:54,000
based on wrong interpretation of the sharia law,

164
0:07:54.915,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or the religious laws.

165
0:07:57.105,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What's worst, when they become codified

166
0:07:59.23,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as laws in the system,

167
0:08:01.681,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and when women themselves believe in their inferiority,

168
0:08:05.077,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and they even fight those who try

169
0:08:07.567,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to question these rules.

170
0:08:11.137,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So for me, it wasn't only about these attacks I had to face.

171
0:08:15.403,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It was about living two totally different

172
0:08:18.217,000 --> 0:08:2,000
perceptions of my personality, of my person --

173
0:08:21.177,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the villain back in my home country,

174
0:08:23.889,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and the hero outside.

175
0:08:25.912,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Just to tell you, two stories happened in the last two years.

176
0:08:29.987,000 --> 0:08:31,000
One of them is when I was in jail.

177
0:08:32.365,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I'm pretty sure when I was in jail,

178
0:08:34.023,000 --> 0:08:38,000
everyone saw titles in the international media

179
0:08:38.474,000 --> 0:08:42,000
something like this during these nine days I was in jail.

180
0:08:42.519,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But in my home country, it was a totally different picture.

181
0:08:45.996,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It was more like this:

182
0:08:47.665,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"Manal al-Sharif faces charges of disturbing public order

183
0:08:50.697,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and inciting women to drive."

184
0:08:54.439,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I know.

185
0:08:57.473,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"Manal al-Sharif withdraws from the campaign."

186
0:08:59.522,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Ah, it's okay. This is my favorite.

187
0:09:02.089,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"Manal al-Sharif breaks down and confesses:

188
0:09:04.486,000 --> 0:09:05,000
'Foreign forces incited me.'"

189
0:09:06.298,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:08.657,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And it goes on, even trial and flogging me in public.

191
0:09:13.854,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So it's a totally different picture.

192
0:09:17.282,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I was asked last year to give a speech

193
0:09:19.054,000 --> 0:09:21,000
at the Oslo Freedom Forum.

194
0:09:21.666,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I was surrounded by this love

195
0:09:24.251,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and the support of people around me,

196
0:09:26.386,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and they looked at me as an inspiration.

197
0:09:28.571,000 --> 0:09:3,000
At the same time, I flew back to my home country,

198
0:09:31.433,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they hated that speech so much.

199
0:09:33.358,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The way they called it: a betrayal to the Saudi country

200
0:09:35.897,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and the Saudi people,

201
0:09:37.489,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they even started a hashtag called #OsloTraitor on Twitter.

202
0:09:40.85,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Some 10,000 tweets were written in that hashtag,

203
0:09:44.119,000 --> 0:09:46,000
while the opposite hashtag, #OsloHero,

204
0:09:46.937,000 --> 0:09:47,000
there was like a handful of tweets written.

205
0:09:48.721,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They even started a poll.

206
0:09:50.661,000 --> 0:09:53,000
More than 13,000 voters answered this poll:

207
0:09:53.944,000 --> 0:09:56,000
whether they considered me a traitor or not after that speech.

208
0:09:56.97,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Ninety percent said yes, she's a traitor.

209
0:09:59.996,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So it's these two totally different perceptions

210
0:10:03.886,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of my personality.

211
0:10:05.493,000 --> 0:10:07,000
For me, I'm a proud Saudi woman,

212
0:10:07.517,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and I do love my country,

213
0:10:09.116,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and because I love my country, I'm doing this.

214
0:10:12.045,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Because I believe a society will not be free

215
0:10:14.91,000 --> 0:10:16,000
if the women of that society are not free.

216
0:10:17.453,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Applause)

217
0:10:27.382,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Thank you.

218
0:10:29.734,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Applause)

219
0:10:32.55,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

220
0:10:35.174,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

221
0:10:47.938,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Thank you.

222
0:10:51.615,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But you learn lessons from these things that happen to you.

223
0:10:55.836,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I learned to be always there.

224
0:10:58.054,000 --> 0:11:,000
The first thing, I got out of jail,

225
0:11:00.292,000 --> 0:11:03,000
of course after I took a shower, I went online,

226
0:11:03.612,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I opened my Twitter account and my Facebook page,

227
0:11:06.831,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and I've been always very respectful

228
0:11:09.119,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to those people who are opining to me.

229
0:11:10.626,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I would listen to what they say,

230
0:11:12.226,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and I would never defend myself with words only.

231
0:11:15.159,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I would use actions. When they said I should withdraw from the campaign,

232
0:11:17.567,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I filed the first lawsuit against the general directorate

233
0:11:20.725,000 --> 0:11:24,000
of traffic police for not issuing me a driver's license.

234
0:11:24.967,000 --> 0:11:25,000
There are a lot of people also --

235
0:11:26.942,000 --> 0:11:28,000
very big support, like those 3,000 people

236
0:11:29.247,000 --> 0:11:31,000
who signed the petition to release me.

237
0:11:31.611,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We sent a petition to the Shura Council

238
0:11:34.815,000 --> 0:11:37,000
in favor of lifting the ban on Saudi women,

239
0:11:38.047,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and there were, like, 3,500 citizens who believed in that

240
0:11:41.256,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and they signed that petition.

241
0:11:42.889,000 --> 0:11:44,000
There were people like that, I just showed some examples,

242
0:11:45.76,000 --> 0:11:48,000
who are amazing, who are believing in women's rights in Saudi Arabia,

243
0:11:48.872,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and trying, and they are also facing a lot of hate

244
0:11:51.6,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because of speaking up and voicing their views.

245
0:11:55.408,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Saudi Arabia today is taking small steps

246
0:11:57.785,000 --> 0:11:59,000
toward enhancing women's rights.

247
0:11:59.994,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The Shura Council that's appointed by the king,

248
0:12:02.192,000 --> 0:12:04,000
by royal decree of King Abdullah,

249
0:12:04.546,000 --> 0:12:07,000
last year there were 30 women assigned to that Council,

250
0:12:08.154,000 --> 0:12:1,000
like 20 percent.

251
0:12:10.682,000 --> 0:12:12,000
20 percent of the Council. (Applause)

252
0:12:13.41,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The same time, finally, that Council,

253
0:12:15.57,000 --> 0:12:17,000
after rejecting our petition four times for women driving,

254
0:12:18.562,000 --> 0:12:2,000
they finally accepted it last February.

255
0:12:21.137,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

256
0:12:26.127,000 --> 0:12:27,000
After being sent to jail

257
0:12:27.964,000 --> 0:12:29,000
or sentenced lashing, or sent to a trial,

258
0:12:30.817,000 --> 0:12:32,000
the spokesperson of the traffic police said,

259
0:12:32.906,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we will only issue traffic violation for women drivers.

260
0:12:37.217,000 --> 0:12:38,000
The Grand Mufti, who is the head

261
0:12:38.655,000 --> 0:12:4,000
of the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia,

262
0:12:41.431,000 --> 0:12:45,000
he said, it's not recommended for women to drive.

263
0:12:45.543,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It used to be haram, forbidden, by the previous Grand Mufti.

264
0:12:50.073,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So for me, it's not about only these small steps.

265
0:12:55.622,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's about women themselves.

266
0:12:57.187,000 --> 0:12:58,000
A friend once asked me, she said,

267
0:12:58.839,000 --> 0:13:,000
"So when do you think this women driving will happen?"

268
0:13:01.59,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I told her, "Only if women stop asking 'When?'

269
0:13:04.339,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and take action to make it now."

270
0:13:07.113,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So it's not only about the system,

271
0:13:08.767,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it's also about us women to drive our own life, I'd say.

272
0:13:15.21,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So I have no clue, really, how I became an activist.

273
0:13:21.362,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And I don't know how I became one now.

274
0:13:25.329,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But all I know, and all I'm sure of, in the future

275
0:13:28.977,000 --> 0:13:3,000
when someone asks me my story,

276
0:13:31.745,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I will say, "I'm proud

277
0:13:33.977,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to be amongst those women who lifted the ban,

278
0:13:36.833,000 --> 0:13:39,000
fought the ban, and celebrated everyone's freedom."

279
0:13:40.608,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So the question I started my talk with,

280
0:13:43.905,000 --> 0:13:46,000
who do you think is more difficult to face,

281
0:13:47.105,000 --> 0:13:49,000
oppressive governments or oppressive societies?

282
0:13:50.062,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I hope you find clues to answer that from my speech.

283
0:13:52.961,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Thank you, everyone.

284
0:13:54.417,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

285
0:13:59.185,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Thank you.

286
0:14:02.309,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Applause)

287
0:14:07.993,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Thank you. (Applause)

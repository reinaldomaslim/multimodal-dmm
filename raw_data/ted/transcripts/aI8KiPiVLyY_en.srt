1
0:00:13.11,000 --> 0:00:17,000
How many people here have heard of PMS?

2
0:00:17.429,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Everybody, right?

3
0:00:18.915,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Everyone knows that women go a little crazy

4
0:00:21.399,000 --> 0:00:23,000
right before they get their period,

5
0:00:24.27,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that the menstrual cycle throws them onto an inevitable hormonal roller coaster

6
0:00:28.458,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of irrationality and irritability.

7
0:00:31.151,000 --> 0:00:32,000
There's a general assumption

8
0:00:32.939,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that fluctuations in reproductive hormones cause extreme emotions

9
0:00:37.858,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and that the great majority of women are affected by this.

10
0:00:41.391,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Well, I am here to tell you that scientific evidence says

11
0:00:44.15,000 --> 0:00:46,000
neither of those assumptions is true.

12
0:00:46.569,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I'm here to give you the good news about PMS.

13
0:00:50.572,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But first, let's take a look at how firmly the idea of PMS

14
0:00:54.242,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is entrenched in American culture.

15
0:00:56.634,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If you examine newspaper or magazine articles,

16
0:01:00.21,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you'll see how widely assumed it is that everyone gets PMS.

17
0:01:04.552,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In an article in the magazine Redbook titled "You: PMS Free,"

18
0:01:09.94,000 --> 0:01:14,000
readers were informed that between 80 to 90 percent of women suffer from PMS.

19
0:01:15.52,000 --> 0:01:17,000
L.A. Muscle magazine warned its readers

20
0:01:18.251,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that 40 to 50 percent of women suffer from PMS,

21
0:01:21.525,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and that it plays a major role in women's mental and physical health,

22
0:01:26.169,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and a couple of years ago, even the Wall Street Journal

23
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
ran an article on calcium as a treatment for PMS,

24
0:01:32.345,000 --> 0:01:34,000
asking its female readers,

25
0:01:34.4,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"Do you turn into a witch every month?"

26
0:01:36.989,000 --> 0:01:39,000
From all these articles, you would think there must be a mountain of research

27
0:01:40.866,000 --> 0:01:43,000
verifying the widespread nature of PMS.

28
0:01:44.79,000 --> 0:01:47,000
However, after five decades of research,

29
0:01:47.948,000 --> 0:01:51,000
there's no strong consensus on the definition, the cause,

30
0:01:52.019,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the treatment, or even the existence of PMS.

31
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
As most commonly defined by psychologists,

32
0:01:59.313,000 --> 0:02:03,000
PMS involves negative behavioral, cognitive and physical symptoms

33
0:02:04.282,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from the time of ovulation to menstruation.

34
0:02:07.208,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But here's where it gets tricky.

35
0:02:09.42,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Over 150 different symptoms have been used to diagnose PMS,

36
0:02:14.661,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and here are just a few of those.

37
0:02:16.751,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, I want to be clear here.

38
0:02:18.632,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I'm not saying women don't get some of these symptoms.

39
0:02:21.998,000 --> 0:02:23,000
What I'm saying is that getting some of these symptoms

40
0:02:24.622,000 --> 0:02:26,000
doesn't amount to a mental disorder,

41
0:02:27.501,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and when psychologists come up with a disorder

42
0:02:30.822,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that's so vaguely defined,

43
0:02:33.108,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the label eventually becomes meaningless.

44
0:02:36.591,000 --> 0:02:38,000
With a list of symptoms this long and wide,

45
0:02:39.563,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I could have PMS, you could have PMS,

46
0:02:42.326,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the guy in the third row here could have PMS,

47
0:02:44.88,000 --> 0:02:46,000
my dog could have PMS. (Laughter)

48
0:02:48.193,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Some researchers said you had to have five symptoms.

49
0:02:50.861,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Some said three.

50
0:02:52.426,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Other researchers said that symptoms were only meaningful

51
0:02:55.282,000 --> 0:02:56,000
if they were highly disturbing to you,

52
0:02:57.116,000 --> 0:03:,000
but others said minor symptoms were just as important.

53
0:03:00.669,000 --> 0:03:02,000
For many years, because there was no standardization

54
0:03:03.571,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in the definition of PMS,

55
0:03:05.66,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when psychologists tried to report prevalence rates,

56
0:03:08.725,000 --> 0:03:1,000
their estimates ranged from five percent of women

57
0:03:11.512,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to 97 percent of women,

58
0:03:13.81,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so at the same time almost no one and almost everyone had PMS.

59
0:03:19.638,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Overall, the weaknesses in the methods of research on PMS have been considerable.

60
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
First, many studies asked women to report their symptoms retrospectively,

61
0:03:31.967,000 --> 0:03:33,000
looking to the past and relying on memory,

62
0:03:34.684,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which is known to inflate reporting of PMS

63
0:03:37.865,000 --> 0:03:4,000
compared to what's called prospective reporting,

64
0:03:41.23,000 --> 0:03:43,000
which involves keeping a daily log of symptoms

65
0:03:43.426,000 --> 0:03:45,000
for at least two months in a row.

66
0:03:45.864,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Many studies also exclusively focused on white, middle-class women,

67
0:03:50.833,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which makes it problematic to apply study findings to all women.

68
0:03:55.479,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We know there's a strong cultural component to the belief in PMS

69
0:03:59.517,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because it's nearly unheard of outside of Western nations.

70
0:04:03.139,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Third, many studies failed to use control groups.

71
0:04:07.4,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If we want to understand the specific characteristics

72
0:04:10.21,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of women who have PMS,

73
0:04:11.73,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we need to be able to compare them to women who don't have PMS.

74
0:04:15.932,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And finally, many different types of questionnaires were used

75
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to diagnose PMS, focusing on different symptoms,

76
0:04:23.17,000 --> 0:04:25,000
symptom duration and severity.

77
0:04:25.823,000 --> 0:04:28,000
To do reliable research on any condition,

78
0:04:28.934,000 --> 0:04:3,000
scientists must agree on the specific characteristics

79
0:04:31.883,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that make up that condition

80
0:04:33.636,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so they're all talking about the same thing,

81
0:04:35.749,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and with PMS, this has not been the case.

82
0:04:39.185,000 --> 0:04:41,000
However, in 1994,

83
0:04:41.461,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,

84
0:04:45.129,000 --> 0:04:47,000
known as the DSM, thankfully --

85
0:04:47.428,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it's also the manual for mental health professionals --

86
0:04:51.306,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they redefined PMS as PMDD,

87
0:04:55.23,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder.

88
0:04:58.248,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And dysphoria refers to a feeling of agitation or unease.

89
0:05:04.192,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And according to these new DSM guidelines,

90
0:05:07.652,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in most menstrual cycles in the last year,

91
0:05:10.879,000 --> 0:05:13,000
at least five of 11 possible symptoms

92
0:05:14.13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
must appear in the week before menstruation starts;

93
0:05:17.822,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the symptoms must improve once menstruation has begun;

94
0:05:21.189,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the symptoms must be absent the week after menstruation has ended.

95
0:05:27.101,000 --> 0:05:3,000
One of these symptoms must come from this list of four:

96
0:05:30.429,000 --> 0:05:35,000
marked mood swings, irritability, anxiety, or depression.

97
0:05:35.677,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The other symptoms could come from the first slide

98
0:05:38.509,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or from those on the second slide,

99
0:05:40.646,000 --> 0:05:42,000
including symptoms like feeling out of control

100
0:05:43.269,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and changes in sleep or appetite.

101
0:05:46.938,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The DSM also required now that the symptoms

102
0:05:50.815,000 --> 0:05:54,000
should be associated with clinically significant distress --

103
0:05:54.995,000 --> 0:05:56,000
there should be some kind of disturbance in work

104
0:05:57.828,000 --> 0:05:59,000
or school or social relationships --

105
0:06:00.753,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and that symptoms and symptom severity should now be documented

106
0:06:04.259,000 --> 0:06:08,000
by keeping a daily log for at least two cycles in a row.

107
0:06:08.276,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And finally, the DSM required that the emotional disturbance

108
0:06:12.131,000 --> 0:06:17,000
should be more than simply an exacerbation of an already existing disorder.

109
0:06:17.889,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So scientifically speaking, this is an improvement.

110
0:06:20.675,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We now have a limited number of symptoms,

111
0:06:23.322,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and a high impact on functioning that's required,

112
0:06:26.898,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and the reporting and timing of symptoms have both become very specific.

113
0:06:32.354,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Well, using this criteria

114
0:06:35.164,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and looking at most recent studies,

115
0:06:37.31,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we see that on average,

116
0:06:38.925,000 --> 0:06:43,000
three to eight percent of women suffer from PMDD.

117
0:06:44.89,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Not all women, not most women,

118
0:06:47.47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
not the majority of women, not even a lot of women:

119
0:06:50.24,000 --> 0:06:52,000
three to eight percent.

120
0:06:52.926,000 --> 0:06:56,000
For everyone else, variables like stressful events or happy occasions

121
0:06:57.883,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or even day of the week

122
0:06:59.927,000 --> 0:07:03,000
are more powerful predictors of mood than time of the month,

123
0:07:04.012,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and this is the information the scientific community has had

124
0:07:07.452,000 --> 0:07:08,000
since the 1990s.

125
0:07:08.982,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In 2002, my colleagues and I published an article

126
0:07:11.722,000 --> 0:07:14,000
describing the PMS and PMDD research,

127
0:07:14.856,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and several similar articles have appeared in psychology journals.

128
0:07:19.129,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The questions is, why hasn't this information trickled down to the public?

129
0:07:23.54,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Why do these myths persist?

130
0:07:27.116,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Well, certainly the onslaught of messages that women receive

131
0:07:30.413,000 --> 0:07:35,000
from books, TV, movies, the Internet, that everyone gets PMS

132
0:07:35.557,000 --> 0:07:38,000
go a long way in convincing them it must be true.

133
0:07:39.19,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Research tells us that the more a woman believes that everyone gets PMS,

134
0:07:44.36,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the more likely she is to erroneously report that she has it.

135
0:07:48.268,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Let me tell you what I mean by "erroneously."

136
0:07:50.544,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You might ask her, "Do you have PMS?"

137
0:07:53.27,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and she says yes,

138
0:07:54.613,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but then, when you have her keep a daily log

139
0:07:57.031,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of psychological symptoms for two months,

140
0:07:59.43,000 --> 0:08:02,000
no correlation is found between her symptoms

141
0:08:02.704,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and time of the month.

142
0:08:05.016,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Another reason for the persistence of the PMS myth

143
0:08:09.385,000 --> 0:08:12,000
has to do with the narrow boundaries of the feminine role.

144
0:08:12.846,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Feminist psychologists like Joan Chrisler

145
0:08:15.494,000 --> 0:08:18,000
have suggested that taking on the label of PMS

146
0:08:19.486,000 --> 0:08:24,000
allows women to express emotions that would otherwise be considered unladylike.

147
0:08:24.919,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The near universal definition of a good woman

148
0:08:28.31,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is one who is happy, loving, caring for others,

149
0:08:31.838,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and taking great satisfaction from that role.

150
0:08:34.694,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Well, PMS has become a permission slip to be angry, complain, be irritated,

151
0:08:39.846,000 --> 0:08:42,000
without losing the title of good woman.

152
0:08:43.214,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We know that the variables in a woman's environment

153
0:08:47.254,000 --> 0:08:5,000
are much more likely to cause her to be angry than her hormones,

154
0:08:50.714,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but when she attributes anger to hormones,

155
0:08:53.57,000 --> 0:08:55,000
she's absolved of responsibility or criticism.

156
0:08:56.337,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"Oh, that's not who she is. It's out of her control."

157
0:08:59.79,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And while this can be a useful tool, it serves to invalidate women's emotions.

158
0:09:06.406,000 --> 0:09:08,000
When people respond to a woman's anger

159
0:09:09.127,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with the thought, "Oh, it's just that time of the month,"

160
0:09:12.122,000 --> 0:09:17,000
her ability to be taken seriously or effect change is severely limited.

161
0:09:17.48,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So who else benefits from the myth of PMS?

162
0:09:21.467,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Well, I can tell you that treating PMS

163
0:09:23.511,000 --> 0:09:27,000
has become a profitable, thriving industry.

164
0:09:27.992,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Amazon.com currently offers over 1,900 books on PMS treatment.

165
0:09:34.772,000 --> 0:09:36,000
A quick Google search will bring up a cornucopia

166
0:09:37.233,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of clinics, workshops and seminars.

167
0:09:40.971,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Reputable Internet sources of medical information

168
0:09:43.874,000 --> 0:09:47,000
like WebMD or the Mayo Clinic list PMS as a known disorder.

169
0:09:48.634,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's not a known disorder, but they list it.

170
0:09:51.141,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And they also list the medications that physicians have prescribed to treat it,

171
0:09:55.112,000 --> 0:09:57,000
like anti-depressants or hormones.

172
0:09:58.048,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Interestingly, though, both websites say that the success of medication

173
0:10:03.772,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in treating PMS symptoms vary from woman to woman.

174
0:10:07.859,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Well, that doesn't make sense.

175
0:10:09.59,000 --> 0:10:11,000
If you've got a distinct disorder with a distinct cause,

176
0:10:12.224,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which PMS is supposed to be,

177
0:10:14.174,000 --> 0:10:17,000
then the treatment should bring improvement for a great number of women.

178
0:10:17.982,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This has not been the case with these treatments,

179
0:10:20.536,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and FDA regulations say that for a drug to be deemed effective,

180
0:10:24.646,000 --> 0:10:26,000
a large portion of the target population

181
0:10:26.713,000 --> 0:10:29,000
should see clinically significant improvement.

182
0:10:29.871,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So we have not had that at all with these so-called treatments.

183
0:10:33.887,000 --> 0:10:37,000
However, the financial gain of perpetuating the myth

184
0:10:38.2,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that PMS is a common mental disorder

185
0:10:41.201,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and is treatable is quite substantial.

186
0:10:45.27,000 --> 0:10:48,000
When women are prescribed drugs like anti-depressants or hormones,

187
0:10:48.724,000 --> 0:10:53,000
medical protocol requires that they have physician follow-up every three months.

188
0:10:53.833,000 --> 0:10:54,000
That's a lot of doctor visits.

189
0:10:55.806,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Pharmaceutical companies reap untold profits

190
0:10:58.314,000 --> 0:11:01,000
when women are convinced they should take a prescribed medication

191
0:11:02.238,000 --> 0:11:04,000
for all of their child-bearing lives.

192
0:11:05.14,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Over-the-counter drugs like Midol

193
0:11:07.764,000 --> 0:11:11,000
even claim to treat PMS symptoms like tension and irritability,

194
0:11:12.176,000 --> 0:11:15,000
even though they only contain a diuretic, a pain reliever

195
0:11:16.169,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and caffeine.

196
0:11:18.143,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now, far be it from me to argue with the magical powers of caffeine,

197
0:11:21.579,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but I don't think reducing tension is one of them.

198
0:11:25.944,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Since 2002, Midol has marketed a Teen Midol to adolescents.

199
0:11:32.51,000 --> 0:11:34,000
They are aiming at young girls early,

200
0:11:35.34,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to convince them that everyone gets PMS and that it will make you a monster,

201
0:11:39.585,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but wait, there's something you can do about it:

202
0:11:41.864,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Take Midol and you will be a human being again.

203
0:11:44.926,000 --> 0:11:5,000
In 2013, Midol took in 48 million dollars in sales revenue.

204
0:11:51.45,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So while perpetuating the myth of PMS has been lucrative for some,

205
0:11:56.1,000 --> 0:12:,000
it comes with some serious adverse consequences for women.

206
0:12:00.32,000 --> 0:12:02,000
First, it contributes to the medicalization

207
0:12:02.874,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of women's reproductive health.

208
0:12:05.544,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The medical field has a long history of conceptualizing

209
0:12:08.748,000 --> 0:12:13,000
women's reproductive processes as illnesses that require treatment,

210
0:12:14.158,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and this has come at many costs, including excessive Cesarean deliveries,

211
0:12:18.268,000 --> 0:12:2,000
hysterectomies and prescribed hormone treatments

212
0:12:20.978,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that have harmed rather than enhanced women's health.

213
0:12:25.675,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Second, the PMS myth also contributes to the stereotype of women

214
0:12:30.505,000 --> 0:12:33,000
as irrational and overemotional.

215
0:12:33.871,000 --> 0:12:36,000
When the menstrual cycle is described as a hormonal roller coaster

216
0:12:37.61,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that turns women into angry beasts,

217
0:12:40.43,000 --> 0:12:44,000
it becomes easy to question the competence of all women.

218
0:12:44.775,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Women have made tremendous strides in the workforce,

219
0:12:47.594,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but still there's a minuscule number of women at the highest echelons

220
0:12:51.657,000 --> 0:12:53,000
of fields like government or business,

221
0:12:54.397,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and when we think about who makes for a good CEO or senator,

222
0:12:59.343,000 --> 0:13:04,000
someone who has qualities like rationality, steadiness, competence

223
0:13:04.462,000 --> 0:13:05,000
come to mind,

224
0:13:05.971,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and in our culture, that sounds more like a man than a woman,

225
0:13:09.512,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and the PMS myth contributes to that.

226
0:13:13.17,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Psychologists know that the moods of men and women

227
0:13:16.339,000 --> 0:13:18,000
are more similar than different.

228
0:13:19.172,000 --> 0:13:23,000
One study followed men and women for four to six months

229
0:13:23.235,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and found that the number of mood swings they experienced

230
0:13:26.3,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and the severity of those mood swings were no different.

231
0:13:30.154,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And finally, the PMS myth keeps women from dealing

232
0:13:34.357,000 --> 0:13:38,000
with the actual issues causing them emotional upset.

233
0:13:38.374,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Individual issues like quality of relationship or work conditions

234
0:13:42.809,000 --> 0:13:46,000
or societal issues like racism or sexism or the daily grind of poverty

235
0:13:47.313,000 --> 0:13:5,000
are all strongly related to daily mood.

236
0:13:50.657,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Sweeping emotions under the rug of PMS

237
0:13:54.42,000 --> 0:13:57,000
keeps women from understanding the source of their negative emotions,

238
0:13:58.272,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but it also takes away the opportunity to take any action to change them.

239
0:14:03.64,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So the good news about PMS

240
0:14:06.469,000 --> 0:14:1,000
is that while some women get some symptoms because of the menstrual cycle,

241
0:14:11.205,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the great majority don't get a mental disorder.

242
0:14:14.758,000 --> 0:14:17,000
They go to work or school, take care of their families,

243
0:14:17.985,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and function at a normal level.

244
0:14:20.284,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We know the emotions and moods of men and women

245
0:14:23.511,000 --> 0:14:24,000
are more similar than different,

246
0:14:25.462,000 --> 0:14:3,000
so let's walk away from the tired old PMS myth of women as witches

247
0:14:31.097,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and embrace the reality of high emotional and professional functioning

248
0:14:35.945,000 --> 0:14:38,000
the great majority of women live every day.

249
0:14:39.149,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Thank you.

250
0:14:41.425,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Applause)

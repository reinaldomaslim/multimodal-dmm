1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The things we make

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
have one supreme quality --

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
they live longer than us.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We perish, they survive;

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we have one life, they have many lives,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and in each life they can mean different things.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Which means that, while we all have one biography,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
they have many.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I want this morning to talk

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about the story, the biography -- or rather the biographies --

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
of one particular object,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
one remarkable thing.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It doesn't, I agree,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
look very much.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's about the size of a rugby ball.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's made of clay,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and it's been fashioned

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
into a cylinder shape,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
covered with close writing

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and then baked dry in the sun.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And as you can see,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it's been knocked about a bit,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which is not surprising

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because it was made two and a half thousand years ago

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and was dug up

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in 1879.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But today,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
this thing is, I believe,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a major player

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the politics of the Middle East.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And it's an object

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
with fascinating stories

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and stories that are by no means over yet.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The story begins

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in the Iran-Iraq war

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and that series of events

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that culminated

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in the invasion of Iraq

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
by foreign forces,

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the removal of a despotic ruler

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and instant regime change.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I want to begin

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with one episode from that sequence of events

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that most of you would be very familiar with,

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Belshazzar's feast --

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because we're talking about the Iran-Iraq war

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of 539 BC.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the parallels

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
between the events

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of 539 BC and 2003 and in between

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
are startling.

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
What you're looking at is Rembrandt's painting,

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
now in the National Gallery in London,

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in the Hebrew scriptures.

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And you all know roughly the story.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Belshazzar, the son of Nebuchadnezzar,

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Nebuchadnezzar who'd conquered Israel, sacked Jerusalem

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and captured the people

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and taken the Jews back to Babylon.

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Not only the Jews, he'd taken the temple vessels.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
He'd ransacked, desecrated the temple.

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
had been taken to Babylon.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Belshazzar, his son,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
decides to have a feast.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And in order to make it even more exciting,

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun,

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and he brings out the temple vessels.

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
He's already at war with the Iranians,

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with the king of Persia.

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that night, Daniel tells us,

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
at the height of the festivities

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
a hand appeared and wrote on the wall,

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"You are weighed in the balance and found wanting,

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and your kingdom is handed over

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to the Medes and the Persians."

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And that very night

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Cyrus, king of the Persians, entered Babylon

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell.

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It is, of course, a great moment

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in the history

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
of the Jewish people.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's a great story. It's story we all know.

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"The writing on the wall"

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is part of our everyday language.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
What happened next

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
was remarkable,

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it's where our cylinder

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
enters the story.

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Cyrus, king of the Persians,

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
has entered Babylon without a fight --

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the great empire of Babylon,

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
which ran from central southern Iraq

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to the Mediterranean,

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
falls to Cyrus.

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And Cyrus makes a declaration.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And that is what this cylinder is,

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the declaration made by the ruler guided by God

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
who had toppled the Iraqi despot

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and was going to bring freedom to the people.

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
In ringing Babylonian --

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it was written in Babylonian --

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
he says, "I am Cyrus, king of all the universe,

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the great king, the powerful king,

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
king of Babylon, king of the four quarters of the world."

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They're not shy of hyperbole as you can see.

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is probably

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the first real press release

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
by a victorious army

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that we've got.

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And it's written, as we'll see in due course,

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
by very skilled P.R. consultants.

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising.

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And what is the great king, the powerful king,

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the king of the four quarters of the world going to do?

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
He goes on to say that, having conquered Babylon,

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
he will at once let all the peoples

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar --

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
have captured and enslaved

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
go free.

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
He'll let them return to their countries.

123
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And more important,

124
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
he will let them all recover

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the gods, the statues,

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the temple vessels

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that had been confiscated.

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
will go home,

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and they'll take with them their gods.

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And they'll be able to restore their altars

132
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and to worship their gods

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in their own way, in their own place.

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This is the decree,

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
this object is the evidence

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for the fact that the Jews,

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
after the exile in Babylon,

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the years they'd spent sitting by the waters of Babylon,

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
weeping when they remembered Jerusalem,

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
those Jews were allowed to go home.

141
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and to rebuild the temple.

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's a central document

144
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in Jewish history.

145
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And the Book of Chronicles, the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
reported in ringing terms.

147
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
This is the Jewish version

148
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of the same story.

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Thus said Cyrus, king of Persia,

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
'All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee,

151
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and he has charged me

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to build him a house in Jerusalem.

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Who is there among you of his people?

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The Lord God be with him,

155
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and let him go up.'"

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Go up" -- aaleh.

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The central element, still,

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of the notion of return,

159
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
a central part

160
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
of the life of Judaism.

161
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
As you all know, that return from exile,

162
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the second temple,

163
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
reshaped Judaism.

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And that change,

165
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that great historic moment,

166
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
was made possible by Cyrus, the king of Persia,

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
reported for us in Hebrew in scripture

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
and in Babylonian in clay.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Two great texts,

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
what about the politics?

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What was going on

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The empire of Iran, the Medes and the Persians,

174
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
united under Cyrus,

175
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
became the first great world empire.

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC.

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And by the time of his son Darius,

178
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the whole of the eastern Mediterranean

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is under Persian control.

180
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This empire is, in fact,

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the Middle East as we now know it,

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and it's what shapes the Middle East as we now know it.

183
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It was the largest empire the world had known until then.

184
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Much more important,

185
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it was the first

186
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
multicultural, multifaith state

187
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
on a huge scale.

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And it had to be run in a quite new way.

189
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It had to be run in different languages.

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing.

191
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And it had to recognize their different habits,

192
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
different peoples, different religions, different faiths.

193
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
All of those are respected by Cyrus.

194
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Cyrus sets up a model

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
of how you run

196
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
a great multinational, multifaith, multicultural society.

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And the result of that

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen,

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and which survived for 200 years of stability

200
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
until it was shattered by Alexander.

201
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit,

202
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and a unit where people of different faiths

203
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
could live together.

204
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The Greek invasions ended that.

205
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And of course, Alexander couldn't sustain a government

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and it fragmented.

207
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But what Cyrus represented

208
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
remained absolutely central.

209
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The Greek historian Xenophon

210
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
wrote his book "Cyropaedia"

211
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
promoting Cyrus as the great ruler.

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And throughout European culture afterward,

213
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Cyrus remained the model.

214
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This is a 16th century image

215
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to show you how widespread

216
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
his veneration actually was.

217
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And Xenophon's book on Cyrus

218
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
on how you ran a diverse society

219
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
was one of the great textbooks

220
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that inspired the Founding Fathers

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of the American Revolution.

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Jefferson was a great admirer --

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the ideals of Cyrus

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals

225
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of how you create religious tolerance

226
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in a new state.

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Meanwhile, back in Babylon,

228
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
things had not been going well.

229
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
After Alexander, the other empires,

230
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Babylon declines, falls into ruins,

231
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost --

232
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
until 1879

233
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when the cylinder is discovered

234
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon.

235
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And it enters now another story.

236
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It enters that great debate

237
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in the middle of the 19th century:

238
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Are the scriptures reliable? Can we trust them?

239
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We only knew

240
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus

241
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
from the Hebrew scriptures.

242
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
No other evidence.

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Suddenly, this appeared.

244
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And great excitement

245
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to a world where those who believed in the scriptures

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
had had their faith in creation shaken

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
by evolution, by geology,

248
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
here was evidence

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that the scriptures were historically true.

250
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's a great 19th century moment.

251
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But -- and this, of course, is where it becomes complicated --

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the facts were true,

253
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
hurrah for archeology,

254
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but the interpretation was rather more complicated.

255
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
differ in one key respect.

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The Babylonian cylinder

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is written by the priests

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of the great god of Bablyon, Marduk.

260
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And, not surprisingly,

261
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
they tell you that all this was done by Marduk.

262
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"Marduk, we hold, called Cyrus by his name."

263
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand,

264
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
calls him to shepherd his people

265
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and gives him the rule of Babylon.

266
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Marduk tells Cyrus

267
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that he will do these great, generous things

268
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
of setting the people free.

269
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And this is why we should all be grateful to

270
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and worship Marduk.

271
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The Hebrew writers

272
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in the Old Testament,

273
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
you will not be surprised to learn,

274
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
take a rather different view of this.

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
For them, of course, it can't possibly by Marduk

276
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that made all this happen.

277
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It can only be Jehovah.

278
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And so in Isaiah,

279
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we have the wonderful texts

280
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
giving all the credit of this,

281
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
not to Marduk

282
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but to the Lord God of Israel --

283
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the Lord God of Israel

284
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
who also called Cyrus by name,

285
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
also takes Cyrus by the hand

286
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and talks of him shepherding his people.

287
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It's a remarkable example

288
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of two different priestly appropriations of the same event,

289
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
two different religious takeovers

290
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
of a political fact.

291
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
God, we know,

292
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is usually on the side of the big battalions.

293
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
The question is, which god was it?

294
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And the debate unsettles

295
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
everybody in the 19th century

296
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to realize that the Hebrew scriptures

297
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
are part of a much wider world of religion.

298
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And it's quite clear

299
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah,

300
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and yet, Jehovah is speaking

301
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
in words very similar

302
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to those used by Marduk.

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And there's a slight sense that Isaiah knows this,

304
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because he says,

305
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
this is God speaking, of course,

306
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
"I have called thee by thy name

307
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
though thou hast not known me."

308
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I think it's recognized

309
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that Cyrus doesn't realize

310
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that he's acting under orders from Jehovah.

311
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And equally, he'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk.

312
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Because interestingly, of course,

313
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Cyrus is a good Iranian

314
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
with a totally different set of gods

315
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
who are not mentioned in any of these texts.

316
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

317
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
That's 1879.

318
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
40 years on

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and we're in 1917,

320
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and the cylinder enters a different world.

321
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
This time, the real politics

322
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
of the contemporary world --

323
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the year of the Balfour Declaration,

324
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East, Britain,

325
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
decides that it will declare

326
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
a Jewish national home,

327
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it will allow

328
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the Jews to return.

329
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And the response to this

330
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic.

331
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And across Eastern Europe,

332
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Jews display pictures of Cyrus

333
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and of George V

334
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
side by side --

335
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the two great rulers

336
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
who have allowed the return to Jerusalem.

337
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view

338
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and the text of this

339
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
as a demonstration of why what is going to happen

340
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
after the war is over in 1918

341
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
is part of a divine plan.

342
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
You all know what happened.

343
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The state of Israel is setup,

344
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and 50 years later, in the late 60s,

345
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
it's clear that Britain's role as the imperial power is over.

346
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And another story of the cylinder begins.

347
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The region, the U.K. and the U.S. decide,

348
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
has to be kept safe from communism,

349
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and the superpower that will be created to do this

350
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
would be Iran, the Shah.

351
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history,

352
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
or a return to Iranian history,

353
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that puts him in the center of a great tradition

354
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and produces coins

355
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
showing himself

356
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
with the Cyrus cylinder.

357
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis,

358
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
he summons the cylinder

359
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum, goes to Tehran,

360
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and is part of those great celebrations

361
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
of the Pahlavi dynasty.

362
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Cyrus cylinder: guarantor of the Shah.

363
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
10 years later, another story:

364
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Iranian Revolution, 1979.

365
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Islamic revolution, no more Cyrus;

366
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
we're not interested in that history,

367
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we're interested in Islamic Iran --

368
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
until Iraq,

369
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the new superpower that we've all decided should be in the region,

370
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
attacks.

371
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Then another Iran-Iraq war.

372
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And it becomes critical for the Iranians

373
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to remember their great past,

374
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
their great past

375
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
when they fought Iraq and won.

376
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It becomes critical to find a symbol

377
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that will pull together all Iranians --

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Muslims and non-Muslims,

379
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews living in Iran,

380
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
people who are devout, not devout.

381
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus.

382
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem

383
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
cooperate and work together, as we've been doing,

384
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
the Iranians ask for one thing only

385
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
as a loan.

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It's the only object they want.

387
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder.

388
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And last year,

389
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran

390
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
for the second time.

391
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
It's shown being presented here, put into its case

392
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
by the director of the National Museum of Tehran,

393
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions,

394
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Mrs. Ardakani.

395
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It was a huge event.

396
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
This is the other side of that same picture.

397
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
It's seen in Tehran

398
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
by between one and two million people

399
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
in the space of a few months.

400
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition

401
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
in the West.

402
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And it's the subject of a huge debate

403
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
about what this cylinder means, what Cyrus means,

404
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
but above all, Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder --

405
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Cyrus as the defender of the homeland,

406
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
the champion, of course, of Iranian identity

407
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and of the Iranian peoples,

408
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
tolerant of all faiths.

409
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And in the current Iran,

410
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places

411
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
in the Iranian parliament, something to be very, very proud of.

412
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
To see this object in Tehran,

413
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
thousands of Jews living in Iran

414
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
came to Tehran to see it.

415
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
It became a great emblem,

416
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
a great subject of debate

417
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
about what Iran is at home and abroad.

418
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed?

419
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Will Iran set free the people

420
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated?

421
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
This is heady national rhetoric,

422
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and it was all put together

423
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
in a great pageant

424
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
launching the return.

425
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage

426
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
with great figures from Iranian history

427
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
gathering to take their place

428
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
in the heritage of Iran.

429
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
It was a narrative presented

430
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
by the president himself.

431
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
And for me,

432
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
to take this object to Iran,

433
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to be allowed to take this object to Iran

434
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
was to be allowed to be part

435
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
of an extraordinary debate

436
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
led at the highest levels

437
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
about what Iran is,

438
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
what different Irans there are

439
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and how the different histories of Iran

440
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
might shape the world today.

441
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
It's a debate that's still continuing,

442
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
and it will continue to rumble,

443
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
because this object

444
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
is one of the great declarations

445
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
of a human aspiration.

446
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
It stands with the American constitution.

447
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
It certainly says far more about real freedoms

448
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
than Magna Carta.

449
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
It is a document that can mean so many things,

450
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
for Iran and for the region.

451
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
A replica of this

452
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
is at the United Nations.

453
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
In New York this autumn, it will be present

454
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
when the great debates

455
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
about the future of the Middle East take place.

456
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And I want to finish by asking you

457
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
what the next story will be

458
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
in which this object figures.

459
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
It will appear, certainly,

460
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
in many more Middle Eastern stories.

461
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And what story of the Middle East,

462
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
what story of the world,

463
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
do you want to see

464
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
reflecting what is said,

465
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
what is expressed in this cylinder?

466
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
The right of peoples

467
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
to live together in the same state,

468
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
worshiping differently, freely --

469
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
a Middle East, a world,

470
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
in which religion is not the subject of division

471
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
or of debate.

472
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
In the world of the Middle East at the moment,

473
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
the debates are, as you know, shrill.

474
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
But I think it's possible

475
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them

476
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
may well be the voice

477
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
of this mute thing,

478
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
the Cyrus cylinder.

479
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
Thank you.

480
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
(Applause)

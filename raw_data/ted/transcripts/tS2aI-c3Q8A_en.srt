1
0:00:13.393,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The philosopher Plato once said,

2
0:00:16.051,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"Music gives a soul to the universe,

3
0:00:18.824,000 --> 0:00:19,000
wings to the mind,

4
0:00:20.442,000 --> 0:00:22,000
flight to the imagination

5
0:00:22.488,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and life to everything."

6
0:00:25.613,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Music has always been a big part of my life.

7
0:00:27.925,000 --> 0:00:29,000
To create and to perform music

8
0:00:30.319,000 --> 0:00:32,000
connects you to people countries and lifetimes away.

9
0:00:33.597,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It connects you to the people you're playing with,

10
0:00:35.974,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to your audience

11
0:00:37.186,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and to yourself.

12
0:00:38.952,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When I'm happy, when I'm sad,

13
0:00:41.127,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when I'm bored, when I'm stressed,

14
0:00:43.351,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I listen to and I create music.

15
0:00:47.536,000 --> 0:00:49,000
When I was younger, I played piano;

16
0:00:49.831,000 --> 0:00:5,000
later, I took up guitar.

17
0:00:51.252,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And as I started high school,

18
0:00:53.109,000 --> 0:00:54,000
music became a part of my identity.

19
0:00:55.329,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I was in every band,

20
0:00:56.77,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was involved with every musical fine arts event.

21
0:00:59.978,000 --> 0:01:,000
Music surrounded me.

22
0:01:01.409,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It made me who I was,

23
0:01:02.788,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it gave me a place to belong.

24
0:01:06.476,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, I've always had this thing with rhythms.

25
0:01:08.597,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I remember being young,

26
0:01:09.79,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I would walk down the hallways of my school

27
0:01:11.878,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I would tap rhythms to myself on my leg with my hands,

28
0:01:14.892,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or tapping my teeth.

29
0:01:17.504,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It was a nervous habit,

30
0:01:19.007,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I was always nervous.

31
0:01:20.66,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I think I liked the repetition of the rhythm --

32
0:01:22.97,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it was calming.

33
0:01:25.777,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Then in high school,

34
0:01:26.951,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I started music theory,

35
0:01:28.488,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and it was the best class I've ever taken.

36
0:01:30.742,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We were learning about music --

37
0:01:32.3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
things I didn't know, like theory and history.

38
0:01:35.656,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It was a class where we basically just listened to a song,

39
0:01:39.08,000 --> 0:01:4,000
talked about what it meant to us

40
0:01:40.732,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and analyzed it,

41
0:01:41.942,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and figured out what made it tick.

42
0:01:45.53,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Every Wednesday, we did something called "rhythmic dictation,"

43
0:01:48.614,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I was pretty good at it.

44
0:01:50.592,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Our teacher would give us an amount of measures

45
0:01:52.871,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and a time signature,

46
0:01:54.388,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and then he would speak a rhythm to us

47
0:01:56.276,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and we would have to write it down with the proper rests and notes.

48
0:02:00.232,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Like this:

49
0:02:02.442,000 --> 0:02:04,000
ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta,

50
0:02:04.943,000 --> 0:02:06,000
ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a.

51
0:02:08.652,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I loved it.

52
0:02:09.981,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The simplicity of the rhythm --

53
0:02:11.483,000 --> 0:02:13,000
a basic two- to four- measure line --

54
0:02:13.665,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and yet each of them almost told a story,

55
0:02:17.417,000 --> 0:02:19,000
like they had so much potential,

56
0:02:21.07,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and all you had to do was add a melody.

57
0:02:25.4,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Guitar)

58
0:02:33.408,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Rhythms set a foundation for melodies and harmonies to play on top of.

59
0:02:37.808,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It gives structure and stability.

60
0:02:41.34,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, music has these parts --

61
0:02:43.044,000 --> 0:02:45,000
rhythm, melody and harmony --

62
0:02:45.203,000 --> 0:02:46,000
just like our lives.

63
0:02:47.372,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Where music has rhythm,

64
0:02:49.432,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we have routines and habits --

65
0:02:51.71,000 --> 0:02:54,000
things that help us to remember what to do and to stay on track,

66
0:02:54.999,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and to just keep going.

67
0:02:58.05,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And you may not notice it,

68
0:02:59.899,000 --> 0:03:,000
but it's always there.

69
0:03:02.486,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Guitar)

70
0:03:04.879,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And it may seem simple,

71
0:03:06.72,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it may seem dull by itself,

72
0:03:10.407,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but it gives tempo and heartbeat.

73
0:03:15.443,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And then things in your life add on to it,

74
0:03:17.9,000 --> 0:03:18,000
giving texture --

75
0:03:19.726,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that's your friends and your family,

76
0:03:21.503,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and anything that creates a harmonic structure in your life

77
0:03:25.163,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and in your song,

78
0:03:26.772,000 --> 0:03:27,000
like harmonies,

79
0:03:28.458,000 --> 0:03:29,000
cadences

80
0:03:29.639,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and anything that makes it polyphonic.

81
0:03:34.198,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And they create beautiful chords and patterns.

82
0:03:36.609,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Guitar)

83
0:03:39.174,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And then there's you.

84
0:03:41.221,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You play on top of everything else,

85
0:03:45.141,000 --> 0:03:48,000
on top of the rhythms and the beat

86
0:03:49.679,000 --> 0:03:5,000
because you're the melody.

87
0:03:52.974,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And things may change and develop,

88
0:03:57.046,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but no matter what we do,

89
0:03:58.63,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we're still the same people.

90
0:04:01.93,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Throughout a song melodies develop,

91
0:04:04.135,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but it's still the same song.

92
0:04:07.073,000 --> 0:04:08,000
No matter what you do,

93
0:04:08.881,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the rhythms are still there:

94
0:04:10.831,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the tempo and the heartbeat ...

95
0:04:16.029,000 --> 0:04:17,000
until I left,

96
0:04:18.975,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and I went to college

97
0:04:20.588,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and everything disappeared.

98
0:04:24.431,000 --> 0:04:26,000
When I first arrived at university,

99
0:04:26.654,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I felt lost.

100
0:04:28.534,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And don't get me wrong -- sometimes I loved it and it was great,

101
0:04:31.588,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but other times,

102
0:04:34.781,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I felt like I had been left alone

103
0:04:37.79,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to fend for myself.

104
0:04:40.423,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It's like I had been taken out of my natural environment,

105
0:04:43.261,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and put somewhere new,

106
0:04:44.63,000 --> 0:04:46,000
where the rhythms and the harmonies

107
0:04:47.486,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the form had gone away,

108
0:04:51.458,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and it was just me --

109
0:04:52.851,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Guitar)

110
0:04:54.2,000 --> 0:04:56,000
silence and my melody.

111
0:04:59.75,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And even that began to waver,

112
0:05:02.269,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because I didn't know what I was doing.

113
0:05:04.894,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I didn't have any chords to structure myself,

114
0:05:08.209,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or a rhythm

115
0:05:10.06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or a beat to know the tempo.

116
0:05:11.811,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Guitar)

117
0:05:15.305,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And then I began to hear all these other sounds.

118
0:05:17.641,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Guitar)

119
0:05:19.49,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And they were off-time

120
0:05:22.599,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and off-key.

121
0:05:26.764,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And the more I was around them,

122
0:05:29.536,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the more my melody started to sound like theirs.

123
0:05:36.08,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And slowly I began to lose myself,

124
0:05:40.335,000 --> 0:05:41,000
like I was being washed away.

125
0:05:45.004,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But then the next moment --

126
0:05:46.525,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Guitar)

127
0:05:48.535,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I could hear it.

128
0:05:51.454,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I could feel it.

129
0:05:55.07,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And it was me.

130
0:05:57.284,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I was here.

131
0:05:59.555,000 --> 0:06:,000
And it was different,

132
0:06:02.639,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but not worse off.

133
0:06:06.228,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Just changed a little.

134
0:06:11.346,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Music is my way of coping with the changes in my life.

135
0:06:16.258,000 --> 0:06:18,000
There's a beautiful connection between music and life.

136
0:06:19.307,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It can bind us to reality

137
0:06:20.637,000 --> 0:06:22,000
at the same time it allows us to escape it.

138
0:06:23.053,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Music is something that lives inside of you.

139
0:06:25.597,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You create it and you're created by it.

140
0:06:29.547,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Our lives are not only conducted by music,

141
0:06:32.683,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they're also composed of it.

142
0:06:35.348,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So this may seem like a bit of a stretch,

143
0:06:37.484,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but hear me out:

144
0:06:39.075,000 --> 0:06:42,000
music is a fundamental part of what we are

145
0:06:42.689,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and of everything around us.

146
0:06:45.096,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now, music is my passion,

147
0:06:46.54,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but physics also used to be an interest of mine.

148
0:06:49.469,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And the more I learned,

149
0:06:50.65,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the more I saw connections between the two --

150
0:06:53.498,000 --> 0:06:54,000
especially regarding string theory.

151
0:06:57.095,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I know this is only one of many theories,

152
0:06:59.857,000 --> 0:07:,000
but it spoke to me.

153
0:07:02.211,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So, one aspect of string theory, at its simplest form, is this:

154
0:07:07.131,000 --> 0:07:09,000
matter is made up of atoms,

155
0:07:09.181,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which are made up of protons and neutrons and electrons,

156
0:07:12.423,000 --> 0:07:13,000
which are made up of quark.

157
0:07:14.173,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And here's where the string part comes in.

158
0:07:16.23,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This quark is supposedly made up of little coiled strings,

159
0:07:20.516,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and it's the vibrations of these strings that make everything what it is.

160
0:07:25.571,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Michio Kaku once explained this

161
0:07:27.146,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in a lecture called, "The Universe in a Nutshell,"

162
0:07:30.102,000 --> 0:07:31,000
where he says,

163
0:07:32.324,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"String theory is the simple idea

164
0:07:34.588,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that the four forces of the universe --

165
0:07:36.64,000 --> 0:07:4,000
gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the two strong forces --

166
0:07:40.85,000 --> 0:07:41,000
can be viewed as music.

167
0:07:42.849,000 --> 0:07:44,000
The music of tiny little rubber bands."

168
0:07:46.444,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In this lecture, he goes on to explain physics

169
0:07:48.783,000 --> 0:07:5,000
as the laws of harmony between these strings;

170
0:07:51.216,000 --> 0:07:54,000
chemistry, as the melodies you can play on these strings;

171
0:07:54.965,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and he states that the universe is a "symphony of strings."

172
0:08:01.259,000 --> 0:08:03,000
These strings dictate the universe;

173
0:08:03.351,000 --> 0:08:05,000
they make up everything we see and everything we know.

174
0:08:06.908,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They're musical notes,

175
0:08:08.142,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but they make us what we are and they hold us together.

176
0:08:12.177,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So you see,

177
0:08:14.087,000 --> 0:08:15,000
everything is music.

178
0:08:16.291,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Guitar)

179
0:08:17.679,000 --> 0:08:19,000
When I look at the world,

180
0:08:19.833,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I see music all around us.

181
0:08:25.084,000 --> 0:08:26,000
When I look at myself,

182
0:08:27.634,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I see music.

183
0:08:33.168,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And my life has been defined by music.

184
0:08:37.288,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I found myself through music.

185
0:08:41.181,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Music is everywhere,

186
0:08:43.657,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and it is in everything.

187
0:08:48.231,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And it changes and it builds

188
0:08:51.041,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and it diminishes.

189
0:08:54.39,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But it's always there,

190
0:08:56.591,000 --> 0:08:57,000
supporting us,

191
0:08:58.249,000 --> 0:08:59,000
connecting us to each other

192
0:09:00.991,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and showing us the beauty of the universe.

193
0:09:04.868,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So if you ever feel lost,

194
0:09:07.211,000 --> 0:09:09,000
stop and listen for your song.

195
0:09:10.361,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Thank you.

196
0:09:12.498,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

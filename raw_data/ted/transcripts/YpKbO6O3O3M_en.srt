1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I told you three things last year.

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I told you that the statistics of the world

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
have not been made properly available.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Because of that, we still have the old mindset

5
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.

6
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And that animated graphics can make a difference.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Things are changing

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,

9
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.

10
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Applause)

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And if I could share the image with you on the screen.

12
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So three things have happened.

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
U.N. opened their statistic databases,

14
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and we have a new version of the software

15
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
up working as a beta on the net,

16
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
so you don't have to download it any longer.

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And let me repeat what you saw last year.

18
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The bubbles are the countries.

19
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --

20
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and there you have the length of life in years.

21
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,

22
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
those were developing countries.

23
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
At that time there was a "we" and "them."

24
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
There was a huge difference in the world.

25
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.

26
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And this is what happens.

27
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You can see how China is the red, big bubble.

28
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The blue there is India.

29
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be

30
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
a little more serious this year in showing you

31
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
how things really changed.

32
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?

33
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Large families still, and the HIV epidemic

34
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
brought down the countries like this.

35
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is more or less what we saw last year,

36
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and this is how it will go on into the future.

37
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I will talk on, is this possible?

38
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.

39
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Because this is where we are.

40
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Will it be possible that this will happen?

41
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I cover my lifetime here, you know?

42
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I expect to live 100 years.

43
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And this is where we are today.

44
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?

45
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And I would like to show that against child survival.

46
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We'll swap the axis.

47
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival --

48
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
four kids dying there, 200 dying there.

49
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And this is GDP per capita on this axis.

50
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And this was 2007.

51
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics --

52
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:03,000
here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.

53
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Some countries still had statistics.

54
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We are looking down in the archive,

55
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and when we are down into 1820,

56
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.

57
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.

59
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.

60
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.

61
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
How they got slowly richer and richer,

62
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and they add statistics.

63
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?

64
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You see the importance of that?

65
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And here, children don't live longer.

66
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,

67
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because most of this statistics is Europe.

68
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It was only by the turn of the century

69
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.

70
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is India coming up, with the first data from India.

71
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.

72
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.

73
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,

74
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:07,000
not getting so rich.

75
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.

76
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It moves this way over here.

77
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the bubbles keep moving up there,

78
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and this is what the world looks like today.

79
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Let us have a look at the United States.

81
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."

82
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --

83
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I put them up like this, and now we go backwards.

84
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And we can see that the United States

85
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
goes to the right of the mainstream.

86
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They are on the money side all the time.

87
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --

88
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
present, contemporary India.

89
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And that means United States was richer,

90
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.

91
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.

92
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The Philippines of today has almost the same economy

93
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as the United States during the First World War.

94
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But we have to bring United States forward quite a while

95
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to find the same health of the United States

96
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:16,000
as we have in the Philippines.

97
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
About 1957 here, the health of the United States

98
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is the same as the Philippines.

99
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,

100
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,

101
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:33,000
are much more ahead in being healthy, educated,

102
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
having human resources than they are economically.

103
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
There's a discrepancy in what's happening today

104
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in the emerging economies.

105
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There now, social benefits, social progress,

106
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
are going ahead of economical progress.

107
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.

108
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And how long do we have to bring United States

109
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to get the same health as Chile has today?

110
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --

111
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the United States has the same health as Chile.

112
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Chile's catching up!

113
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Within some years Chile may have better child survival

114
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
than the United States.

115
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
This is really a change, that you have this lag

116
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.

117
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And behind the health is the educational level.

118
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And there's a lot of infrastructure things,

119
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and general human resources are there.

120
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now we can take away this --

121
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I would like to show you the rate of speed,

122
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the rate of change, how fast they have gone.

123
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.

124
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.

125
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And I'm going to stage a race here

126
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
between this sort of yellowish Ford here

127
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the red Toyota down there,

128
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and the brownish Volvo.

129
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter)

130
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And here we go. Here we go.

131
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,

132
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and the United States Ford is going off-road there.

133
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And the Volvo is doing quite fine.

134
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now

135
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --

136
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:15,000
can you see that?

137
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And they are taking over Sweden,

138
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and they are now healthier than Sweden.

139
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.

140
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.

142
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They really caught up.

143
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And this changes gradually.

144
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We have to look over generations to understand it.

145
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And let me show you my own sort of family history --

146
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
we made these graphs here.

147
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?

148
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And this is my family.

149
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.

150
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.

151
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.

152
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And Sweden was like Mozambique.

153
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.

154
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
She took care of me as a child,

155
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
so I'm not talking about statistic now --

156
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
now it's oral history in my family.

157
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That's when I believe statistics,

158
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
when it's grandma-verified statistics.

159
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

160
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.

161
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Sweden was like Ghana.

162
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It's interesting to see the enormous diversity

163
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
within sub-Saharan Africa.

164
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I told you last year, I'll tell you again,

165
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?

166
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I'm the Mexican in the family.

167
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And my daughter, she was born in Chile,

168
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,

169
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
now the healthiest country on this Earth.

170
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,

171
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
with better child survival.

172
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But they're very small, you know?

173
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They're so close to the hospital we can never

174
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
beat them out in these forests.

175
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But homage to Singapore.

177
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Singapore is the best one.

178
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now this looks also like a very good story.

179
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.

180
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.

181
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We can also make the color here represent the variable --

182
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and what am I choosing here?

183
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.

184
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.

185
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And China was emitting 0.6,

186
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.

187
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And what happens when we moved on?

188
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Well, you see the nice story of getting richer

189
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and getting healthier --

190
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:39,000
everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.

191
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
There is no one who has done it so far.

192
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And we don't have all the updated data

193
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
any longer, because this is really hot data today.

194
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And there we are, 2001.

195
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,

196
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:59,000
many say now the problem is that the emerging economies,

197
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:02,000
they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.

198
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The Minister of the Environment of India said,

199
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."

200
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The OECD countries -- the high-income countries --

201
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
they were the ones who caused the climate change.

202
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.

203
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But from now on, we count per capita.

204
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
From now on we count per capita.

205
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."

206
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This really shows you, we have not seen good economic

207
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and health progress anywhere in the world

208
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
without destroying the climate.

209
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And this is really what has to be changed.

210
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,

211
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but I don't think it's like this.

212
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The world is quite a messy place.

213
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
This we can call Dollar Street.

214
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Everyone lives on this street here.

215
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
What they earn here -- what number they live on --

216
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is how much they earn per day.

217
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This family earns about one dollar per day.

218
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We drive up the street here,

219
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:,000
we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.

220
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,

221
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.

222
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And how do they live?

223
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
If we look at the bed here, we can see

224
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that they sleep on a rug on the floor.

225
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This is what poverty line is --

226
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,

227
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the food for the day.

228
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.

229
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.

230
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see

231
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the sofa immediately here.

232
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Laughter)

233
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.

234
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,

235
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you see the family still sitting on the floor there.

236
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Although there is a sofa,

237
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that

238
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.

239
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It comes beyond here, when you really can get

240
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:55,000
good working conditions in the family.

241
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And if you really want to see the difference,

242
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you look at the toilet over here.

243
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This can change. This can change.

244
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
These are all pictures and images from Africa,

245
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and it can become much better.

246
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We can get out of poverty.

247
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:12,000
My own research has not been in IT or anything like this.

248
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers

249
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
who were on the verge of famine.

250
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.

251
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The nice thing here is that you can't see

252
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
who are the researchers in this picture.

253
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
That's when research functions in poor societies --

254
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
you must really live with the people.

255
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:35,000
When you're in poverty, everything is about survival.

256
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's about having food.

257
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And these two young farmers, they are girls now --

258
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --

259
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
they discuss with a trained agronomist.

260
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,

261
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --

262
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.

263
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,

264
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and that's to survive in poverty.

265
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:02,000
That's one context.

266
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Getting out of poverty.

267
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.

268
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.

269
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour,

270
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."

271
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Technology will bring you out of poverty,

272
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.

273
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.

274
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling

275
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.

276
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market

277
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and doesn't have to stay home.

278
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.

279
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It's also good with credit.

280
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.

281
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.

282
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You can do this.

283
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that

284
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the seemingly impossible is possible.

285
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Africa has not done bad.

286
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation

287
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,

288
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
with a functioning nation and state.

289
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world

290
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:1,000
during the last 50 years.

291
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Because we don't consider where they came from.

292
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
It's this stupid concept of developing countries

293
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,

294
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and says that Mozambique did worse.

295
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We have to know a little more about the world.

296
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.

297
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
He knows everything.

298
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:29,000
He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.

299
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.

300
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

301
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But my neighbor only knows two types of countries --

302
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
industrialized and developing.

303
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And I know 200, I know about the small data.

304
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But you can do that.

305
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

306
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?

307
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You make a PowerPoint, you know?

308
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

309
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Homage to the Office package, no?

310
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?

311
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.

312
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Everyone wants your pet thing.

313
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.

314
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,

315
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
you love equity between gender.

316
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.

317
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.

318
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
We need everything.

319
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
All these things are important for development,

320
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
especially when you just get out of poverty

321
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and you should go towards welfare.

322
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Now, what we need to think about

323
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is, what is a goal for development,

324
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and what are the means for development?

325
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Let me first grade what are the most important means.

326
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor,

327
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:44,000
is the most important thing for development

328
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
because it explains 80 percent of survival.

329
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Governance. To have a government which functions --

330
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.

331
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It was the government that made law function finally.

332
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
Education, human resources are important.

333
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.

334
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Environment is important.

335
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.

336
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?

337
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We are not interested in money.

338
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Money is not a goal.

339
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.

340
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,

341
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but it's not a goal.

342
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.

343
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy

344
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.

345
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And that's good, it gets two plusses.

346
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Environment is very, very crucial.

347
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.

348
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But where are the important goals?

349
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Of course, it's human rights.

350
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Human rights is the goal,

351
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.

352
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,

353
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
because that's what brings joy to life.

354
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
That's the value of living.

355
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So the seemingly impossible is possible.

356
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
Even African countries can achieve this.

357
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.

358
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And remember, please remember my main message,

359
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:14,000
which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.

360
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
We can have a good world.

361
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,

362
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and I think I will convince you also by culture.

363
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Laughter)

364
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Applause)

365
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Bring me my sword!

366
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.

367
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:46,000
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years

368
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:52,000
has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.

369
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:54,000
(Laughter)

370
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible

371
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:02,000
by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --

372
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:06,000
this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,

373
0:18:06,000 --> 0:18:08,000
in the last year we had war.

374
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.

375
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And I'm going to take this blade of steel,

376
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and push it down through my body of blood and flesh,

377
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:27,000
and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.

378
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Can I request a moment of absolute silence?

379
0:18:43,000 --> 0:19:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.709,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Type is something we consume

2
0:00:14.235,000 --> 0:00:15,000
in enormous quantities.

3
0:00:16.157,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In much of the world,

4
0:00:17.239,000 --> 0:00:18,000
it's completely inescapable.

5
0:00:19.107,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But few consumers are concerned to know

6
0:00:22.13,000 --> 0:00:24,000
where a particular typeface came from

7
0:00:24.462,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or when or who designed it,

8
0:00:27.226,000 --> 0:00:3,000
if, indeed, there was any human agency involved

9
0:00:30.579,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in its creation, if it didn't just sort of materialize

10
0:00:33.376,000 --> 0:00:36,000
out of the software ether.

11
0:00:37.088,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But I do have to be concerned with those things.

12
0:00:40.613,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's my job.

13
0:00:42.13,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I'm one of the tiny handful of people

14
0:00:44.34,000 --> 0:00:46,000
who gets badly bent out of shape

15
0:00:46.454,000 --> 0:00:48,000
by the bad spacing of the T and the E

16
0:00:49.048,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that you see there.

17
0:00:50.948,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I've got to take that slide off.

18
0:00:52.39,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I can't stand it. Nor can Chris.

19
0:00:54.461,000 --> 0:00:55,000
There. Good.

20
0:00:56.122,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So my talk is about the connection

21
0:00:57.89,000 --> 0:01:,000
between technology and design of type.

22
0:01:01.29,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The technology has changed

23
0:01:03.953,000 --> 0:01:05,000
a number of times since I started work:

24
0:01:06.825,000 --> 0:01:1,000
photo, digital, desktop, screen, web.

25
0:01:11.486,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I've had to survive those changes and try

26
0:01:13.224,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to understand their implications for what I do

27
0:01:15.928,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for design.

28
0:01:17.319,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This slide is about the effect of tools on form.

29
0:01:22.489,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The two letters, the two K's,

30
0:01:25.39,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the one on your left, my right, is modern,

31
0:01:28.715,000 --> 0:01:29,000
made on a computer.

32
0:01:30.126,000 --> 0:01:32,000
All straight lines are dead straight.

33
0:01:32.168,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The curves have that kind of mathematical smoothness

34
0:01:34.978,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that the Bézier formula imposes.

35
0:01:38.724,000 --> 0:01:4,000
On the right, ancient Gothic,

36
0:01:41.221,000 --> 0:01:45,000
cut in the resistant material of steel by hand.

37
0:01:45.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
None of the straight lines are actually straight.

38
0:01:47.405,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The curves are kind of subtle.

39
0:01:49.57,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It has that spark of life from the human hand

40
0:01:54.284,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that the machine or the program

41
0:01:56.198,000 --> 0:01:57,000
can never capture.

42
0:01:58.131,000 --> 0:01:59,000
What a contrast.

43
0:02:00.11,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Well, I tell a lie.

44
0:02:02.689,000 --> 0:02:04,000
A lie at TED. I'm really sorry.

45
0:02:05.677,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Both of these were made on a computer,

46
0:02:07.798,000 --> 0:02:08,000
same software, same Bézier curves,

47
0:02:09.724,000 --> 0:02:1,000
same font format.

48
0:02:11.416,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The one on your left

49
0:02:13.95,000 --> 0:02:15,000
was made by Zuzana Licko at Emigre,

50
0:02:16.204,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I did the other one.

51
0:02:17.639,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The tool is the same, yet the letters are different.

52
0:02:20.995,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The letters are different

53
0:02:22.518,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because the designers are different.

54
0:02:23.724,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That's all. Zuzana wanted hers to look like that.

55
0:02:26.985,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I wanted mine to look like that. End of story.

56
0:02:30.106,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Type is very adaptable.

57
0:02:32.31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Unlike a fine art, such as sculpture or architecture,

58
0:02:35.631,000 --> 0:02:38,000
type hides its methods.

59
0:02:39.03,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I think of myself as an industrial designer.

60
0:02:41.827,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The thing I design is manufactured,

61
0:02:43.393,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it has a function:

62
0:02:45.269,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to be read, to convey meaning.

63
0:02:47.107,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But there is a bit more to it than that.

64
0:02:48.753,000 --> 0:02:49,000
There's the sort of aesthetic element.

65
0:02:50.601,000 --> 0:02:52,000
What makes these two letters different

66
0:02:53.317,000 --> 0:02:56,000
from different interpretations by different designers?

67
0:02:56.349,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What gives the work of some designers

68
0:02:58.362,000 --> 0:03:,000
sort of characteristic personal style,

69
0:03:01.273,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as you might find in the work of a fashion designer,

70
0:03:03.81,000 --> 0:03:06,000
an automobile designer, whatever?

71
0:03:06.885,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There have been some cases, I admit,

72
0:03:08.66,000 --> 0:03:09,000
where I as a designer

73
0:03:09.81,000 --> 0:03:12,000
did feel the influence of technology.

74
0:03:12.899,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This is from the mid-'60s,

75
0:03:15.959,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the change from metal type to photo,

76
0:03:18.194,000 --> 0:03:19,000
hot to cold.

77
0:03:19.896,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This brought some benefits

78
0:03:21.093,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but also one particular drawback:

79
0:03:24.439,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a spacing system that only provided

80
0:03:27.112,000 --> 0:03:3,000
18 discrete units for letters

81
0:03:31.095,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to be accommodated on.

82
0:03:33.558,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I was asked at this time to design

83
0:03:35.534,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a series of condensed sans serif types

84
0:03:38.272,000 --> 0:03:41,000
with as many different variants as possible

85
0:03:41.435,000 --> 0:03:44,000
within this 18-unit box.

86
0:03:45.282,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Quickly looking at the arithmetic,

87
0:03:46.921,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I realized I could only actually make three

88
0:03:50.23,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of related design. Here you see them.

89
0:03:53.617,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In Helvetica Compressed, Extra Compressed,

90
0:03:56.208,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and Ultra Compressed, this rigid 18-unit system

91
0:04:00.019,000 --> 0:04:01,000
really boxed me in.

92
0:04:01.592,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It kind of determined the proportions

93
0:04:03.425,000 --> 0:04:05,000
of the design.

94
0:04:05.714,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Here are the typefaces, at least the lower cases.

95
0:04:09.744,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So do you look at these and say,

96
0:04:12.436,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"Poor Matthew, he had to submit to a problem,

97
0:04:15.575,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and by God it shows in the results."

98
0:04:19.382,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I hope not.

99
0:04:20.689,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If I were doing this same job today,

100
0:04:22.93,000 --> 0:04:24,000
instead of having 18 spacing units,

101
0:04:25.756,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I would have 1,000.

102
0:04:28.84,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Clearly I could make more variants,

103
0:04:31.293,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but would these three members of the family be better?

104
0:04:35.989,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's hard to say without actually doing it,

105
0:04:37.841,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but they would not be better in the proportion

106
0:04:39.548,000 --> 0:04:42,000
of 1,000 to 18, I can tell you that.

107
0:04:42.637,000 --> 0:04:43,000
My instinct tells you that any improvement

108
0:04:44.575,000 --> 0:04:47,000
would be rather slight, because they were designed

109
0:04:47.653,000 --> 0:04:49,000
as functions of the system they were designed to fit,

110
0:04:50.574,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and as I said, type is very adaptable.

111
0:04:52.983,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It does hide its methods.

112
0:04:55.77,000 --> 0:04:57,000
All industrial designers work within constraints.

113
0:04:58.452,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is not fine art.

114
0:05:00.944,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The question is, does a constraint

115
0:05:02.822,000 --> 0:05:04,000
force a compromise?

116
0:05:05.489,000 --> 0:05:06,000
By accepting a constraint,

117
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
are you working to a lower standard?

118
0:05:09.449,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I don't believe so, and I've always been encouraged

119
0:05:11.411,000 --> 0:05:13,000
by something that Charles Eames said.

120
0:05:13.535,000 --> 0:05:14,000
He said he was conscious of working

121
0:05:15.08,000 --> 0:05:16,000
within constraints,

122
0:05:16.118,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but not of making compromises.

123
0:05:19.344,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The distinction between a constraint

124
0:05:21.905,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and a compromise is obviously very subtle,

125
0:05:24.28,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but it's very central to my attitude to work.

126
0:05:29.951,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Remember this reading experience?

127
0:05:32.842,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The phone book. I'll hold the slide

128
0:05:34.267,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so you can enjoy the nostalgia.

129
0:05:38.802,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is from the mid-'70s early trials

130
0:05:41.548,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of Bell Centennial typeface I designed

131
0:05:44.177,000 --> 0:05:45,000
for the U.S. phone books,

132
0:05:45.951,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it was my first experience of digital type,

133
0:05:49.27,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and quite a baptism.

134
0:05:53.44,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Designed for the phone books, as I said,

135
0:05:55.039,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to be printed at tiny size on newsprint

136
0:05:58.407,000 --> 0:06:,000
on very high-speed rotary presses

137
0:06:00.725,000 --> 0:06:02,000
with ink that was kerosene and lampblack.

138
0:06:03.477,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is not a hospitable environment

139
0:06:07.318,000 --> 0:06:1,000
for a typographic designer.

140
0:06:10.52,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So the challenge for me was to design type

141
0:06:12.419,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that performed as well as possible

142
0:06:13.92,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in these very adverse production conditions.

143
0:06:18.665,000 --> 0:06:2,000
As I say, we were in the infancy of digital type.

144
0:06:21.52,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I had to draw every character by hand

145
0:06:24.339,000 --> 0:06:25,000
on quadrille graph paper --

146
0:06:26.054,000 --> 0:06:27,000
there were four weights of Bell Centennial 

147
0:06:28.006,000 --> 0:06:31,000
pixel by pixel, then encode them raster line by raster line

148
0:06:31.359,000 --> 0:06:31,000
for the keyboard.

149
0:06:32.34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It took two years, but I learned a lot.

150
0:06:36.764,000 --> 0:06:37,000
These letters look as though they've been chewed

151
0:06:38.394,000 --> 0:06:39,000
by the dog or something or other,

152
0:06:39.838,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but the missing pixels at the intersections

153
0:06:41.78,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of strokes or in the crotches

154
0:06:43.385,000 --> 0:06:46,000
are the result of my studying the effects

155
0:06:46.559,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of ink spread on cheap paper

156
0:06:49.505,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and reacting, revising the font accordingly.

157
0:06:53.242,000 --> 0:06:56,000
These strange artifacts are designed to compensate

158
0:06:56.492,000 --> 0:06:58,000
for the undesirable effects of scale

159
0:06:59.244,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and production process.

160
0:07:01.53,000 --> 0:07:03,000
At the outset, AT&T had wanted

161
0:07:04.376,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to set the phone books in Helvetica,

162
0:07:07.617,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but as my friend Erik Spiekermann said

163
0:07:09.282,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in the Helvetica movie, if you've seen that,

164
0:07:11.785,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the letters in Helvetica were designed to be

165
0:07:13.82,000 --> 0:07:15,000
as similar to one another as possible.

166
0:07:16.561,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is not the recipe for legibility at small size.

167
0:07:19.835,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It looks very elegant up on a slide.

168
0:07:22.425,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I had to disambiguate these forms

169
0:07:24.615,000 --> 0:07:27,000
of the figures as much as possible in Bell Centennial

170
0:07:27.615,000 --> 0:07:29,000
by sort of opening the shapes up, as you can see

171
0:07:29.91,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in the bottom part of that slide.

172
0:07:32.823,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So now we're on to the mid-'80s,

173
0:07:35.48,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the early days of digital outline fonts,

174
0:07:38.036,000 --> 0:07:4,000
vector technology.

175
0:07:40.393,000 --> 0:07:42,000
There was an issue at that time

176
0:07:42.431,000 --> 0:07:43,000
with the size of the fonts,

177
0:07:44.287,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the amount of data that was required to find

178
0:07:47.171,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and store a font in computer memory.

179
0:07:52.141,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It limited the number of fonts you could get

180
0:07:53.799,000 --> 0:07:55,000
on your typesetting system at any one time.

181
0:07:56.789,000 --> 0:08:,000
I did an analysis of the data,

182
0:08:00.938,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and found that a typical serif face

183
0:08:03.462,000 --> 0:08:04,000
you see on the left

184
0:08:04.921,000 --> 0:08:06,000
needed nearly twice as much data

185
0:08:06.937,000 --> 0:08:08,000
as a sans serif in the middle

186
0:08:09.473,000 --> 0:08:11,000
because of all the points required

187
0:08:11.535,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to define the elegantly curved serif brackets.

188
0:08:16.043,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The numbers at the bottom of the slide, by the way,

189
0:08:19.477,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they represent the amount of data

190
0:08:21.179,000 --> 0:08:24,000
needed to store each of the fonts.

191
0:08:24.984,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So the sans serif, in the middle,

192
0:08:27.15,000 --> 0:08:29,000
sans the serifs, was much more economical,

193
0:08:30.114,000 --> 0:08:32,000
81 to 151.

194
0:08:32.313,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"Aha," I thought. "The engineers have a problem.

195
0:08:35.97,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Designer to the rescue."

196
0:08:38.205,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I made a serif type, you can see it on the right,

197
0:08:40.552,000 --> 0:08:41,000
without curved serifs.

198
0:08:42.499,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I made them polygonal, out of straight line segments,

199
0:08:44.915,000 --> 0:08:45,000
chamfered brackets.

200
0:08:46.898,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And look, as economical in data as a sans serif.

201
0:08:51.266,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We call it Charter, on the right.

202
0:08:53.565,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So I went to the head of engineering

203
0:08:55.535,000 --> 0:08:57,000
with my numbers, and I said proudly,

204
0:08:57.993,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"I have solved your problem."

205
0:09:00.121,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"Oh," he said. "What problem?"

206
0:09:03.834,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And I said, "Well, you know, the problem

207
0:09:05.48,000 --> 0:09:08,000
of the huge data you require for serif fonts and so on."

208
0:09:08.897,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"Oh," he said. "We solved that problem last week.

209
0:09:12.444,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We wrote a compaction routine that reduces

210
0:09:14.6,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the size of all fonts by an order of magnitude.

211
0:09:17.18,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You can have as many fonts on your system

212
0:09:19.168,000 --> 0:09:2,000
as you like."

213
0:09:20.726,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"Well, thank you for letting me know," I said.

214
0:09:23.34,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Foiled again.

215
0:09:24.97,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I was left with a design solution

216
0:09:27.015,000 --> 0:09:31,000
for a nonexistent technical problem.

217
0:09:31.488,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But here is where the story sort of gets interesting for me.

218
0:09:33.957,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I didn't just throw my design away

219
0:09:36.552,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in a fit of pique.

220
0:09:37.953,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I persevered.

221
0:09:39.69,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What had started as a technical exercise

222
0:09:41.858,000 --> 0:09:44,000
became an aesthetic exercise, really.

223
0:09:45.122,000 --> 0:09:48,000
In other words, I had come to like this typeface.

224
0:09:48.171,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Forget its origins. Screw that.

225
0:09:50.49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I liked the design for its own sake.

226
0:09:52.98,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The simplified forms of Charter

227
0:09:55.363,000 --> 0:09:57,000
gave it a sort of plain-spoken quality

228
0:09:57.446,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and unfussy spareness

229
0:09:58.997,000 --> 0:10:,000
that sort of pleased me.

230
0:10:01.487,000 --> 0:10:03,000
You know, at times of technical innovation,

231
0:10:04.04,000 --> 0:10:05,000
designers want to be influenced

232
0:10:05.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
by what's in the air.

233
0:10:07.296,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We want to respond. We want to be pushed

234
0:10:09.527,000 --> 0:10:12,000
into exploring something new.

235
0:10:12.938,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So Charter is a sort of parable for me, really.

236
0:10:15.837,000 --> 0:10:18,000
In the end, there was no hard and fast causal link

237
0:10:19.627,000 --> 0:10:22,000
between the technology and the design of Charter.

238
0:10:22.82,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I had really misunderstood the technology.

239
0:10:26.582,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The technology did suggest something to me,

240
0:10:29.91,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but it did not force my hand,

241
0:10:32.027,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and I think this happens very often.

242
0:10:34.744,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You know, engineers are very smart,

243
0:10:37.37,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and despite occasional frustrations

244
0:10:38.926,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because I'm less smart,

245
0:10:40.453,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I've always enjoyed working with them

246
0:10:42.18,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and learning from them.

247
0:10:44.258,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Apropos, in the mid-'90s,

248
0:10:46.6,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I started talking to Microsoft

249
0:10:49.291,000 --> 0:10:51,000
about screen fonts.

250
0:10:51.679,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Up to that point, all the fonts on screen

251
0:10:54.1,000 --> 0:10:56,000
had been adapted from previously existing

252
0:10:56.853,000 --> 0:10:58,000
printing fonts, of course.

253
0:10:59.23,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But Microsoft foresaw correctly

254
0:11:01.733,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the movement, the stampede

255
0:11:03.883,000 --> 0:11:05,000
towards electronic communication,

256
0:11:06.67,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to reading and writing onscreen

257
0:11:08.7,000 --> 0:11:11,000
with the printed output as being sort of secondary

258
0:11:11.833,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in importance.

259
0:11:14.056,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So the priorities were just tipping at that point.

260
0:11:17.635,000 --> 0:11:19,000
They wanted a small core set of fonts

261
0:11:19.829,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that were not adapted but designed for the screen

262
0:11:23.134,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to face up to the problems of screen,

263
0:11:25.707,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which were their coarse resolution displays.

264
0:11:29.549,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I said to Microsoft, a typeface designed

265
0:11:33.08,000 --> 0:11:34,000
for a particular technology

266
0:11:34.649,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is a self-obsoleting typeface.

267
0:11:38.024,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I've designed too many faces in the past

268
0:11:40.118,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that were intended to mitigate technical problems.

269
0:11:43.697,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Thanks to the engineers, the technical problems went away.

270
0:11:46.532,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So did my typeface.

271
0:11:49.021,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It was only a stopgap.

272
0:11:52.152,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Microsoft came back to say that

273
0:11:53.693,000 --> 0:11:54,000
affordable computer monitors

274
0:11:55.323,000 --> 0:11:56,000
with better resolutions

275
0:11:56.52,000 --> 0:11:58,000
were at least a decade away.

276
0:11:59.116,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So I thought, well, a decade, that's not bad,

277
0:12:01.77,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that's more than a stopgap.

278
0:12:04.182,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So I was persuaded, I was convinced,

279
0:12:06.183,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and we went to work on what became Verdana

280
0:12:08.505,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and Georgia,

281
0:12:10.177,000 --> 0:12:12,000
for the first time working not on paper

282
0:12:12.517,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but directly onto the screen from the pixel up.

283
0:12:16.477,000 --> 0:12:19,000
At that time, screens were binary.

284
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The pixel was either on or it was off.

285
0:12:23.37,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Here you see the outline of a letter,

286
0:12:26.225,000 --> 0:12:27,000
the cap H,

287
0:12:27.692,000 --> 0:12:29,000
which is the thin black line, the contour,

288
0:12:30.493,000 --> 0:12:32,000
which is how it is stored in memory,

289
0:12:33.369,000 --> 0:12:34,000
superimposed on the bitmap,

290
0:12:35.039,000 --> 0:12:37,000
which is the grey area,

291
0:12:37.187,000 --> 0:12:38,000
which is how it's displayed on the screen.

292
0:12:39.024,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The bitmap is rasterized from the outline.

293
0:12:42.17,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Here in a cap H, which is all straight lines,

294
0:12:44.411,000 --> 0:12:46,000
the two are in almost perfect sync

295
0:12:46.499,000 --> 0:12:5,000
on the Cartesian grid.

296
0:12:50.867,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Not so with an O.

297
0:12:53.993,000 --> 0:12:55,000
This looks more like bricklaying than type design,

298
0:12:56.72,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but believe me, this is a good bitmap O,

299
0:12:59.621,000 --> 0:13:01,000
for the simple reason that it's symmetrical

300
0:13:01.636,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in both x and y axes.

301
0:13:04.116,000 --> 0:13:06,000
In a binary bitmap, you actually can't ask

302
0:13:06.974,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for more than that.

303
0:13:08.694,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I would sometimes make, I don't know,

304
0:13:11.098,000 --> 0:13:13,000
three or four different versions of a difficult letter

305
0:13:13.454,000 --> 0:13:14,000
like a lowercase A,

306
0:13:14.96,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and then stand back to choose which was the best.

307
0:13:18.5,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Well, there was no best,

308
0:13:20.595,000 --> 0:13:22,000
so the designer's judgment comes in

309
0:13:23.02,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in trying to decide

310
0:13:24.409,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which is the least bad.

311
0:13:27.45,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Is that a compromise?

312
0:13:29.9,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Not to me, if you are working

313
0:13:31.446,000 --> 0:13:34,000
at the highest standard the technology will allow,

314
0:13:34.533,000 --> 0:13:36,000
although that standard may be

315
0:13:36.742,000 --> 0:13:38,000
well short of the ideal.

316
0:13:39.221,000 --> 0:13:4,000
You may be able to see on this slide

317
0:13:40.812,000 --> 0:13:42,000
two different bitmap fonts there.

318
0:13:42.974,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The "a" in the upper one, I think,

319
0:13:44.67,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is better than the "a" in the lower one,

320
0:13:46.583,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but it still ain't great.

321
0:13:49.159,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You can maybe see the effect better

322
0:13:51.066,000 --> 0:13:54,000
if it's reduced. Well, maybe not.

323
0:13:54.442,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So I'm a pragmatist, not an idealist,

324
0:13:56.838,000 --> 0:13:57,000
out of necessity.

325
0:13:58.341,000 --> 0:13:59,000
For a certain kind of temperament,

326
0:14:00.27,000 --> 0:14:01,000
there is a certain kind of satisfaction

327
0:14:01.97,000 --> 0:14:04,000
in doing something that cannot be perfect

328
0:14:05.608,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but can still be done to the best of your ability.

329
0:14:09.477,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Here's the lowercase H from Georgia Italic.

330
0:14:14.334,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The bitmap looks jagged and rough.

331
0:14:16.607,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It is jagged and rough.

332
0:14:18.466,000 --> 0:14:19,000
But I discovered, by experiment,

333
0:14:20.462,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that there is an optimum slant

334
0:14:23.679,000 --> 0:14:24,000
for an italic on a screen

335
0:14:25.625,000 --> 0:14:27,000
so the strokes break well

336
0:14:27.957,000 --> 0:14:29,000
at the pixel boundaries.

337
0:14:30.44,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Look in this example how, rough as it is,

338
0:14:33.221,000 --> 0:14:35,000
how the left and right legs

339
0:14:35.271,000 --> 0:14:36,000
actually break at the same level.

340
0:14:37.22,000 --> 0:14:4,000
That's a victory. That's good, right there.

341
0:14:40.74,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And of course, at the lower depths,

342
0:14:43.918,000 --> 0:14:44,000
you don't get much choice.

343
0:14:45.841,000 --> 0:14:5,000
This is an S, in case you were wondering.

344
0:14:50.886,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Well, it's been 18 years now

345
0:14:53.04,000 --> 0:14:55,000
since Verdana and Georgia were released.

346
0:14:55.69,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Microsoft were absolutely right,

347
0:14:57.78,000 --> 0:14:59,000
it took a good 10 years,

348
0:15:00.194,000 --> 0:15:02,000
but screen displays now do have

349
0:15:02.474,000 --> 0:15:04,000
improved spatial resolution,

350
0:15:04.927,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and very much improved photometric resolution

351
0:15:08.399,000 --> 0:15:11,000
thanks to anti-aliasing and so on.

352
0:15:11.553,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So now that their mission is accomplished,

353
0:15:15.25,000 --> 0:15:16,000
has that meant the demise

354
0:15:16.98,000 --> 0:15:17,000
of the screen fonts that I designed

355
0:15:18.86,000 --> 0:15:2,000
for coarser displays back then?

356
0:15:21.511,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Will they outlive the now-obsolete screens

357
0:15:24.906,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and the flood of new web fonts

358
0:15:27.078,000 --> 0:15:28,000
coming on to the market?

359
0:15:28.581,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Or have they established their own

360
0:15:30.441,000 --> 0:15:32,000
sort of evolutionary niche

361
0:15:32.679,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that is independent of technology?

362
0:15:36.416,000 --> 0:15:37,000
In other words, have they been absorbed

363
0:15:38.087,000 --> 0:15:41,000
into the typographic mainstream?

364
0:15:41.4,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I'm not sure, but they've had a good run so far.

365
0:15:45.058,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Hey, 18 is a good age for anything

366
0:15:47.553,000 --> 0:15:49,000
with present-day rates of attrition,

367
0:15:49.704,000 --> 0:15:5,000
so I'm not complaining.

368
0:15:51.618,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Thank you.

369
0:15:54.457,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Applause)

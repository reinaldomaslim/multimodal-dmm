2
0:00:13.286,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In this talk today, I want to present a different idea

3
0:00:17.774,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for why investing in early childhood education

4
0:00:21.995,000 --> 0:00:23,000
makes sense as a public investment.

5
0:00:24.694,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a different idea, because usually,

6
0:00:26.932,000 --> 0:00:27,000
when people talk about early childhood programs,

7
0:00:28.305,000 --> 0:00:31,000
they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants

8
0:00:31.646,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in terms of former participants, in preschool,

9
0:00:34.928,000 --> 0:00:36,000
they have better K-12 test scores,

10
0:00:37.193,000 --> 0:00:39,000
better adult earnings.

11
0:00:39.308,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now that's all very important,

12
0:00:41.423,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but what I want to talk about is what preschool does

13
0:00:45.519,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for state economies

14
0:00:47.341,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and for promoting state economic development.

15
0:00:50.638,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And that's actually crucial

16
0:00:53.931,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because if we're going to get increased investment

17
0:00:57.255,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in early childhood programs,

18
0:00:59.598,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we need to interest state governments in this.

19
0:01:03.121,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The federal government has a lot on its plate,

20
0:01:05.347,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and state governments are going to have to step up.

21
0:01:07.845,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So we have to appeal to them,

22
0:01:10.028,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the legislators in the state government,

23
0:01:12.581,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and turn to something they understand,

24
0:01:14.571,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that they have to promote the economic development

25
0:01:16.869,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of their state economy.

26
0:01:18.556,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now, by promoting economic development,

27
0:01:20.372,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I don't mean anything magical.

28
0:01:22.086,000 --> 0:01:25,000
All I mean is, is that early childhood education

29
0:01:25.549,000 --> 0:01:28,000
can bring more and better jobs to a state

30
0:01:29.452,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings

31
0:01:32.63,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for the state's residents.

32
0:01:34.58,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now, I think it's fair to say that when people think about

33
0:01:38.573,000 --> 0:01:4,000
state and local economic development,

34
0:01:40.577,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they don't generally think first about what they're doing

35
0:01:44.359,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about childcare and early childhood programs.

36
0:01:46.914,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs.

37
0:01:50.817,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I've talked to a lot of directors

38
0:01:52.44,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of state economic development agencies about these issues,

39
0:01:54.768,000 --> 0:01:56,000
a lot of legislators about these issues.

40
0:01:57.31,000 --> 0:02:,000
When legislators and others think about economic development,

41
0:02:00.369,000 --> 0:02:03,000
what they first of all think about are business tax incentives,

42
0:02:03.625,000 --> 0:02:05,000
property tax abatements, job creation tax credits,

43
0:02:06.503,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you know, there are a million of these programs all over the place.

44
0:02:09.19,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So for example, states compete very vigorously

45
0:02:11.796,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants.

46
0:02:15.461,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks.

47
0:02:17.601,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, those programs can make sense

48
0:02:19.799,000 --> 0:02:22,000
if they in fact induce new location decisions,

49
0:02:22.801,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and the way they can make sense is,

50
0:02:24.186,000 --> 0:02:26,000
by creating more and better jobs,

51
0:02:26.499,000 --> 0:02:29,000
they raise employment rates, raise per capita earnings of state residents.

52
0:02:30.082,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So there is a benefit to state residents

53
0:02:32.152,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that corresponds to the costs that they're paying

54
0:02:34.301,000 --> 0:02:36,000
by paying for these business tax breaks.

55
0:02:36.574,000 --> 0:02:39,000
My argument is essentially that early childhood programs

56
0:02:40.382,000 --> 0:02:43,000
can do exactly the same thing,

57
0:02:44.107,000 --> 0:02:47,000
create more and better jobs, but in a different way.

58
0:02:48.016,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's a somewhat more indirect way.

59
0:02:50.434,000 --> 0:02:53,000
These programs can promote more and better jobs by,

60
0:02:54.08,000 --> 0:02:56,000
you build it, you invest in high-quality preschool,

61
0:02:56.955,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it develops the skills of your local workforce

62
0:03:00.773,000 --> 0:03:03,000
if enough of them stick around, and, in turn,

63
0:03:04.516,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that higher-quality local workforce

64
0:03:06.669,000 --> 0:03:1,000
will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating

65
0:03:11.361,000 --> 0:03:13,000
higher earnings per capita in the local community.

66
0:03:13.869,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now, let me turn to some numbers on this.

67
0:03:16.833,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Okay. If you look at the research evidence --

68
0:03:21.416,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that's extensive -- on how much early childhood programs

69
0:03:26.079,000 --> 0:03:3,000
affect the educational attainment, wages and skills

70
0:03:30.676,000 --> 0:03:33,000
of former participants in preschool as adults,

71
0:03:34.185,000 --> 0:03:36,000
you take those known effects,

72
0:03:36.821,000 --> 0:03:38,000
you take how many of those folks will be expected

73
0:03:39.509,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to stick around the state or local economy and not move out,

74
0:03:43.21,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and you take research on how much skills

75
0:03:47.03,000 --> 0:03:5,000
drive job creation, you will conclude,

76
0:03:50.201,000 --> 0:03:52,000
from these three separate lines of research,

77
0:03:52.244,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs,

78
0:03:56.323,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the per capita earnings of state residents

79
0:03:59.776,000 --> 0:04:01,000
go up by two dollars and 78 cents,

80
0:04:02.542,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so that's a three-to-one return.

81
0:04:04.409,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now you can get much higher returns,

82
0:04:07.442,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of up to 16-to-one, if you include anti-crime benefits,

83
0:04:11.516,000 --> 0:04:15,000
if you include benefits to former preschool participants

84
0:04:16.23,000 --> 0:04:18,000
who move to some other state,

85
0:04:18.414,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars

86
0:04:21.425,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because this is salient and important

87
0:04:23.512,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to state legislators and state policy makers,

88
0:04:25.802,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it's the states that are going to have to act.

89
0:04:27.946,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So there is this key benefit that is relevant

90
0:04:31.245,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to state policy makers in terms of economic development.

91
0:04:34.494,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, one objection you often hear,

92
0:04:37.912,000 --> 0:04:41,000
or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it, is,

93
0:04:42.809,000 --> 0:04:46,000
why should I pay more taxes

94
0:04:47.272,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to invest in other people's children?

95
0:04:51.55,000 --> 0:04:53,000
What's in it for me?

96
0:04:54.044,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And the trouble with that objection,

97
0:04:56.323,000 --> 0:05:,000
it reflects a total misunderstanding

98
0:05:00.325,000 --> 0:05:03,000
of how much local economies

99
0:05:03.342,000 --> 0:05:06,000
involve everyone being interdependent.

100
0:05:06.848,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Specifically, the interdependency here is, is that

101
0:05:10.765,000 --> 0:05:13,000
there are huge spillovers of skills --

102
0:05:14.298,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that when other people's children get more skills,

103
0:05:19.618,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that actually increases the prosperity of everyone,

104
0:05:23.387,000 --> 0:05:26,000
including people whose skills don't change.

105
0:05:26.741,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So for example, numerous research studies have shown

106
0:05:29.145,000 --> 0:05:31,000
if you look at what really drives

107
0:05:31.724,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the growth rate of metropolitan areas,

108
0:05:34.188,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it's not so much low taxes, low cost, low wages;

109
0:05:39.858,000 --> 0:05:42,000
it's the skills of the area. Particularly, the proxy for skills

110
0:05:43.481,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area.

111
0:05:47.016,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So when you look, for example, at metropolitan areas

112
0:05:50.095,000 --> 0:05:53,000
such as the Boston area, Minneapolis-St. Paul,

113
0:05:53.608,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Silicon Valley, these areas are not doing well economically

114
0:05:58.944,000 --> 0:06:,000
because they're low-cost.

115
0:06:01.253,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley.

116
0:06:03.178,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's not exactly a low-cost proposition.

117
0:06:05.995,000 --> 0:06:1,000
They are growing because they have high levels of skills.

118
0:06:11.94,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So when we invest in other people's children,

119
0:06:15.095,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and build up those skills, we increase the overall job growth

120
0:06:19.28,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of a metro area.

121
0:06:20.801,000 --> 0:06:23,000
As another example, if we look

122
0:06:24.689,000 --> 0:06:27,000
at what determines an individual's wages,

123
0:06:27.924,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and we do statistical exploration of that, what determines wages,

124
0:06:32.149,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we know that the individual's wages will depend, in part,

125
0:06:36.672,000 --> 0:06:38,000
on that individual's education,

126
0:06:39.103,000 --> 0:06:41,000
for example whether or not they have a college degree.

127
0:06:42.096,000 --> 0:06:45,000
One of the very interesting facts is that, in addition,

128
0:06:45.434,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we find that even once we hold constant, statistically,

129
0:06:49.481,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the effect of your own education,

130
0:06:52.385,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area

131
0:06:55.585,000 --> 0:06:56,000
also affects your wages.

132
0:06:57.557,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So specifically, if you hold constant your education,

133
0:07:01.761,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area,

134
0:07:05.864,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages

135
0:07:09.824,000 --> 0:07:12,000
without changing your education at all.

136
0:07:13.294,000 --> 0:07:16,000
In fact, this effect is so strong

137
0:07:16.445,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that when someone gets a college degree,

138
0:07:20.258,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the spillover effects of this on the wages

139
0:07:22.699,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of others in the metropolitan area

140
0:07:24.592,000 --> 0:07:27,000
are actually greater than the direct effects.

141
0:07:27.694,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So if someone gets a college degree, their lifetime earnings

142
0:07:31.147,000 --> 0:07:34,000
go up by a huge amount, over 700,000 dollars.

143
0:07:34.462,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area

144
0:07:36.977,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area,

145
0:07:40.84,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and if you add that up -- it's a small effect for each person,

146
0:07:44.256,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area,

147
0:07:47.688,000 --> 0:07:5,000
you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else

148
0:07:51.314,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars.

149
0:07:54.227,000 --> 0:07:56,000
That's actually greater than the direct benefits

150
0:07:56.305,000 --> 0:07:59,000
of the person choosing to get education.

151
0:07:59.359,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, what's going on here?

152
0:08:00.718,000 --> 0:08:03,000
What can explain these huge spillover effects of education?

153
0:08:04.641,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Well, let's think about it this way.

154
0:08:06.115,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I can be the most skilled person in the world,

155
0:08:09.438,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills,

156
0:08:13.239,000 --> 0:08:15,000
my employer is going to find it more difficult

157
0:08:16.208,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to introduce new technology, new production techniques.

158
0:08:20.264,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So as a result, my employer is going to be less productive.

159
0:08:23.866,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages.

160
0:08:27.467,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Even if everyone at my firm has good skills,

161
0:08:31.148,000 --> 0:08:34,000
if the workers at the suppliers to my firm

162
0:08:34.656,000 --> 0:08:35,000
do not have good skills,

163
0:08:36.626,000 --> 0:08:38,000
my firm is going to be less competitive

164
0:08:39.023,000 --> 0:08:41,000
competing in national and international markets.

165
0:08:41.408,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And again, the firm that's less competitive

166
0:08:44.502,000 --> 0:08:46,000
will not be able to pay as good wages,

167
0:08:47.191,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and then, particularly in high-tech businesses,

168
0:08:51.324,000 --> 0:08:54,000
they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses.

169
0:08:54.585,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley

170
0:08:57.805,000 --> 0:09:,000
has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm,

171
0:09:01.6,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area.

172
0:09:06.019,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So as a result, if we can invest in other people's children

173
0:09:09.553,000 --> 0:09:11,000
through preschool and other early childhood programs

174
0:09:11.955,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that are high-quality, we not only help those children,

175
0:09:15.611,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we help everyone in the metropolitan area

176
0:09:19.232,000 --> 0:09:22,000
gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area

177
0:09:22.903,000 --> 0:09:24,000
gain in job growth.

178
0:09:24.925,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Another objection used sometimes here

179
0:09:27.456,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to invest in early childhood programs

180
0:09:29.684,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is concern about people moving out.

181
0:09:33.405,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, you know, maybe Ohio's thinking about investing

182
0:09:37.64,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in more preschool education

183
0:09:39.884,000 --> 0:09:42,000
for children in Columbus, Ohio,

184
0:09:43.694,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will,

185
0:09:45.953,000 --> 0:09:47,000
for some strange reason, decide to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan,

186
0:09:48.87,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and become Wolverines.

187
0:09:50.387,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing

188
0:09:53.681,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in preschool in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and be worried

189
0:09:56.122,000 --> 0:09:59,000
these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes.

190
0:09:59.357,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out.

191
0:10:03.349,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Well, the reality is, if you look at the data,

192
0:10:06.29,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Americans aren't as hyper-mobile as people sometimes assume.

193
0:10:10.503,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The data is that over 60 percent of Americans

194
0:10:15.623,000 --> 0:10:17,000
spend most of their working careers

195
0:10:18.061,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in the state they were born in, over 60 percent.

196
0:10:21.831,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That percentage does not vary much from state to state.

197
0:10:25.926,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It doesn't vary much with the state's economy,

198
0:10:29.03,000 --> 0:10:3,000
whether it's depressed or booming,

199
0:10:30.828,000 --> 0:10:32,000
it doesn't vary much over time.

200
0:10:33.149,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So the reality is, if you invest in kids,

201
0:10:38.962,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they will stay.

202
0:10:41.461,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Or at least, enough of them will stay

203
0:10:44.499,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that it will pay off for your state economy.

204
0:10:47.92,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Okay, so to sum up, there is a lot of research evidence

205
0:10:51.844,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that early childhood programs, if run in a high-quality way,

206
0:10:54.998,000 --> 0:10:56,000
pay off in higher adult skills.

207
0:10:57.854,000 --> 0:10:58,000
There's a lot of research evidence

208
0:10:59.421,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that those folks will stick around the state economy,

209
0:11:03.045,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers

210
0:11:06.362,000 --> 0:11:08,000
with higher skills in your local economy

211
0:11:08.452,000 --> 0:11:11,000
pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy,

212
0:11:12.131,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar,

213
0:11:15.574,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we get about three dollars back

214
0:11:18.303,000 --> 0:11:2,000
in benefits for the state economy.

215
0:11:20.478,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So in my opinion, the research evidence is compelling

216
0:11:24.09,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and the logic of this is compelling.

217
0:11:26.914,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So what are the barriers to getting it done?

218
0:11:30.604,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Well, one obvious barrier is cost.

219
0:11:33.868,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So if you look at what it would cost

220
0:11:38.198,000 --> 0:11:4,000
if every state government invested

221
0:11:41.025,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in universal preschool at age four, full-day preschool at age four,

222
0:11:45.23,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the total annual national cost would be roughly

223
0:11:48.645,000 --> 0:11:5,000
30 billion dollars.

224
0:11:50.95,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So, 30 billion dollars is a lot of money.

225
0:11:53.375,000 --> 0:11:56,000
On the other hand, if you reflect on

226
0:11:57.12,000 --> 0:12:,000
that the U.S.'s population is over 300 million,

227
0:12:00.98,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we're talking about an amount of money

228
0:12:03.663,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that amounts to 100 dollars per capita.

229
0:12:06.283,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Okay? A hundred dollars per capita, per person,

230
0:12:09.261,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is something that any state government can afford to do.

231
0:12:13.266,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It's just a simple matter of political will to do it.

232
0:12:18.015,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And, of course, as I mentioned,

233
0:12:19.895,000 --> 0:12:21,000
this cost has corresponding benefits.

234
0:12:22.049,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three,

235
0:12:24.225,000 --> 0:12:26,000
2.78, for the state economy,

236
0:12:26.325,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in terms of over 80 billion in extra earnings.

237
0:12:29.354,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars

238
0:12:32.378,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to something that might mean something,

239
0:12:34.271,000 --> 0:12:37,000
what we're talking about is that, for the average low-income kid,

240
0:12:37.859,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that would increase earnings by about 10 percent

241
0:12:40.976,000 --> 0:12:43,000
over their whole career, just doing the preschool,

242
0:12:44.175,000 --> 0:12:46,000
not improving K-12 or anything else after that,

243
0:12:46.69,000 --> 0:12:48,000
not doing anything with college tuition or access,

244
0:12:49.238,000 --> 0:12:51,000
just directly improving preschool,

245
0:12:51.934,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and we would get five percent higher earnings

246
0:12:54.233,000 --> 0:12:55,000
for middle-class kids.

247
0:12:55.629,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So this is an investment

248
0:12:57.694,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that pays off in very concrete terms

249
0:13:00.602,000 --> 0:13:04,000
for a broad range of income groups in the state's population

250
0:13:05.022,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and produces large and tangible benefits.

251
0:13:09.532,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Now, that's one barrier.

252
0:13:12.086,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I actually think the more profound barrier

253
0:13:15.508,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is the long-term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs.

254
0:13:19.938,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So the argument I'm making is, is that we're increasing

255
0:13:22.784,000 --> 0:13:23,000
the quality of our local workforce,

256
0:13:24.539,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and thereby increasing economic development.

257
0:13:27.205,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Obviously if we have a preschool with four-year-olds,

258
0:13:30.585,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we're not sending these kids out at age five

259
0:13:32.953,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to work in the sweatshops, right? At least I hope not.

260
0:13:36.468,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So we're talking about an investment

261
0:13:39.88,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that in terms of impacts on the state economy

262
0:13:42.35,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is not going to really pay off for 15 or 20 years,

263
0:13:46.311,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and of course America is notorious for being

264
0:13:49.169,000 --> 0:13:52,000
a short term-oriented society.

265
0:13:52.176,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Now one response you can make to this,

266
0:13:53.836,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and I sometimes have done this in talks,

267
0:13:55.361,000 --> 0:13:58,000
is people can talk about, there are benefits for these programs

268
0:13:58.438,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in reducing special ed and remedial education costs,

269
0:14:02.085,000 --> 0:14:04,000
there are benefits, parents care about preschool,

270
0:14:04.391,000 --> 0:14:06,000
maybe we'll get some migration effects

271
0:14:06.641,000 --> 0:14:08,000
from parents seeking good preschool,

272
0:14:08.959,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and I think those are true,

273
0:14:10.606,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but in some sense they're missing the point.

274
0:14:12.768,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Ultimately, this is something

275
0:14:15.339,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we're investing in now for the future.

276
0:14:19.264,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And so what I want to leave you with is

277
0:14:23.213,000 --> 0:14:25,000
what I think is the ultimate question.

278
0:14:25.519,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I mean, I'm an economist, but this is ultimately

279
0:14:28.353,000 --> 0:14:33,000
not an economic question, it's a moral question:

280
0:14:33.898,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Are we willing, as Americans,

281
0:14:38.105,000 --> 0:14:41,000
are we as a society still capable

282
0:14:41.555,000 --> 0:14:45,000
of making the political choice to sacrifice now

283
0:14:46.339,000 --> 0:14:48,000
by paying more taxes

284
0:14:48.988,000 --> 0:14:53,000
in order to improve the long-term future

285
0:14:54.193,000 --> 0:14:57,000
of not only our kids, but our community?

286
0:14:57.61,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Are we still capable of that as a country?

287
0:15:02.057,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And that's something that each and every citizen

288
0:15:04.498,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and voter needs to ask themselves.

289
0:15:07.041,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Is that something that you are still invested in,

290
0:15:09.986,000 --> 0:15:11,000
that you still believe in the notion of investment?

291
0:15:12.72,000 --> 0:15:13,000
That is the notion of investment.

292
0:15:14.119,000 --> 0:15:16,000
You sacrifice now for a return later.

293
0:15:16.693,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So I think the research evidence

294
0:15:20.331,000 --> 0:15:22,000
on the benefits of early childhood programs

295
0:15:22.969,000 --> 0:15:25,000
for the local economy is extremely strong.

296
0:15:26.576,000 --> 0:15:3,000
However, the moral and political choice

297
0:15:30.858,000 --> 0:15:35,000
is still up to us, as citizens and as voters.

298
0:15:35.962,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

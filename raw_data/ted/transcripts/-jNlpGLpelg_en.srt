1
0:00:12.858,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to tell you a story about stories.

2
0:00:17.51,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And I want to tell you this story because I think we need to remember

3
0:00:21.057,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that sometimes the stories we tell each other

4
0:00:23.273,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are more than just tales or entertainment or narratives.

5
0:00:28.482,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They're also vehicles

6
0:00:30.212,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for sowing inspiration and ideas across our societies

7
0:00:34.105,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and across time.

8
0:00:36.8,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The story I'm about to tell you

9
0:00:38.316,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is about how one of the most advanced technological achievements

10
0:00:41.405,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of the modern era

11
0:00:42.581,000 --> 0:00:43,000
has its roots in stories,

12
0:00:44.881,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and how some of the most important transformations yet to come might also.

13
0:00:50.954,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The story begins over 300 years ago,

14
0:00:53.089,000 --> 0:00:57,000
when Galileo Galilei first learned of the recent Dutch invention

15
0:00:57.409,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that took two pieces of shaped glass and put them in a long tube

16
0:01:02.103,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and thereby extended human sight farther than ever before.

17
0:01:06.005,000 --> 0:01:09,000
When Galileo turned his new telescope to the heavens

18
0:01:09.897,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and to the Moon in particular,

19
0:01:12.418,000 --> 0:01:13,000
he discovered something incredible.

20
0:01:15.121,000 --> 0:01:19,000
These are pages from Galileo's book "Sidereus Nuncius," published in 1610.

21
0:01:20.531,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And in them, he revealed to the world what he had discovered.

22
0:01:23.772,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And what he discovered was that the Moon was not just a celestial object

23
0:01:27.259,000 --> 0:01:29,000
wandering across the night sky,

24
0:01:29.434,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but rather, it was a world,

25
0:01:32.318,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a world with high, sunlit mountains

26
0:01:35.576,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and dark "mare," the Latin word for seas.

27
0:01:40.075,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And once this new world and the Moon had been discovered,

28
0:01:42.982,000 --> 0:01:46,000
people immediately began to think about how to travel there.

29
0:01:47.085,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And just as importantly,

30
0:01:49.31,000 --> 0:01:51,000
they began to write stories

31
0:01:51.419,000 --> 0:01:52,000
about how that might happen

32
0:01:53.285,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and what those voyages might be like.

33
0:01:55.679,000 --> 0:01:58,000
One of the first people to do so was actually the Bishop of Hereford,

34
0:01:59.15,000 --> 0:02:,000
a man named Francis Godwin.

35
0:02:00.835,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Godwin wrote a story about a Spanish explorer,

36
0:02:03.334,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Domingo Gonsales,

37
0:02:04.871,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who ended up marooned on the island of St. Helena

38
0:02:07.699,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in the middle of the Atlantic,

39
0:02:09.185,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and there, in an effort to get home,

40
0:02:12.05,000 --> 0:02:14,000
developed a machine, an invention,

41
0:02:14.09,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to harness the power of the local wild geese

42
0:02:17.021,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to allow him to fly --

43
0:02:18.678,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and eventually to embark on a voyage to the Moon.

44
0:02:22.016,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Godwin's book, "The Man in the Moone, or a Discourse of a Voyage Thither,"

45
0:02:26.421,000 --> 0:02:29,000
was only published posthumously and anonymously in 1638,

46
0:02:30.317,000 --> 0:02:33,000
likely on account of the number of controversial ideas that it contained,

47
0:02:34.126,000 --> 0:02:37,000
including an endorsement of the Copernican view of the universe

48
0:02:37.184,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that put the Sun at the center of the Solar System,

49
0:02:39.952,000 --> 0:02:41,000
as well as a pre-Newtonian concept of gravity

50
0:02:42.559,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that had the idea that the weight of an object

51
0:02:45.524,000 --> 0:02:47,000
would decrease with increasing distance from Earth.

52
0:02:48.801,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And that's to say nothing of his idea of a goose machine

53
0:02:51.623,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that could go to the Moon.

54
0:02:53.073,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:54.732,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And while this idea of a voyage to the Moon by goose machine

56
0:02:57.596,000 --> 0:03:01,000
might not seem particularly insightful or technically creative to us today,

57
0:03:01.763,000 --> 0:03:05,000
what's important is that Godwin described getting to the Moon not by a dream

58
0:03:06.117,000 --> 0:03:09,000
or by magic, as Johannes Kepler had written about,

59
0:03:09.522,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but rather, through human invention.

60
0:03:12.407,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And it was this idea that we could build machines

61
0:03:15.634,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that could travel into the heavens,

62
0:03:17.549,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that would plant its seed in minds across the generations.

63
0:03:22.174,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The idea was next taken up by his contemporary, John Wilkins,

64
0:03:25.077,000 --> 0:03:26,000
then just a young student at Oxford,

65
0:03:26.858,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but later, one of the founders of the Royal Society.

66
0:03:29.981,000 --> 0:03:33,000
John Wilkins took the idea of space travel in Godwin's text seriously

67
0:03:34.15,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and wrote not just another story

68
0:03:36.248,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but a nonfiction philosophical treatise,

69
0:03:39.138,000 --> 0:03:41,000
entitled, "Discovery of the New World in the Moon,

70
0:03:41.756,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or, a Discourse Tending to Prove

71
0:03:44.133,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that 'tis Probable There May Be Another Habitable World in that Planet."

72
0:03:48.93,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And note, by the way, that word "habitable."

73
0:03:51.462,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That idea in itself would have been a powerful incentive

74
0:03:54.153,000 --> 0:03:57,000
for people thinking about how to build machines that could go there.

75
0:03:57.795,000 --> 0:04:,000
In his books, Wilkins seriously considered a number of technical methods

76
0:04:01.236,000 --> 0:04:02,000
for spaceflight,

77
0:04:02.545,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it remains to this day the earliest known nonfiction account

78
0:04:06.14,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of how we might travel to the Moon.

79
0:04:08.138,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Other stories would soon follow, most notably by Cyrano de Bergerac,

80
0:04:11.4,000 --> 0:04:12,000
with his "Lunar Tales."

81
0:04:12.823,000 --> 0:04:15,000
By the mid-17th century, the idea of people building machines

82
0:04:15.871,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that could travel to the heavens

83
0:04:18.058,000 --> 0:04:21,000
was growing in complexity and technical nuance.

84
0:04:22.152,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And yet, in the late 17th century,

85
0:04:25.01,000 --> 0:04:27,000
this intellectual progress effectively ceased.

86
0:04:28.289,000 --> 0:04:3,000
People still told stories about getting to the Moon,

87
0:04:30.837,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but they relied on the old ideas

88
0:04:32.564,000 --> 0:04:35,000
or, once again, on dreams or on magic.

89
0:04:36.203,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Why?

90
0:04:37.67,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Well, because the discovery of the laws of gravity by Newton

91
0:04:41.345,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and the invention of the vacuum pump by Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle

92
0:04:46.027,000 --> 0:04:47,000
meant that people now understood

93
0:04:47.61,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that a condition of vacuum existed between the planets,

94
0:04:50.839,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and consequentially between the Earth and the Moon.

95
0:04:53.501,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And they had no way of overcoming this,

96
0:04:55.953,000 --> 0:04:57,000
no way of thinking about overcoming this.

97
0:04:58.354,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And so, for well over a century,

98
0:05:00.255,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the idea of a voyage to the Moon made very little intellectual progress

99
0:05:04.602,000 --> 0:05:06,000
until the rise of the Industrial Revolution

100
0:05:07.148,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and the development of steam engines and boilers

101
0:05:09.923,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and most importantly, pressure vessels.

102
0:05:13.03,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And these gave people the tools to think about how they could build a capsule

103
0:05:17.143,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that could resist the vacuum of space.

104
0:05:20.371,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So it was in this context, in 1835,

105
0:05:23.599,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that the next great story of spaceflight was written,

106
0:05:26.608,000 --> 0:05:27,000
by Edgar Allan Poe.

107
0:05:28.452,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now, today we think of Poe in terms of gothic poems

108
0:05:31.857,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and telltale hearts and ravens.

109
0:05:34.084,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But he considered himself a technical thinker.

110
0:05:36.788,000 --> 0:05:37,000
He grew up in Baltimore,

111
0:05:38.295,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the first American city with gas street lighting,

112
0:05:40.689,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and he was fascinated by the technological revolution

113
0:05:43.232,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that he saw going on all around him.

114
0:05:45.095,000 --> 0:05:48,000
He considered his own greatest work not to be one of his gothic tales

115
0:05:48.804,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but rather his epic prose poem "Eureka,"

116
0:05:51.384,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in which he expounded his own personal view

117
0:05:53.644,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of the cosmographical nature of the universe.

118
0:05:57.23,000 --> 0:06:,000
In his stories, he would describe in fantastical technical detail

119
0:06:00.85,000 --> 0:06:01,000
machines and contraptions,

120
0:06:02.779,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and nowhere was he more influential in this than in his short story,

121
0:06:06.565,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall."

122
0:06:10.585,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's a story of an unemployed bellows maker in Rotterdam,

123
0:06:13.303,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who, depressed and tired of life -- this is Poe, after all --

124
0:06:16.78,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and deeply in debt,

125
0:06:18.431,000 --> 0:06:22,000
he decides to build a hermetically enclosed balloon-borne carriage

126
0:06:22.785,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that is launched into the air by dynamite

127
0:06:25.253,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and from there, floats through the vacuum of space

128
0:06:27.959,000 --> 0:06:28,000
all the way to the lunar surface.

129
0:06:30.575,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And importantly, he did not develop this story alone,

130
0:06:33.547,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for in the appendix to his tale,

131
0:06:35.128,000 --> 0:06:38,000
he explicitly acknowledged Godwin's "A Man in the Moone"

132
0:06:38.843,000 --> 0:06:4,000
from over 200 years earlier

133
0:06:41.646,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as an influence,

134
0:06:43.258,000 --> 0:06:46,000
calling it "a singular and somewhat ingenious little book."

135
0:06:47.5,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And although this idea of a balloon-borne voyage to the Moon may seem

136
0:06:51.709,000 --> 0:06:54,000
not much more technically sophisticated than the goose machine,

137
0:06:55.698,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in fact, Poe was sufficiently detailed

138
0:06:58.836,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in the description of the construction of the device

139
0:07:02.052,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and in terms of the orbital dynamics of the voyage

140
0:07:05.536,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that it could be diagrammed in the very first spaceflight encyclopedia

141
0:07:09.978,000 --> 0:07:11,000
as a mission in the 1920s.

142
0:07:13.309,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it was this attention to detail, or to "verisimilitude," as he called it,

143
0:07:18.086,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that would influence the next great story:

144
0:07:20.678,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Jules Verne's "From the Earth to the Moon," written in 1865.

145
0:07:24.545,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And it's a story that has a remarkable legacy

146
0:07:27.168,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and a remarkable similarity to the real voyages to the Moon

147
0:07:30.218,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that would take place over a hundred years later.

148
0:07:32.748,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Because in the story, the first voyage to the Moon takes place from Florida,

149
0:07:37.667,000 --> 0:07:39,000
with three people on board,

150
0:07:40.098,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in a trip that takes three days --

151
0:07:42.193,000 --> 0:07:46,000
exactly the parameters that would prevail during the Apollo program itself.

152
0:07:47.268,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And in an explicit tribute to Poe's influence on him,

153
0:07:50.34,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Verne situated the group responsible for this feat in the book in Baltimore,

154
0:07:54.71,000 --> 0:07:55,000
at the Baltimore Gun Club,

155
0:07:56.11,000 --> 0:07:58,000
with its members shouting, "Cheers for Edgar Poe!"

156
0:07:58.551,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as they began to lay out their plans for their conquest of the Moon.

157
0:08:02.115,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And just as Verne was influenced by Poe,

158
0:08:04.624,000 --> 0:08:07,000
so, too, would Verne's own story go on to influence and inspire

159
0:08:08.149,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the first generation of rocket scientists.

160
0:08:10.398,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The two great pioneers of liquid fuel rocketry in Russia and in Germany,

161
0:08:13.912,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and Hermann Oberth,

162
0:08:16.391,000 --> 0:08:18,000
both traced their own commitment to the field of spaceflight

163
0:08:19.325,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to their reading "From the Earth to the Moon" as teenagers,

164
0:08:22.129,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and then subsequently committing themselves

165
0:08:24.154,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to trying to make that story a reality.

166
0:08:27.928,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And Verne's story was not the only one in the 19th century

167
0:08:30.69,000 --> 0:08:31,000
with a long arm of influence.

168
0:08:32.384,000 --> 0:08:33,000
On the other side of the Atlantic,

169
0:08:34.078,000 --> 0:08:36,000
H.G. Wells's "War of the Worlds" directly inspired

170
0:08:36.828,000 --> 0:08:38,000
a young man in Massachusetts, Robert Goddard.

171
0:08:40.356,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And it was after reading "War of the Worlds"

172
0:08:42.502,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that Goddard wrote in his diary,

173
0:08:44.094,000 --> 0:08:45,000
one day in the late 1890s,

174
0:08:46.116,000 --> 0:08:49,000
of resting while trimming a cherry tree on his family's farm

175
0:08:49.898,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and having a vision of a spacecraft taking off from the valley below

176
0:08:55.077,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and ascending into the heavens.

177
0:08:56.977,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And he decided then and there that he would commit the rest of his life

178
0:09:00.958,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to the development of the spacecraft that he saw in his mind's eye.

179
0:09:05.266,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And he did exactly that.

180
0:09:07.238,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Throughout his career, he would celebrate that day

181
0:09:09.651,000 --> 0:09:11,000
as his anniversary day, his cherry tree day,

182
0:09:12.066,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and he would regularly read and reread the works of Verne and of Wells

183
0:09:15.703,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in order to renew his inspiration and his commitment

184
0:09:19.297,000 --> 0:09:22,000
over the decades of labor and effort that would be required

185
0:09:23.127,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to realize the first part of his dream:

186
0:09:25.834,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the flight of a liquid fuel rocket,

187
0:09:27.711,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which he finally achieved in 1926.

188
0:09:30.897,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So it was while reading "From the Earth to the Moon" and "The War of the Worlds"

189
0:09:34.782,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that the first pioneers of astronautics were inspired to dedicate their lives

190
0:09:38.454,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to solving the problems of spaceflight.

191
0:09:40.349,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And it was their treatises and their works in turn

192
0:09:43.325,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that inspired the first technical communities

193
0:09:45.465,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and the first projects of spaceflight,

194
0:09:47.548,000 --> 0:09:49,000
thus creating a direct chain of influence

195
0:09:50.234,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that goes from Godwin to Poe to Verne

196
0:09:52.669,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to the Apollo program

197
0:09:54.064,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and to the present-day communities of spaceflight.

198
0:09:57.689,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So why I have told you all this?

199
0:10:00.97,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Is it just because I think it's cool,

200
0:10:03.105,000 --> 0:10:07,000
or because I'm just weirdly fascinated by stories

201
0:10:07.142,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of 17th- and 19th-century science fiction?

202
0:10:10.538,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It is, admittedly, partly that.

203
0:10:14.085,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But I also think that these stories remind us

204
0:10:16.586,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of the cultural processes driving spaceflight

205
0:10:19.496,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and even technological innovation more broadly.

206
0:10:22.582,000 --> 0:10:23,000
As an economist working at NASA,

207
0:10:24.173,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I spend time thinking about the economic origins

208
0:10:26.794,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of our movement out into the cosmos.

209
0:10:29.349,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And when you look before the investments of billionaire tech entrepreneurs

210
0:10:34.55,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and before the Cold War Space Race,

211
0:10:36.282,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and even before the military investments in liquid fuel rocketry,

212
0:10:39.819,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the economic origins of spaceflight are found in stories and in ideas.

213
0:10:46.431,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It was in these stories that the first concepts for spaceflight were articulated.

214
0:10:50.346,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And it was through these stories

215
0:10:51.921,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that the narrative of a future for humanity in space

216
0:10:56.395,000 --> 0:10:58,000
began to propagate from mind to mind,

217
0:10:58.925,000 --> 0:11:01,000
eventually creating an intergenerational intellectual community

218
0:11:02.794,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that would iterate on the ideas for spacecraft

219
0:11:05.729,000 --> 0:11:07,000
until such a time as they could finally be built.

220
0:11:09.18,000 --> 0:11:13,000
This process has now been going on for over 300 years,

221
0:11:13.237,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and the result is a culture of spaceflight.

222
0:11:17.614,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's a culture that involves thousands of people

223
0:11:19.908,000 --> 0:11:21,000
over hundreds of years.

224
0:11:21.985,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Because for hundreds of years, some of us have looked at the stars

225
0:11:25.139,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and longed to go.

226
0:11:26.355,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And because for hundreds of years,

227
0:11:28.052,000 --> 0:11:29,000
some of us have dedicated our labors

228
0:11:29.919,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to the development of the concepts and systems

229
0:11:32.42,000 --> 0:11:33,000
required to make those voyages possible.

230
0:11:35.857,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I also wanted to tell you about Godwin, Poe and Verne

231
0:11:38.508,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because I think their stories also tell us of the importance

232
0:11:42.176,000 --> 0:11:45,000
of the stories that we tell each other about the future more generally.

233
0:11:45.932,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Because these stories don't just transmit information or ideas.

234
0:11:49.279,000 --> 0:11:51,000
They can also nurture passions,

235
0:11:52.136,000 --> 0:11:54,000
passions that can lead us to dedicate our lives

236
0:11:54.405,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to the realization of important projects.

237
0:11:56.867,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Which means that these stories can and do

238
0:11:59.375,000 --> 0:12:01,000
influence social and technological forces

239
0:12:02.253,000 --> 0:12:03,000
centuries into the future.

240
0:12:05.314,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I think we need to realize this and remember it when we tell our stories.

241
0:12:09.233,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We need to work hard to write stories

242
0:12:11.109,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that don't just show us the possible dystopian paths we may take

243
0:12:14.189,000 --> 0:12:17,000
for a fear that the more dystopian stories we tell each other,

244
0:12:17.372,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the more we plant seeds for possible dystopian futures.

245
0:12:21.343,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Instead we need to tell stories that plant the seeds,

246
0:12:23.874,000 --> 0:12:24,000
if not necessarily for utopias,

247
0:12:25.426,000 --> 0:12:28,000
then at least for great new projects of technological, societal

248
0:12:29.037,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and institutional transformation.

249
0:12:31.428,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And if we think of this idea that the stories we tell each other

250
0:12:34.689,000 --> 0:12:35,000
can transform the future

251
0:12:36.351,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is fanciful or impossible,

252
0:12:38.732,000 --> 0:12:4,000
then I think we need to remember the example of this,

253
0:12:41.267,000 --> 0:12:42,000
our voyage to the Moon,

254
0:12:42.944,000 --> 0:12:44,000
an idea from the 17th century

255
0:12:45.225,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that propagated culturally for over 300 years

256
0:12:49.13,000 --> 0:12:5,000
until it could finally be realized.

257
0:12:51.842,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So, we need to write new stories,

258
0:12:55.615,000 --> 0:12:56,000
stories that, 300 years in the future,

259
0:12:57.58,000 --> 0:12:59,000
people will be able to look back upon and remark

260
0:13:00.481,000 --> 0:13:03,000
how they inspired us to new heights and to new shores,

261
0:13:03.93,000 --> 0:13:06,000
how they showed us new paths and new possibilities,

262
0:13:07.313,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and how they shaped our world for the better.

263
0:13:09.561,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Thank you.

264
0:13:10.755,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Applause)

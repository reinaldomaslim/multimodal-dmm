1
0:00:12.845,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Thank you very much.

2
0:00:14.374,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Well, I would like to start with testicles.

3
0:00:18.683,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.198,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Men who sleep five hours a night

5
0:00:23.976,000 --> 0:00:28,000
have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more.

6
0:00:29.253,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:32.078,000 --> 0:00:37,000
In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night

8
0:00:37.181,000 --> 0:00:39,000
will have a level of testosterone

9
0:00:39.721,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which is that of someone 10 years their senior.

10
0:00:45.083,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade

11
0:00:48.868,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in terms of that critical aspect of wellness.

12
0:00:53.939,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health

13
0:00:58.387,000 --> 0:00:59,000
caused by a lack of sleep.

14
0:01:03.086,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is the best news that I have for you today.

15
0:01:05.761,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:08.461,000 --> 0:01:1,000
From this point, it may only get worse.

17
0:01:10.862,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things

18
0:01:13.666,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that happen when you get sleep,

19
0:01:15.525,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough,

20
0:01:20.03,000 --> 0:01:22,000
both for your brain and for your body.

21
0:01:23.394,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Let me start with the brain

22
0:01:25.832,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and the functions of learning and memory,

23
0:01:28.861,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because what we've discovered over the past 10 or so years

24
0:01:32.154,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is that you need sleep after learning

25
0:01:35.075,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to essentially hit the save button on those new memories

26
0:01:38.386,000 --> 0:01:39,000
so that you don't forget.

27
0:01:40.948,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning

28
0:01:46.488,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to actually prepare your brain,

29
0:01:49.583,000 --> 0:01:51,000
almost like a dry sponge

30
0:01:51.663,000 --> 0:01:53,000
ready to initially soak up new information.

31
0:01:55.167,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain

32
0:01:58.303,000 --> 0:02:,000
essentially become waterlogged, as it were,

33
0:02:01.098,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and you can't absorb new memories.

34
0:02:04.179,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So let me show you the data.

35
0:02:06.092,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis

36
0:02:10.369,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea.

37
0:02:14.244,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So we took a group of individuals

38
0:02:16.627,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups:

39
0:02:20.198,000 --> 0:02:23,000
a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.

40
0:02:23.679,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber,

41
0:02:28.323,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake

42
0:02:31.015,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in the laboratory, under full supervision.

43
0:02:33.658,000 --> 0:02:37,000
There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved.

44
0:02:38.586,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And then the next day,

45
0:02:40.139,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner

46
0:02:44.463,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts

47
0:02:48.273,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as we're taking snapshots of brain activity.

48
0:02:51.596,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And then we're going to test them

49
0:02:53.599,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to see how effective that learning has been.

50
0:02:56.948,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis.

51
0:03:00.515,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And when you put those two groups head to head,

52
0:03:03.219,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit

53
0:03:08.282,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep.

54
0:03:13.044,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I think this should be concerning,

55
0:03:14.918,000 --> 0:03:16,000
considering what we know is happening to sleep

56
0:03:17.164,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in our education populations right now.

57
0:03:20.538,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In fact, to put that in context,

58
0:03:22.381,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it would be the difference in a child acing an exam

59
0:03:25.902,000 --> 0:03:27,000
versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.

60
0:03:30.294,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain

61
0:03:34.514,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to produce these types of learning disabilities.

62
0:03:38.759,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And there's a structure that sits

63
0:03:40.357,000 --> 0:03:44,000
on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus.

64
0:03:45.013,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And you can think of the hippocampus

65
0:03:46.822,000 --> 0:03:49,000
almost like the informational inbox of your brain.

66
0:03:50.634,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's very good at receiving new memory files

67
0:03:53.849,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and then holding on to them.

68
0:03:56.931,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And when you look at this structure

69
0:03:58.666,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in those people who'd had a full night of sleep,

70
0:04:01.752,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity.

71
0:04:06.644,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived,

72
0:04:09.627,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.

73
0:04:14.732,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox,

74
0:04:19.737,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and any new incoming files -- they were just being bounced.

75
0:04:23.898,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.

76
0:04:30.062,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you,

77
0:04:34.585,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but let me just come back to that control group for a second.

78
0:04:38.444,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep?

79
0:04:42.418,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Well, we can ask a very different question:

80
0:04:44.918,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep

81
0:04:48.546,000 --> 0:04:49,000
when you do get it

82
0:04:50.117,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability

83
0:04:53.953,000 --> 0:04:54,000
each and every day?

84
0:04:56.004,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And by placing electrodes all over the head,

85
0:04:59.01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves

86
0:05:03.081,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep

87
0:05:06.724,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that have riding on top of them

88
0:05:09.033,000 --> 0:05:12,000
these spectacular bursts of electrical activity

89
0:05:12.331,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that we call sleep spindles.

90
0:05:15.066,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves

91
0:05:19.512,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night,

92
0:05:23.997,000 --> 0:05:27,000
shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir

93
0:05:28.092,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain,

94
0:05:32.458,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and therefore protecting them, making them safe.

95
0:05:37.467,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And it is important that we understand

96
0:05:39.53,000 --> 0:05:44,000
what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits,

97
0:05:44.613,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because there are real medical and societal implications.

98
0:05:48.771,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And let me just tell you about one area

99
0:05:50.812,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that we've moved this work out into, clinically,

100
0:05:54.272,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which is the context of aging and dementia.

101
0:05:58.87,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older,

102
0:06:02.319,000 --> 0:06:05,000
our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline.

103
0:06:07.051,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But what we've also discovered

104
0:06:08.693,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse,

105
0:06:15.502,000 --> 0:06:18,000
especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing.

106
0:06:20.62,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And only last year, we finally published evidence

107
0:06:23.758,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring,

108
0:06:26.741,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they are significantly interrelated.

109
0:06:30.837,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep

110
0:06:34.148,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is an underappreciated factor

111
0:06:36.466,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline

112
0:06:40.403,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in aging, and most recently we've discovered,

113
0:06:44.005,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in Alzheimer's disease as well.

114
0:06:48.329,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news.

115
0:06:52.092,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's in the mail. It's coming at you.

116
0:06:54.419,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But there's a potential silver lining here.

117
0:06:57.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging,

118
0:07:02.642,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for example changes in the physical structure of the brain,

119
0:07:06.325,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that's fiendishly difficult to treat.

120
0:07:09.411,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle

121
0:07:13.991,000 --> 0:07:15,000
of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting

122
0:07:16.61,000 --> 0:07:18,000
because we may be able to do something about it.

123
0:07:20.53,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center

124
0:07:24.485,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is not by using sleeping pills, by the way.

125
0:07:27.517,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep.

126
0:07:33.532,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this.

127
0:07:36.803,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's called direct current brain stimulation.

128
0:07:40.042,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain,

129
0:07:43.347,000 --> 0:07:45,000
so small you typically don't feel it,

130
0:07:45.609,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but it has a measurable impact.

131
0:07:48.826,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults,

132
0:07:55.191,000 --> 0:07:59,000
as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves,

133
0:07:59.93,000 --> 0:08:03,000
not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,

134
0:08:04.496,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit

135
0:08:09.064,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that you get from sleep.

136
0:08:11.122,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The question now is whether we can translate

137
0:08:13.961,000 --> 0:08:17,000
this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology

138
0:08:18.286,000 --> 0:08:2,000
into older adults and those with dementia.

139
0:08:22.726,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep,

140
0:08:27.336,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning

141
0:08:31.979,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and memory function?

142
0:08:33.487,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That is my real hope now.

143
0:08:36.378,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were.

144
0:08:41.335,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So that's an example of sleep for your brain,

145
0:08:44.717,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but sleep is just as essential for your body.

146
0:08:49.276,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system.

147
0:08:53.863,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system,

148
0:08:58.749,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and that all it takes is one hour.

149
0:09:01.947,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people

150
0:09:07.479,000 --> 0:09:11,000
across 70 countries twice a year,

151
0:09:11.78,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and it's called daylight saving time.

152
0:09:14.907,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep,

153
0:09:18.389,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day.

154
0:09:26.952,000 --> 0:09:29,000
In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep,

155
0:09:30.151,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks.

156
0:09:35.752,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Isn't that incredible?

157
0:09:38.929,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents,

158
0:09:44.629,000 --> 0:09:45,000
even suicide rates.

159
0:09:48.928,000 --> 0:09:5,000
But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this:

160
0:09:51.857,000 --> 0:09:53,000
sleep loss and your immune system.

161
0:09:55.149,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image.

162
0:10:00.015,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They are called natural killer cells,

163
0:10:03.217,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents

164
0:10:08.091,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of your immune system.

165
0:10:09.726,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements

166
0:10:14.733,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and eliminating them.

167
0:10:17.253,000 --> 0:10:2,000
In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.

168
0:10:22.586,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins

169
0:10:28.546,000 --> 0:10:3,000
at all times,

170
0:10:30.626,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough.

171
0:10:35.825,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So here in this experiment,

172
0:10:37.493,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night,

173
0:10:41.346,000 --> 0:10:44,000
you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours

174
0:10:44.881,000 --> 0:10:45,000
for one single night,

175
0:10:46.683,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction

176
0:10:49.708,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in immune cell activity that you suffer.

177
0:10:52.774,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,

178
0:10:55.627,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it's not 20 percent.

179
0:10:57.654,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity.

180
0:11:03.786,000 --> 0:11:07,000
That's a concerning state of immune deficiency,

181
0:11:09.358,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding

182
0:11:12.199,000 --> 0:11:15,000
significant links between short sleep duration

183
0:11:16.079,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer.

184
0:11:21.892,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel,

185
0:11:24.699,000 --> 0:11:27,000
cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast.

186
0:11:29.853,000 --> 0:11:34,000
In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong

187
0:11:35.233,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that the World Health Organization

188
0:11:37.639,000 --> 0:11:41,000
has classified any form of nighttime shift work

189
0:11:41.853,000 --> 0:11:44,000
as a probable carcinogen,

190
0:11:45.059,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms.

191
0:11:49.83,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So you may have heard of that old maxim

192
0:11:52.584,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that you can sleep when you're dead.

193
0:11:54.72,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Well, I'm being quite serious now --

194
0:11:56.814,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it is mortally unwise advice.

195
0:12:00.375,000 --> 0:12:05,000
We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals.

196
0:12:05.436,000 --> 0:12:06,000
There's a simple truth:

197
0:12:07.441,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.

198
0:12:10.869,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.

199
0:12:16.94,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer

200
0:12:21.133,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or even Alzheimer's disease

201
0:12:23.401,000 --> 0:12:27,000
were not sufficiently disquieting,

202
0:12:27.601,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode

203
0:12:31.323,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the very fabric of biological life itself,

204
0:12:36.681,000 --> 0:12:37,000
your DNA genetic code.

205
0:12:40.038,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults

206
0:12:43.998,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night

207
0:12:47.761,000 --> 0:12:48,000
for one week,

208
0:12:49.436,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile

209
0:12:53.257,000 --> 0:12:55,000
relative to when those same individuals

210
0:12:55.725,000 --> 0:12:57,000
were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night.

211
0:12:59.451,000 --> 0:13:,000
And there were two critical findings.

212
0:13:02.204,000 --> 0:13:07,000
First, a sizable and significant 711 genes

213
0:13:07.299,000 --> 0:13:09,000
were distorted in their activity,

214
0:13:09.651,000 --> 0:13:1,000
caused by a lack of sleep.

215
0:13:11.923,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The second result was that about half of those genes

216
0:13:15.074,000 --> 0:13:17,000
were actually increased in their activity.

217
0:13:17.842,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The other half were decreased.

218
0:13:20.448,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep

219
0:13:23.753,000 --> 0:13:26,000
were genes associated with your immune system,

220
0:13:27.266,000 --> 0:13:29,000
so once again, you can see that immune deficiency.

221
0:13:31.348,000 --> 0:13:34,000
In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated

222
0:13:34.445,000 --> 0:13:36,000
or increased by way of a lack of sleep,

223
0:13:36.841,000 --> 0:13:39,000
were genes associated with the promotion of tumors,

224
0:13:40.763,000 --> 0:13:45,000
genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body,

225
0:13:45.938,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and genes associated with stress,

226
0:13:48.764,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.

227
0:13:53.171,000 --> 0:13:56,000
There is simply no aspect of your wellness

228
0:13:56.855,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation

229
0:14:00.146,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and get away unscathed.

230
0:14:02.912,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home.

231
0:14:05.944,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny

232
0:14:09.611,000 --> 0:14:11,000
of your physiology,

233
0:14:12.021,000 --> 0:14:15,000
even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet

234
0:14:15.95,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that spells out your daily health narrative.

235
0:14:21.866,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And at this point, you may be thinking,

236
0:14:24.573,000 --> 0:14:26,000
"Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep?

237
0:14:27.129,000 --> 0:14:29,000
What are you tips for good sleep?"

238
0:14:30.08,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact

239
0:14:34.582,000 --> 0:14:36,000
of alcohol and caffeine on sleep,

240
0:14:37.525,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and if you're struggling with sleep at night,

241
0:14:39.986,000 --> 0:14:41,000
avoiding naps during the day,

242
0:14:42.191,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I have two pieces of advice for you.

243
0:14:45.104,000 --> 0:14:47,000
The first is regularity.

244
0:14:47.942,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time,

245
0:14:51.367,000 --> 0:14:54,000
no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.

246
0:14:54.452,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Regularity is king,

247
0:14:57.221,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and it will anchor your sleep

248
0:14:59.206,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep.

249
0:15:04.372,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The second is keep it cool.

250
0:15:08.088,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Your body needs to drop its core temperature

251
0:15:10.539,000 --> 0:15:14,000
by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep

252
0:15:14.776,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and then to stay asleep,

253
0:15:16.88,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and it's the reason you will always find it easier

254
0:15:19.396,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to fall asleep in a room that's too cold

255
0:15:21.801,000 --> 0:15:22,000
than too hot.

256
0:15:24.013,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees,

257
0:15:27.553,000 --> 0:15:28,000
or about 18 degrees Celsius.

258
0:15:29.531,000 --> 0:15:31,000
That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people.

259
0:15:34.446,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And then finally, in taking a step back, then,

260
0:15:37.967,000 --> 0:15:4,000
what is the mission-critical statement here?

261
0:15:42.771,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Well, I think it may be this:

262
0:15:45.011,000 --> 0:15:5,000
sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury.

263
0:15:51.105,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity.

264
0:15:56.892,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It is your life-support system,

265
0:16:00.507,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality.

266
0:16:06.709,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations

267
0:16:11.249,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness,

268
0:16:16.49,000 --> 0:16:18,000
even the safety and the education of our children.

269
0:16:20.323,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It's a silent sleep loss epidemic,

270
0:16:23.363,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges

271
0:16:26.752,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that we face in the 21st century.

272
0:16:32.294,000 --> 0:16:37,000
I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right

273
0:16:37.401,000 --> 0:16:38,000
to a full night of sleep,

274
0:16:40.012,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and without embarrassment

275
0:16:42.193,000 --> 0:16:45,000
or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.

276
0:16:46.638,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life,

277
0:16:54.038,000 --> 0:16:56,000
the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were.

278
0:16:58.667,000 --> 0:17:,000
And with that soapbox rant over,

279
0:17:01.335,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I will simply say, good night, good luck,

280
0:17:03.454,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and above all ...

281
0:17:06.889,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I do hope you sleep well.

282
0:17:08.675,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Thank you very much indeed.

283
0:17:10.057,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause)

284
0:17:14.612,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Thank you.

285
0:17:15.794,000 --> 0:17:17,000
(Applause)

286
0:17:18.66,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Thank you so much.

287
0:17:20.227,000 --> 0:17:22,000
David Biello: No, no, no. Stay there for a second.

288
0:17:22.994,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Good job not running away, though. I appreciate that.

289
0:17:25.57,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So that was terrifying.

290
0:17:26.838,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Matt Walker: You're welcome. DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.

291
0:17:30.314,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do?

292
0:17:35.514,000 --> 0:17:38,000
What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night

293
0:17:39.07,000 --> 0:17:42,000
or doing shift work or whatever else?

294
0:17:42.156,000 --> 0:17:44,000
MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep.

295
0:17:44.521,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Sleep is not like the bank.

296
0:17:45.87,000 --> 0:17:47,000
You can't accumulate a debt

297
0:17:47.934,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time.

298
0:17:50.65,000 --> 0:17:53,000
I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic

299
0:17:53.818,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and that our health deteriorates so quickly,

300
0:17:56.896,000 --> 0:17:58,000
first, it's because human beings are the only species

301
0:17:59.657,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep

302
0:18:02.159,000 --> 0:18:04,000
for no apparent reason.

303
0:18:04.572,000 --> 0:18:05,000
DB: Because we're smart.

304
0:18:05.748,000 --> 0:18:09,000
MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature,

305
0:18:10.597,000 --> 0:18:11,000
throughout the course of evolution,

306
0:18:12.311,000 --> 0:18:16,000
has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation.

307
0:18:17.295,000 --> 0:18:2,000
So she's never developed a safety net,

308
0:18:20.731,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and that's why when you undersleep,

309
0:18:22.883,000 --> 0:18:26,000
things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body.

310
0:18:27.241,000 --> 0:18:29,000
So you just have to prioritize.

311
0:18:30.038,000 --> 0:18:33,000
DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed,

312
0:18:33.364,000 --> 0:18:34,000
what do I do?

313
0:18:34.799,000 --> 0:18:38,000
MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long,

314
0:18:39.442,000 --> 0:18:42,000
you should get out of bed and go to a different room

315
0:18:42.719,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and do something different.

316
0:18:44.056,000 --> 0:18:48,000
The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom

317
0:18:48.401,000 --> 0:18:5,000
with the place of wakefulness,

318
0:18:50.744,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and you need to break that association.

319
0:18:53.457,000 --> 0:18:55,000
So only return to bed when you are sleepy,

320
0:18:56.378,000 --> 0:18:59,000
and that way you will relearn the association that you once had,

321
0:18:59.941,000 --> 0:19:01,000
which is your bed is the place of sleep.

322
0:19:02.473,000 --> 0:19:03,000
So the analogy would be,

323
0:19:04.156,000 --> 0:19:07,000
you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry,

324
0:19:07.756,000 --> 0:19:09,000
so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy?

325
0:19:11.548,000 --> 0:19:13,000
DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.

326
0:19:13.572,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Great job, Matt.

327
0:19:14.765,000 --> 0:19:16,000
MW: You're very welcome. Thank you very much.

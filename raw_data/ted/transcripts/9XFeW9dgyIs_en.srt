1
0:00:13.014,000 --> 0:00:14,000
You may be wondering

2
0:00:14.23,000 --> 0:00:15,000
why a marine biologist from Oceana

3
0:00:16.064,000 --> 0:00:17,000
would come here today to talk to you

4
0:00:17.904,000 --> 0:00:18,000
about world hunger.

5
0:00:19.14,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm here today because

6
0:00:21.291,000 --> 0:00:24,000
saving the oceans is more than an ecological desire.

7
0:00:24.526,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's more than a thing we're doing

8
0:00:26.67,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because we want to create jobs for fishermen

9
0:00:28.468,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or preserve fishermen's jobs.

10
0:00:30.552,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's more than an economic pursuit.

11
0:00:33.9,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Saving the oceans can feed the world.

12
0:00:36.512,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Let me show you how.

13
0:00:38.338,000 --> 0:00:39,000
As you know, there are already

14
0:00:40.14,000 --> 0:00:42,000
more than a billion hungry people on this planet.

15
0:00:42.766,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We're expecting that problem to get worse

16
0:00:45.116,000 --> 0:00:47,000
as world population grows to nine billion

17
0:00:47.546,000 --> 0:00:48,000
or 10 billion by midcentury,

18
0:00:49.41,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we can expect to have greater pressure

19
0:00:52.388,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on our food resources.

20
0:00:54.246,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And this is a big concern,

21
0:00:55.29,000 --> 0:00:57,000
especially considering where we are now.

22
0:00:57.956,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now we know that our arable land per capita

23
0:01:00.668,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is already on the decline

24
0:01:02.096,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in both developed and developing countries.

25
0:01:04.805,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We know that we're headed for climate change,

26
0:01:07.46,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which is going to change rainfall patterns,

27
0:01:09.876,000 --> 0:01:12,000
making some areas drier, as you can see in orange,

28
0:01:13.186,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and others wetter, in blue,

29
0:01:15.497,000 --> 0:01:16,000
causing droughts in our breadbaskets,

30
0:01:17.24,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in places like the Midwest and Central Europe,

31
0:01:19.09,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and floods in others.

32
0:01:20.372,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It's going to make it harder for the land

33
0:01:22.134,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to help us solve the hunger problem.

34
0:01:24.69,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And that's why the oceans need to be their most abundant,

35
0:01:27.154,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so that the oceans can provide us

36
0:01:28.728,000 --> 0:01:3,000
as much food as possible.

37
0:01:31.321,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And that's something the oceans have been doing

38
0:01:32.968,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for us for a long time.

39
0:01:35.61,000 --> 0:01:37,000
As far back as we can go, we've seen an increase

40
0:01:38.29,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in the amount of food we've been able to harvest

41
0:01:40.233,000 --> 0:01:41,000
from our oceans.

42
0:01:41.897,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It just seemed like it was continuing to increase,

43
0:01:44.385,000 --> 0:01:45,000
until about 1980,

44
0:01:45.789,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when we started to see a decline.

45
0:01:48.585,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You've heard of peak oil.

46
0:01:50.183,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Maybe this is peak fish.

47
0:01:52.17,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I hope not. I'm going to come back to that.

48
0:01:53.97,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But you can see about an 18-percent decline

49
0:01:56.473,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in the amount of fish we've gotten in our world catch

50
0:01:59.425,000 --> 0:02:,000
since 1980.

51
0:02:00.78,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And this is a big problem. It's continuing.

52
0:02:03.04,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This red line is continuing to go down.

53
0:02:05.397,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But we know how to turn it around,

54
0:02:07.493,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and that's what I'm going to talk about today.

55
0:02:09.183,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We know how to turn that curve back upwards.

56
0:02:11.583,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This doesn't have to be peak fish.

57
0:02:14.03,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If we do a few simple things in targeted places,

58
0:02:17.219,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we can bring our fisheries back and use them

59
0:02:19.702,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to feed people.

60
0:02:21.966,000 --> 0:02:22,000
First we want to know where the fish are,

61
0:02:23.886,000 --> 0:02:24,000
so let's look where the fish are.

62
0:02:25.457,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It turns out the fish, conveniently,

63
0:02:27.351,000 --> 0:02:29,000
are located for the most part

64
0:02:29.567,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in our coastal areas of the countries,

65
0:02:31.63,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in coastal zones,

66
0:02:32.935,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and these are areas that national jurisdictions

67
0:02:35.339,000 --> 0:02:36,000
have control over,

68
0:02:36.721,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and they can manage their fisheries

69
0:02:38.545,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in these coastal areas.

70
0:02:40.204,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Coastal countries tend to have jurisdictions

71
0:02:42.462,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that go out about 200 nautical miles,

72
0:02:45.07,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in areas that are called exclusive economic zones,

73
0:02:48.441,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and this is a good thing that they can control

74
0:02:50.434,000 --> 0:02:51,000
their fisheries in these areas,

75
0:02:51.595,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because the high seas,

76
0:02:53.111,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which are the darker areas on this map,

77
0:02:55.404,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the high seas, it's a lot harder to control things,

78
0:02:57.603,000 --> 0:02:59,000
because it has to be done internationally.

79
0:02:59.692,000 --> 0:03:,000
You get into international agreements,

80
0:03:01.559,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and if any of you are tracking the climate change agreement,

81
0:03:03.807,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you know this can be a very slow,

82
0:03:05.519,000 --> 0:03:06,000
frustrating, tedious process.

83
0:03:07.501,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And so controlling things nationally

84
0:03:09.223,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is a great thing to be able to do.

85
0:03:11.997,000 --> 0:03:13,000
How many fish are actually in these coastal areas

86
0:03:14.194,000 --> 0:03:15,000
compared to the high seas?

87
0:03:15.771,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well, you can see here about

88
0:03:17.281,000 --> 0:03:2,000
seven times as many fish in the coastal areas

89
0:03:20.364,000 --> 0:03:21,000
than there are in the high seas,

90
0:03:21.951,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so this is a perfect place for us to be focusing,

91
0:03:24.167,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because we can actually get a lot done.

92
0:03:26.311,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We can restore a lot of our fisheries

93
0:03:28.701,000 --> 0:03:3,000
if we focus in these coastal areas.

94
0:03:30.895,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But how many of these countries do we have to work in?

95
0:03:33.919,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There's something like 80 coastal countries.

96
0:03:35.521,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Do we have to fix fisheries management

97
0:03:37.507,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in all of those countries?

98
0:03:38.91,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So we asked ourselves, how many countries

99
0:03:41.032,000 --> 0:03:42,000
do we need to focus on,

100
0:03:42.439,000 --> 0:03:43,000
keeping in mind that the European Union

101
0:03:44.301,000 --> 0:03:45,000
conveniently manages its fisheries

102
0:03:45.87,000 --> 0:03:47,000
through a common fisheries policy?

103
0:03:48.237,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So if we got good fisheries management

104
0:03:50.529,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in the European Union and, say, nine other countries,

105
0:03:53.794,000 --> 0:03:55,000
how much of our fisheries would we be covering?

106
0:03:55.883,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Turns out, European Union plus nine countries

107
0:03:58.94,000 --> 0:04:01,000
covers about two thirds of the world's fish catch.

108
0:04:02.054,000 --> 0:04:05,000
If we took it up to 24 countries plus the European Union,

109
0:04:05.333,000 --> 0:04:06,000
we would up to 90 percent,

110
0:04:07.055,000 --> 0:04:1,000
almost all of the world's fish catch.

111
0:04:10.265,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So we think we can work in a limited number of places

112
0:04:13.193,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to make the fisheries come back.

113
0:04:14.885,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But what do we have to do in these places?

114
0:04:17.497,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Well, based on our work in the United States

115
0:04:19.292,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and elsewhere, we know that there are

116
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:21,000
three key things we have to do

117
0:04:22.721,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to bring fisheries back, and they are:

118
0:04:25.427,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We need to set quotas or limits

119
0:04:27.373,000 --> 0:04:29,000
on how much we take;

120
0:04:29.48,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we need to reduce bycatch, which is the accidental

121
0:04:32.273,000 --> 0:04:34,000
catching and killing of fish that we're not targeting,

122
0:04:34.609,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and it's very wasteful;

123
0:04:36.459,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and three, we need to protect habitats,

124
0:04:39.123,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the nursery areas, the spawning areas

125
0:04:41.24,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that these fish need to grow and reproduce successfully

126
0:04:43.81,000 --> 0:04:44,000
so that they can rebuild their populations.

127
0:04:45.66,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If we do those three things, we know the fisheries will come back.

128
0:04:49.422,000 --> 0:04:5,000
How do we know?

129
0:04:50.77,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We know because we've seen it happening

130
0:04:52.785,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in a lot of different places.

131
0:04:54.213,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This is a slide that shows

132
0:04:55.654,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the herring population in Norway

133
0:04:57.852,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that was crashing since the 1950s.

134
0:05:00.175,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It was coming down, and when Norway set limits,

135
0:05:02.326,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or quotas, on its fishery, what happens?

136
0:05:05.244,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The fishery comes back.

137
0:05:07.11,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This is another example, also happens to be from Norway,

138
0:05:10.01,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of the Norwegian Arctic cod.

139
0:05:12.468,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Same deal. The fishery is crashing.

140
0:05:14.524,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They set limits on discards.

141
0:05:16.484,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Discards are these fish they weren't targeting

142
0:05:18.598,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and they get thrown overboard wastefully.

143
0:05:21.2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When they set the discard limit,

144
0:05:22.812,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the fishery came back.

145
0:05:24.868,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And it's not just in Norway.

146
0:05:26.135,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We've seen this happening in countries

147
0:05:28.094,000 --> 0:05:31,000
all around the world, time and time again.

148
0:05:31.153,000 --> 0:05:32,000
When these countries step in and they

149
0:05:32.686,000 --> 0:05:35,000
put in sustainable fisheries management policies,

150
0:05:35.82,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the fisheries, which are always crashing, it seems,

151
0:05:38.636,000 --> 0:05:39,000
are starting to come back.

152
0:05:40.574,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So there's a lot of promise here.

153
0:05:42.432,000 --> 0:05:43,000
What does this mean for the world fish catch?

154
0:05:44.124,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This means that if we take that fishery catch

155
0:05:46.46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that's on the decline

156
0:05:47.49,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and we could turn it upwards, we could increase it

157
0:05:49.878,000 --> 0:05:52,000
up to 100 million metric tons per year.

158
0:05:53.416,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So we didn't have peak fish yet.

159
0:05:55.389,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We still have an opportunity

160
0:05:56.916,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to not only bring the fish back

161
0:05:58.217,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but to actually get more fish

162
0:05:59.92,000 --> 0:06:,000
that can feed more people

163
0:06:01.371,000 --> 0:06:02,000
than we currently are now.

164
0:06:02.873,000 --> 0:06:04,000
How many more? Right about now,

165
0:06:04.979,000 --> 0:06:06,000
we can feed about 450 million people

166
0:06:07.86,000 --> 0:06:07,000
a fish meal a day

167
0:06:08.834,000 --> 0:06:1,000
based on the current world fish catch,

168
0:06:11.084,000 --> 0:06:13,000
which, of course, you know is going down,

169
0:06:13.548,000 --> 0:06:14,000
so that number will go down over time

170
0:06:15.203,000 --> 0:06:16,000
if we don't fix it,

171
0:06:16.806,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but if we put fishery management practices

172
0:06:19.216,000 --> 0:06:21,000
like the ones I've described in place

173
0:06:21.78,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in 10 to 25 countries,

174
0:06:23.885,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we could bring that number up

175
0:06:25.364,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and feed as many as 700 million people a year

176
0:06:28.918,000 --> 0:06:29,000
a healthy fish meal.

177
0:06:30.466,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We should obviously do this just because

178
0:06:32.008,000 --> 0:06:34,000
it's a good thing to deal with the hunger problem,

179
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but it's also cost-effective.

180
0:06:36.177,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It turns out fish is the most cost-effective protein

181
0:06:40.524,000 --> 0:06:41,000
on the planet.

182
0:06:41.9,000 --> 0:06:43,000
If you look at how much fish protein you get

183
0:06:44.03,000 --> 0:06:45,000
per dollar invested

184
0:06:45.03,000 --> 0:06:47,000
compared to all of the other animal proteins,

185
0:06:47.762,000 --> 0:06:49,000
obviously, fish is a good business decision.

186
0:06:50.692,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It also doesn't need a lot of land,

187
0:06:52.292,000 --> 0:06:53,000
something that's in short supply,

188
0:06:53.758,000 --> 0:06:56,000
compared to other protein sources.

189
0:06:57.276,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And it doesn't need a lot of fresh water.

190
0:06:59.907,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It uses a lot less fresh water than,

191
0:07:01.979,000 --> 0:07:02,000
for example, cattle,

192
0:07:03.02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
where you have to irrigate a field

193
0:07:05.174,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so that you can grow the food to graze the cattle.

194
0:07:08.317,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It also has a very low carbon footprint.

195
0:07:10.436,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It has a little bit of a carbon footprint

196
0:07:12.316,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because we do have to get out and catch the fish.

197
0:07:14.315,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It takes a little bit of fuel,

198
0:07:15.81,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but as you know, agriculture can have a carbon footprint,

199
0:07:18.032,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and fish has a much smaller one,

200
0:07:19.586,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so it's less polluting.

201
0:07:21.36,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's already a big part of our diet,

202
0:07:23.741,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but it can be a bigger part of our diet,

203
0:07:25.83,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which is a good thing, because we know

204
0:07:27.561,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that it's healthy for us.

205
0:07:29.186,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It can reduce our risks of cancer,

206
0:07:31.511,000 --> 0:07:32,000
heart disease and obesity.

207
0:07:33.4,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In fact, our CEO Andy Sharpless,

208
0:07:35.371,000 --> 0:07:37,000
who is the originator of this concept, actually,

209
0:07:37.96,000 --> 0:07:4,000
he likes to say fish is the perfect protein.

210
0:07:41.88,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Andy also talks about the fact that

211
0:07:44.13,000 --> 0:07:46,000
our ocean conservation movement really grew

212
0:07:46.636,000 --> 0:07:48,000
out of the land conservation movement,

213
0:07:48.868,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and in land conservation,

214
0:07:50.36,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we have this problem where biodiversity

215
0:07:53.424,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is at war with food production.

216
0:07:56.424,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You have to cut down the biodiverse forest

217
0:07:59.215,000 --> 0:08:,000
if you want to get the field

218
0:08:01.108,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to grow the corn to feed people with,

219
0:08:03.338,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and so there's a constant push-pull there.

220
0:08:05.18,000 --> 0:08:06,000
There's a constant tough decision

221
0:08:06.728,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that has to be made between

222
0:08:08.567,000 --> 0:08:1,000
two very important things:

223
0:08:10.588,000 --> 0:08:13,000
maintaining biodiversity and feeding people.

224
0:08:13.681,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But in the oceans, we don't have that war.

225
0:08:15.981,000 --> 0:08:17,000
In the oceans, biodiversity is not at war

226
0:08:18.538,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with abundance.

227
0:08:19.7,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In fact, they're aligned.

228
0:08:21.805,000 --> 0:08:24,000
When we do things that produce biodiversity,

229
0:08:24.978,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we actually get more abundance,

230
0:08:27.03,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and that's important so that we can feed people.

231
0:08:30.846,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, there's a catch.

232
0:08:33.576,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Didn't anyone get that? (Laughter)

233
0:08:36.121,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Illegal fishing.

234
0:08:38.164,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Illegal fishing undermines the type of

235
0:08:39.73,000 --> 0:08:41,000
sustainable fisheries management I'm talking about.

236
0:08:41.98,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It can be when you catch fish using gears

237
0:08:44.46,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that have been prohibited,

238
0:08:45.489,000 --> 0:08:47,000
when you fish in places where you're not supposed to fish,

239
0:08:48.14,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you catch fish that are the wrong size or the wrong species.

240
0:08:51.378,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Illegal fishing cheats the consumer

241
0:08:53.343,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and it also cheats honest fishermen,

242
0:08:55.55,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and it needs to stop.

243
0:08:56.71,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The way illegal fish get into our market is through seafood fraud.

244
0:08:59.787,000 --> 0:09:,000
You might have heard about this.

245
0:09:01.236,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's when fish are labeled as something they're not.

246
0:09:04.42,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Think about the last time you had fish.

247
0:09:05.955,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What were you eating?

248
0:09:06.745,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Are you sure that's what it was?

249
0:09:08.516,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Because we tested 1,300 different fish samples

250
0:09:11.24,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and about a third of them

251
0:09:12.482,000 --> 0:09:13,000
were not what they were labeled to be.

252
0:09:14.22,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Snappers, nine out of 10 snappers were not snapper.

253
0:09:16.96,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Fifty-nine percent of the tuna we tested

254
0:09:19.18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
was mislabeled.

255
0:09:21.15,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And red snapper, we tested 120 samples,

256
0:09:23.778,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and only seven of them were really red snapper,

257
0:09:25.694,000 --> 0:09:28,000
so good luck finding a red snapper.

258
0:09:29.238,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Seafood has a really complex supply chain,

259
0:09:31.466,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and at every step in this supply chain,

260
0:09:33.762,000 --> 0:09:35,000
there's an opportunity for seafood fraud,

261
0:09:35.952,000 --> 0:09:37,000
unless we have traceability.

262
0:09:38.08,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Traceability is a way where the seafood industry

263
0:09:40.799,000 --> 0:09:42,000
can track the seafood from the boat to the plate

264
0:09:43.096,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to make sure that the consumer can then find out

265
0:09:45.627,000 --> 0:09:46,000
where their seafood came from.

266
0:09:47.274,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This is a really important thing.

267
0:09:49.03,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's being done by some in the industry, but not enough,

268
0:09:51.598,000 --> 0:09:52,000
so we're pushing a law in Congress

269
0:09:52.945,000 --> 0:09:53,000
called the SAFE Seafood Act,

270
0:09:54.351,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and I'm very excited today to announce the release

271
0:09:56.99,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of a chef's petition, where 450 chefs

272
0:09:59.634,000 --> 0:10:01,000
have signed a petition calling on Congress

273
0:10:02.306,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to support the SAFE Seafood Act.

274
0:10:04.508,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It has a lot of celebrity chefs you may know --

275
0:10:06.336,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Anthony Bourdain, Mario Batali,

276
0:10:09.54,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Barton Seaver and others —

277
0:10:11.216,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and they've signed it because they believe

278
0:10:12.97,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that people have a right to know

279
0:10:14.298,000 --> 0:10:16,000
about what they're eating.

280
0:10:16.673,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

281
0:10:22.464,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Fishermen like it too, so there's a good chance

282
0:10:24.42,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we can get the kind of support we need

283
0:10:26.02,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to get this bill through,

284
0:10:26.954,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and it comes at a critical time,

285
0:10:28.478,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because this is the way we stop seafood fraud,

286
0:10:30.584,000 --> 0:10:32,000
this is the way we curb illegal fishing,

287
0:10:32.65,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and this is the way we make sure

288
0:10:34.522,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that quotas, habitat protection,

289
0:10:36.226,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and bycatch reductions can do the jobs

290
0:10:38.106,000 --> 0:10:39,000
they can do.

291
0:10:39.283,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We know that we can manage our fisheries sustainably.

292
0:10:42.459,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We know that we can produce

293
0:10:44.101,000 --> 0:10:47,000
healthy meals for hundreds of millions of people

294
0:10:47.87,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that don't use the land, that don't use much water,

295
0:10:50.115,000 --> 0:10:51,000
have a low carbon footprint,

296
0:10:51.3,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and are cost-effective.

297
0:10:53.102,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We know that saving the oceans

298
0:10:55.09,000 --> 0:10:56,000
can feed the world,

299
0:10:56.673,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and we need to start now.

300
0:10:59.06,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Applause)

301
0:11:01.817,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Thank you. (Applause)

2
0:00:13.358,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Have you ever felt lonely?

3
0:00:16.842,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The urge of wanting to connect with people,

4
0:00:19.581,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but you seem to have no one you really would want to contact?

5
0:00:23.877,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Or, it's a Friday night and you want to be with others,

6
0:00:26.713,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but you have no energy to go out, so instead you sit at home all evening,

7
0:00:32.29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
watch Netflix

8
0:00:33.82,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and feel more alone than ever?

9
0:00:37.001,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You feel like a monster

10
0:00:38.648,000 --> 0:00:4,000
between humans that know how to function.

11
0:00:42.193,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This is what loneliness felt like to me.

12
0:00:47.856,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I'm an artist,

13
0:00:49.265,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I process my emotional world by sharing my feelings through my art.

14
0:00:54.846,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If you share your feelings with someone,

15
0:00:57.8,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they understand and share those feelings too,

16
0:01:01.379,000 --> 0:01:04,000
you create an emotional and deep connection.

17
0:01:05.456,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is why you can be surrounded by hundreds of people,

18
0:01:09.711,000 --> 0:01:11,000
jump from one candidate to the next,

19
0:01:12.591,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but still feel lonely.

20
0:01:14.919,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's because these deeper connections haven't been made.

21
0:01:21.258,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I was an always-happy child.

22
0:01:24.094,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I think we nearly have no single photo of me

23
0:01:26.775,000 --> 0:01:28,000
where I don't smile broadly or laugh or joke around.

24
0:01:29.776,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And this went on until ...

25
0:01:32.27,000 --> 0:01:33,000
well, it's still the case.

26
0:01:34.217,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But I had many friend groups

27
0:01:38.501,000 --> 0:01:41,000
up until, as a young adult, I moved to another city

28
0:01:42.126,000 --> 0:01:44,000
for my first job as a comic artist.

29
0:01:45.857,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And like so many young, thriving people all over the planet,

30
0:01:50.694,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I concentrated all my energy into my work life.

31
0:01:55.816,000 --> 0:02:,000
But, if you spend, like, 90 percent of your daily capacity

32
0:02:01.51,000 --> 0:02:03,000
trying to succeed at work,

33
0:02:03.632,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of course there is nothing left

34
0:02:05.252,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to take care of all the other important aspects in your life,

35
0:02:08.213,000 --> 0:02:1,000
like your human relationships.

36
0:02:11.665,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Nourishing friendships as an adult is work.

37
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You need to be consistent with connecting.

38
0:02:21.095,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You need to be open, you need to be honest.

39
0:02:23.692,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And this is all I struggled with,

40
0:02:25.835,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because I tend to camouflage my real feelings

41
0:02:28.872,000 --> 0:02:3,000
by trying to appear always happy

42
0:02:31.12,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and trying to make everyone else happy, too,

43
0:02:33.512,000 --> 0:02:35,000
by trying to fix their problems.

44
0:02:36.843,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I know a lot of us are guilty of this,

45
0:02:40.231,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because it's an easy way to not think about your own issues.

46
0:02:44.106,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Isn't it?

47
0:02:45.408,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?

48
0:02:46.912,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:49.198,000 --> 0:02:5,000
OK.

50
0:02:51.428,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The turning point came

51
0:02:54.237,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when I fell into an emotionally abusive relationship

52
0:02:59.367,000 --> 0:03:,000
just a few years ago.

53
0:03:01.492,000 --> 0:03:03,000
He isolated me

54
0:03:03.737,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and left me feeling more alone than ever.

55
0:03:08.565,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It was the lowest point in my life,

56
0:03:10.371,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but it was also my wake-up call,

57
0:03:13.475,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because it was the first time

58
0:03:15.487,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that I really felt loneliness.

59
0:03:20.354,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Many others put their feelings into their art.

60
0:03:23.747,000 --> 0:03:27,000
There are endless books, movies, paintings, music,

61
0:03:28.27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
all filled with the real emotion of an artist.

62
0:03:31.154,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So, as an artist myself, I did the same.

63
0:03:33.99,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I shared my feelings.

64
0:03:37.199,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I wanted to help people cope with loneliness.

65
0:03:41.63,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I wanted, yeah, to make them understand it,

66
0:03:44.277,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to really experience it through my art

67
0:03:48.265,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in the form of an interactive story,

68
0:03:51.782,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a video game.

69
0:03:54.825,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So, in our game --

70
0:03:57.086,000 --> 0:04:,000
we called it "Sea of Solitude" --

71
0:04:00.455,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you are a person named Kay,

72
0:04:02.98,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who is suffering from such strong loneliness

73
0:04:06.382,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that her inner feelings --

74
0:04:08.72,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the anger,

75
0:04:09.982,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the feeling of hopelessness, worthlessness --

76
0:04:13.795,000 --> 0:04:14,000
turn to the outside,

77
0:04:15.798,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and she becomes a monster.

78
0:04:17.869,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The game -- well, Kay --

79
0:04:20.11,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is actually a representation of me

80
0:04:23.117,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and the path I went through to overcome my struggles.

81
0:04:28.309,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The game plays, actually, in Kay's mind,

82
0:04:30.445,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so you walk through a world that is flooded by her tears,

83
0:04:35.292,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and the weather is changing by her mood,

84
0:04:39.518,000 --> 0:04:4,000
how her mood is changing.

85
0:04:42.301,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And, well, the only thing Kay wears,

86
0:04:47.644,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the only thing,

87
0:04:49.521,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is her backpack.

88
0:04:52.272,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's the baggage we all carry throughout our life.

89
0:04:56.997,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And Kay doesn't know how to cope with her emotions in the right way,

90
0:05:00.276,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so her backpack becomes bigger and bigger

91
0:05:03.048,000 --> 0:05:04,000
until it bursts,

92
0:05:04.516,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and she finally is forced to overcome her own struggles.

93
0:05:10.135,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In our story, we present many different manifestations of loneliness.

94
0:05:16.443,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Loneliness through social exclusion is very common.

95
0:05:21.041,000 --> 0:05:24,000
In our game, the brother of Kay got bullied in his school,

96
0:05:25.007,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and he just wants to hide and fly away.

97
0:05:27.679,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And we portray him as a huge bird monster surrounded by thick fog.

98
0:05:33.317,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The player has to actually walk through his school

99
0:05:35.84,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and experience, really feel the harm,

100
0:05:39.616,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that the brother had been through,

101
0:05:42.488,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because for a long time, nobody really listens to him.

102
0:05:46.081,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But the very moment friends and family start to listen,

103
0:05:51.537,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the first step towards overcoming this form of loneliness had been made.

104
0:05:56.374,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We also show loneliness in relationships,

105
0:06:00.367,000 --> 0:06:04,000
like when parents just stay together for the sake of their kids

106
0:06:05.163,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but end up hurting the entire family.

107
0:06:09.182,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We put the player literally in between the two parents while they are fighting,

108
0:06:15.303,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and you get hurt in the middle.

109
0:06:17.545,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They don't even see that their daughter, Kay, is right there

110
0:06:22.17,000 --> 0:06:23,000
until she breaks down.

111
0:06:25.016,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We also show loneliness through mental health issues,

112
0:06:30.071,000 --> 0:06:34,000
with the boyfriend of Kay, who suffers from depression

113
0:06:34.174,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and shows that sometimes

114
0:06:36.716,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it is most important to focus on your own well-being first.

115
0:06:43.77,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The boyfriend also tends to camouflage his feelings,

116
0:06:47.257,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so he appears like a lone, shiny white wolf.

117
0:06:51.376,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But the moment he starts to interact with his girlfriend, Kay,

118
0:06:55.852,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the mask falls off,

119
0:06:57.463,000 --> 0:07:,000
and we see the black dog beneath it:

120
0:07:00.853,000 --> 0:07:01,000
depression.

121
0:07:03.355,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Sometimes we put on a smile

122
0:07:06.647,000 --> 0:07:09,000
instead of dealing with the issues at hand,

123
0:07:10.328,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and that can ultimately make it worse,

124
0:07:13.03,000 --> 0:07:15,000
affect the people around us

125
0:07:15.162,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and damage our relationships.

126
0:07:19.561,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So Kay herself

127
0:07:20.851,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we portray as ripped apart into her basic emotions.

128
0:07:26.457,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Some help you,

129
0:07:27.756,000 --> 0:07:29,000
some are trying to stop you.

130
0:07:30.994,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Self-Doubt is a huge creature,

131
0:07:34.189,000 --> 0:07:37,000
always telling Kay how worthless she is

132
0:07:37.432,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and that she should just give up.

133
0:07:40.167,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Like in real life,

134
0:07:42.531,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Self-Doubt is blocking the path,

135
0:07:44.893,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and it seems impossible to overcome it.

136
0:07:48.271,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Destroying the omnipresence of Self-Doubt is a slow process.

137
0:07:52.729,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But in the game, you can slowly, like, shrink her,

138
0:07:56.525,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so she turns from self-doubt

139
0:07:59.005,000 --> 0:08:,000
to actually healthy doubt,

140
0:08:00.815,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and you can finally trust her advice.

141
0:08:04.544,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We also show Self-Destruction.

142
0:08:07.769,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's a huge monster

143
0:08:09.415,000 --> 0:08:12,000
always lurking nearby under the water's surface.

144
0:08:13.627,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Self-Destruction is actually the main antagonist of the game,

145
0:08:16.659,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and she is always trying to drown you in the ocean of tears.

146
0:08:21.432,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But, when she actually drowns you,

147
0:08:23.881,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you wake up just a few moments [before],

148
0:08:25.902,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and you have a chance to progress again.

149
0:08:29.432,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We wanted to show

150
0:08:31.937,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that we all go through hardships in our life, we all do.

151
0:08:35.761,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But if you at least, like, stand up and try to move forward,

152
0:08:41.482,000 --> 0:08:45,000
you are very likely to make it through your struggle,

153
0:08:46.103,000 --> 0:08:47,000
step by step.

154
0:08:49.742,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Joy is something that Kay cannot really embrace or touch.

155
0:08:55.921,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's always something in the distance.

156
0:08:58.699,000 --> 0:09:,000
We portrayed Joy as a child version of Kay,

157
0:09:01.222,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with a yellow raincoat,

158
0:09:02.614,000 --> 0:09:05,000
so she is invulnerable to the ocean of tears.

159
0:09:05.858,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But Joy can also turn into obsession

160
0:09:09.125,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and start to be actually harmful for Kay,

161
0:09:11.212,000 --> 0:09:14,000
like when she starts obsessing over her boyfriend.

162
0:09:14.974,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Joy will not turn back to normal until Kay realizes

163
0:09:20.68,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that her happiness should not depend on anybody else

164
0:09:25.526,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but herself.

165
0:09:29.977,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So our monsters appear huge and scary,

166
0:09:32.928,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but if you overcome your reluctance and approach them,

167
0:09:36.227,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you soon see that they are no monsters at all,

168
0:09:40.302,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but just fragile beings that are simply overwhelmed by what life throws at them.

169
0:09:48.325,000 --> 0:09:5,000
All of those emotions,

170
0:09:51.086,000 --> 0:09:54,000
be it self-doubt or even self-destruction,

171
0:09:54.535,000 --> 0:09:56,000
don't completely vanish in our game.

172
0:09:58.292,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The key message is to not only chase for joy or happiness

173
0:10:04.214,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but to embrace all your emotions

174
0:10:07.188,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and bring them into balance,

175
0:10:11.138,000 --> 0:10:14,000
being OK with sometimes not being OK.

176
0:10:17.468,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Everyone has their own loneliness story to tell.

177
0:10:21.123,000 --> 0:10:24,000
This realization changed everything for me.

178
0:10:25.91,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Being much more open with my emotions

179
0:10:28.077,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and concentrating much more on my private life,

180
0:10:31.866,000 --> 0:10:33,000
my friends, my family.

181
0:10:35.274,000 --> 0:10:36,000
When we released the game,

182
0:10:36.665,000 --> 0:10:39,000
literally thousands of fans wrote us,

183
0:10:40.009,000 --> 0:10:42,000
all sharing their stories with us

184
0:10:42.63,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and telling us they felt not so alone anymore

185
0:10:47.463,000 --> 0:10:49,000
just because they played our game.

186
0:10:50.497,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Many people wrote us that they felt hope

187
0:10:53.443,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for a better future for themselves for the first time in decades.

188
0:10:57.955,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Many wrote us that they seek therapy now,

189
0:11:01.584,000 --> 0:11:05,000
just because they played our game

190
0:11:06.078,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and felt hopeful to overcome their own struggles.

191
0:11:11.155,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Our game is not a therapy.

192
0:11:12.653,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's not meant to be a therapy.

193
0:11:14.297,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It's just my friends and me sharing our stories

194
0:11:17.241,000 --> 0:11:19,000
through our art, video games.

195
0:11:19.956,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But we are so deeply thankful for every single message

196
0:11:24.711,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that people feel better,

197
0:11:26.471,000 --> 0:11:29,000
just because we shared our story with them.

198
0:11:31.456,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So ...

199
0:11:32.939,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I didn't completely overcome my urge to help others.

200
0:11:39.956,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But I don't want to overcome it anymore.

201
0:11:42.74,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I love it.

202
0:11:44.137,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I just needed to bring it to a healthy size,

203
0:11:48.772,000 --> 0:11:51,000
so it doesn't stand in the way of deeper relationships anymore,

204
0:11:51.867,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but even help me to connect with people.

205
0:11:56.264,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So, if you have an inner monster

206
0:11:59.767,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that is born out of negative emotions,

207
0:12:03.48,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it is not only the goal to kill that monster

208
0:12:06.939,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but to understand that we humans are complex beings.

209
0:12:11.918,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Look at what part of your life is so big that others fall short.

210
0:12:18.92,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Look at what emotions you barely feel

211
0:12:22.378,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or maybe feel too much

212
0:12:23.952,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and move towards lowering those peaks.

213
0:12:27.191,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Most of all, it's about understanding

214
0:12:29.796,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that all the wide range of emotions and struggles

215
0:12:33.524,000 --> 0:12:35,000
makes us what we are:

216
0:12:35.963,000 --> 0:12:36,000
humans.

217
0:12:38.162,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Thank you.

218
0:12:39.348,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Applause)

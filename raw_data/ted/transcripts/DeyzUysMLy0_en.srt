1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What I thought I would talk about today

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is the transition from one mode

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
of thinking about nature

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to another that's tracked by architecture.

5
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
What's interesting about architects is,

6
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we always have tried to justify beauty

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
by looking to nature,

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and arguably, beautiful architecture

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
has always been looking at a model of nature.

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So, for roughly 300 years,

11
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the hot debate in architecture

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
was whether the number five

13
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or the number seven

14
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
was a better proportion to think about architecture,

15
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because the nose was one-fifth of your head,

16
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or because your head was one-seventh of your body.

17
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And the reason that that was the model

18
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of beauty and of nature

19
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
was because the decimal point had not been invented yet --

20
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it wasn't the 16th century --

21
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and everybody had to dimension a building

22
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in terms of fractions,

23
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
so a room would be dimensioned

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
as one-fourth of a facade;

25
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units,

26
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and you would get down to the small elements

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
by fractional subdivision:

28
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
finer and finer and finer.

29
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In the 15th century, the decimal point was invented;

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
architects stopped using fractions,

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and they had a new model of nature.

32
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So, what's going on today

33
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is that there's a model of natural form

34
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which is calculus-based

35
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and which is using digital tools,

36
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and that has a lot of implications

37
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to the way we think about beauty and form,

38
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature.

39
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The best example of this would probably be the Gothic,

40
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus,

41
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
although the Gothic architects

42
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
weren't really using calculus to define their forms.

43
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But what was important is,

44
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time

45
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that force and motion was thought of in terms of form.

46
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So, examples like Christopher Wren's King's Cross:

47
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting

48
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
get articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing

49
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the expression of structural force and form.

50
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Much later, Robert Maillart's bridges,

51
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
which optimize structural form

52
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola.

53
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi,

54
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
the Catalan architect.

55
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century,

56
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and how that Hanging Chain model

57
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
translates into archways

58
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and vaulting.

59
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So, in all of these examples,

60
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
structure is the determining force.

61
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams

62
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall.

63
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Interestingly, in the last 10 years

64
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model

65
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to generate the roof of the National Gallery,

66
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
with the structural engineer Chris Williams.

67
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
In all these examples,

68
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
there's one ideal form,

69
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because these are thought in terms of structure.

70
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems

71
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
very limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms

72
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment.

73
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So, what I thought I would bring up is

74
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
another component that needs to be thought of,

75
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
whenever you think about nature,

76
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and that's basically the invention of

77
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
generic form in genetic evolution.

78
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
My hero is actually not Darwin;

79
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it's a guy named William Bateson,

80
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.

81
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And he was what you'd call a teratologist:

82
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations

83
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.

84
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So, instead of trying to find the ideal type

85
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
or the ideal average,

86
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
he'd always look for the exception. So, in this example,

87
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule,

88
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb.

89
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago,

90
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.

91
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Beautiful, because it has symmetry.

92
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations,

93
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
instead of having a thumb,

94
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
you would either get another opposable thumb,

95
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or you would get four fingers.

96
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So, the mutations reverted to symmetry.

97
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And Bateson invented

98
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the concept of symmetry breaking,

99
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which is that

100
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
wherever you lose information in a system,

101
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
you revert back to symmetry.

102
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization --

103
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which is what I was always understanding, and as is an architect --

104
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
symmetry was the absence of information.

105
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry;

106
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
whenever you added information to a system, you would break symmetry.

107
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment

108
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
from looking for ideal shapes

109
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to looking for a combination of

110
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
information and generic form.

111
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
You know, literally after seeing that image,

112
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and finding out what Bateson was working with,

113
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching

114
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to start to think about architectural form.

115
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
To just talk for a minute about the

116
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
digital mediums that we're using now

117
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and how they integrate calculus:

118
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the fact that they're calculus-based

119
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
means that we don't have to think about dimension

120
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in terms of ideal units

121
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or discreet elements.

122
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So, in architecture we deal with

123
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
big assemblies of components,

124
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so there might be up to, say,

125
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
50,000 pieces of material

126
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in this room you're sitting in right now

127
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that all need to get organized.

128
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now, typically you'd think that they would all be the same:

129
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
like, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension.

130
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm

131
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that every chair would be a slightly different dimension,

132
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines.

133
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting,

134
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
they're all losing their modular quality,

135
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions.

136
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's because we're all using calculus tools

137
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for manufacturing and for design.

138
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Calculus is also a mathematics of curves.

139
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So, even a straight line, defined with calculus, is a curve.

140
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's just a curve without inflection.

141
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So, a new vocabulary of form

142
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is now pervading all design fields:

143
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
whether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc.,

144
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature.

145
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
The intricacies of scale that come out of that --

146
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
you know, in the example of the nose to the face,

147
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
there's a fractional part-to-whole idea.

148
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
With calculus, the whole idea

149
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of subdivision is more complex,

150
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because the whole and the parts are one continuous series.

151
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus,

152
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so I brought some images to just describe how that works.

153
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This is a Korean church that we did in Queens.

154
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And in this example, you can see

155
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that the components of this stair are repetitive,

156
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but they're repetitive without being modular.

157
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Each one of the elements in this structure

158
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is a unique distance and dimension,

159
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and all of the connections are unique angles.

160
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, the only way we could design that,

161
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
or possibly construct it,

162
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is by using a calculus-based definition

163
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of the form.

164
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It also is much more dynamic,

165
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so that you can see that the same form opens and closes

166
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
in a very dynamic way as you move across it,

167
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because it has this quality of vector in motion

168
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
built into it.

169
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume,

170
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista.

171
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And you also get a sense of

172
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
visual movement in the space,

173
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern,

174
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar.

175
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I think that's one of the main changes,

176
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
also, in architecture:

177
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form,

178
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
like a Latin cross for a church,

179
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but actually all the traits of a church:

180
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,

181
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
directionality that focuses you towards an altar.

182
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It turns out it's not rocket science

183
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to design a sacred space.

184
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits

185
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in a very kind of genetic way.

186
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So, these are the different perspectives of that interior,

187
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which has a very complex

188
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
set of orientations all in a simple form.

189
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In terms of construction and manufacturing,

190
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
this is a kilometer-long housing block

191
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that was built in the '70s in Amsterdam.

192
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And here we've broken the 500 apartments

193
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
up into small neighborhoods,

194
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and differentiated those neighborhoods.

195
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects,

196
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but what you can see is that

197
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the escalators and elevators

198
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that circulate people along the face of the building

199
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
are all held up by

200
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
122 structural trusses.

201
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Because we're using escalators

202
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to move people,

203
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads.

204
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped

205
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
as you move down the length of the building.

206
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So, working with

207
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Bentley and MicroStation,

208
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we've written a custom piece of software

209
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that networks all of the components together

210
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
into these chunks of information,

211
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
so that if we change any element

212
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
along the length of the building,

213
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
not only does that change distribute

214
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
through each one of the trusses,

215
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but each one of the trusses then distributes that information

216
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
down the length of the entire facade of the building.

217
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So it's a single calculation

218
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for every single component of the building

219
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that we're adding onto.

220
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So, it's tens of millions of calculations

221
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel

222
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and another piece of structural steel.

223
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But what it gives us is a harmonic

224
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and synthesized

225
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
relationship of all these components, one to another.

226
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This idea has, kind of, brought me into doing

227
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
some product design,

228
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and it's because design firms

229
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that have connections to architects,

230
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
like, I'm working with Vitra, which is a furniture company,

231
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and Alessi, which is a houseware company.

232
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
They saw this actually solving a problem:

233
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
this ability to differentiate components

234
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but keep them synthetic.

235
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So, not to pick on BMW,

236
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or to celebrate them,

237
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but take BMW as an example.

238
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They have to, in 2005,

239
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
have a distinct identity

240
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for all their models of cars.

241
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is,

242
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the 100 series that's coming out,

243
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
has to look like the 700 series,

244
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
at the other end of their product line,

245
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
so they need a distinct, coherent identity,

246
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
which is BMW.

247
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
At the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars

248
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
for a 300-series car,

249
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and a person paying 70,000 dollars

250
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
for a 700 series,

251
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and that person paying more than double

252
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
doesn't want their car to look too much like

253
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the bottom-of-the-market car.

254
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So they have to also discriminate between these products.

255
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So, as manufacturing

256
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
starts to allow more

257
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
design options,

258
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
this problem gets exacerbated,

259
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of the whole and the parts.

260
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Now, as an architect, part-to-whole relationships

261
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
is all I think about,

262
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but in terms of product design

263
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies.

264
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So, the first kind of test product we did

265
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
was with Alessi,

266
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
which was for a coffee and tea set.

267
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set;

268
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
we knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew

269
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
down south in San Diego,

270
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and we used an exploded

271
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
titanium forming method

272
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that's used in the aerospace industry.

273
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Basically what we can do,

274
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is just cut a graphite mold,

275
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
put it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees,

276
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
gently inflate titanium that's soft,

277
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and then explode it at the last minute into this form.

278
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But what's great about it is,

279
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the forms are only a few hundred dollars.

280
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
The titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.

281
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So, we designed a system here

282
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of eight curves that could be swapped,

283
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
very similar to that housing project I showed you,

284
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and we could recombine those together,

285
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
so that we always had ergonomic shapes

286
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that always had the same volume

287
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and could always be produced in the same way.

288
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
That way, each one of these tools we could pay for with

289
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
a few hundred dollars,

290
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and get incredible variation in the components.

291
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And this is one of those examples of the sets.

292
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So, for me, what was important is that

293
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
this coffee set --

294
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
which is just a coffee pot, a teapot,

295
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and those are the pots sitting on a tray --

296
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that they would have a coherence --

297
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots --

298
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but that everyone who bought one

299
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way.

300
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
To go back to architecture,

301
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
what's organic about architecture as a field,

302
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
unlike product design,

303
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is this whole issue of holism

304
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and of monumentality is really our realm.

305
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object,

306
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but also break down into small rooms

307
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and have an identity of both the big scale

308
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and the small scale.

309
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Architects tend to work with signature,

310
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
so that an architect needs a signature

311
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and that signature has to work across the scale of houses

312
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
up to, say, skyscrapers,

313
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining

314
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and working with; and intricacy,

315
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
which is the relationship of, say,

316
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
the shape of a building, its structure, its windows,

317
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
its color, its pattern. These are real architectural problems.

318
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So, my kind of hero for this in the natural world

319
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
are these tropical frogs.

320
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I got interested in them because they're the most

321
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
extreme example

322
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of a surface where

323
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration --

324
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works --

325
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
are all intricately connected to one another.

326
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So a change in the form

327
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
indicates a change in the color pattern.

328
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing,

329
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
but they really work together and are fused

330
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
in some way.

331
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So, when doing a center

332
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
for the national parks in Costa Rica,

333
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
we tried to use that idea of a gradient color

334
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and a change in texture

335
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
as the structure moves across the surface of the building.

336
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
We also used a continuity of change

337
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum,

338
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
so it's all one continuous change

339
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
in the massing,

340
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms.

341
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
In a housing project in Valencia, Spain, we're doing,

342
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
the different towers of housing fused together

343
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
in shared curves so you get a single mass,

344
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
like a kind of monolith,

345
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
but it breaks down into individual elements.

346
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And you can see that that change in massing

347
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
also gives all 48 of the apartments

348
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
a unique shape and size,

349
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
but always within a, kind of, controlled limit,

350
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
an envelope of change.

351
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I work with a group of other architects.

352
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We have a company called United Architects.

353
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.

354
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And I think this just shows how

355
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
we were approaching

356
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the problem of incredibly large-scale construction.

357
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral

358
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
around the footprints of the World Trade Center site.

359
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And to do that, we tried to connect up

360
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
the five towers into a single system.

361
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And we looked at, from the 1950s on,

362
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
there were numerous examples of other architects

363
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
trying to do the same thing.

364
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We really approached it at the level

365
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
of the typology of the building,

366
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
where we could build these five separate towers,

367
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
but they would all join at the 60th floor

368
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and make a kind of single monolithic mass.

369
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
With United Architects, also,

370
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters

371
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that used the same system,

372
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
but this time in a much more monolithic mass,

373
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
like a sphere.

374
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
But again, you can see this, kind of,

375
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
organic fusion

376
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
of multiple building elements

377
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
to make a thing which is whole, but breaks down into smaller parts,

378
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
but in an incredibly organic way.

379
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Finally, I'd like to just show you

380
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
some of the effects of using digital fabrication.

381
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
About six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills,

382
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
to just replace, kind of,

383
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models.

384
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And I also bought a laser cutter

385
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and started to fabricate within my own shop,

386
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
kind of, large-scale building elements and models,

387
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
where we could go directly to the tooling.

388
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
What I found out is that the tooling,

389
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
if you intervened in the software,

390
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
actually produced decorative effects.

391
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
So, for these interiors, like this shop in Stockholm, Sweden,

392
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
or this installation wall in the Netherlands

393
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
at the Netherlands Architecture Institute,

394
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
we could use the texture that the tool would leave

395
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
to produce a lot of the spatial effects,

396
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and we could integrate the texture of the wall

397
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
with the form of the wall with the material.

398
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
So, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass,

399
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and then even at the level of structural steel,

400
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
which you think of as being linear and modular.

401
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
The steel industry is so far

402
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
ahead of the design industry

403
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
that if you take advantage of it

404
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
you can even start to think of beams and columns

405
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
all rolled together into a single system

406
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
which is highly efficient,

407
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
but also produces decorative effects

408
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and formal effects

409
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
that are very beautiful and organic.

410
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Thanks very much.

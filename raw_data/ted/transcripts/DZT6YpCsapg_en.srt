1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let me begin with four words

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that will provide the context for this week,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
four words that will come to define

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
this century.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Here they are:

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The Earth is full.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's full of us, it's full of our stuff,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
full of our waste, full of our demands.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Yes, we are a brilliant and creative species,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but we've created a little too much stuff --

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
so much that our economy is now bigger

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
than its host, our planet.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This is not a philosophical statement,

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
this is just science

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
based in physics,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
chemistry and biology.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There are many science-based analyses of this,

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but they all draw the same conclusion --

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that we're living beyond our means.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The eminent scientists of the Global Footprint Network, for example,

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
calculate that we need about 1.5 Earths

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to sustain this economy.

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
In other words,

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to keep operating at our current level,

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we need 50 percent more Earth than we've got.

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
In financial terms,

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
this would be like always spending 50 percent more than you earn,

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
going further into debt every year.

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But of course, you can't borrow natural resources,

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so we're burning through our capital,

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or stealing from the future.

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So when I say full, I mean really full --

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
well past any margin for error,

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
well past any dispute

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
about methodology.

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What this means is our economy is unsustainable.

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm not saying it's not nice or pleasant

38
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or that it's bad for polar bears or forests,

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
though it certainly is.

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What I'm saying

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is our approach is simply unsustainable.

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In other words, thanks to those pesky laws of physics,

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
when things aren't sustainable, they stop.

44
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But that's not possible, you might think.

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We can't stop economic growth.

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Because that's what will stop: economic growth.

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It will stop because of the end of trade resources.

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It will stop because of the growing demand of us

49
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
on all the resources, all the capacity,

50
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
all the systems of the Earth,

51
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which is now having economic damage.

52
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
When we think about economic growth stopping,

53
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we go, "That's not possible,"

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because economic growth is so essential to our society

55
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that is is rarely questioned.

56
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Although growth has certainly delivered many benefits,

57
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it is an idea so essential

58
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that we tend not to understand

59
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the possibility of it not being around.

60
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Even though it has delivered many benefits,

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
it is based on a crazy idea --

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the crazy idea being

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that we can have infinite growth

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
on a finite planet.

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes.

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That the crazy idea is just that,

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it is crazy,

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and with the Earth full, it's game over.

69
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Come on, you're thinking.

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
That's not possible.

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Technology is amazing. People are innovative.

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There are so many ways we can improve the way we do things.

73
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We can surely sort this out.

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That's all true.

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Well, it's mostly true.

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We are certainly amazing,

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and we regularly solve complex problems

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with amazing creativity.

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So if our problem

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
was to get the human economy down

81
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
from 150 percent to 100 percent of the Earth's capacity,

82
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we could do that.

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The problem is we're just warming up

84
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
this growth engine.

85
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We plan to take this highly-stressed economy

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and make it twice as big

87
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and then make it four times as big --

88
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
not in some distant future,

89
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but in less than 40 years,

90
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in the life time of most of you.

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
China plans to be there in just 20 years.

92
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The only problem with this plan

93
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is that it's not possible.

94
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In response, some people argue,

95
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but we need growth, we need it to solve poverty.

96
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We need it to develop technology.

97
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We need it to keep social stability.

98
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I find this argument fascinating,

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics

100
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to suit our needs.

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's like the Earth doesn't care what we need.

102
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Mother nature doesn't negotiate;

103
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
she just sets rules and describes consequences.

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And these are not esoteric limits.

105
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is about food and water, soil and climate,

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
the basic practical and economic foundations

107
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
of our lives.

108
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So the idea that we can smoothly transition

109
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to a highly-efficient,

110
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
solar-powered, knowledge-based economy

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
transformed by science and technology

112
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so that nine billion people

113
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
can live in 2050

114
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a life of abundance and digital downloads

115
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is a delusion.

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's not that it's not possible to feed, clothe and house us all

117
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and have us live decent lives.

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It certainly is.

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But the idea that we can gently grow there

120
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with a few minor hiccups

121
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is just wrong,

122
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and it's dangerously wrong,

123
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
because it means we're not getting ready

124
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
for what's really going to happen.

125
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
See what happens when you operate a system

126
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
past its limits

127
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and then keep on going

128
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
at an ever-accelerating rate

129
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is that the system stops working and breaks down.

130
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And that's what will happen to us.

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Many of you will be thinking,

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but surely we can still stop this.

133
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
If it's that bad, we'll react.

134
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Let's just think through that idea.

135
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now we've had

136
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
50 years of warnings.

137
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We've had science proving

138
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the urgency of change.

139
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We've had economic analysis pointing out

140
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that, not only can we afford it,

141
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
it's cheaper to act early.

142
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And yet, the reality is

143
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we've done pretty much nothing to change course.

144
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We're not even slowing down.

145
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Last year on climate, for example,

146
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we had the highest global emissions ever.

147
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The story on food, on water, on soil, on climate

148
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is all much the same.

149
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I actually don't say this in despair.

150
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I've done my grieving about the loss.

151
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I accept where we are.

152
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It is sad,

153
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but it is what it is.

154
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But it is also time

155
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that we ended our denial

156
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and recognized

157
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that we're not acting, we're not close to acting

158
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and we're not going to act

159
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
until this crisis hits the economy.

160
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And that's why the end of growth

161
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is the central issue

162
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and the event that we need to get ready for.

163
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So when does this transition begin?

164
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
When does this breakdown begin?

165
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
In my view, it is well underway.

166
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I know most people don't see it that way.

167
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We tend to look at the world,

168
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not as the integrated system that it is,

169
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but as a series of individual issues.

170
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We see the Occupy protests,

171
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we see spiraling debt crises,

172
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we see growing inequality,

173
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we see money's influence on politics,

174
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we see resource constraint, food and oil prices.

175
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But we see, mistakenly, each of these issues

176
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
as individual problems to be solved.

177
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
In fact, it's the system

178
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in the painful process of breaking down --

179
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
our system, of debt-fueled economic growth,

180
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of ineffective democracy,

181
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of overloading planet Earth,

182
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is eating itself alive.

183
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I could give you countless studies

184
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and evidence to prove this,

185
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
but I won't because, if you want to see it,

186
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that evidence is all around you.

187
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I want to talk to you about fear.

188
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I want to do so because, in my view,

189
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the most important issue we face

190
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is how we respond

191
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to this question.

192
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The crisis is now inevitable.

193
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This issue is, how will we react?

194
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Of course, we can't know what will happen.

195
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The future is inherently uncertain.

196
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But let's just think through what the science is telling us

197
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is likely to happen.

198
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Imagine our economy

199
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
when the carbon bubble bursts,

200
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
when the financial markets recognize

201
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that, to have any hope

202
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
of preventing the climate spiraling out of control,

203
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the oil and coal industries are finished.

204
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Imagine China, India and Pakistan going to war

205
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
as climate impacts

206
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
generate conflict over food and water.

207
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Imagine the Middle East without oil income,

208
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but with collapsing governments.

209
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Imagine our highly-tuned, just-in-time food industry

210
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and our highly-stressed agricultural system failing

211
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and supermarket shelves emptying.

212
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Imagine 30 percent unemployment in America

213
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
as the global economy is gripped

214
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
by fear and uncertainty.

215
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now imagine what that means for you,

216
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
your family, your friends,

217
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
your personal financial security.

218
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Imagine what it means

219
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
for your personal security

220
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
as a heavily armed civilian population

221
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
gets angrier and angrier

222
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
about why this was allowed to happen.

223
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Imagine what you'll tell your children

224
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
when they ask you,

225
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"So, in 2012, Mom and Dad,

226
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
what was it like

227
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
when you'd had the hottest decade on record

228
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for the third decade in a row,

229
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
when every scientific body in the world was saying

230
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
you've got a major problem,

231
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
when the oceans were acidifying,

232
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
when oil and food prices were spiking,

233
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
when they were rioting in the streets of London

234
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and occupying Wall Street?

235
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
When the system was so clearly breaking down, Mom and Dad,

236
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
what did you do, what were you thinking?"

237
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So how do you feel

238
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
when the lights go out

239
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
on the global economy in your mind,

240
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
when your assumptions about the future

241
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
fade away

242
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and something very different emerges?

243
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Just take a moment

244
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and take a breath

245
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and think, what do you feel

246
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
at this point?

247
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Perhaps denial.

248
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Perhaps anger.

249
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Maybe fear.

250
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Of course, we can't know what's going to happen

251
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and we have to live with uncertainty.

252
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint,

253
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we should feel a bit of fear.

254
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We are in danger, all of us,

255
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear

256
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to motivate a powerful response,

257
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to help us bravely face a threat.

258
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But this time it's not a tiger at the cave mouth.

259
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
You can't see the danger at your door.

260
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But if you look,

261
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you can see it at the door of your civilization.

262
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That's why we need to feel our response now while the lights are still on,

263
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because if we wait until the crisis takes hold,

264
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we may panic and hide.

265
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
If we feel it now and think it through,

266
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we will realize we have nothing to fear

267
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but fear itself.

268
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Yes, things will get ugly, and it will happen soon --

269
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
certainly in our lifetime --

270
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but we are more than capable

271
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of getting through everything that's coming.

272
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
You see, those people that have faith

273
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that humans can solve any problem,

274
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that technology is limitless, that markets can be a force for good,

275
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
are in fact right.

276
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The only thing they're missing

277
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is that it takes a good crisis to get us going.

278
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
When we feel fear and we fear loss

279
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we are capable of quite extraordinary things.

280
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Think about war.

281
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it just took four days

282
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
for the government to ban the production of civilian cars

283
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and to redirect the auto industry,

284
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and from there to rationing of food and energy.

285
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Think about how a company responds to a bankruptcy threat

286
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and how a change that seemed impossible just gets done.

287
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Think about how an individual responds

288
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness

289
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and how lifestyle changes

290
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
that previously were just too difficult

291
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
suddenly become relatively easy.

292
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We are smart, in fact, we really are quite amazing,

293
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but we do love a good crisis.

294
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And the good news, this one's a monster.

295
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter)

296
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Sure, if we get it wrong,

297
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we could face the end of this civilization,

298
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but if we get it right,

299
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it could be the beginning of civilization instead.

300
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And how cool would it be

301
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that?

302
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
There's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way.

303
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Scientists like James Hansen tell us

304
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
we may need to eliminate net CO2 emissions from the economy

305
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in just a few decades.

306
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I wanted to know what that would take,

307
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
so I worked with professor Jorgen Randers from Norway

308
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to find the answer.

309
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We developed a plan called "The One Degree War Plan" --

310
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required.

311
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
To my surprise,

312
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
eliminating net CO2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years

313
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap,

314
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
not very cheap,

315
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization.

316
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We didn't calculate that precisely,

317
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but we understand that's very expensive.

318
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
You can read the details,

319
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
but in summary, we can transform our economy.

320
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We can do it with proven technology.

321
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
We can do it at an affordable cost.

322
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
We can do it with existing political structures.

323
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The only thing we need to change

324
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
is how we think and how we feel.

325
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And this is where you come in.

326
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
When we think about the future I paint,

327
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
of course we should feel a bit of fear.

328
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
But fear can be paralyzing or motivating.

329
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We need to accept the fear and then we need to act.

330
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We need to act

331
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
like the future depends on it.

332
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We need to act like we only have one planet.

333
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We can do this.

334
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you

335
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that more growth, more stuff and nine billion people going shopping

336
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
is the best we can do.

337
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
They're wrong.

338
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We can be more,

339
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
we can be much more.

340
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We have achieved remarkable things

341
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago.

342
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We've built a powerful foundation

343
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
of science, knowledge and technology --

344
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
more than enough to build a society

345
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
where nine billion people

346
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
can lead decent, meaningful and satisfying lives.

347
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
The Earth can support that

348
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
if we choose the right path.

349
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
We can choose this moment of crisis

350
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to ask and answer the big questions of society's evolution --

351
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
like, what do we want to be when we grow up,

352
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
when we move past this bumbling adolescence

353
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
where we think there are no limits

354
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and suffer delusions of immortality?

355
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Well it's time to grow up,

356
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to be wiser, to be calmer,

357
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to be more considered.

358
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Like generations before us,

359
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
we'll be growing up in war --

360
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
not a war between civilizations,

361
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
but a war for civilization,

362
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
for the extraordinary opportunity

363
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to build a society

364
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
which is stronger and happier

365
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and plans on staying around

366
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
into middle age.

367
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
We can choose life over fear.

368
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We can do what we need to do,

369
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
but it will take every entrepreneur,

370
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
every artist,

371
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
every scientist, every communicator,

372
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
every mother, every father, every child,

373
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
every one of us.

374
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
This could be our finest hour.

375
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Thank you.

376
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Applause)

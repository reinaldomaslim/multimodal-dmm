1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and then nod to the person on your left.

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now, chances are that over the last winter,

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you just nodded at would have died.

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now, that's an awful lot of bees.

9
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.

11
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, that's a lot, a lot of bees, and that's really important.

12
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And most of those losses are because of things we know.

13
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced

14
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,

15
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.

16
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.

17
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And below, you can see all these out yards,

18
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,

19
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and then they're shipped out to the almonds.

20
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months

21
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
after I was here, described this not as beehives

22
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.

23
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, I'm going to sum up a year's worth of work in two sentences

24
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to say that we have been trying to figure out

25
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
what the cause of this is.

26
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.

27
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.

28
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,

29
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
this flu was caused by a new virus to us,

30
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.

31
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,

32
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,

33
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of course, there's the implication.

34
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.

35
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses

36
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,

37
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and the question that keeps us up at night,

38
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,

39
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?

40
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And we don't have the answer to that yet,

41
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.

42
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.

43
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team

44
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides

45
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives

46
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these

47
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
very strange things that we can't begin to understand.

48
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health.

49
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,

50
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
beekeepers can replace them very quickly.

51
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.

52
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,

53
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the National Guard would be out.

54
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,

55
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
they can split that colony in two.

56
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.

57
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,

58
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and you can introduce that queen.

59
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And in fact, America was the first country

60
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,

61
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail

62
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.

63
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,

64
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,

65
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,

66
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you know, your three-pound packages of bees.

67
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.

68
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,

69
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and so they've been able to cover those losses.

70
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,

71
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the same number of colonies have existed in the country,

72
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
at about 2.4 million colonies.

73
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Now, those losses are tragic on many fronts,

74
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.

75
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,

76
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.

77
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone

78
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,

79
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco

80
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
backyard pig farmer.

81
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And you get all of these people in the same room,

83
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and they're all engaged and they're getting along,

84
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and they're all there because of the passion for bees.

85
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now, there's another part of that community

86
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
which are the commercial beekeepers,

87
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.

88
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,

89
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.

90
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.

91
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year.

92
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.

93
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I mean, there may be 100 explanations

94
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,

95
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.

96
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,

97
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.

98
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
No formal education, but very knowledgeable.

99
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,

100
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen

101
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
from cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,

102
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.

103
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We also have Dave Hackenberg, who is the poster child of CCD.

104
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
He's the one who first identified this condition

105
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and raised the alarm bells.

106
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And he has a history of these trucks,

107
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.

108
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,

109
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.

110
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,

111
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.

112
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder

113
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.

114
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And you can do that one year in a row,

115
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you may be able to do it two years in a row.

116
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,

117
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried

118
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
about losing this segment of our industry.

119
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And that's important for many fronts,

120
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.

121
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.

122
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You know, they pick up their hives;

123
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
they move their families once or twice in a year.

124
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,

125
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.

126
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,

127
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.

128
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café

129
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.

130
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees

131
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
into the almond groves.

132
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They all have their breakfast

133
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,

134
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,

135
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because that's quite essential American experience.

136
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,

137
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.

138
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And they're not people who like to ask for help,

139
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
although they are the most helpful people ever.

140
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,

141
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives

142
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to help him replace those lost colonies.

143
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,

144
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
historic and exciting community to be involved with.

145
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Of course, the real importance for bees is not the honey.

146
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.

147
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,

148
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.

149
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat

150
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.

151
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact

152
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning --

153
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,

154
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,

155
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee --

156
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and had we taken out all those ingredients,

157
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
-- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola --

158
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
if we had taken out all those ingredients

159
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,

160
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we wouldn't have much on our plate.

161
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,

162
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but clearly our diet would be diminished.

163
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,

164
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and for flowers bees are the messengers of love.

165
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And that's a really great expression, because really,

166
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know --

167
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
they get paid for their services.

168
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They get paid by pollen and nectar,

169
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.

170
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't --

171
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.

172
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples

173
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of one variety, and then you have another apple tree

174
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that's a different type of pollen.

175
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And bees are very faithful.

176
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,

177
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.

178
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.

179
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them

180
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.

181
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
However, honeybees are a minority.

182
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced

183
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
with the colonialists.

184
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And there are actually more species of bees

185
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
than there are mammals and birds combined.

186
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,

187
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and very intensely in the last three years.

188
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.

189
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.

190
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,

191
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong

192
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.

193
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We have bumblebees on the top.

194
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,

195
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
because only the queen is, over winter.

196
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.

197
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
They're like tiny little flies and they fly around.

198
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,

199
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering --

200
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering --

201
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Audience: Bee?

202
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.

203
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

204
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,

205
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,

206
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and they collect pollen and make it into a ball,

207
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and they lay an egg on it.

208
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Well, these bees hang out at that hole,

209
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,

210
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.

211
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,

212
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you know that your environment is healthy,

213
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.

214
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators

215
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list

216
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.

217
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,

218
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people

219
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think

220
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.

221
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And so it's not just honeybees that are in trouble,

222
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
but we don't understand these native pollinators

223
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or all those other parts of our community.

224
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.

225
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
There are other animals that pollinate, like bats,

226
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and bats are in trouble too.

227
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,

228
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
because there's no money to research the bat problems.

229
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.

230
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.

231
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,

232
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco

233
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
becoming the population of half of this county in three years.

234
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.

235
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But I'm glad to say that I think we know the cause

236
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:

237
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Nature Deficit Disorder.

238
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is,

239
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
we forgot our connection with nature.

240
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And I think if we reconnect to nature,

241
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
we'll be able to have the resources and that interest

242
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to solve these problems.

243
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.

244
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.

245
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And I think we have lost our connection,

246
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.

247
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow

248
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.

249
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.

250
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It used to be, two, three hundred years ago,

251
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that a lawn was a symbol of prestige,

252
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green

253
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.

254
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.

255
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.

256
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And so it's incredible the amount of resources we've spent

257
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.

258
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And so we need to rethink this idea.

259
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
In fact, you know, the White House

260
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
used to have sheep in front in order to help fund

261
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;

262
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
it wouldn't be a bad idea.

263
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.

264
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns

265
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.

266
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,

267
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.

268
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.

269
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow

270
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,

271
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that --

272
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,

273
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
this companion you can have as it matures

274
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and as it has these different fragrances.

275
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And this is a companion,

276
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and this is a relationship that never dries up.

277
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.

278
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And I encourage you to look at that.

279
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Now, not all of us have meadows,

280
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,

281
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
grow a meadow in a pot.

282
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.

283
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,

284
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but a pot in a meadow.

285
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
But you can also have this great community of city

286
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
or building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live --

287
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
This is in Paris where these beekeepers live.

288
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And everyone should open a beehive,

289
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.

290
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,

291
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I think this is a great way of doing it.

292
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Get a beehive and grow a meadow,

293
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and watch that life come back into your life.

294
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,

295
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future --

296
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.

297
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs

298
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees

299
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.

300
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And I hope that you experience it

301
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and I hope you tell me about it one day.

302
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much.

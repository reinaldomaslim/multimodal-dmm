1
0:00:12.973,000 --> 0:00:14,000
While preparing for my talk

2
0:00:15.209,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was reflecting on my life and trying to figure out

3
0:00:19.263,000 --> 0:00:23,000
where exactly was that moment when my journey began.

4
0:00:24.187,000 --> 0:00:26,000
A long time passed by, and I simply couldn't figure out

5
0:00:26.834,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the beginning or the middle or the end of my story.

6
0:00:29.806,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I always used to think that my beginning

7
0:00:31.757,000 --> 0:00:35,000
was one afternoon in my community when my mother had told me

8
0:00:35.867,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that I had escaped three arranged marriages by the time I was two.

9
0:00:40.278,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Or one evening when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community,

10
0:00:44.713,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and my dad sat, surrounded by all of us,

11
0:00:46.965,000 --> 0:00:49,000
telling us stories of when he was a little kid struggling to go to school

12
0:00:50.866,000 --> 0:00:54,000
while his father, who was a farmer, wanted him to work in the fields with him.

13
0:00:54.974,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Or that dark night when I was 16

14
0:00:57.722,000 --> 0:01:01,000
when three little kids had come to me and they whispered in my ear

15
0:01:02.139,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that my friend was murdered in something called the honor killings.

16
0:01:08.106,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But then I realized that,

17
0:01:10.231,000 --> 0:01:13,000
as much as I know that these moments have contributed on my journey,

18
0:01:13.948,000 --> 0:01:14,000
they have influenced my journey

19
0:01:15.548,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but they have not been the beginning of it,

20
0:01:17.707,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but the true beginning of my journey was in front of a mud house

21
0:01:22.003,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in upper Sindh of Pakistan,

22
0:01:24.626,000 --> 0:01:26,000
where my father held the hand of my 14-year-old mother

23
0:01:27.482,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and they decided to walk out of the village

24
0:01:29.502,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to go to a town where they could send their kids to school.

25
0:01:32.962,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In a way, I feel like my life

26
0:01:35.168,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is kind of a result of some wise choices and decisions they've made.

27
0:01:40.903,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And just like that, another of their decisions

28
0:01:43.759,000 --> 0:01:46,000
was to keep me and my siblings connected to our roots.

29
0:01:46.986,000 --> 0:01:5,000
While we were living in a community I fondly remember as called Ribabad,

30
0:01:51.235,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which means community of the poor,

31
0:01:53.464,000 --> 0:01:56,000
my dad made sure that we also had a house in our rural homeland.

32
0:01:57.156,000 --> 0:02:,000
I come from an indigenous tribe in the mountains of Balochistan

33
0:02:00.78,000 --> 0:02:01,000
called Brahui.

34
0:02:02.52,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Brahui, or Brohi, means mountain dweller, and it is also my language.

35
0:02:07.688,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Thanks to my father's very strict rules about connecting to our customs,

36
0:02:11.924,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I had to live a beautiful life of songs, cultures, traditions, stories, mountains,

37
0:02:17.655,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and a lot of sheep.

38
0:02:19.696,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But then, living in two extremes

39
0:02:22.365,000 --> 0:02:26,000
between the traditions of my culture, of my village,

40
0:02:26.394,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and then modern education in my school wasn't easy.

41
0:02:29.745,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I was aware that I was the only girl who got to have such freedom,

42
0:02:34.249,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and I was guilty of it.

43
0:02:36.293,000 --> 0:02:39,000
While going to school in Karachi and Hyderabad,

44
0:02:40.255,000 --> 0:02:43,000
a lot of my cousins and childhood friends were getting married off,

45
0:02:44.196,000 --> 0:02:46,000
some to older men, some in exchange,

46
0:02:46.95,000 --> 0:02:48,000
some even as second wives.

47
0:02:49.249,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I got to see the beautiful tradition and its magic fade in front of me

48
0:02:54.558,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when I saw that the birth of a girl child was celebrated with sadness,

49
0:02:59.892,000 --> 0:03:03,000
when women were told to have patience as their main virtue.

50
0:03:04.659,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Up until I was 16,

51
0:03:06.64,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I healed my sadness by crying,

52
0:03:09.448,000 --> 0:03:11,000
mostly at nights when everyone would sleep

53
0:03:11.634,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and I would sob in my pillow,

54
0:03:13.95,000 --> 0:03:16,000
until that one night when I found out my friend was killed

55
0:03:17.297,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in the name of honor.

56
0:03:20.381,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Honor killings is a custom

57
0:03:23.218,000 --> 0:03:25,000
where men and women are suspected of having relationships

58
0:03:26.116,000 --> 0:03:27,000
before or outside of the marriage,

59
0:03:27.811,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and they're killed by their family for it.

60
0:03:29.99,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Usually the killer is the brother or father or the uncle in the family.

61
0:03:34.375,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The U.N. reports there are about 1,000 honor murders every year in Pakistan,

62
0:03:39.007,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and these are only the reported cases.

63
0:03:41.445,000 --> 0:03:44,000
A custom that kills did not make any sense to me,

64
0:03:45.183,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I knew I had to do something about it this time.

65
0:03:47.761,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I was not going to cry myself to sleep.

66
0:03:50.152,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I was going to do something, anything, to stop it.

67
0:03:52.66,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I was 16 -- I started writing poetry

68
0:03:54.726,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and going door to door telling everybody about honor killings

69
0:03:57.954,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and why it happens, why it should be stopped,

70
0:04:00.149,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and raising awareness about it

71
0:04:01.585,000 --> 0:04:05,000
until I actually found a much, much better way to handle this issue.

72
0:04:06.841,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In those days, we were living in a very small, one-roomed house in Karachi.

73
0:04:13.002,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Every year, during the monsoon seasons, our house would flood up with water --

74
0:04:17.529,000 --> 0:04:18,000
rainwater and sewage --

75
0:04:19.241,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and my mom and dad would be taking the water out.

76
0:04:22.368,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In those days, my dad brought home a huge machine, a computer.

77
0:04:27.467,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It was so big it looked as if it was going to take up half of the only room we had,

78
0:04:32.364,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and had so many pieces and wires that needed to be connected.

79
0:04:35.864,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But it was still the most exciting thing

80
0:04:37.954,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that has ever happened to me and my sisters.

81
0:04:40.74,000 --> 0:04:44,000
My oldest brother Ali got to be in charge of taking care of the computer,

82
0:04:44.85,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and all of us were given 10 to 15 minutes every day to use it.

83
0:04:48.785,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Being the oldest of eight kids,

84
0:04:51.85,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I got to use it the last,

85
0:04:54.335,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and that was after I had washed the dishes,

86
0:04:57.074,000 --> 0:04:59,000
cleaned the house, made dinner with my mom,

87
0:04:59.837,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and put blankets on the floor for everyone to sleep,

88
0:05:02.529,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and after that, I would run to the computer,

89
0:05:04.712,000 --> 0:05:05,000
connect it to the Internet,

90
0:05:06.269,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and have pure joy and wonder for 10 to 15 minutes.

91
0:05:12.288,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In those days, I had discovered a website called Joogle.

92
0:05:16.694,000 --> 0:05:19,000
[Google] (Laughter)

93
0:05:19.76,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In my frantic wish to do something about this custom,

94
0:05:23.474,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I made use of Google and discovered Facebook,

95
0:05:26.982,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a website where people can connect to anyone around the world,

96
0:05:31.137,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and so, from my very tiny, cement-roofed room in Karachi,

97
0:05:35.618,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I connected with people in the U.K., the U.S., Australia and Canada,

98
0:05:38.828,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and created a campaign called

99
0:05:41.335,000 --> 0:05:43,000
WAKE UP Campaign against Honor Killings.

100
0:05:44.228,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It became enormous in just a few months.

101
0:05:47.299,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I got a lot of support from all around the world.

102
0:05:49.851,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Media was connecting to us.

103
0:05:51.312,000 --> 0:05:54,000
A lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us.

104
0:05:54.611,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It became so big that it went from online to the streets of my hometown,

105
0:05:59.353,000 --> 0:06:01,000
where we would do rallies and strikes

106
0:06:01.697,000 --> 0:06:04,000
trying to change the policies in Pakistan for women's support.

107
0:06:05.169,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And while I thought everything was perfect,

108
0:06:08.891,000 --> 0:06:11,000
my team -- which was basically my friends and neighbors at that time --

109
0:06:12.768,000 --> 0:06:14,000
thought everything was going so well,

110
0:06:14.858,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we had no idea a big opposition was coming to us.

111
0:06:20.039,000 --> 0:06:22,000
My community stood up against us,

112
0:06:22.174,000 --> 0:06:25,000
saying we were spreading un-Islamic behavior.

113
0:06:25.891,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We were challenging centuries-old customs in those communities.

114
0:06:30.601,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I remember my father receiving anonymous letters

115
0:06:33.679,000 --> 0:06:35,000
saying, "Your daughter is spreading Western culture

116
0:06:36.615,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in the honorable societies."

117
0:06:38.341,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Our car was stoned at one point.

118
0:06:40.887,000 --> 0:06:43,000
One day I went to the office and found our metal signboard

119
0:06:44.787,000 --> 0:06:48,000
wrinkled and broken as if a lot of people had been hitting it with something heavy.

120
0:06:49.589,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Things got so bad that I had to hide myself in many ways.

121
0:06:53.216,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I would put up the windows of the car,

122
0:06:56.293,000 --> 0:06:59,000
veil my face, not speak while I was in public,

123
0:07:00.225,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but eventually situations got worse when my life was threatened,

124
0:07:04.202,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and I had to leave, back to Karachi, and our actions stopped.

125
0:07:09.962,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Back in Karachi, as an 18-year-old,

126
0:07:13.335,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I thought this was the biggest failure of my entire life.

127
0:07:18.101,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I was devastated.

128
0:07:20.011,000 --> 0:07:23,000
As a teenager, I was blaming myself for everything that happened.

129
0:07:23.656,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And it turns out, when we started reflecting,

130
0:07:25.792,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we did realize that it was actually me and my team's fault.

131
0:07:31.666,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There were two big reasons why our campaign had failed big time.

132
0:07:36.821,000 --> 0:07:38,000
One of those, the first reason,

133
0:07:39.071,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is we were standing against core values of people.

134
0:07:42.9,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We were saying no to something that was very important to them,

135
0:07:46.412,000 --> 0:07:48,000
challenging their code of honor,

136
0:07:48.759,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and hurting them deeply in the process.

137
0:07:51.026,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And number two, which was very important for me to learn,

138
0:07:53.725,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and amazing, and surprising for me to learn,

139
0:07:55.93,000 --> 0:07:58,000
was that we were not including the true heroes

140
0:07:59.111,000 --> 0:08:01,000
who should be fighting for themselves.

141
0:08:01.317,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The women in the villages had no idea we were fighting for them in the streets.

142
0:08:05.274,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Every time I would go back,

143
0:08:06.711,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I would find my cousins and friends with scarves on their faces,

144
0:08:09.718,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and I would ask, "What happened?"

145
0:08:11.512,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And they'd be like, "Our husbands beat us."

146
0:08:13.902,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But we are working in the streets for you!

147
0:08:16.781,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We are changing the policies.

148
0:08:18.383,000 --> 0:08:2,000
How is that not impacting their life?

149
0:08:21.355,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So then we found out something which was very amazing for us.

150
0:08:26.206,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The policies of a country

151
0:08:28.856,000 --> 0:08:32,000
do not necessarily always affect the tribal and rural communities.

152
0:08:33.467,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It was devastating -- like, oh, we can't actually do something about this?

153
0:08:37.771,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And we found out there's a huge gap

154
0:08:40.813,000 --> 0:08:43,000
when it comes to official policies and the real truth on the ground.

155
0:08:44.649,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So this time, we were like, we are going to do something different.

156
0:08:47.961,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We are going to use strategy,

157
0:08:49.71,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and we are going to go back and apologize.

158
0:08:52.699,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Yes, apologize.

159
0:08:54.35,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We went back to the communities

160
0:08:55.863,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and we said we are very ashamed of what we did.

161
0:08:59.111,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We are here to apologize, and in fact, we are here to make it up to you.

162
0:09:03.681,000 --> 0:09:04,000
How do we do that?

163
0:09:05.251,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We are going to promote three of your main cultures.

164
0:09:08.217,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We know that it's music, language, and embroidery.

165
0:09:11.799,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Nobody believed us.

166
0:09:13.325,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Nobody wanted to work with us.

167
0:09:16.063,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It took a lot of convincing and discussions with these communities

168
0:09:19.618,000 --> 0:09:22,000
until they agreed that we are going to promote their language

169
0:09:23.31,000 --> 0:09:27,000
by making a booklet of their stories, fables and old tales in the tribe,

170
0:09:27.972,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and we would promote their music

171
0:09:30.544,000 --> 0:09:35,000
by making a CD of the songs from the tribe, and some drumbeating.

172
0:09:36.055,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And the third, which was my favorite,

173
0:09:38.216,000 --> 0:09:42,000
was we would promote their embroidery by making a center in the village

174
0:09:42.227,000 --> 0:09:45,000
where women would come every day to make embroidery.

175
0:09:46.064,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And so it began.

176
0:09:48.038,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We worked with one village, and we started our first center.

177
0:09:52.77,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It was a beautiful day.

178
0:09:54.268,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We started the center.

179
0:09:55.372,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Women were coming to make embroidery,

180
0:09:57.441,000 --> 0:10:,000
and going through a life-changing process of education,

181
0:10:01.185,000 --> 0:10:04,000
learning about their rights, what Islam says about their rights,

182
0:10:04.235,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and enterprise development, how they can create money,

183
0:10:07.054,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and then how they can create money from money,

184
0:10:09.306,000 --> 0:10:12,000
how they can fight the customs that have been destroying their lives

185
0:10:13.184,000 --> 0:10:14,000
from so many centuries,

186
0:10:14.902,000 --> 0:10:15,000
because in Islam, in reality,

187
0:10:16.758,000 --> 0:10:19,000
women are supposed to be shoulder to shoulder with men.

188
0:10:20.373,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Women have so much status that we have not been hearing,

189
0:10:24.125,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that they have not been hearing,

190
0:10:25.938,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and we needed to tell them that they need to know

191
0:10:28.956,000 --> 0:10:3,000
where their rights are and how to take them by themselves,

192
0:10:31.696,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because they can do it and we can't.

193
0:10:34.021,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So this was the model which actually came out -- very amazing.

194
0:10:36.993,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Through embroidery we were promoting their traditions.

195
0:10:39.526,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We went into the village. We would mobilize the community.

196
0:10:42.237,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We would make a center inside where 30 women will come

197
0:10:45.257,000 --> 0:10:49,000
for six months to learn about value addition of traditional embroidery,

198
0:10:49.365,000 --> 0:10:52,000
enterprise development, life skills and basic education,

199
0:10:53.104,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and about their rights and how to say no to those customs

200
0:10:56.215,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and how to stand as leaders for themselves and the society.

201
0:10:59.886,000 --> 0:11:03,000
After six months, we would connect these women to loans and to markets

202
0:11:04.698,000 --> 0:11:07,000
where they can become local entrepreneurs in their communities.

203
0:11:08.608,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We soon called this project Sughar.

204
0:11:11.865,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Sughar is a local word used in many, many languages in Pakistan.

205
0:11:15.905,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It means skilled and confident women.

206
0:11:19.341,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I truly believe, to create women leaders, there's only one thing you have to do:

207
0:11:24.449,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Just let them know that they have what it takes to be a leader.

208
0:11:28.631,000 --> 0:11:29,000
These women you see here,

209
0:11:30.13,000 --> 0:11:34,000
they have strong skills and potential to be leaders.

210
0:11:34.573,000 --> 0:11:37,000
All we had to do was remove the barriers that surrounded them,

211
0:11:37.615,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and that's what we decided to do.

212
0:11:40.154,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But then while we were thinking everything was going well,

213
0:11:43.443,000 --> 0:11:45,000
once again everything was fantastic,

214
0:11:46.043,000 --> 0:11:48,000
we found our next setback:

215
0:11:48.11,000 --> 0:11:51,000
A lot of men started seeing the visible changes in their wife.

216
0:11:51.279,000 --> 0:11:53,000
She's speaking more, she's making decisions --

217
0:11:53.42,000 --> 0:11:55,000
oh my gosh, she's handling everything in the house.

218
0:11:56.109,000 --> 0:12:,000
They stopped them from coming to the centers,

219
0:12:00.578,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and this time, we were like, okay, time for strategy two.

220
0:12:04.622,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We went to the fashion industry in Pakistan

221
0:12:06.71,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and decided to do research about what happens there.

222
0:12:10.493,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Turns out the fashion industry in Pakistan is very strong and growing day by day,

223
0:12:15.48,000 --> 0:12:18,000
but there is less contribution from the tribal areas

224
0:12:19.046,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and to the tribal areas, especially women.

225
0:12:22.121,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So we decided to launch our first ever tribal women's very own fashion brand,

226
0:12:26.555,000 --> 0:12:28,000
which is now called Nomads.

227
0:12:30.085,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And so women started earning more,

228
0:12:32.267,000 --> 0:12:34,000
they started contributing more financially to the house,

229
0:12:35.073,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and men had to think again before saying no to them

230
0:12:38.304,000 --> 0:12:4,000
when they were coming to the centers.

231
0:12:43.343,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Applause)

232
0:12:46.106,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Thank you, thank you.

233
0:12:48.265,000 --> 0:12:53,000
In 2013, we launched our first Sughar Hub instead of a center.

234
0:12:53.442,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We partnered with TripAdvisor

235
0:12:55.602,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and created a cement hall in the middle of a village

236
0:12:59.514,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and invited so many other organizations to work over there.

237
0:13:03.752,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We created this platform for the nonprofits

238
0:13:05.847,000 --> 0:13:07,000
so they can touch and work on the other issues

239
0:13:08.17,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that Sughar is not working on,

240
0:13:10.395,000 --> 0:13:13,000
which would be an easy place for them to give trainings,

241
0:13:14.259,000 --> 0:13:16,000
use it as a farmer school, even as a marketplace,

242
0:13:16.874,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and anything they want to use it for,

243
0:13:19.146,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and they have been doing really amazingly.

244
0:13:21.259,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And so far, we have been able to support 900 women

245
0:13:24.789,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in 24 villages around Pakistan.

246
0:13:28.039,000 --> 0:13:32,000
(Applause)

247
0:13:33.624,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But that's actually not what I want.

248
0:13:38.758,000 --> 0:13:42,000
My dream is to reach out to one million women in the next 10 years,

249
0:13:43.41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and to make sure that happens,

250
0:13:45.059,000 --> 0:13:47,000
this year we launched Sughar Foundation in the U.S.

251
0:13:48.047,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It is not just going to fund Sughar but many other organizations in Pakistan

252
0:13:52.811,000 --> 0:13:54,000
to replicate the idea

253
0:13:55.02,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and to find even more innovative ways

254
0:13:57.76,000 --> 0:14:,000
to unleash the rural women's potential in Pakistan.

255
0:14:01.591,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Thank you so much.

256
0:14:03.564,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Applause)

257
0:14:06.606,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

258
0:14:11.056,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Chris Anderson: Khalida, you are quite the force of nature.

259
0:14:14.359,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I mean, this story, in many ways, just seems beyond belief.

260
0:14:18.982,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It's incredible that someone so young could do achieve this much

261
0:14:23.042,000 --> 0:14:25,000
through so much force and ingenuity.

262
0:14:25.9,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So I guess one question:

263
0:14:27.47,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This is a spectacular dream to reach out and empower a million women --

264
0:14:32.181,000 --> 0:14:35,000
how much of the current success depends on you,

265
0:14:35.975,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the force of this magnetic personality?

266
0:14:40.218,000 --> 0:14:42,000
How does it scale?

267
0:14:42.858,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Khalida Brohi: I think my job is to give the inspiration out,

268
0:14:47.344,000 --> 0:14:48,000
give my dream out.

269
0:14:49.065,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I can't teach how to do it, because there are so many different ways.

270
0:14:52.487,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We have been experimenting with three ways only.

271
0:14:54.792,000 --> 0:14:57,000
There are a hundred different ways to unleash potential in women.

272
0:14:58.385,000 --> 0:15:,000
I would just give the inspiration and that's my job.

273
0:15:01.033,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I will keep doing it. Sughar will still be growing.

274
0:15:03.507,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We are planning to reach out to two more villages,

275
0:15:06.595,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and soon I believe we will be scaling out of Pakistan

276
0:15:09.575,000 --> 0:15:11,000
into South Asia and beyond.

277
0:15:12.361,000 --> 0:15:15,000
CA: I love that when you talked about your team in the talk,

278
0:15:15.914,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I mean, you were all 18 at the time.

279
0:15:18.096,000 --> 0:15:19,000
What did this team look like?

280
0:15:19.861,000 --> 0:15:2,000
This was school friends, right?

281
0:15:21.509,000 --> 0:15:25,000
KB: Do people here believe that I'm at an age

282
0:15:26.478,000 --> 0:15:29,000
where I'm supposed to be a grandmother in my village?

283
0:15:29.522,000 --> 0:15:34,000
My mom was married at nine, and I am the oldest woman not married

284
0:15:35.412,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and not doing anything in my life in my village.

285
0:15:38.988,000 --> 0:15:41,000
CA: Wait, wait, wait, not doing anything?

286
0:15:42.285,000 --> 0:15:44,000
KB: No. CA: You're right.

287
0:15:44.653,000 --> 0:15:46,000
KB: People feel sorry for me, a lot of times.

288
0:15:47.556,000 --> 0:15:5,000
CA: But how much time are you spending now actually back in Balochistan?

289
0:15:51.48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
KB: I live over there.

290
0:15:53.367,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We live between, still, Karachi and Balochistan.

291
0:15:56.199,000 --> 0:15:58,000
My siblings are all going to school.

292
0:15:58.983,000 --> 0:16:,000
I am still the oldest of eight siblings.

293
0:16:01.424,000 --> 0:16:05,000
CA: But what you're doing is definitely threatening to some people there.

294
0:16:05.784,000 --> 0:16:09,000
How do you handle safety? Do you feel safe?

295
0:16:10.14,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Are there issues there?

296
0:16:12.265,000 --> 0:16:15,000
KB: This question has come to me a lot of times before,

297
0:16:16.075,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and I feel like the word "fear" just comes to me and then drops,

298
0:16:22.39,000 --> 0:16:25,000
but there is one fear that I have that is different from that.

299
0:16:26.12,000 --> 0:16:29,000
The fear is that if I get killed, what would happen to the people

300
0:16:29.623,000 --> 0:16:3,000
who love me so much?

301
0:16:31.608,000 --> 0:16:35,000
My mom waits for me till late at night that I should come home.

302
0:16:35.84,000 --> 0:16:37,000
My sisters want to learn so much from me,

303
0:16:38.585,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and there are many, many girls in my community who want to talk to me

304
0:16:41.846,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and ask me different things,

305
0:16:44.119,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and I recently got engaged. (Laughs)

306
0:16:46.91,000 --> 0:16:48,000

KB: Escaping arranged marriages, I chose my own husband

310
0:17:03.72,000 --> 0:17:07,000
across the world in L.A., a really different world.

311
0:17:08.178,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I had to fight for a whole year. That's totally a different story.

312
0:17:11.444,000 --> 0:17:15,000
But I think that's the only thing that I'm afraid of,

313
0:17:16.189,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and I don't want my mom to not see anyone when she waits in the night.

314
0:17:21.933,000 --> 0:17:23,000
CA: So people who want to help you on their way,

315
0:17:24.404,000 --> 0:17:26,000
they can go on, they can maybe buy some of these clothes

316
0:17:27.077,000 --> 0:17:29,000
that you're bringing over

317
0:17:29.649,000 --> 0:17:32,000
that are actually made, the embroidery is done back in Balochistan?

318
0:17:33.161,000 --> 0:17:34,000
KB: Yeah.

319
0:17:34.369,000 --> 0:17:36,000
CA: Or they can get involved in the foundation.

320
0:17:36.573,000 --> 0:17:38,000
KB: Definitely. We are looking for as many people as we can,

321
0:17:39.419,000 --> 0:17:42,000
because now that the foundation's in the beginning process,

322
0:17:43.117,000 --> 0:17:45,000
I am trying to learn a lot about how to operate,

323
0:17:45.708,000 --> 0:17:49,000
how to get funding or reach out to more organizations,

324
0:17:50.087,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and especially in the e-commerce, which is very new for me.

325
0:17:53.245,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I mean, I am not a fashion person, believe me.

326
0:17:55.632,000 --> 0:17:58,000
CA: Well, it's been incredible to have you here.

327
0:17:58.929,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Please go on being courageous, go on being smart, and please stay safe.

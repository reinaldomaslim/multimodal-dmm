1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Yeah, so a couple of years ago I was turning 60,

2
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I don't like being 60.

3
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I started grappling

5
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
with this existential angst

6
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of what little I had done with my life.

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It wasn't the resume

8
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of breaking this record here,

9
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
it was more like, who had I become?

10
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
How had I spent my valuable time?

11
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
How could this have gone by

12
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
like lightning?

13
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I couldn't forgive myself

14
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
for the countless, countless hours

15
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I had lost

16
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in negative thought --

17
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all the time I had spent beating myself up

18
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
for losing my marriage

19
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid

20
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and career moves

21
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and this and this and this.

22
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Just why, why didn't I do it better? Why? Why? Why?

23
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then my mother died at 82.

24
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And so I starting thinking,

25
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
not only am I not happy with the past,

26
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
now I'm getting choked with,

27
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"I've only got 22 years left."

28
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
What am I going to do with this short amount of time

29
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that's just fleeting?

30
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I'm not in the present whatsoever.

31
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I decided the remedy to all this malaise

32
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
was going to be

33
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
for me to chase

34
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
an elevated dream,

35
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
an extreme dream,

36
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
something that would require

37
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
utter conviction

38
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and unwavering passion,

39
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
something that would make me

40
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
be my best self

41
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in every aspect of my life,

42
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
every minute of every day,

43
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because the dream was so big

44
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
that I couldn't get there

45
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction.

46
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I decided,

47
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
it was an old dream that was lingering,

48
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that was from so many years ago,

49
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
three decades ago --

50
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the only sort of world class swim

51
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I had tried and failed at back in my 20s --

52
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
was going from Cuba to Florida.

53
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It was deep in my imagination.

54
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
No one's ever done it without a shark cage.

55
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's daunting.

56
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean.

57
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's probably, at my speed, at my age --

58
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for anybody's speed at anybody's age --

59
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
going to take 60, maybe 70, hours

60
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of continuous swimming,

61
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
never getting out on the boat.

62
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I started to train.

63
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I hadn't swum for 31 years, not a stroke.

64
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And I had kept in good shape, but swimming's a whole different animal.

65
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
As a matter of fact,

66
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
this picture is supposed to be me during training.

67
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's a smiling face.

68
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And when you're training for this sport, you are not smiling.

69
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's an arduous, difficult sport,

71
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and I don't remember smiling

72
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
at any time during this sport.

73
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
As I said, I respect other sports,

74
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I compare this sport sometimes

75
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to cycling and to mountain climbing

76
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and other of the expedition type events,

77
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but this is a sensory deprivation,

78
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a physical duress.

79
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And when I started in

80
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
with the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours

81
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims,

82
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I knew I had it,

83
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because I was making it through these.

84
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And when I said I'm going to go out and do a 15-hour swim,

85
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and we're coming into the dock after a long day

86
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and it's now night,

87
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we come in and it's 14 hours and 58 minutes

88
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and I can touch the dock and we're done,

89
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the trainer says, "That's great.

90
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's 14 hours 58 minutes. Who cares the last two minutes?"

91
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I say, "No, it's got to be 15 hours,"

92
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I swim another minute out and another minute back

93
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
to make the 15 hours.

94
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And I put together an expedition.

95
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's not that I didn't have help,

96
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but honestly, I sort of led, I was the team leader.

97
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And to get the government permissions,

98
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you read in the paper,

99
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you think it's easy to get into Cuba everyday?

100
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Try going in with an armada like we had

101
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of 50 people and five boats

102
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and CNN's crew, etc.

103
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The navigation is difficult.

104
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There's a big river called the Gulf Stream

105
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that runs across

106
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and it's not going in the direction you are.

107
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's going to the east and you'd like to go north.

108
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's tricky.

109
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And there's dehydration.

110
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And there's hypothermia.

111
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And there are sharks.

112
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And there are all kinds of problems.

113
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I gathered together, honestly,

114
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the world's leading experts in every possible way.

115
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And a month ago,

116
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the 23rd of September,

117
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I stood on that shore

118
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I looked across

119
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to that long, long faraway horizon

120
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I asked myself,

121
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
do you have it?

122
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Are your shoulders ready?

123
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And they were. They were prepared.

124
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
No stone left unturned.

125
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Was the mind ready?

126
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You know, you're swimming with the fogged goggles,

127
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you're swimming at 60 strokes a minute,

128
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so you're never really focused on anything, you don't see well.

129
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You've got tight bathing caps over your ears

130
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
trying to keep the heat of the head,

131
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because it's where the hypothermia starts,

132
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and so you don't hear very well.

133
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You're really left alone with your own thoughts.

134
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there

135
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in English, followed by German,

136
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
followed by Spanish, followed by French.

137
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You save the French for last.

138
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I had songs, I had a playlist in my head --

139
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
not through headphones, in my own head --

140
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
of 65 songs.

141
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I couldn't wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night,

142
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because that's when Neil Young comes out.

143
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

144
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And it's odd, isn't it?

145
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You'd think you'd be singing Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah"

146
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
out in the majesty of the ocean,

147
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
not songs about heroin addiction in New York City.

148
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But no, for some reason

149
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I couldn't wait to get into the dark of the night

150
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and be singing,

151
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000

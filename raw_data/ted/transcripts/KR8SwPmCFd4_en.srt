1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder --

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
thank God for technology --

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words --

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform --

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:47,000
if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.

9
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,

10
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.

11
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So these four characters are going to be from that work

12
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I've been doing for many years now,

13
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people

14
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:,000
I've interviewed.

15
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?

16
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I thought he would be the perfect person

17
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.

18
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,

19
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,

20
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."

21
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So this is his answer about a defining moment in American history.

23
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:37,000
"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one;

24
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one --

25
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.

26
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word

27
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage --

28
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.

29
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You see, we also have the technology.

30
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I say, less and less the human touch.

31
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Oh, let me kind of tell you a funny little play bit.

32
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,

33
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and they should leave the gate there.

34
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:07,000
These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.

35
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And these trains are smooth,

36
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and they're quiet and they're efficient.

37
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.

38
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.

39
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now we have humans imitating robots.

40
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.

41
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.

42
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in

43
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.

44
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And that voice, without losing a beat, says,

45
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'

46
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes

47
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.

48
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding --

49
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I do that to steel my nerves -- and so

50
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my --

51
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.

52
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs

53
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when I say that, but not on this train. Silence.

54
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And so suddenly they're looking at me.

55
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So here I am with the couple, the three of us

56
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.

57
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"Just then I see a baby, a little baby in the lap of a mother.

58
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.

59
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,

60
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,

61
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,

62
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:51,000
what is your considered opinion of the human species?'

63
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,

64
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:54,000
starts laughing,

65
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.

66
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'

67
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"But you see, the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.

68
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.

69
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain --

70
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:13,000
you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.

71
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.

72
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.

73
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?

74
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,

75
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but there's something in him.

76
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,

77
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.

78
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And Huck gets on the raft with a property named Jim, a slave, see.

79
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids

80
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and steal them from the woman who owns them,

81
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh --

82
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.

83
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;

84
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
he's going to do a terrible thing.'

85
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.

86
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:06,000
'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.'

87
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:13,000
'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.

88
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,

89
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?'

90
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"But it's the goodness of Huck, that stuff that Huck's been made of,

91
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
you see, all been buried; it's all been buried.

92
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.

93
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So you ask about a defining moment --

94
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
ain't no defining moment in American history for me.

95
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,

96
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:38,000
where trivia becomes news.

97
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.

98
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,

99
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,

100
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
'We're more and more into communications

101
0:05:55,000 --> 0:06:,000
and less and less into communication.'

102
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."

103
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And that's Studs Terkel.

104
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Applause)

105
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So, talk about risk taking. I'm going to do somebody that nobody likes.

106
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable --

107
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,

108
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I like to inspire people.

109
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But since this was called "risk taking,"

110
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable

111
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that one person actually came backstage

112
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and told me to take her out of the show she was in.

113
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,

114
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
at a conference like this, as a good thing.

115
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But there are certain other connotations to the word "risk,"

116
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?

117
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher

118
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:58,000
who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy --

119
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
great, big philosophy kind of an organization --

120
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I went to her and asked her what are the two things

121
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.

122
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey

123
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
when I see the president of my university.

124
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee

125
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."

126
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And she said, "And then intellectually,

127
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I don't know enough about the negative imagination.

128
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And September 11th certainly taught us

129
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that that's a whole area we don't investigate."

130
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So this piece is about a negative imagination.

131
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,

132
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and about what a risk can be.

133
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.

134
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Everything I do is word for word off a tape.

135
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,

136
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."

137
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.

138
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:,000
"I began to learn how to cover it up,

139
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.

140
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I want everybody to think we were a normal family.

141
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I mean we had all the materialistic things,

142
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but that didn't make my children pain any less;

143
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that didn't make their fears subside.

144
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes

145
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.

146
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact

147
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.

148
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And I failed them dramatically,

149
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because I allowed it to go on and on and on.

150
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"But the night that Myesha got killed --

151
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and the intensity just grew and grew and grew,

152
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
until one night we came home from getting drugs,

153
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,

154
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.

155
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing

156
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that Myesha was having sex with her little brother

157
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason.

158
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.

159
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And so he put her in the bathtub,

160
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and I was in the bedroom with the baby.

161
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
"And four months before this happened, four months before Myesha died,

162
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane --

163
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.

164
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And it didn't work, didn't work.

165
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,

166
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
who was four months old when I came to jail.

167
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"And I was in the bedroom. Like I said, he had her in the bathroom

168
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall.

169
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.

170
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.

171
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I didn't even go and see what was happening.

172
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I just sat there and listened.

173
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And then he put her in the hallway.

174
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:06,000
He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.

175
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And then he told her, get up.

176
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.

177
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.

178
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
All around her head was just swollen;

179
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:25,000
her head was about two sizes of its own size.

180
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.

181
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"The next morning she was dead.

182
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.

183
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
He says, 'She won't breathe.'

184
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I knew immediately that she was dead.

185
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in

186
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and I put a mirror to her mouth --

187
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:55,000
there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.

188
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:56,000
He said, he said, he said,

189
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.'

190
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:02,000
He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.

191
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"I mean, I've been keeping a secret for years and years and years,

192
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.

193
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,

194
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that she was missing.

195
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We told a security guard that she was missing,

196
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
though she wasn't missing.

197
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And we told the security guard what we had put on her

198
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing

199
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.

200
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"And then we got the baby and my other child,

201
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and we drove out to, like, I-95.

202
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I was so petrified and so numb,

203
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:55,000
all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.

204
0:11:55,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.

205
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:11,000
My own child, I let that happen to."

206
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.

207
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

208
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:27,000
When I started this project

209
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
called "On the Road: A Search For an American Character"

210
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:31,000
with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America

211
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,

212
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations,

213
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
because my first big show was a show about a race riot.

214
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And so I went to both -- two race riots,

215
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:49,000
one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.

216
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Because this is what I would say

217
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.

218
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.

219
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Everybody knows that the Los Angeles riots happened

220
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.

221
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It was captured on videotape -- technology --

222
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and it was played all over the world.

223
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.

224
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
They did not, so there were riots.

225
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,

226
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
ordered by George Bush, Sr.

227
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail

228
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.

229
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And I mean, the people just danced in the streets

230
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
because they were afraid there was going to be another riot.

231
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.

232
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So there was a community that didn't -- the Korean-Americans,

233
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
whose stores had been burned to the ground.

234
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,

235
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.

236
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And she asks also a question that Studs talks about:

237
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
this notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."

238
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance

239
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and questioning what justice is in society.

240
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."

241
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:04,000
"I used to believe America was the best.

242
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.

243
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I never saw any poor man, any black.

244
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do;

245
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I don't deny that because I am a victim.

246
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,

247
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,

248
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I began to really realize that Koreans

249
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:45,000
are completely left out of this society and we are nothing.

250
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Why? Why do we have to be left out?

251
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,

252
0:14:54,000 --> 0:15:01,000
no welfare, anything. Many African-Americans who never work

253
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:05,000
got minimum amount of money to survive.

254
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:13,000
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house.

255
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?

256
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:31,000
"OK. OK? OK. OK.

257
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.

258
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,

259
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,

260
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
all of South Central, all the churches. And they say,

261
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:51,000
'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'

262
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Well, what about victims' rights?

263
0:15:54,000 --> 0:16:01,000
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.

264
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:14,000
They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.

265
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:21,000
He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.

266
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:25,000
He is the model of non-violence, non-violence --

267
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and they would all like to be in his spirit.

268
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:37,000
"But what about 1992? They destroyed innocent people.

269
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And I wonder if that is really justice

270
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:48,000
for them, to get their rights in that way.

271
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.

272
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:04,000
They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.

273
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.

274
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims

275
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
who were destroyed by them.

276
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:3,000
They fought for their rights for over two centuries,

277
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,

278
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.

279
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:39,000
That's why I understand;

280
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:42,000
that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.

281
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:47,000
"But I wish that, I wish that, I wish that

282
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I could be part of the enjoyment.

283
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I wish that I could live together with black people.

284
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:07,000
But after the riot, it's too much difference.

285
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:14,000
The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].

286
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.

287
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:29,000
It's still there; it can burst out anytime."

288
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Mrs. Young-Soon Han.

289
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:44,000
(Applause)

290
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
The other reason that I don't wear shoes

291
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:51,000
is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up

292
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and get into the feet of somebody,

293
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:55,000
walking really in somebody else's shoes.

294
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year,

295
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:01,000
but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around

296
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,

297
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and I got sidetracked on race relations.

298
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Finally, I did find a bull rider, two years ago.

299
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.

300
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.

301
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:22,000
He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway --

302
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:26,000
so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,

303
0:19:26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
and this is on toughness,

304
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:3,000
in case anybody needs to know about being tough

305
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:33,000
for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.

306
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And this is called "Toughness."

307
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:41,000
"Well, I'm an optimist. I mean basically I'm an optimist.

308
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:43,000
I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,

309
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:45,000
her family's always saying,

310
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:47,000
you know, you ever think he's just a born loser?

311
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:49,000
It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.

312
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:51,000
But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,

313
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:53,000
I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney,

314
0:19:53,000 --> 0:19:55,000
I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.

315
0:19:55,000 --> 0:19:56,000
I think that's good luck.

316
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:58,000
(Laughter)

317
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:,000
"And, I mean, funny things like this happen.

318
0:20:,000 --> 0:20:04,000
I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan,

319
0:20:04,000 --> 0:20:07,000
and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.

320
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:1,000
It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says

321
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:11,000
if you want to get lucky,

322
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:13,000
you know, you've got to be around positive people.

323
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:17,000
I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here

324
0:20:17,000 --> 0:20:19,000
and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking;

325
0:20:19,000 --> 0:20:21,000
she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'

326
0:20:21,000 --> 0:20:23,000
"And then you called me up and you said you wanted to come out here

327
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.

328
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:27,000
She said, 'Look who she is.

329
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:29,000
You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.'

330
0:20:29,000 --> 0:20:33,000
(Laughter)

331
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:35,000
And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot

332
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:36,000
because I've never been to college,

333
0:20:36,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.

334
0:20:38,000 --> 0:20:4,000
I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.

335
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:42,000
You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know,

336
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:43,000
like, you know, she wanted me to talk,

337
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:48,000
I don't think she would even come out here.'

338
0:20:48,000 --> 0:20:51,000
"Confidence? Well, I think I ride

339
0:20:51,000 --> 0:20:54,000
more out of determination than confidence.

340
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:55,000
I mean, confidence is like, you know,

341
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:57,000
you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.

342
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:01,000
I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.

343
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:04,000
But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form,

344
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:06,000
get the horn.'

345
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:1,000
(Laughter)

346
0:21:1,000 --> 0:21:12,000
That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'

347
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:14,000
I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy,

348
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:17,000
he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.'

349
0:21:17,000 --> 0:21:19,000
And try and determination is the same thing.

350
0:21:19,000 --> 0:21:21,000
Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull,

351
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:23,000
even if you're riding upside down.

352
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:25,000
Determination's like, you're going to ride

353
0:21:25,000 --> 0:21:28,000
till your head hits the back of the dirt.

354
0:21:28,000 --> 0:21:32,000
"Freedom? It would have to be the rodeo.

355
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:37,000
"Beauty? I don't think I know what beauty is.

356
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:39,000
Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.

357
0:21:39,000 --> 0:21:4,000
I mean, look how we are, the roughy family,

358
0:21:4,000 --> 0:21:43,000
palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.

359
0:21:43,000 --> 0:21:46,000
It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.

360
0:21:46,000 --> 0:21:49,000
We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together

361
0:21:49,000 --> 0:21:5,000
and we sleep together.

362
0:21:5,000 --> 0:21:53,000
I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like

363
0:21:53,000 --> 0:21:55,000
the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.

364
0:21:55,000 --> 0:21:56,000
I mean, I have my ranch and everything,

365
0:21:56,000 --> 0:21:59,000
but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.

366
0:21:59,000 --> 0:22:01,000
I mean, I guess it just be like --

367
0:22:01,000 --> 0:22:05,000
I guess it be like the day my brother died.

368
0:22:05,000 --> 0:22:1,000
"Toughness? Well, we was in West Jordan, Utah, and this bull

369
0:22:1,000 --> 0:22:13,000
shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a --

370
0:22:13,000 --> 0:22:16,000
you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.

371
0:22:16,000 --> 0:22:18,000
And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.

372
0:22:18,000 --> 0:22:2,000
And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,

373
0:22:2,000 --> 0:22:23,000
so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia,

374
0:22:23,000 --> 0:22:26,000
or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.

375
0:22:26,000 --> 0:22:28,000
And then they had to straighten out my nose,

376
0:22:28,000 --> 0:22:31,000
and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose

377
0:22:31,000 --> 0:22:33,000
and went up through my brains

378
0:22:33,000 --> 0:22:35,000
and felt like it was coming out the top of my head,

379
0:22:35,000 --> 0:22:37,000
and everybody said that it should have killed me,

380
0:22:37,000 --> 0:22:41,000
but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.

381
0:22:41,000 --> 0:22:44,000
(Laughter)

382
0:22:44,000 --> 0:22:47,000
But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there

383
0:22:47,000 --> 0:22:49,000
and straightened my nose out, I could breathe,

384
0:22:49,000 --> 0:22:51,000
and I hadn't been able to breathe

385
0:22:51,000 --> 0:22:54,000
since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."

386
0:22:54,000 --> 0:22:56,000
Thank you.

387
0:22:56,000 --> 0:23:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Our face is hugely important

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because it's the external, visual part

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that everybody else sees.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Let's not forget it's a functional entity.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We have strong skull bones

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's where our senses are located, our special senses --

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
our vision, our speech,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
our hearing, our smell, our taste.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And this bone

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with cavities, the sinuses,

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which warm and moisten the air we breathe.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone --

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
our head would be dead weight,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we wouldn't be able to hold it erect,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This woman is slowly dying

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because the benign tumors in her facial bones

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
so she can't breathe and eat.

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Attached to the facial bones

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that define our face's structure

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
are the muscles that deliver our facial expression,

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
our universal language of expression,

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
our social-signaling system.

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And overlying this is the skin drape,

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
which is a hugely complex

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
three-dimensional structure --

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
taking right-angled bends here and there,

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
having thin areas like the eyelids,

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
thick areas like the cheek, different colors.

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And then we have the sensual factor of the face.

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Where do we like to kiss people?

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's the face where we're attracted to with that.

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But let's not forget the hair.

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You're looking at the image on your left-hand side --

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that's my son with his eyebrows present.

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
There's a definite difference.

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
he'd look even odder still.

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Dysmorphophobia

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is an extreme version

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of the fact that we don't see ourselves

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
as others see us.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's a shocking truth

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that we only see mirror images of ourselves,

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we only see ourselves

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in freeze-frame photographic images

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Dysmorphophobia

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is a perversion of this

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
where people who may be very good looking

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
regard themselves as hideously ugly

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and are constantly seeking surgery

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to correct their facial appearance.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They don't need this. They need psychiatric help.

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Max has kindly donated his photograph to me.

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In other words, he looks entirely normal.

64
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Age is another thing

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
when our attitude toward our appearance changes.

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by the behavior of adults around them.

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and she's having difficulty seeing.

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
As you can see, it's blocking her vision.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
She's also in danger, when she damages this,

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of bleeding profusely.

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Our research has shown

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that the parents and close loved ones of these children

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
adore them.

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They've grown used to their face; they think they're special.

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Actually, sometimes the parents argue

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about whether these children should have the lesion removed.

80
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because the child they've grown to love

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them.

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But other adults

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
say incredibly painful things.

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They say, "How dare you take this child out of the house

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and terrify other people.

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Shouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?"

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because -- a natural curiosity.

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And that obviously alerts the child

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
to their unusual nature.

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
After surgery, everything normalizes.

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The adults behave more naturally,

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the children play more readily with other children.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
As teenagers --

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
just think back to your teenage years --

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we're going through a dramatic

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and often disproportionate change

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in our facial appearance.

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We're trying to struggle to find our identity.

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We crave the approval of our peers.

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So our facial appearance is vital to us

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
as we're trying to project ourselves to the world.

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Just remember that single acne spot

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that crippled you for several days.

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,

108
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,

109
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
trying to raise one eyebrow?

110
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's a crippling time.

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward

113
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and her lower lip jutting forward.

114
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Turn to the person next to you,

116
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you

117
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and look at them -- they look miserable.

118
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
That's exactly what people used to say to Sue.

119
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
She wasn't miserable at all.

120
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?"

121
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
People were making misjudgments all the time

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
on her mood.

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So she chose to have facial surgery.

125
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
After the facial surgery,

126
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
she said, "My face now reflects my personality.

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
People know now that I'm enthusiastic,

128
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that I'm a happy person."

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers.

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Is this change, though, a real change,

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
or is it a figment of the imagination

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of the patient themselves?

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Well we studied teenagers' attitudes

134
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And what we found was --

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we jumbled up the photographs

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so they couldn't recognize the before and after --

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
what we found was that the patients were regarded

139
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
as being more attractive after the surgery.

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
on honesty, intelligence,

142
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
friendliness, violence.

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They were all perceived as being

144
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
less than normal in all those characteristics --

145
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
more violent, etc. -- before the surgery.

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
After the surgery,

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
they were perceived as being more intelligent,

148
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
more friendly, more honest, less violent --

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
or their character.

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
When people get older,

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Their presence in the consultation suite

154
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
What happens to them

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So this is a photograph of Henry,

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone,

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
his upper jaw, his eye-socket.

161
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
He looks pretty good at this stage.

162
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as the disease ravaged his face

164
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and destroyed my reconstruction regularly.

165
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
I learned a huge amount from Henry.

166
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Henry taught me

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that you can carry on working.

168
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.

169
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
He enjoyed life to the full,

170
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job

171
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and a caring family

172
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and was able to participate socially.

173
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
He maintained a calm insouciance.

174
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.

175
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This was something more than that. He ignored it.

176
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life

177
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and carried on oblivious to it.

178
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And that's what these people can do.

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.

180
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This is a man in his 20s

181
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer

182
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.

183
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It was my longest operation.

184
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.

185
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We removed all the bones at the right side of his face --

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
his eye, his nose,

187
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the skull bones, the facial skin --

188
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and reconstructed him with tissue from the back.

189
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.

191
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And again, he said,

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am."

194
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
His facial disfigurement

195
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
did not affect him

196
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
because he had the support of a family;

197
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
he had a successful, fulfilling job.

198
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So we've seen that we can change people's faces.

199
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But when we change people's faces,

200
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
are we changing their identity --

201
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
for better or for worse?

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
For instance,

203
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
there are two different types of facial surgery.

204
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We can categorize it like that.

205
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --

206
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
like Sue.

207
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
When they have facial surgery,

208
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
they feel their lives have changed

209
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because other people perceive them

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
as better people.

211
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They don't feel different.

212
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They feel that they've actually gained

213
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
what they never had,

214
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that their face now reflects their personality.

215
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery

216
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and this kind of surgery.

217
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Because you might say, "Well, this type of surgery

218
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
might be regarded as cosmetic."

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.

220
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They're trying to achieve difference in their lives.

221
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
She was just trying to achieve the face

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that matched her personality.

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But then we have other people

225
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
who don't choose to have facial surgery.

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They're people who have their face shot off.

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They have it forced upon them.

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And again, as I told you,

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
if they have a caring family

231
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and good work life,

232
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.

233
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Their identity doesn't change.

234
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Is this business

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
about appearance and preoccupation with it

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
a Western phenomenon?

237
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Muzetta's family give the lie to this.

238
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London

239
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which has already made her blind

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.

242
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
After she had surgery to remove the tumor,

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,

244
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
a pink ribbon in her hair,

245
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,

246
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims

247
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and the mother wore a full burqa.

248
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So it's not simply a Western phenomenon.

249
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We make judgments on people's faces

250
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
all the time.

251
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso

252
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and the way he would define criminal faces.

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
He said you could see criminal faces,

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
judging them just on the photographs that were showed.

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Good-looking people

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
are always judged as being more friendly.

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We look at O.J. --

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
he's a good-looking guy.

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.

260
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer,

261
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and actually he's not the good guy.

262
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And beauty doesn't equate to goodness,

263
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and certainly doesn't equate to contentment.

264
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So we've talked about the static face

265
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and judging the static face,

266
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but actually, we're more comfortable

267
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
with judging the moving face.

268
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We think we can judge people on their expressions.

269
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system

270
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
like to see a live witness

271
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity --

272
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the blink, the hesitation.

273
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And so they want to see live witnesses.

274
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,

275
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
we can make a judgment on somebody's face.

276
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.

277
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face,

278
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
our financial adviser's face was covered?

279
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We'd be pretty uncomfortable.

280
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But are we good at making the judgments

281
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
on facial appearance and movement?

282
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The truth is that there's a five-minute rule,

283
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.

284
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
If you spend five minutes with somebody,

285
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
you start looking beyond their facial appearance,

286
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and the people who you're initially attracted to

287
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
may seem boring and you lose interest in them,

288
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and the people who you didn't immediately seek out,

289
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
because you didn't find them particularly attractive,

290
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
become attractive people

291
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because of their personality.

292
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So we've talked a lot about facial appearance.

293
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I now want to share

294
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
a little bit of the surgery that we do --

295
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
where we're at and where we're going.

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This is an image of Ann

297
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.

298
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And you can see in the images afterward,

299
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
we've managed to reconstruct her successfully.

300
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But that's not good enough.

301
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking,

302
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
she wants to be out climbing mountains.

303
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to.

304
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
This is a horrific image,

305
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
so I'm putting my hand up now.

306
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
This is a photograph of Adi,

307
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off

308
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in an armed robbery.

309
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin

310
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and his upper jaw and teeth.

311
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This is the bar that he set for us.

312
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before."

313
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So with modern technology,

314
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we used computers to make models.

315
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We made a model of the jaw without bone in it.

316
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We then bent a plate up to it.

317
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
We put it in place

318
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
so we knew it was an accurate position.

319
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We then put bone and tissue from the back.

320
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Here you can see the plate holding it,

321
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and you can see the implants being put in --

322
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
so that in one operation

323
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
we achieve this

324
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and this.

325
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So the patient's life is restored.

326
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
That's the good news.

327
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
However, his chin skin

328
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
doesn't look the same as it did before.

329
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It's skin from his back.

330
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.

331
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And that's where we're failing,

332
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and that's where we need the face transplant.

333
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The face transplant has a role

334
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
probably in burns patients to replace the skin.

335
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We can replace the underlying skeletal structure,

336
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.

337
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So it's very valuable

338
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to have that tool in our armamentarium.

339
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But the patients are going to have to take drugs

340
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.

341
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
What does that mean?

342
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.

343
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
This is not a life-saving transplant --

344
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant --

345
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it is a quality-of-life transplant,

346
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and as a result,

347
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,

348
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this

349
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.

350
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We also don't know what they feel

351
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
about recognition and identity.

352
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation,

353
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
are studying that.

354
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Donors are going to be short on the ground,

355
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
because how many people want to have their loved one's face

356
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
removed at the point of death?

357
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So there are going to be problems

358
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
with face transplantation.

359
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
So the better news is

360
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
the future's almost here --

361
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and the future is tissue engineering.

362
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Just imagine,

363
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I can make a biologically-degradable template.

364
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I can put it in place where it's meant to be.

365
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I can sprinkle a few cells,

366
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
stem cells from the patient's own hip,

367
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
a little bit of genetically engineered protein,

368
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.

369
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe.

370
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
But we've still got problems.

371
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
We've got mouth cancer to solve.

372
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer.

373
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We're still not reconstructing them well enough.

374
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
In the U.K. we have an epidemic

375
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
of facial injuries among young people.

376
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We still can't get rid of scars.

377
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We need to do research.

378
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And the best news of all

379
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is that surgeons know

380
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that we need to do research.

381
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And we've set up charities

382
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that will help us fund

383
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the clinical research

384
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to determine the best treatment practice now

385
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and better treatment into the future,

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay.

387
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Let's leave it as it is."

388
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Thank you very much indeed.

389
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Applause)

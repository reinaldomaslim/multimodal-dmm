1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.

4
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.

5
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:51,000
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.

6
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.

7
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.

8
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The question is, why?

9
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,

10
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places

11
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:21,000
like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.

12
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.

13
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.

14
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.

15
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.

16
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:37,000
One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.

17
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.

18
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Education is the main event that can happen in cities.

19
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What's going on in the street in Mumbai?

20
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.

21
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.

22
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.

23
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So here's the first punch line:

24
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:19,000
cities have defused the population bomb.

25
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And here's the second punch line.

26
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.

27
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.

28
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now we're shining right back up.

29
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Thank you.

2
0:00:12.537,000 --> 0:00:13,000
In 1991 I had

3
0:00:14.363,000 --> 0:00:16,000
maybe the most profound and transformative

4
0:00:17.121,000 --> 0:00:18,000
experience of my life.

5
0:00:18.687,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree.

6
0:00:23.414,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I took a couple victory laps in there.

7
0:00:25.605,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California,

8
0:00:29.827,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus,

9
0:00:32.484,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and we were relaxing next to this beautiful

10
0:00:34.55,000 --> 0:00:36,000
idyllic lake in the mountains.

11
0:00:36.739,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise,

12
0:00:41.135,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and as we sat there, over the mountains coming in

13
0:00:43.851,000 --> 0:00:45,000
from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds

14
0:00:46.819,000 --> 0:00:47,000
rolling toward us,

15
0:00:48.292,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley,

16
0:00:50.939,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so help me God, every single animal in that place

17
0:00:55.337,000 --> 0:00:57,000
stopped making noise at the same time.

18
0:00:57.553,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Whoosh) This electric hush, as if they could sense what was about to happen.

19
0:01:02.637,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And then the clouds came over us, and then,

20
0:01:04.697,000 --> 0:01:08,000
boom! This massive thunderclap, and sheets of rain.

21
0:01:09.007,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was just extraordinary, and when I came back home

22
0:01:12.469,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz,

23
0:01:15.472,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and decided to set it to music,

24
0:01:17.973,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a piece for choir called "Cloudburst,"

25
0:01:20.154,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which is the piece that we'll perform for you in just a moment.

26
0:01:23.317,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now fast forward to just three years ago.

27
0:01:27.692,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Music) And we released to YouTube this,

28
0:01:31.133,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the Virtual Choir Project,

29
0:01:33.389,000 --> 0:01:36,000
185 singers from 12 different countries.

30
0:01:36.596,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You can see my little video there conducting these people,

31
0:01:40.033,000 --> 0:01:41,000
alone in their dorm rooms

32
0:01:41.188,000 --> 0:01:44,000
or in their living rooms at home.

33
0:01:44.277,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Two years ago, on this very stage, we premiered

34
0:01:48.003,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Virtual Choir 2,

35
0:01:51.55,000 --> 0:01:55,000
2,052 singers from 58 different countries,

36
0:01:56.112,000 --> 0:01:59,000
this time performing a piece that I had written called "Sleep."

37
0:01:59.403,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3,

38
0:02:04.697,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"Water Night," another piece that I had written,

39
0:02:07.253,000 --> 0:02:13,000
this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries.

40
0:02:13.517,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Music)

41
0:02:18.936,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future

42
0:02:21.943,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this,

43
0:02:24.093,000 --> 0:02:28,000
he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could.

44
0:02:28.854,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Could we do this all in real time?

45
0:02:31.357,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Could we have people singing together in real time?

46
0:02:34.397,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And with the help of Skype,

47
0:02:35.992,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that is what we are going to attempt today.

48
0:02:38.096,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now, we'll perform "Cloudburst" for you.

49
0:02:40.269,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage.

50
0:02:43.421,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach,

51
0:02:45.917,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College,

52
0:02:49.245,000 --> 0:02:52,000
some of the best amateur choirs in the country, and —

53
0:02:52.565,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Applause) --

54
0:02:59.603,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and in the second half of the piece,

55
0:03:01.789,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the virtual choir will join us, 30 different singers

56
0:03:04.611,000 --> 0:03:06,000
from 30 different countries.

57
0:03:06.661,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, we've pushed the technology as far as it can go,

58
0:03:09.245,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but there's still less than a second of latency,

59
0:03:12.077,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but in musical terms, that's a lifetime.

60
0:03:14.156,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We deal in milliseconds.

61
0:03:15.608,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So what I've done is, I've adapted "Cloudburst"

62
0:03:18.075,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so that it embraces the latency

63
0:03:20.578,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and the performers sing into the latency

64
0:03:23.483,000 --> 0:03:25,000
instead of trying to be exactly together.

65
0:03:25.981,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So with deep humility, and for your approval,

66
0:03:29.245,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we present "Cloudburst."

67
0:03:31.357,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:36.076,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Piano)

69
0:03:42.249,000 --> 0:03:46,000
[The rain ...]

70
0:03:53.142,000 --> 0:03:56,000
[Eyes of shadow-water]

71
0:03:58.253,000 --> 0:04:01,000
[eyes of well-water]

72
0:04:16.512,000 --> 0:04:22,000
[eyes of dream-water.]

73
0:04:27.439,000 --> 0:04:33,000
[Blue suns, green whirlwinds,]

74
0:04:45.919,000 --> 0:04:5,000
[birdbeaks of light pecking open]

75
0:04:53.687,000 --> 0:04:56,000
[pomegranate stars.]

76
0:05:03.694,000 --> 0:05:09,000
[But tell me, burnt earth, is there no water?]

77
0:05:22.311,000 --> 0:05:26,000
[Only blood, only dust,]

78
0:05:30.239,000 --> 0:05:34,000
[only naked footsteps on the thorns?]

79
0:05:46.903,000 --> 0:05:49,000
[The rain awakens...]

80
0:06:04.271,000 --> 0:06:07,000
[We must sleep with open eyes,]

81
0:06:07.583,000 --> 0:06:11,000
[we must dream with our hands,]

82
0:06:20.14,000 --> 0:06:24,000
[we must dream the dreams of a river seeking its course,]

83
0:06:25.191,000 --> 0:06:28,000
[of the sun dreaming its worlds.]

84
0:06:39.628,000 --> 0:06:45,000
[We must dream aloud,]

85
0:07:00.967,000 --> 0:07:07,000
[we must sing till the song puts forth roots,]

86
0:07:27.759,000 --> 0:07:31,000
[trunk, branches, birds, stars.]

87
0:07:57.475,000 --> 0:08:01,000
[We must find the lost word,]

88
0:08:12.322,000 --> 0:08:15,000
[and remember what the blood,]

89
0:08:20.187,000 --> 0:08:24,000
[the tides, the earth, and the body say,]

90
0:08:46.991,000 --> 0:08:52,000
[and return to the point of departure...]

91
0:09:04.561,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Music)

92
0:11:34.745,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

93
0:11:49.169,000 --> 0:11:51,000
["Cloudburst" Octavio Paz][translation by Lysander Kemp, adapted by Eric Whitacre]

94
0:11:51.478,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Eric Whitacre: Beth. Annabelle, where are you? Jacob.

95
0:11:58.881,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Applause)

96
0:12:20.622,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thank you.

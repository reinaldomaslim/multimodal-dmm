1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Ten years ago exactly,

2
0:00:14,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was in Afghanistan.

3
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I was covering the war in Afghanistan,

4
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I witnessed, as a reporter for Al Jazeera,

5
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the amount of suffering and destruction

6
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that emerged out of a war like that.

7
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Then, two years later,

8
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I covered another war -- the war in Iraq.

9
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I was placed at the center of that war

10
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
because I was covering the war

11
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
from the northern part of Iraq.

12
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And the war ended

13
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
with a regime change,

14
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:47,000
like the one in Afghanistan.

15
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And that regime

16
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that we got rid of

17
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
was actually a dictatorship,

18
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
an authoritarian regime,

19
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that for decades

20
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:03,000
created a great sense of paralysis

21
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
within the nation, within the people themselves.

22
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
However,

23
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the change that came through foreign intervention

24
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
created even worse circumstances for the people

25
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and deepened the sense

26
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of paralysis and inferiority

27
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in that part of the world.

28
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
For decades,

29
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we have lived under authoritarian regimes --

30
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in the Arab world, in the Middle East.

31
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
These regimes

32
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
created something within us during this period.

33
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm 43 years old right now.

34
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
For the last 40 years,

35
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I have seen almost the same faces

36
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for kings and presidents ruling us --

37
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
old, aged, authoritarian,

38
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
corrupt situations --

39
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
regimes that we have seen around us.

40
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And for a moment I was wondering,

41
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
are we going to live in order to see

42
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
real change happening on the ground,

43
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a change that does not come through foreign intervention,

44
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
through the misery of occupation,

45
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
through nations invading our land

46
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes?

47
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The Iraqis: yes, they got rid of Saddam Hussein,

48
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but when they saw

49
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
their land occupied by foreign forces

50
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they felt very sad,

51
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
they felt that their dignity had suffered.

52
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this is why they revolted.

53
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is why they did not accept.

54
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And actually other regimes, they told their citizens,

55
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Would you like to see the situation of Iraq?

56
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Would you like to see civil war, sectarian killing?

57
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Would you like to see destruction?

58
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Would you like to see foreign troops on your land?"

59
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the people thought for themselves,

60
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"Maybe we should live with

61
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
this kind of authoritarian situation that we find ourselves in,

62
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
instead of having the second scenario."

63
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
That was one of the worst nightmares that we have seen.

64
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
For 10 years,

65
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
unfortunately we have found ourselves

66
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
reporting images of destruction,

67
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
images of killing,

68
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
of sectarian conflicts,

69
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
images of violence,

70
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
emerging from a magnificent piece of land,

71
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
a region that one day was the source

72
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of civilizations and art and culture

73
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for thousands of years.

74
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now I am here to tell you

75
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that the future

76
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that we were dreaming for

77
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
has eventually arrived.

78
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
A new generation,

79
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
well-educated,

80
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
connected,

81
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
inspired by universal values

82
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and a global understanding,

83
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
has created a new reality for us.

84
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We have found a new way

85
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to express our feelings

86
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and to express our dreams:

87
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
these young people

88
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
who have restored self-confidence

89
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in our nations in that part of the world,

90
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
who have given us

91
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
new meaning for freedom

92
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and empowered us to go down to the streets.

93
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Nothing happened. No violence. Nothing.

94
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Just step out of your house,

95
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
raise your voice

96
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and say, "We would like to see the end of the regime."

97
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is what happened in Tunisia.

98
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Over a few days,

99
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the Tunisian regime that invested billions of dollars

100
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in the security agencies,

101
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
billions of dollars

102
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in maintaining, trying to maintain,

103
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
its prisons,

104
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
collapsed, disappeared,

105
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because of the voices of the public.

106
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
People who were inspired to go down to the streets

107
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and to raise their voices,

108
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they tried to kill.

109
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The intelligence agencies wanted to arrest people.

110
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They found something called Facebook.

111
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They found something called Twitter.

112
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
They were surprised by all of these kinds of issues.

113
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And they said,

114
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"These kids are misled."

115
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Therefore, they asked their parents

116
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to go down to the streets

117
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and collect them, bring them back home.

118
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is what they were telling. This is their propaganda.

119
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"Bring these kids home

120
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because they are misled."

121
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But yes,

122
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
these youth

123
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
who have been inspired

124
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
by universal values,

125
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
who are idealistic enough

126
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to imagine a magnificent future

127
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and, at the same time, realistic enough

128
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to balance this kind of imagination

129
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the process leading to it --

130
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
not using violence,

131
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
not trying to create chaos --

132
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
these young people,

133
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they did not go home.

134
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Parents actually went to the streets

135
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and they supported them.

136
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And this is how the revolution was born in Tunisia.

137
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We in Al Jazeera

138
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
were banned from Tunisia for years,

139
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the government did not allow

140
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
any Al Jazeera reporter to be there.

141
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But we found that these people in the street,

142
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
all of them are our reporters,

143
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
feeding our newsroom

144
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
with pictures, with videos

145
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and with news.

146
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And suddenly that newsroom in Doha

147
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
became a center

148
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that received all this kind of input from ordinary people --

149
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
people who are connected and people who have ambition

150
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and who have liberated themselves

151
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
from the feeling of inferiority.

152
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And then we took that decision:

153
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We are unrolling the news.

154
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We are going to be the voice for these voiceless people.

155
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We are going to spread the message.

156
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Yes, some of these young people

157
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
are connected to the Internet,

158
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but the connectivity in the Arab world

159
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is very little, is very small,

160
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because of many problems that we are suffering from.

161
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But Al Jazeera took the voice from these people

162
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and we amplified [it].

163
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We put it in every sitting room in the Arab world --

164
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and internationally, globally,

165
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
through our English channel.

166
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And then people started to feel

167
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that there's something new happening.

168
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And then Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali

169
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
decided to leave.

170
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And then Egypt started,

171
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and Hosni Mubarak decided to leave.

172
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And now Libya as you see it.

173
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And then you have Yemen.

174
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And you have many other countries trying to see

175
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and to rediscover that feeling

176
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
of, "How do we imagine a future

177
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which is magnificent and peaceful and tolerant?"

178
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I want to tell you something,

179
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that the Internet and connectivity

180
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
has created [a] new mindset.

181
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But this mindset

182
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
has continued to be faithful

183
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to the soil and to the land

184
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that it emerged from.

185
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And while this was the major difference

186
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
between many initiatives before

187
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to create change,

188
0:07:57,000 --> 0:07:59,000
before we thought, and governments told us --

189
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and even sometimes it was true --

190
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that change was imposed on us,

191
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and people rejected that,

192
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
because they thought that it is alien to their culture.

193
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Always, we believed

194
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that change will spring from within,

195
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that change should be a reconciliation

196
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
with culture, cultural diversity,

197
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
with our faith in our tradition

198
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and in our history,

199
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but at the same time,

200
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
open to universal values, connected with the world,

201
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
tolerant to the outside.

202
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And this is the moment

203
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that is happening right now in the Arab world.

204
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is the right moment, and this is the actual moment

205
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that we see all of these meanings meet together

206
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and then create the beginning

207
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
of this magnificent era

208
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that will emerge from the region.

209
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
How did the elite deal with that --

210
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the so-called political elite?

211
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In front of Facebook,

212
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
they brought the camels in Tahrir Square.

213
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
In front of Al Jazeera,

214
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:08,000
they started creating tribalism.

215
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And then when they failed,

216
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
they started speaking about conspiracies

217
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that emerged from Tel Aviv and Washington

218
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in order to divide the Arab world.

219
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
They started telling the West,

220
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"Be aware of Al-Qaeda.

221
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Al-Qaeda is taking over our territories.

222
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
These are Islamists

223
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:29,000
trying to create new Imaras.

224
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Be aware of these people

225
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who [are] coming to you

226
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in order to ruin your great civilization."

227
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Fortunately,

228
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
people right now cannot be deceived.

229
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Because this corrupt elite

230
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in that region

231
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:51,000
has lost even the power of deception.

232
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They could not, and they cannot, imagine

233
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
how they could really deal with this reality.

234
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
They have lost.

235
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
They have been detached

236
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:03,000
from their people, from the masses,

237
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and now we are seeing them collapsing

238
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
one after the other.

239
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Al Jazeera is not

240
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
a tool of revolution.

241
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We do not create revolutions.

242
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
However,

243
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
when something of that magnitude happens,

244
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
we are at the center of the coverage.

245
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We were banned from Egypt,

246
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and our correspondents,

247
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:31,000
some of them were arrested.

248
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But most of our camera people

249
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and our journalists,

250
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
they went underground in Egypt -- voluntarily --

251
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to report what happened in Tahrir Square.

252
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
For 18 days,

253
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
our cameras were broadcasting, live,

254
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the voices of the people in Tahrir Square.

255
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I remember one night

256
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
when someone phoned me on my cellphone --

257
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
ordinary person who I don't know -- from Tahrir Square.

258
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
He told me, "We appeal to you

259
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
not to switch off the cameras.

260
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you switch off the cameras tonight,

261
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
there will be a genocide.

262
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
You are protecting us

263
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
by showing what is happening at Tahrir Square."

264
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I felt the responsibility

265
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to phone our correspondents there

266
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and to phone our newsroom

267
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and to tell them, "Make your best

268
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
not to switch off the cameras at night,

269
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
because the guys there really feel confident

270
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
when someone is reporting their story --

271
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and they feel protected as well."

272
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So we have a chance

273
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to create a new future

274
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in that part of the world.

275
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We have a chance

276
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to go and to think of the future

277
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
as something which is open to the world.

278
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Let us not repeat the mistake of Iran,

279
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
of [the] Mosaddeq revolution.

280
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Let us free ourselves -- especially in the West --

281
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
from thinking about that part of the world

282
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
based on oil interest,

283
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
or based on interests

284
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of the illusion of stability and security.

285
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The stability and security

286
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of authoritarian regimes

287
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
cannot create

288
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but terrorism and violence and destruction.

289
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Let us accept the choice of the people.

290
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Let us not pick and choose

291
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
who we would like to rule their future.

292
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The future should be ruled

293
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
by people themselves,

294
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
even sometimes if they are voices

295
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that might now scare us.

296
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But the values of democracy

297
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and the freedom of choice

298
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that is sweeping the Middle East at this moment in time

299
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is the best opportunity for the world,

300
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
for the West and the East,

301
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to see stability and to see security

302
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and to see friendship and to see tolerance

303
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
emerging from the Arab world,

304
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
rather than the images of violence and terrorism.

305
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Let us support these people.

306
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Let us stand for them.

307
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And let us give up

308
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:,000
our narrow selfishness

309
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in order to embrace change,

310
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and in order to celebrate with the people of that region

311
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
a great future

312
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and hope and tolerance.

313
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The future has arrived,

314
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and the future is now.

315
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I thank you very much.

316
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Applause)

317
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Thank you very much.

318
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Applause)

319
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Chris Anderson: I just have a couple of questions for you.

320
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Thank you for coming here.

321
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
How would you characterize the historical significance

322
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
of what's happened?

323
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Is this a story-of-the-year, a story-of-the-decade

324
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
or something more?

325
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Wadah Khanfar: Actually, this may be the biggest story that we have ever covered.

326
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We have covered many wars.

327
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We have covered a lot of tragedies, a lot of problems,

328
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
a lot of conflict zones, a lot of hot spots in the region,

329
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
because we were centered at the middle of it.

330
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But this is a story -- it is a great story; it is beautiful.

331
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It is not something that you only cover

332
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because you have to cover a great incident.

333
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:14,000
You are witnessing change in history.

334
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
You are witnessing the birth of a new era.

335
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And this is what the story's all about.

336
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
CA: There are a lot of people in the West

337
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
who are still skeptical,

338
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
or think this may just be an intermediate stage

339
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
before much more alarming chaos.

340
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
You really believe

341
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that if there are democratic elections in Egypt now,

342
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that a government could emerge

343
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that espouses some of the values you've spoken about so inspiringly?

344
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:41,000
WK: And people actually,

345
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
after the collapse of the Hosni Mubarak regime,

346
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the youth who have organized themselves

347
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in certain groups and councils,

348
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:52,000
they are guarding the transformation

349
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and they are trying to put it on a track

350
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in order to satisfy

351
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the values of democracy,

352
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
but at the same time

353
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
also to make it reasonable

354
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and to make it rational,

355
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
not to go out of order.

356
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
In my opinion, these people are much more wiser

357
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
than, not only the political elite,

358
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
even the intellectual elite, even opposition leaders

359
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
including political parties.

360
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
At this moment in time, the youth in the Arab world

361
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
are much more wiser

362
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and capable of creating the change

363
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
than the old --

364
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
including the political and cultural

365
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and ideological

366
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
old regimes.

367
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Applause)

368
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
CA: We are not to get involved politically and interfere in that way.

369
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
What should people here at TED,

370
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
here in the West,

371
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
do if they want to connect or make a difference

372
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and they believe in what's happening here?

373
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
WK: I think we have discovered a very important issue in the Arab world --

374
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that people care,

375
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
people care about this great transformation.

376
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Mohamed Nanabhay who's sitting with us,

377
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:,000
the head of Aljazeera.net,

378
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:05,000
he told me that a 2,500 percent increase

379
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:07,000
of accessing our website

380
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
from various parts of the world.

381
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Fifty percent of it is coming from America.

382
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Because we discovered that people care,

383
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and people would like to know --

384
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
they are receiving the stream through our Internet.

385
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Unfortunately in the United States,

386
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we are not covering but Washington D.C. at this moment in time

387
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
for Al Jazeera English.

388
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But I can tell you, this is the moment to celebrate

389
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
through connecting ourselves

390
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:32,000
with those people in the street

391
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and expressing our support to them

392
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and expressing this kind of feeling, universal feeling,

393
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
of supporting the weak and the oppressed

394
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
to create a much better future for all of us.

395
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
CA: Well Wadah, a group of members of the TED community,

396
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:5,000
TEDxCairo,

397
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:52,000
are meeting as we speak.

398
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:54,000
They've had some speakers there.

399
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I believe they've heard your talk.

400
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Thank you for inspiring them and for inspiring all of us.

401
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
Thank you so much.

402
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.924,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Carlos,

2
0:00:14.477,000 --> 0:00:15,000
the Vietnam vet Marine

3
0:00:16.054,000 --> 0:00:19,000
who volunteered for three tours and got shot up in every one.

4
0:00:20.65,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In 1971, he was medically retired

5
0:00:22.776,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because he had so much shrapnel in his body

6
0:00:25.099,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that he was setting off metal detectors.

7
0:00:28.279,000 --> 0:00:31,000
For the next 42 years, he suffered from nightmares,

8
0:00:31.404,000 --> 0:00:33,000
extreme anxiety in public,

9
0:00:33.642,000 --> 0:00:35,000
isolation, depression.

10
0:00:35.677,000 --> 0:00:36,000
He self-medicated with alcohol.

11
0:00:37.605,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He was married and divorced three times.

12
0:00:40.535,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Carlos had post-traumatic stress disorder.

13
0:00:44.129,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Now, I became a psychologist to help mitigate human suffering,

14
0:00:47.73,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and for the past 10 years, my target has been the suffering caused by PTSD,

15
0:00:52.241,000 --> 0:00:54,000
as experienced by veterans like Carlos.

16
0:00:55.356,000 --> 0:01:,000
Until recently, the science of PTSD just wasn't there.

17
0:01:01.161,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And so, we didn't know what to do.

18
0:01:03.561,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We put some veterans on heavy drugs.

19
0:01:05.949,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Others we hospitalized and gave generic group therapy,

20
0:01:08.777,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and others still we simply said to them,

21
0:01:10.899,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Just go home and try to forget about your experiences."

22
0:01:15.534,000 --> 0:01:18,000
More recently, we've tried therapy dogs, wilderness retreats --

23
0:01:18.901,000 --> 0:01:2,000
many things which may temporarily relieve stress,

24
0:01:21.846,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but which don't actually eliminate PTSD symptoms over the long term.

25
0:01:26.654,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But things have changed.

26
0:01:28.451,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I am here to tell you that we can now eliminate PTSD,

27
0:01:33.631,000 --> 0:01:34,000
not just manage the symptoms,

28
0:01:35.482,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and in huge numbers of veterans.

29
0:01:37.054,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Because new scientific research has been able to show,

30
0:01:40.056,000 --> 0:01:42,000
objectively, repeatedly,

31
0:01:42.458,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which treatments actually get rid of symptoms and which do not.

32
0:01:45.957,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now as it turns out,

33
0:01:47.629,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the best treatments for PTSD use many of the very same training principles

34
0:01:52.883,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that the military uses in preparing its trainees for war.

35
0:01:58.227,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, making war --

36
0:02:00.254,000 --> 0:02:02,000
this is something that we are good at.

37
0:02:02.993,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We humans have been making war since before we were even fully human.

38
0:02:08.006,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And since then, we have gone from using stone and sinew

39
0:02:11.494,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to developing the most sophisticated and devastating weapon systems imaginable.

40
0:02:16.108,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And to enable our warriors to use these weapons,

41
0:02:18.467,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we employ the most cutting-edge training methods.

42
0:02:20.812,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We are good at making war.

43
0:02:22.898,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And we are good at training our warriors to fight.

44
0:02:26.687,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Yet, when we consider the experience of the modern-day combat veteran,

45
0:02:30.2,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we begin to see that we have not been as good

46
0:02:33.411,000 --> 0:02:34,000
at preparing them to come home.

47
0:02:35.447,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Why is that?

48
0:02:37.731,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Well, our ancestors lived immersed in conflict,

49
0:02:41.029,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and they fought right where they lived.

50
0:02:44.094,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So until only very recently in our evolutionary history,

51
0:02:47.132,000 --> 0:02:49,000
there was hardly a need to learn how to come home from war,

52
0:02:50.048,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because we never really did.

53
0:02:53.377,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But thankfully, today,

54
0:02:54.643,000 --> 0:02:57,000
most of humanity lives in far more peaceful societies,

55
0:02:57.682,000 --> 0:03:,000
and when there is conflict, we, especially in the United States,

56
0:03:01.685,000 --> 0:03:04,000
now have the technology to put our warriors through advanced training,

57
0:03:05.206,000 --> 0:03:07,000
drop them in to fight anywhere on the globe

58
0:03:08.047,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and when they're done,

59
0:03:09.53,000 --> 0:03:11,000
jet them back to peacetime suburbia.

60
0:03:12.514,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But just imagine for a moment what this must feel like.

61
0:03:17.064,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I've spoken with veterans who've told me

62
0:03:19.108,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that one day they're in a brutal firefight in Afghanistan

63
0:03:22.224,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where they saw carnage and death,

64
0:03:25.867,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and just three days later, they found themselves

65
0:03:28.361,000 --> 0:03:3,000
toting an ice chest to their kid's soccer game.

66
0:03:32.405,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"Mindfuck" is the most common term.

67
0:03:35.194,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:36.632,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's the most common term I've heard to describe that experience.

69
0:03:39.775,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And that's exactly what that is.

70
0:03:41.323,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Because while our warriors spend countless hours training for war,

71
0:03:45.336,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we've only recently come to understand

72
0:03:47.253,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that many require training on how to return to civilian life.

73
0:03:51.642,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, like any training, the best PTSD treatments require repetition.

74
0:03:55.757,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In the military,

75
0:03:56.932,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we don't simply hand trainees Mark-19 automatic grenade launchers

76
0:04:00.196,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and say, "Here's the trigger, here's some ammo and good luck."

77
0:04:03.412,000 --> 0:04:07,000
No. We train them, on the range and in specific contexts,

78
0:04:08.132,000 --> 0:04:09,000
over and over and over

79
0:04:09.842,000 --> 0:04:11,000
until lifting their weapon and engaging their target

80
0:04:12.655,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is so engrained into muscle memory

81
0:04:14.515,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that it can be performed without even thinking,

82
0:04:16.867,000 --> 0:04:18,000
even under the most stressful conditions you can imagine.

83
0:04:20.63,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now, the same holds for training-based treatments.

84
0:04:23.875,000 --> 0:04:26,000
The first of these treatments is cognitive therapy,

85
0:04:27.23,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and this is a kind of mental recalibration.

86
0:04:31.166,000 --> 0:04:32,000
When veterans come home from war,

87
0:04:32.819,000 --> 0:04:34,000
their way of mentally framing the world is calibrated

88
0:04:35.439,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to an immensely more dangerous environment.

89
0:04:38.86,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So when you try to overlay that mind frame onto a peacetime environment,

90
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you get problems.

91
0:04:45.269,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You begin drowning in worries about dangers that aren't present.

92
0:04:49.748,000 --> 0:04:52,000
You begin not trusting family or friends.

93
0:04:53.935,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Which is not to say there are no dangers in civilian life; there are.

94
0:04:58.402,000 --> 0:05:,000
It's just that the probability of encountering them

95
0:05:01.118,000 --> 0:05:02,000
compared to combat

96
0:05:02.412,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is astronomically lower.

97
0:05:05.675,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So we never advise veterans to turn off caution completely.

98
0:05:08.839,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We do train them, however, to adjust caution

99
0:05:11.247,000 --> 0:05:12,000
according to where they are.

100
0:05:13.685,000 --> 0:05:15,000
If you find yourself in a bad neighborhood,

101
0:05:16.194,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you turn it up.

102
0:05:17.878,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Out to dinner with family?

103
0:05:19.551,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You turn it way down.

104
0:05:21.975,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We train veterans to be fiercely rational,

105
0:05:25.271,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to systematically gauge the actual statistical probability

106
0:05:28.849,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of encountering, say, an IED here in peacetime America.

107
0:05:33.46,000 --> 0:05:37,000
With enough practice, those recalibrations stick.

108
0:05:39.193,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The next of these treatments is exposure therapy,

109
0:05:41.531,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and this is a kind of field training,

110
0:05:44.453,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the fastest of the proven effective treatments out there.

111
0:05:47.974,000 --> 0:05:48,000
You remember Carlos?

112
0:05:49.555,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This was the treatment that he chose.

113
0:05:51.869,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And so we started off by giving him exercises,

114
0:05:54.333,000 --> 0:05:55,000
for him, challenging ones:

115
0:05:55.663,000 --> 0:05:56,000
going to a grocery store,

116
0:05:57.633,000 --> 0:05:59,000
going to a shopping mall, going to a restaurant,

117
0:06:00.282,000 --> 0:06:02,000
sitting with his back to the door.

118
0:06:03.214,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And, critically --

119
0:06:05.032,000 --> 0:06:06,000
staying in these environments.

120
0:06:07.791,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, at first he was very anxious.

121
0:06:09.525,000 --> 0:06:11,000
He wanted to sit where he could scan the room,

122
0:06:12.041,000 --> 0:06:13,000
where he could plan escape routes,

123
0:06:13.99,000 --> 0:06:16,000
where he could get his hands on a makeshift weapon.

124
0:06:17.041,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And he wanted to leave, but he didn't.

125
0:06:20.39,000 --> 0:06:22,000
He remembered his training in the Marine Corps,

126
0:06:23.285,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and he pushed through his discomfort.

127
0:06:25.53,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And every time he did this, his anxiety ratcheted down a little bit,

128
0:06:28.746,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and then a little bit more and then a little bit more,

129
0:06:31.529,000 --> 0:06:32,000
until in the end,

130
0:06:32.867,000 --> 0:06:36,000
he had effectively relearned how to sit in a public space

131
0:06:38.785,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and just enjoy himself.

132
0:06:41.704,000 --> 0:06:44,000
He also listened to recordings of his combat experiences,

133
0:06:45.046,000 --> 0:06:47,000
over and over and over.

134
0:06:47.706,000 --> 0:06:51,000
He listened until those memories no longer generated any anxiety.

135
0:06:52.419,000 --> 0:06:54,000
He processed his memories so much

136
0:06:55.005,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that his brain no longer needed to return to those experiences

137
0:06:58.258,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in his sleep.

138
0:07:00.4,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And when I spoke with him a year after treatment had finished,

139
0:07:03.977,000 --> 0:07:04,000
he told me,

140
0:07:05.372,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"Doc, this is the first time in 43 years

141
0:07:10.472,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that I haven't had nightmares."

142
0:07:13.412,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, this is different than erasing a memory.

143
0:07:18.087,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Veterans will always remember their traumatic experiences,

144
0:07:21.106,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but with enough practice,

145
0:07:22.787,000 --> 0:07:27,000
those memories are no longer as raw or as painful as they once were.

146
0:07:28.379,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They don't feel emotionally like they just happened yesterday,

147
0:07:31.964,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and that is an immensely better place to be.

148
0:07:37.985,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But it's often difficult.

149
0:07:39.677,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And, like any training, it may not work for everybody.

150
0:07:44.117,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And there are trust issues.

151
0:07:45.931,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Sometimes I'm asked,

152
0:07:47.237,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"If you haven't been there, Doc, how can you help me?"

153
0:07:49.915,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Which is understandable.

154
0:07:52.244,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But at the point of returning to civilian life,

155
0:07:56.639,000 --> 0:07:58,000
you do not require somebody who's been there.

156
0:07:59.985,000 --> 0:08:02,000
You don't require training for operations on the battlefield;

157
0:08:03.125,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you require training on how to come home.

158
0:08:10.626,000 --> 0:08:12,000
For the past 10 years of my work,

159
0:08:13.336,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I have been exposed to detailed accounts

160
0:08:16.108,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of the worst experiences that you can imagine,

161
0:08:18.732,000 --> 0:08:19,000
daily.

162
0:08:19.985,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And it hasn't always been easy.

163
0:08:22.107,000 --> 0:08:25,000
There have been times where I have just felt my heart break

164
0:08:25.496,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or that I've absorbed too much.

165
0:08:28.15,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But these training-based treatments work so well,

166
0:08:31.497,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that whatever this work takes out of me, it puts back even more,

167
0:08:34.603,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because I see people get better.

168
0:08:38.754,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I see people's lives transform.

169
0:08:42.656,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Carlos can now enjoy outings with his grandchildren,

170
0:08:46.018,000 --> 0:08:49,000
which is something he couldn't even do with his own children.

171
0:08:49.638,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And what's amazing to me is that after 43 years of suffering,

172
0:08:53.648,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it only took him 10 weeks of intense training to get his life back.

173
0:08:58.001,000 --> 0:09:,000
And when I spoke with him, he told me,

174
0:09:00.333,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"I know that I can't get those years back.

175
0:09:05.088,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But at least now, whatever days that I have left on this Earth,

176
0:09:10.021,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I can live them in peace."

177
0:09:13.114,000 --> 0:09:16,000
He also said, "I hope that these younger veterans don't wait

178
0:09:16.61,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to get the help they need."

179
0:09:18.588,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And that's my hope, too.

180
0:09:21.02,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Because ...

181
0:09:23.003,000 --> 0:09:24,000
this life is short,

182
0:09:25.383,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and if you are fortunate enough to have survived war

183
0:09:28.579,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or any kind of traumatic experience,

184
0:09:30.683,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you owe it to yourself to live your life well.

185
0:09:34.629,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And you shouldn't wait to get the training you need

186
0:09:37.294,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to make that happen.

187
0:09:40.663,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now, the best way of ending human suffering caused by war

188
0:09:46.883,000 --> 0:09:47,000
is to never go to war.

189
0:09:49.422,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But we are just not there yet as a species.

190
0:09:52.157,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Until we are,

191
0:09:53.441,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the mental suffering that we create in our sons and in our daughters

192
0:09:58.698,000 --> 0:09:59,000
when we send them off to fight

193
0:10:00.682,000 --> 0:10:02,000
can be alleviated.

194
0:10:03.675,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But we must ensure that the science, the energy level, the value

195
0:10:09.785,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that we place on sending them off to war

196
0:10:13.516,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is at the very least mirrored

197
0:10:15.45,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in how well we prepare them to come back home to us.

198
0:10:19.868,000 --> 0:10:2,000
This much, we owe them.

199
0:10:22.186,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Thank you.

200
0:10:23.393,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Applause)

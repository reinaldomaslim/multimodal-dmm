0:00:15.733,000 --> 0:00:19,000
There's a group of people in Kenya.

3
0:00:20.341,000 --> 0:00:24,000
People cross oceans to go see them.

4
0:00:24.345,000 --> 0:00:26,000
These people are tall.

5
0:00:26.379,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They jump high. They wear red.

6
0:00:30.886,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And they kill lions.

7
0:00:32.998,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You might be wondering, who are these people?

8
0:00:36.055,000 --> 0:00:38,000
These are the Maasais.

9
0:00:38.649,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And you know what's cool? I'm actually one of them.

10
0:00:44.551,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The Maasais, the boys are brought up to be warriors.

11
0:00:48.911,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The girls are brought up to be mothers.

12
0:00:52.158,000 --> 0:00:54,000
When I was five years old,

13
0:00:54.686,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I found out that I was engaged

14
0:00:57.254,000 --> 0:01:,000
to be married as soon as I reached puberty.

15
0:01:00.34,000 --> 0:01:02,000
My mother, my grandmother, my aunties,

16
0:01:03.326,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they constantly reminded me that

17
0:01:05.504,000 --> 0:01:07,000
your husband just passed by.

18
0:01:08.224,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter) Cool, yeah?

19
0:01:13.17,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And everything I had to do from that moment

20
0:01:16.335,000 --> 0:01:2,000
was to prepare me to be a perfect woman at age 12.

21
0:01:20.966,000 --> 0:01:23,000
My day started at 5 in the morning,

22
0:01:24.543,000 --> 0:01:26,000
milking the cows, sweeping the house,

23
0:01:26.7,000 --> 0:01:3,000
cooking for my siblings, collecting water, firewood.

24
0:01:31.239,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I did everything that I needed to do

25
0:01:34.481,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to become a perfect wife.

26
0:01:38.108,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I went to school not because the Maasais'

27
0:01:41.172,000 --> 0:01:43,000
women or girls were going to school.

28
0:01:43.813,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's because my mother was denied an education,

29
0:01:46.97,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and she constantly reminded me and my siblings that

30
0:01:50.439,000 --> 0:01:53,000
she never wanted us to live the life she was living.

31
0:01:54.387,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Why did she say that?

32
0:01:56.916,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My father worked as a policeman in the city.

33
0:02:00.244,000 --> 0:02:01,000
He came home once a year.

34
0:02:01.874,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We didn't see him for sometimes even two years.

35
0:02:05.231,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And whenever he came home, it was a different case.

36
0:02:09.119,000 --> 0:02:11,000
My mother worked hard in the farm

37
0:02:11.124,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to grow crops so that we can eat.

38
0:02:12.99,000 --> 0:02:14,000
She reared the cows and the goats

39
0:02:15.093,000 --> 0:02:17,000
so that she can care for us.

40
0:02:17.108,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But when my father came, he would sell the cows,

41
0:02:19.938,000 --> 0:02:21,000
he would sell the products we had,

42
0:02:22.321,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and he went and drank with his friends in the bars.

43
0:02:26.516,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Because my mother was a woman,

44
0:02:27.909,000 --> 0:02:3,000
she was not allowed to own any property,

45
0:02:30.91,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and by default, everything in my family anyway

46
0:02:33.404,000 --> 0:02:35,000
belongs to my father, so he had the right.

47
0:02:36.076,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And if my mother ever questioned him,

48
0:02:38.365,000 --> 0:02:44,000
he beat her, abused her, and really it was difficult.

49
0:02:45.153,000 --> 0:02:48,000
When I went to school, I had a dream.

50
0:02:48.159,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I wanted to become a teacher.

51
0:02:50.564,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Teachers looked nice.

52
0:02:52.37,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They wear nice dresses, high-heeled shoes.

53
0:02:54.623,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I found out later that they are uncomfortable, but I admired it.

54
0:02:57.726,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:00.981,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But most of all, the teacher was just writing on the board --

56
0:03:04.482,000 --> 0:03:07,000
not hard work, that's what I thought,

57
0:03:07.556,000 --> 0:03:09,000
compared to what I was doing in the farm.

58
0:03:10.436,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So I wanted to become a teacher.

59
0:03:12.383,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I worked hard in school, but when I was in eighth grade,

60
0:03:16.286,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it was a determining factor.

61
0:03:18.69,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In our tradition, there is a ceremony

62
0:03:21.263,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that girls have to undergo to become women,

63
0:03:24.096,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it's a rite of passage to womanhood.

64
0:03:26.677,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And then I was just finishing my eighth grade,

65
0:03:30.245,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and that was a transition for me to go to high school.

66
0:03:32.796,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This was the crossroad.

67
0:03:34.377,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Once I go through this tradition, I was going to become a wife.

68
0:03:39.899,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Well, my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass.

69
0:03:44.141,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So I talked -- I had to come up with a plan

70
0:03:46.656,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to figure these things out.

71
0:03:49.22,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I talked to my father. I did something that most girls have never done.

72
0:03:53.356,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I told my father, "I will only go through this ceremony

73
0:03:56.556,000 --> 0:03:58,000
if you let me go back to school."

74
0:03:59.136,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The reason why, if I ran away,

75
0:04:01.724,000 --> 0:04:04,000
my father will have a stigma, people will be calling him

76
0:04:05.17,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the father of that girl who didn't go through the ceremony.

77
0:04:08.211,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It was a shameful thing for him to carry the rest of his life.

78
0:04:12.23,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So he figured out. "Well," he said, "okay,

79
0:04:15.082,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you'll go to school after the ceremony."

80
0:04:18.415,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I did. The ceremony happened.

81
0:04:21.035,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's a whole week long of excitement.

82
0:04:24.616,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's a ceremony. People are enjoying it.

83
0:04:26.781,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And the day before the actual ceremony happens,

84
0:04:29.749,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we were dancing, having excitement,

85
0:04:32.237,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and through all the night we did not sleep.

86
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The actual day came, and we walked out of the house

87
0:04:39.49,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that we were dancing in. Yes, we danced and danced.

88
0:04:41.644,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We walked out to the courtyard, and there were a bunch of people waiting.

89
0:04:45.513,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They were all in a circle.

90
0:04:48.124,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And as we danced and danced,

91
0:04:49.783,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and we approached this circle of women,

92
0:04:52.628,000 --> 0:04:55,000
men, women, children, everybody was there.

93
0:04:55.779,000 --> 0:04:57,000
There was a woman sitting in the middle of it,

94
0:04:58.347,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and this woman was waiting to hold us.

95
0:05:02.885,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I was the first. There were my sisters and a couple of other girls,

96
0:05:06.56,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and as I approached her,

97
0:05:09.554,000 --> 0:05:11,000
she looked at me, and I sat down.

98
0:05:12.273,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I sat down, and I opened my legs.

99
0:05:15.851,000 --> 0:05:18,000
As I opened my leg, another woman came,

100
0:05:19.319,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and this woman was carrying a knife.

101
0:05:22.675,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And as she carried the knife, she walked toward me

102
0:05:26.259,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and she held the clitoris, and she cut it off.

103
0:05:30.648,000 --> 0:05:35,000
As you can imagine, I bled. I bled.

104
0:05:35.911,000 --> 0:05:4,000
After bleeding for a while, I fainted thereafter.

105
0:05:41.009,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It's something that so many girls --

106
0:05:43.132,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I'm lucky, I never died -- but many die.

107
0:05:47.03,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's practiced, it's no anesthesia, it's a rusty old knife,

108
0:05:53.441,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and it was difficult.

109
0:05:56.242,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I was lucky because one, also, my mom did something

110
0:05:58.979,000 --> 0:06:,000
that most women don't do.

111
0:06:01.976,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Three days later, after everybody has left the home,

112
0:06:04.803,000 --> 0:06:05,000
my mom went and brought a nurse.

113
0:06:06.525,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We were taken care of.

114
0:06:08.379,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Three weeks later, I was healed, and I was back in high school.

115
0:06:12.972,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I was so determined to be a teacher now

116
0:06:16.443,000 --> 0:06:2,000
so that I could make a difference in my family.

117
0:06:20.443,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Well, while I was in high school, something happened.

118
0:06:24.21,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I met a young gentleman from our village

119
0:06:26.824,000 --> 0:06:28,000
who had been to the University of Oregon.

120
0:06:29.057,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans, camera,

121
0:06:34.933,000 --> 0:06:37,000
white sneakers -- and I'm talking about white sneakers.

122
0:06:38.229,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There is something about clothes, I think, and shoes.

123
0:06:42.156,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They were sneakers, and this is in a village

124
0:06:45.619,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that doesn't even have paved roads. It was quite attractive.

125
0:06:49.689,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I told him, "Well, I want to go to where you are,"

126
0:06:54.676,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because this man looked very happy, and I admired that.

127
0:06:58.924,000 --> 0:07:,000
And he told me, "Well,

128
0:07:01.189,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what do you mean, you want to go?

129
0:07:02.323,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Don't you have a husband waiting for you?"

130
0:07:04.643,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I told him, "Don't worry about that part.

131
0:07:07.448,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Just tell me how to get there."

132
0:07:10.606,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This gentleman, he helped me.

133
0:07:13.208,000 --> 0:07:15,000
While I was in high school also, my dad was sick.

134
0:07:16.055,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He got a stroke, and he was really, really sick,

135
0:07:19.323,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so he really couldn't tell me what to do next.

136
0:07:22.643,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But the problem is, my father is not the only father I have.

137
0:07:26.334,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Everybody who is my dad's age, male in the community,

138
0:07:29.779,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is my father by default --

139
0:07:31.423,000 --> 0:07:35,000
my uncles, all of them -- and they dictate what my future is.

140
0:07:35.606,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So the news came, I applied to school

141
0:07:38.739,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and I was accepted to Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia,

142
0:07:42.971,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and I couldn't come without the support of the village,

143
0:07:47.411,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because I needed to raise money to buy the air ticket.

144
0:07:49.403,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I got a scholarship but I needed to get myself here.

145
0:07:52.683,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But I needed the support of the village,

146
0:07:55.371,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and here again, when the men heard,

147
0:07:58.953,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and the people heard that a woman had gotten an opportunity to go to school,

148
0:08:03.03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
they said, "What a lost opportunity.

149
0:08:05.455,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This should have been given to a boy. We can't do this."

150
0:08:09.1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So I went back and I had to go back to the tradition.

151
0:08:13.427,000 --> 0:08:15,000
There's a belief among our people

152
0:08:15.745,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that morning brings good news.

153
0:08:19.115,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I had to come up with something to do with the morning,

154
0:08:21.977,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because there's good news in the morning.

155
0:08:24.379,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And in the village also, there is one chief, an elder,

156
0:08:28.583,000 --> 0:08:31,000
who if he says yes, everybody will follow him.

157
0:08:32.235,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So I went to him very early in the morning, as the sun rose.

158
0:08:35.89,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The first thing he sees when he opens his door is, it's me.

159
0:08:39.651,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"My child, what are you doing here?"

160
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"Well, Dad, I need help. Can you support me to go to America?"

161
0:08:46.475,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I promised him that I would be the best girl,

162
0:08:48.707,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I will come back, anything they wanted after that,

163
0:08:51.941,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I will do it for them.

164
0:08:54.1,000 --> 0:08:56,000
He said, "Well, but I can't do it alone."

165
0:08:56.194,000 --> 0:08:59,000
He gave me a list of another 15 men that I went --

166
0:08:59.741,000 --> 0:09:01,000
16 more men -- every single morning

167
0:09:02.278,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I went and visited them.

168
0:09:03.862,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They all came together.

169
0:09:05.603,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The village, the women, the men, everybody came together

170
0:09:08.593,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to support me to come to get an education.

171
0:09:11.912,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I arrived in America. As you can imagine, what did I find?

172
0:09:16.675,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I found snow!

173
0:09:19.884,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I found Wal-Marts, vacuum cleaners,

174
0:09:23.042,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and lots of food in the cafeteria.

175
0:09:26.118,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I was in a land of plenty.

176
0:09:28.771,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I enjoyed myself, but during that moment while I was here,

177
0:09:34.536,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I discovered a lot of things.

178
0:09:37.168,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I learned that that ceremony that I went through

179
0:09:40.209,000 --> 0:09:45,000
when I was 13 years old, it was called female genital mutilation.

180
0:09:45.404,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I learned that it was against the law in Kenya.

181
0:09:49.078,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I learned that I did not have to trade part of my body

182
0:09:53.03,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to get an education. I had a right.

183
0:09:57.108,000 --> 0:10:,000
And as we speak right now, three million girls

184
0:10:00.547,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in Africa are at risk of going through this mutilation.

185
0:10:05.888,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I learned that my mom had a right to own property.

186
0:10:09.063,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I learned that she did not have to be abused

187
0:10:11.952,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because she is a woman.

188
0:10:14.395,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Those things made me angry.

189
0:10:17.482,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I wanted to do something.

190
0:10:19.383,000 --> 0:10:21,000
As I went back, every time I went,

191
0:10:21.952,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I found that my neighbors' girls were getting married.

192
0:10:24.92,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They were getting mutilated, and here,

193
0:10:26.994,000 --> 0:10:29,000
after I graduated from here, I worked at the U.N.,

194
0:10:30.53,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I went back to school to get my graduate work,

195
0:10:33.053,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the constant cry of these girls was in my face.

196
0:10:37.163,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I had to do something.

197
0:10:39.989,000 --> 0:10:41,000
As I went back, I started talking to the men,

198
0:10:42.909,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to the village, and mothers, and I said,

199
0:10:44.496,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"I want to give back the way I had promised you

200
0:10:46.516,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that I would come back and help you. What do you need?"

201
0:10:49.228,000 --> 0:10:51,000
As I spoke to the women, they told me,

202
0:10:51.346,000 --> 0:10:52,000
"You know what we need? We really need a school for girls."

203
0:10:53.322,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Because there had not been any school for girls.

204
0:10:56.078,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And the reason they wanted the school for girls

205
0:10:57.891,000 --> 0:11:,000
is because when a girl is raped when she's walking to school,

206
0:11:01.517,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the mother is blamed for that.

207
0:11:03.725,000 --> 0:11:06,000
If she got pregnant before she got married,

208
0:11:07.137,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the mother is blamed for that, and she's punished.

209
0:11:09.506,000 --> 0:11:1,000
She's beaten.

210
0:11:11.147,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They said, "We wanted to put our girls in a safe place."

211
0:11:14.882,000 --> 0:11:16,000
As we moved, and I went to talk to the fathers,

212
0:11:17.525,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the fathers, of course, you can imagine what they said:

213
0:11:19.898,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"We want a school for boys."

214
0:11:22.301,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And I said, "Well, there are a couple of men from my village

215
0:11:25.605,000 --> 0:11:27,000
who have been out and they have gotten an education.

216
0:11:28.277,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Why can't they build a school for boys,

217
0:11:30.349,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and I'll build a school for girls?"

218
0:11:32.646,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That made sense. And they agreed.

219
0:11:35.921,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And I told them, I wanted them to show me a sign of commitment.

220
0:11:40.58,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And they did. They donated land where we built the girls' school.

221
0:11:45.372,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We have.

222
0:11:46.831,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I want you to meet one of the girls in that school.

223
0:11:49.963,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Angeline came to apply for the school,

224
0:11:52.603,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and she did not meet any criteria that we had.

225
0:11:56.203,000 --> 0:11:58,000
She's an orphan. Yes, we could have taken her for that.

226
0:11:58.946,000 --> 0:12:,000
But she was older. She was 12 years old,

227
0:12:01.69,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and we were taking girls who were in fourth grade.

228
0:12:04.802,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Angeline had been moving from one place --

229
0:12:06.597,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because she's an orphan, she has no mother, she has no father --

230
0:12:08.938,000 --> 0:12:1,000
moving from one grandmother's house to another one,

231
0:12:11.292,000 --> 0:12:14,000
from aunties to aunties. She had no stability in her life.

232
0:12:14.926,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And I looked at her, I remember that day,

233
0:12:17.514,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline.

234
0:12:22.046,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And yes, she was older to be in fourth grade.

235
0:12:24.942,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We gave her the opportunity to come to the class.

236
0:12:27.912,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Five months later, that is Angeline.

237
0:12:31.139,000 --> 0:12:33,000
A transformation had begun in her life.

238
0:12:33.905,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Angeline wants to be a pilot so she can fly around the world

239
0:12:36.647,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and make a difference.

240
0:12:38.38,000 --> 0:12:39,000
She was not the top student when we took her.

241
0:12:40.18,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Now she's the best student, not just in our school,

242
0:12:42.676,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but in the entire division that we are in.

243
0:12:45.825,000 --> 0:12:49,000
That's Sharon. That's five years later.

244
0:12:50.146,000 --> 0:12:57,000
That's Evelyn. Five months later, that is the difference that we are making.

245
0:12:57.315,000 --> 0:13:,000
As a new dawn is happening in my school,

246
0:13:00.59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
a new beginning is happening.

247
0:13:02.849,000 --> 0:13:07,000
As we speak right now, 125 girls will never be mutilated.

248
0:13:08.193,000 --> 0:13:12,000
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they're 12 years old.

249
0:13:12.889,000 --> 0:13:17,000
One hundred twenty-five girls are creating and achieving their dreams.

250
0:13:18.857,000 --> 0:13:2,000
This is the thing that we are doing,

251
0:13:21.13,000 --> 0:13:24,000
giving them opportunities where they can rise.

252
0:13:24.457,000 --> 0:13:27,000
As we speak right now, women are not being beaten

253
0:13:28.112,000 --> 0:13:31,000
because of the revolutions we've started in our community.

254
0:13:31.658,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Applause)

255
0:13:39.338,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I want to challenge you today.

256
0:13:42.173,000 --> 0:13:44,000
You are listening to me because you are here,

257
0:13:45.077,000 --> 0:13:47,000
very optimistic.

258
0:13:47.521,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You are somebody who is so passionate.

259
0:13:51.035,000 --> 0:13:54,000
You are somebody who wants to see a better world.

260
0:13:54.882,000 --> 0:13:58,000
You are somebody who wants to see that war ends, no poverty.

261
0:13:59.388,000 --> 0:14:01,000
You are somebody who wants to make a difference.

262
0:14:02.137,000 --> 0:14:05,000
You are somebody who wants to make our tomorrow better.

263
0:14:05.703,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I want to challenge you today that to be the first,

264
0:14:09.481,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because people will follow you.

265
0:14:11.978,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Be the first. People will follow you.

266
0:14:14.202,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Be bold. Stand up. Be fearless. Be confident.

267
0:14:19.485,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Move out, because as you change your world,

268
0:14:22.765,000 --> 0:14:24,000
as you change your community,

269
0:14:25.204,000 --> 0:14:29,000
as we believe that we are impacting one girl, one family,

270
0:14:30.004,000 --> 0:14:33,000
one village, one country at a time.

271
0:14:33.324,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We are making a difference, so if you change your world,

272
0:14:36.189,000 --> 0:14:38,000
you are going to change your community,

273
0:14:38.238,000 --> 0:14:39,000
you are going to change your country,

274
0:14:40.03,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and think about that. If you do that, and I do that,

275
0:14:42.997,000 --> 0:14:45,000
aren't we going to create a better future for our children,

276
0:14:46.597,000 --> 0:14:48,000
for your children, for our grandchildren?

277
0:14:48.832,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And we will live in a very peaceful world. Thank you very much.

278
0:14:53.037,000 --> 0:15:1,000
(Applause)

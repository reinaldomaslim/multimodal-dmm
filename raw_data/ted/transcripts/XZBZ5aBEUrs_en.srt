2
0:00:13.028,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name is Rebecca, and I'm a cyborg.

3
0:00:15.944,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:18.992,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Specifically, I have 32 computer chips inside my head,

5
0:00:23.23,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which rebuild my sense of hearing.

6
0:00:25.519,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This is called a cochlear implant.

7
0:00:28.805,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You remember the Borg from Star Trek,

8
0:00:31.909,000 --> 0:00:35,000
those aliens who conquered and absorbed everything in sight?

9
0:00:36.958,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, that's me.

10
0:00:38.163,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:39.829,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The good news is I come for your technology

12
0:00:42.567,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and not for your human life-forms.

13
0:00:44.727,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:47.189,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Actually, I've never seen an episode of Star Trek.

15
0:00:49.568,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:51.633,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But there's a reason for that:

17
0:00:53.619,000 --> 0:00:55,000
television wasn't closed-captioned when I was a kid.

18
0:00:57.109,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I grew up profoundly deaf.

19
0:00:59.102,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I went to regular schools, and I had to lip-read.

20
0:01:02.237,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I didn't meet another deaf person until I was 20.

21
0:01:06.135,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Electronics were mostly audio back then.

22
0:01:09.205,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My alarm clock was my sister Barbara,

23
0:01:11.725,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who would set her alarm and then throw something at me to wake up.

24
0:01:15.781,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:18.317,000 --> 0:01:23,000
My hearing aids were industrial-strength, sledgehammer volume,

26
0:01:23.515,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but they helped me more than they helped most people.

27
0:01:26.269,000 --> 0:01:29,000
With them, I could hear music and the sound of my own voice.

28
0:01:30.679,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I've always liked the idea that technology can help make the world more human.

29
0:01:36.195,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I used to watch the stereo flash color when the music shifted,

30
0:01:40.522,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I knew it was just a matter of time before my watch could show me sound, too.

31
0:01:48.263,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Did you know that hearing occurs in the brain?

32
0:01:50.967,000 --> 0:01:53,000
In your ear is a small organ called the cochlea,

33
0:01:54.682,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and the cochlea is lined with thousands of receptors called hair cells.

34
0:01:59.813,000 --> 0:02:01,000
When sound enters your ear,

35
0:02:02.266,000 --> 0:02:06,000
those hair cells, they send electric signals to your brain,

36
0:02:06.782,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and your brain then interprets that as sound.

37
0:02:10.763,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Hair-cell damage is really common:

38
0:02:14.231,000 --> 0:02:18,000
noise exposure, ordinary aging, illness.

39
0:02:18.457,000 --> 0:02:21,000
My hair cells were damaged before I was even born.

40
0:02:21.927,000 --> 0:02:25,000
My mother was exposed to German measles when she was pregnant with me.

41
0:02:27.125,000 --> 0:02:3,000
About five percent of the world has significant hearing loss.

42
0:02:31.107,000 --> 0:02:36,000
By 2050, that's expected to double to over 900 million people,

43
0:02:36.694,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or one in 10.

44
0:02:38.731,000 --> 0:02:4,000
For seniors, it's already one out of three.

45
0:02:42.966,000 --> 0:02:43,000
With a cochlear implant,

46
0:02:44.807,000 --> 0:02:46,000
computer chips do the job for the damaged hair cells.

47
0:02:48.324,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Imagine a box of 16 crayons,

48
0:02:51.685,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and those 16 crayons, in combination,

49
0:02:55.192,000 --> 0:02:58,000
have to make all of the colors in the universe.

50
0:02:58.731,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Same with the cochlear implant.

51
0:03:00.638,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I have 16 electrodes in each of my cochleas.

52
0:03:04.559,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Those 16 electrodes, in combination, send signals to my brain,

53
0:03:10.303,000 --> 0:03:14,000
representing all of the sounds in the universe.

54
0:03:14.693,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I have electronics inside and outside of my head

55
0:03:18.665,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to make that happen,

56
0:03:20.18,000 --> 0:03:25,000
including a small processor, magnets inside my skull

57
0:03:25.275,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and a rechargeable power source.

58
0:03:27.907,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Radio waves transmit sound through the magnets.

59
0:03:32.573,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The number one question that I get about the cochlear implant

60
0:03:36.224,000 --> 0:03:38,000
when people hear about the magnets

61
0:03:38.488,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is whether my head sticks to the refrigerator.

62
0:03:40.925,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:47.24,000 --> 0:03:48,000
No, it does not.

64
0:03:48.693,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:50.494,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Applause)

66
0:03:52.217,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Thank you, thank you.

67
0:03:54.406,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:56.216,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I know this, because I tried.

69
0:03:57.852,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

70
0:04:00.105,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Hearing people assume that the Deaf

71
0:04:02.479,000 --> 0:04:06,000
live in a perpetual state of wanting to hear,

72
0:04:06.621,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because they can't imagine any other way.

73
0:04:09.002,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But I've never once wished to be hearing.

74
0:04:11.477,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I just wanted to be part of a community like me.

75
0:04:14.995,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I wanted everyone else to be deaf.

76
0:04:17.501,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I think that sense of belonging is what ultimately connects our stories,

77
0:04:22.888,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and mine felt incomplete.

78
0:04:25.725,000 --> 0:04:27,000
When cochlear implants first got going,

79
0:04:28.272,000 --> 0:04:29,000
back in the '80s,

80
0:04:29.908,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the operation was Frankenstein-monster scary.

81
0:04:35.185,000 --> 0:04:39,000
By 2001, the procedure had evolved considerably,

82
0:04:39.778,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but it still wiped out any natural hearing that you had.

83
0:04:43.767,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The success rate then for speech comprehension was low,

84
0:04:47.881,000 --> 0:04:48,000
maybe 50 percent.

85
0:04:50.256,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So if it didn't work, you couldn't go back.

86
0:04:53.935,000 --> 0:04:57,000
At that time, implants were also controversial in the Deaf culture.

87
0:04:59.295,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Basically, it was considered the equivalent

88
0:05:02.072,000 --> 0:05:04,000
of changing the color of your skin.

89
0:05:04.954,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I held off for a while,

90
0:05:06.838,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but my hearing was going downhill fast,

91
0:05:10.098,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and hearing aids were no longer helping.

92
0:05:12.781,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So in 2003, I made the tough decision to have the cochlear implant.

93
0:05:18.439,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I just needed to stop that soul-sucking cycle of loss,

94
0:05:24.348,000 --> 0:05:26,000
regardless of whether the operation worked,

95
0:05:27.01,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and I really didn't think that it would.

96
0:05:29.476,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I saw it as one last box to check off

97
0:05:33.18,000 --> 0:05:37,000
before I made the transition to being completely deaf,

98
0:05:37.459,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which a part of me wanted.

99
0:05:41.291,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Complete silence is very addictive.

100
0:05:45.824,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Maybe you've spent time in a sensory deprivation tank,

101
0:05:49.985,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and you know what I mean.

102
0:05:51.701,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Silence has mind-expanding capabilities.

103
0:05:55.669,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In silence, I see sound.

104
0:05:58.586,000 --> 0:06:,000
When I watch a music video without sound,

105
0:06:01.32,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I can hear music.

106
0:06:02.892,000 --> 0:06:04,000
In the absence of sound,

107
0:06:04.98,000 --> 0:06:08,000
my brain fills in the gaps based on the movement I see.

108
0:06:09.75,000 --> 0:06:13,000
My mind is no longer competing with the distraction of sound.

109
0:06:14.243,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's freed up to think more creatively.

110
0:06:19.309,000 --> 0:06:23,000
There are advantages to having bionic body parts as well.

111
0:06:23.483,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's undeniably convenient to be able to hear,

112
0:06:26.436,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I can turn it off any time I want.

113
0:06:28.634,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

114
0:06:30.826,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I'm hearing when I need to be, and the rest of the time, I'm not.

115
0:06:34.588,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Bionic hearing doesn't age,

116
0:06:36.564,000 --> 0:06:39,000
although external parts sometimes need replacement.

117
0:06:40.669,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It would be so cool

118
0:06:42.584,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to just automatically regenerate a damaged part like a real cyborg,

119
0:06:47.799,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but I get mine FedExed from Advanced Bionics.

120
0:06:50.553,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:52.84,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Oh, I get updates

122
0:06:55.935,000 --> 0:06:57,000
downloaded into my head.

123
0:06:58.833,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:59.991,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's not quite AirDrop -- but close.

125
0:07:02.302,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

126
0:07:04.558,000 --> 0:07:05,000
With the cochlear implant,

127
0:07:05.861,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I can stream music from my iPod into my head without earbuds.

128
0:07:11.336,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Recently, I went to a friend's long, tedious concert ...

129
0:07:16.463,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

130
0:07:18.351,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and unknown to anyone else,

131
0:07:20.866,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I listened to the Beatles for three hours instead.

132
0:07:23.756,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:24.781,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Applause)

134
0:07:31.209,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Technology has come so far so fast.

135
0:07:35.137,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The biggest obstacle I face as a deaf person

136
0:07:38.53,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is no longer a physical barrier.

137
0:07:40.95,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It's the way that people respond to my deafness,

138
0:07:44.848,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the outdated way people respond to my deafness --

139
0:07:48.752,000 --> 0:07:51,000
pity, patronization, even anger --

140
0:07:52.456,000 --> 0:07:55,000
because that just cancels out the human connection

141
0:07:56.329,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that technology achieves.

142
0:07:58.695,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I once had a travel roommate who had a complete temper tantrum,

143
0:08:03.663,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because I didn't hear her knocking on the door

144
0:08:05.856,000 --> 0:08:06,000
when her key didn't work.

145
0:08:07.853,000 --> 0:08:1,000
If I hadn't been there, no problem, she could get another key,

146
0:08:11.511,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but when she saw that I was there, her anger boiled over.

147
0:08:16.106,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It was no longer about a key.

148
0:08:18.507,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It was about deafness not being a good enough reason

149
0:08:22.464,000 --> 0:08:23,000
for her inconvenience.

150
0:08:24.845,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Or the commercial about the deaf man

151
0:08:27.105,000 --> 0:08:3,000
whose neighborhood surprised him with sign language messages

152
0:08:30.885,000 --> 0:08:32,000
from people on the street.

153
0:08:33.085,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Everyone who sent me the video told me they cried,

154
0:08:36.554,000 --> 0:08:37,000
so I asked them,

155
0:08:37.896,000 --> 0:08:38,000
"Well, what if he wasn't deaf?

156
0:08:39.546,000 --> 0:08:41,000
What if his first language was Spanish,

157
0:08:41.965,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and everyone learned Spanish instead?

158
0:08:44.417,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Would you have cried?"

159
0:08:46.012,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And they all said no.

160
0:08:48.065,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They weren't crying because of the communication barrier,

161
0:08:51.262,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they were crying because the man was deaf.

162
0:08:54.421,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But I see it differently.

163
0:08:56.493,000 --> 0:09:,000
What if the Borg showed up in that video,

164
0:09:01.014,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and the Borg said, "Deafness is irrelevant."

165
0:09:05.252,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Because that's what they say, right?

166
0:09:07.002,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Everything's "irrelevant."

167
0:09:08.5,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And then the Borg assimilated the deaf guy --

168
0:09:12.087,000 --> 0:09:14,000
not out of pity, not out of anger,

169
0:09:14.873,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but because he had a biological distinctiveness

170
0:09:18.198,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that the Borg wanted,

171
0:09:19.788,000 --> 0:09:22,000
including unique language capabilities.

172
0:09:23.599,000 --> 0:09:25,000
I would much rather see that commercial.

173
0:09:25.663,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:27.866,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Why does thinking about ability make people so uncomfortable?

175
0:09:32.224,000 --> 0:09:34,000
You might know a play, later a movie,

176
0:09:35.132,000 --> 0:09:36,000
called "Children of a Lesser God,"

177
0:09:37.006,000 --> 0:09:38,000
by Mark Medoff.

178
0:09:38.87,000 --> 0:09:39,000
That play, that title,

179
0:09:40.603,000 --> 0:09:43,000
actually comes from a poem by Alfred Tennyson,

180
0:09:44.089,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and I interpret both the play and title

181
0:09:47.756,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to say that humans who are perceived as defective

182
0:09:52.797,000 --> 0:09:53,000
were made by a lesser God

183
0:09:54.689,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and live an inferior existence,

184
0:09:56.915,000 --> 0:10:01,000
while those made by the real God are a superior class,

185
0:10:02.146,000 --> 0:10:04,000
because God doesn't make mistakes.

186
0:10:05.496,000 --> 0:10:06,000
In World War II,

187
0:10:06.981,000 --> 0:10:1,000
an estimated 275,000 people with disabilities

188
0:10:11.791,000 --> 0:10:13,000
were murdered in special death camps,

189
0:10:14.804,000 --> 0:10:18,000
because they didn't fit Hitler's vision of a superior race.

190
0:10:19.355,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Hitler said that he was inspired by the United States,

191
0:10:24.12,000 --> 0:10:3,000
which had enacted involuntary sterilization laws for "the unfit"

192
0:10:30.577,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in the early 1900s.

193
0:10:33.06,000 --> 0:10:38,000
That practice continued in more than 30 states until the '70s,

194
0:10:38.681,000 --> 0:10:42,000
with the last law finally repealed in 2003.

195
0:10:43.729,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So the world is not that far removed from Tennyson's poem.

196
0:10:48.411,000 --> 0:10:52,000
That tendency to make assumptions about people based on ability

197
0:10:53.078,000 --> 0:10:55,000
comes out in sentences like

198
0:10:55.8,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"You're so special," "I couldn't live like that"

199
0:10:59.736,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or "Thank God that's not me."

200
0:11:04.399,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Changing how people think is like getting them to break a habit.

201
0:11:08.954,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Before the implant, I had stopped using the voice telephone

202
0:11:13.224,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and switched to email,

203
0:11:14.955,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but people kept leaving me voice mail.

204
0:11:17.708,000 --> 0:11:19,000
They were upset that I was unreachable by phone

205
0:11:20.542,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and not returning messages.

206
0:11:22.781,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I continued to tell them my situation.

207
0:11:26.248,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It took them months to adapt.

208
0:11:29.009,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Fast-forward 10 years,

209
0:11:31.233,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and you know who else hated voice mail?

210
0:11:34.612,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Millennials.

211
0:11:35.787,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Laughter)

212
0:11:38.334,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And you know what they did?

213
0:11:40.596,000 --> 0:11:44,000
They normalized texting for communication instead.

214
0:11:44.939,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now, when it comes to ignoring voice mail,

215
0:11:48.448,000 --> 0:11:51,000
it no longer matters whether you're deaf or just self-absorbed.

216
0:11:52.211,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

217
0:11:55.487,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

218
0:12:02.347,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Millennials changed how people think about messaging.

219
0:12:06.131,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They reset the default.

220
0:12:08.778,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Can I just tell you how much I love texting?

221
0:12:11.562,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Oh, and group texts.

222
0:12:14.049,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I have six siblings --

223
0:12:17.146,000 --> 0:12:18,000
they're all hearing,

224
0:12:18.927,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but I don't think any less of them.

225
0:12:21.007,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Laughter)

226
0:12:22.964,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And we all text.

227
0:12:24.576,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Do you know how thrilling it is

228
0:12:26.168,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to have a visual means of communication that everyone else actually uses?

229
0:12:31.886,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So I am on a mission now.

230
0:12:34.278,000 --> 0:12:36,000
As a consumer of technology,

231
0:12:37.187,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I want visual options whenever there's audio.

232
0:12:40.513,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It doesn't matter whether I'm deaf

233
0:12:42.746,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or don't want to wake the baby.

234
0:12:44.547,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Both are equally valid.

235
0:12:46.985,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Smart designers

236
0:12:48.69,000 --> 0:12:51,000
include multiple ways to access technology,

237
0:12:52.437,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but segregating that access under "accessibility" --

238
0:12:58.073,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that's just hiding it from mainstream users.

239
0:13:01.611,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In order to change how people think,

240
0:13:04.571,000 --> 0:13:05,000
we need to be more than accessible,

241
0:13:06.401,000 --> 0:13:08,000
we need to be connected.

242
0:13:08.786,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Apple did this recently.

243
0:13:11.014,000 --> 0:13:15,000
On my iPhone, it automatically displays a visual transcript

244
0:13:15.292,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of my voice mail,

245
0:13:16.626,000 --> 0:13:17,000
right next to the audio button.

246
0:13:18.356,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to.

247
0:13:21.426,000 --> 0:13:22,000
You know what else?

248
0:13:22.806,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime no longer say

249
0:13:27.467,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"Closed-captioned for the hearing impaired."

250
0:13:29.863,000 --> 0:13:32,000
They say "subtitles," "on" or "off,"

251
0:13:33.316,000 --> 0:13:36,000
with a list of languages underneath, including English.

252
0:13:38.164,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Technology has come so far.

253
0:13:40.846,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Our mindset just needs to catch up.

254
0:13:44.79,000 --> 0:13:45,000
"Resistance is futile."

255
0:13:46.615,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Laughter)

256
0:13:48.131,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You have been assimilated.

257
0:13:49.758,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

258
0:13:51.805,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Thank you.

259
0:13:52.98,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

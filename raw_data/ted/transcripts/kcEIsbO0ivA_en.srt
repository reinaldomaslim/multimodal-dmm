1
0:00:12.874,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I experienced my first coup d'état at the age of four.

2
0:00:17.125,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Because of the coup d'état,

3
0:00:18.835,000 --> 0:00:21,000
my family had to leave my native home of Ghana

4
0:00:21.962,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and move to the Gambia.

5
0:00:24.178,000 --> 0:00:25,000
As luck would have it,

6
0:00:25.899,000 --> 0:00:26,000
six months after we arrived,

7
0:00:27.632,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they too had a military coup.

8
0:00:30.703,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I vividly remember being woken up in the middle of the night

9
0:00:33.121,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and gathering the few belongings we could

10
0:00:35.348,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and walking for about two hours

11
0:00:38.297,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to a safe house.

12
0:00:40.343,000 --> 0:00:42,000
For a week, we slept under our beds

13
0:00:43.175,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because we were worried that bullets might fly through the window.

14
0:00:47.956,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Then, at the age of eight,

15
0:00:50.138,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we moved to Botswana.

16
0:00:52.265,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This time, it was different.

17
0:00:54.458,000 --> 0:00:55,000
There were no coups.

18
0:00:56.292,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Everything worked. Great education.

19
0:00:59.335,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They had such good infrastructure that even at the time they had

20
0:01:02.31,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a fiber-optic telephone system,

21
0:01:04.211,000 --> 0:01:07,000
long before it had reached Western countries.

22
0:01:09.466,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The only thing they didn't have

23
0:01:11.349,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is that they didn't have

24
0:01:12.679,000 --> 0:01:14,000
their own national television station,

25
0:01:15.329,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and so I remember watching

26
0:01:17.22,000 --> 0:01:19,000
TV from neighboring South Africa,

27
0:01:19.705,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and watching Nelson Mandela in jail

28
0:01:22.326,000 --> 0:01:24,000
being offered a chance to come out

29
0:01:24.621,000 --> 0:01:26,000
if he would give up the apartheid struggle.

30
0:01:27.501,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But he didn't. He refused to do that

31
0:01:28.616,000 --> 0:01:29,000
until he actually achieved his objective

32
0:01:30.464,000 --> 0:01:33,000
of freeing South Africa from apartheid.

33
0:01:33.676,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I remember feeling how just one good leader

34
0:01:37.709,000 --> 0:01:41,000
could make such a big difference in Africa.

35
0:01:42.557,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Then at the age of 12,

36
0:01:44.83,000 --> 0:01:47,000
my family sent me to high school in Zimbabwe.

37
0:01:48.17,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Initially, this too was amazing:

38
0:01:51.747,000 --> 0:01:56,000
growing economy, excellent infrastructure,

39
0:01:56.933,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and it seemed like it was a model

40
0:01:58.969,000 --> 0:02:,000
for economic development in Africa.

41
0:02:01.658,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I graduated from high school in Zimbabwe

42
0:02:03.649,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I went off to college.

43
0:02:05.07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Six years later, I returned to the country.

44
0:02:09.161,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Everything was different.

45
0:02:11.145,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It had shattered into pieces.

46
0:02:14.396,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Millions of people had emigrated,

47
0:02:17.606,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the economy was in a shambles,

48
0:02:19.413,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it seemed all of a sudden that 30 years

49
0:02:21.004,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of development had been wiped out.

50
0:02:23.889,000 --> 0:02:26,000
How could a country go so bad so fast?

51
0:02:27.377,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Most people would agree

52
0:02:28.99,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that it's all because of leadership.

53
0:02:31.178,000 --> 0:02:34,000
One man, President Robert Mugabe,

54
0:02:34.958,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is almost single-handedly responsible

55
0:02:36.168,000 --> 0:02:39,000
for having destroyed this country.

56
0:02:39.515,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now, all these experiences of living in different

57
0:02:41.244,000 --> 0:02:43,000
parts of Africa growing up

58
0:02:43.675,000 --> 0:02:44,000
did two things to me.

59
0:02:45.497,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The first is it made me fall in love with Africa.

60
0:02:49.776,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Everywhere I went,

61
0:02:51.699,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I experienced the wonderful beauty of our continent

62
0:02:54.377,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and saw the resilience and the spirit of our people,

63
0:02:57.534,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and at the time, I realized that I wanted to dedicate

64
0:02:59.461,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the rest of my life to making this continent great.

65
0:03:04.242,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But I also realized that making Africa great

66
0:03:06.144,000 --> 0:03:09,000
would require addressing this issue of leadership.

67
0:03:09.461,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You see, all these countries I lived in,

68
0:03:11.632,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the coups d'état

69
0:03:13.624,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the corruption I'd seen in Ghana and Gambia

70
0:03:16.683,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and in Zimbabwe,

71
0:03:19.405,000 --> 0:03:23,000
contrasted with the wonderful examples I had seen

72
0:03:23.858,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in Botswana and in South Africa of good leadership.

73
0:03:28.412,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It made me realize that Africa would rise or fall

74
0:03:32.495,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because of the quality of our leaders.

75
0:03:36.174,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, one might think, of course,

76
0:03:38.423,000 --> 0:03:4,000
leadership matters everywhere.

77
0:03:41.191,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But if there's one thing you take away from my talk today, it is this:

78
0:03:45.421,000 --> 0:03:48,000
In Africa, more than anywhere else in the world,

79
0:03:48.55,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the difference that just one good leader can make

80
0:03:51.876,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is much greater than anywhere else, and here's why.

81
0:03:55.435,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's because in Africa, we have weak institutions,

82
0:03:58.225,000 --> 0:04:,000
like the judiciary, the constitution,

83
0:04:00.903,000 --> 0:04:03,000
civil society and so forth.

84
0:04:04.094,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So here's a general rule of thumb that I believe in:

85
0:04:07.944,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When societies have strong institutions,

86
0:04:10.711,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the difference that one good leader can make is limited,

87
0:04:13.973,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but when you have weak institutions,

88
0:04:16.18,000 --> 0:04:17,000
then just one good leader

89
0:04:17.91,000 --> 0:04:19,000
can make or break that country.

90
0:04:20.058,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Let me make it a bit more concrete.

91
0:04:23.366,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You become the president of the United States.

92
0:04:26.415,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You think, "Wow, I've arrived.

93
0:04:28.687,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I'm the most powerful man in the world."

94
0:04:31.75,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So you decide, perhaps let me pass a law.

95
0:04:35.436,000 --> 0:04:36,000
All of a sudden, Congress taps you on the shoulder

96
0:04:36.978,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and says, "No, no, no, no, no, you can't do that."

97
0:04:40.111,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You say, "Let me try this way."

98
0:04:42.82,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The Senate comes and says, "Uh-uh,

99
0:04:44.273,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we don't think you can do that."

100
0:04:47.101,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You say, perhaps, "Let me print some money.

101
0:04:49.744,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I think the economy needs a stimulus."

102
0:04:52.399,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The central bank governor will think you're crazy.

103
0:04:53.894,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You might get impeached for that.

104
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But if you become the president of Zimbabwe,

105
0:04:59.307,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and you say, "You know, I really like this job.

106
0:05:02.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I think I'd like to stay in it forever." (Laughter)

107
0:05:07.225,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, you just can.

108
0:05:10.07,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You decide you want to print money.

109
0:05:12.55,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You call the central bank governor and you say,

110
0:05:14.453,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"Please double the money supply."

111
0:05:16.785,000 --> 0:05:17,000
He'll say, "Okay, yes, sir,

112
0:05:18.226,000 --> 0:05:21,000
is there anything else I can do for you?"

113
0:05:21.77,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is the power that African leaders have,

114
0:05:25.609,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and this is why they make the most difference

115
0:05:29.127,000 --> 0:05:31,000
on the continent.

116
0:05:31.581,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The good news is that

117
0:05:33.626,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the quality of leadership in Africa has been improving.

118
0:05:36.464,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We've had three generations of leaders, in my mind.

119
0:05:39.206,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Generation one are those who appeared

120
0:05:41.434,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in the '50s and '60s.

121
0:05:42.976,000 --> 0:05:44,000
These are people like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana

122
0:05:45.414,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania.

123
0:05:47.827,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The legacy they left is that they brought independence to Africa.

124
0:05:50.432,000 --> 0:05:51,000
They freed us from colonialism,

125
0:05:51.737,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and let's give them credit for that.

126
0:05:54.121,000 --> 0:05:57,000
They were followed by generation two.

127
0:05:57.133,000 --> 0:05:59,000
These are people that brought nothing

128
0:05:59.183,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but havoc to Africa.

129
0:06:01.32,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Think warfare, corruption, human rights abuses.

130
0:06:04.75,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is the stereotype of the typical African leader

131
0:06:06.783,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that we typically think of:

132
0:06:08.178,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Mobutu Sese Seko from Zaire,

133
0:06:10.184,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Sani Abacha from Nigeria.

134
0:06:12.565,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The good news is that most of these leaders have moved on,

135
0:06:15.741,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and they were replaced by generation three.

136
0:06:17.845,000 --> 0:06:19,000
These are people like the late Nelson Mandela

137
0:06:20.161,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and most of the leaders that we see in Africa today,

138
0:06:22.175,000 --> 0:06:24,000
like Paul Kagame and so forth.

139
0:06:24.852,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now these leaders are by no means perfect,

140
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but the one thing they have done is that they have

141
0:06:29.605,000 --> 0:06:31,000
cleaned up much of the mess of generation two.

142
0:06:32.603,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They've stopped the fighting,

143
0:06:34.061,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and I call them the stabilizer generation.

144
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They're much more accountable to their people,

145
0:06:39.11,000 --> 0:06:42,000
they've improved macroeconomic policies,

146
0:06:42.305,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and we are seeing for the first time

147
0:06:44.24,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Africa's growing, and in fact it's the second fastest

148
0:06:46.58,000 --> 0:06:47,000
growing economic region in the world.

149
0:06:48.425,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So these leaders are by no means perfect,

150
0:06:50.591,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but they are by and large

151
0:06:51.923,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the best leaders we've seen in the last 50 years.

152
0:06:56.749,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So where to from here?

153
0:06:59.628,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I believe that the next generation

154
0:07:01.844,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to come after this, generation four,

155
0:07:04.476,000 --> 0:07:06,000
has a unique opportunity

156
0:07:07.009,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to transform the continent.

157
0:07:09.564,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Specifically, they can do two things

158
0:07:11.408,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that previous generations have not done.

159
0:07:13.534,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The first thing they need to do

160
0:07:15.716,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is they need to create prosperity for the continent.

161
0:07:18.144,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Why is prosperity so important?

162
0:07:20.031,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Because none of the previous generations

163
0:07:21.714,000 --> 0:07:23,000
have been able to tackle this issue of poverty.

164
0:07:24.394,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Africa today

165
0:07:25.71,000 --> 0:07:27,000
has the fastest growing population in the world,

166
0:07:28.54,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but also is the poorest.

167
0:07:31.241,000 --> 0:07:34,000
By 2030, Africa will have a larger workforce than China,

168
0:07:34.918,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and by 2050, it will have the largest workforce in the world.

169
0:07:38.72,000 --> 0:07:4,000
One billion people will need jobs in Africa,

170
0:07:41.252,000 --> 0:07:43,000
so if we don't grow our economies fast enough,

171
0:07:43.626,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we're sitting on a ticking time bomb,

172
0:07:46.073,000 --> 0:07:49,000
not just for Africa but for the entire world.

173
0:07:49.605,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Let me show you an example

174
0:07:51.743,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of one person who is living up to this legacy

175
0:07:53.449,000 --> 0:07:55,000
of creating prosperity: Laetitia.

176
0:07:56.212,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Laetitia's a young woman from Kenya

177
0:07:59.203,000 --> 0:08:,000
who at the age of 13 had to drop out of school

178
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because her family couldn't afford to pay fees for her.

179
0:08:03.91,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So she started her own business rearing rabbits,

180
0:08:06.111,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which happen to be a delicacy in this part of Kenya

181
0:08:07.71,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that she's from.

182
0:08:09.308,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This business did so well that within a year,

183
0:08:11.292,000 --> 0:08:13,000
she was employing 15 women

184
0:08:13.448,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and was able to generate enough income

185
0:08:15.425,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that she was able to send herself to school,

186
0:08:17.146,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and through these women

187
0:08:18.155,000 --> 0:08:2,000
fund another 65 children to go to school.

188
0:08:20.862,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The profits that she generated,

189
0:08:22.564,000 --> 0:08:23,000
she used that to build a school,

190
0:08:24.149,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and today she educates

191
0:08:25.697,000 --> 0:08:27,000
400 children in her community.

192
0:08:28.238,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And she's just turned 18.

193
0:08:30.128,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Applause)

194
0:08:36.857,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Another example is Erick Rajaonary.

195
0:08:40.713,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Erick comes from the island of Madagascar.

196
0:08:43.797,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Now, Erick realized that agriculture

197
0:08:46.596,000 --> 0:08:47,000
would be the key to creating jobs

198
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in the rural areas of Madagascar,

199
0:08:50.319,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but he also realized that fertilizer was a very

200
0:08:52.265,000 --> 0:08:55,000
expensive input for most farmers in Madagascar.

201
0:08:55.596,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Madagascar has these very special bats

202
0:08:58.623,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that produce these droppings

203
0:09:00.207,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that are very high in nutrients.

204
0:09:02.614,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In 2006, Erick quit his job as a chartered accountant

205
0:09:05.989,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and started a company to manufacture

206
0:09:07.958,000 --> 0:09:1,000
fertilizer from the bat droppings.

207
0:09:11.144,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Today, Erick has built a business

208
0:09:13.442,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that generates several million dollars of revenue,

209
0:09:16.283,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and he employs 70 people full time

210
0:09:19.116,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and another 800 people during the season

211
0:09:20.994,000 --> 0:09:22,000
when the bats drop their droppings the most.

212
0:09:23.976,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now, what I like about this story

213
0:09:26.539,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is that it shows that opportunities to create prosperity

214
0:09:30.421,000 --> 0:09:32,000
can be found almost anywhere.

215
0:09:32.716,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Erick is known as the Batman.

216
0:09:34.77,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

217
0:09:35.785,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And who would have thought that you would have

218
0:09:37.752,000 --> 0:09:39,000
been able to build a multimillion-dollar business

219
0:09:40.414,000 --> 0:09:44,000
employing so many people just from bat poo?

220
0:09:47.444,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The second thing that this generation needs to do

221
0:09:51.395,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is to create our institutions.

222
0:09:53.836,000 --> 0:09:54,000
They need to build these institutions such that we

223
0:09:55.651,000 --> 0:09:58,000
are never held to ransom again

224
0:09:58.876,000 --> 0:10:02,000
by a few individuals like Robert Mugabe.

225
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Now, all of this sounds great,

226
0:10:06.472,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but where are we going to get this generation four from?

227
0:10:10.5,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Do we just sit and hope that they emerge

228
0:10:12.941,000 --> 0:10:15,000
by chance, or that God gives them to us?

229
0:10:16.705,000 --> 0:10:17,000
No, I don't think so.

230
0:10:18.458,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's too important an issue for us to leave it to chance.

231
0:10:21.61,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I believe that we need to create African institutions,

232
0:10:24.917,000 --> 0:10:26,000
home-grown, that will identify and develop

233
0:10:27.628,000 --> 0:10:3,000
these leaders in a systematic, practical way.

234
0:10:31.379,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We've been doing this for the last 10 years

235
0:10:33.03,000 --> 0:10:35,000
through the African Leadership Academy.

236
0:10:35.581,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Laetitia is one of our young leaders.

237
0:10:38.262,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Today, we have 700 of them that are being groomed

238
0:10:40.67,000 --> 0:10:42,000
for the African continent,

239
0:10:42.72,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and over the next 50 years,

240
0:10:43.795,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we expect to create 6,000 of them.

241
0:10:46.789,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But one thing has been troubling me.

242
0:10:49.408,000 --> 0:10:51,000
We would get about 4,000 applications a year

243
0:10:51.5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
for 100 young leaders that we could take

244
0:10:53.569,000 --> 0:10:54,000
into this academy,

245
0:10:54.883,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and so I saw the tremendous hunger that existed

246
0:10:56.944,000 --> 0:10:58,000
for this leadership training that we're offering.

247
0:10:59.835,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But we couldn't satisfy it.

248
0:11:02.951,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So today, I'm announcing for the first time in public

249
0:11:06.973,000 --> 0:11:1,000
an extension to this vision for the African Leadership Academy.

250
0:11:11.611,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We're building 25 brand new universities in Africa

251
0:11:16.718,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that are going to cultivate this next generation

252
0:11:18.267,000 --> 0:11:19,000
of African leaders.

253
0:11:20.113,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Each campus will have 10,000 leaders at a time

254
0:11:23.975,000 --> 0:11:25,000
so we'll be educating and developing

255
0:11:26.201,000 --> 0:11:28,000
250,000 leaders at any given time.

256
0:11:29.015,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Applause)

257
0:11:36.137,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Over the next 50 years, this institution

258
0:11:38.388,000 --> 0:11:39,000
will create three million transformative leaders

259
0:11:40.346,000 --> 0:11:42,000
for the continent.

260
0:11:42.379,000 --> 0:11:44,000
My hope is that half of them

261
0:11:44.62,000 --> 0:11:45,000
will become the entrepreneurs that we need,

262
0:11:46.172,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who will create these jobs that we need,

263
0:11:47.995,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and the other half

264
0:11:49.502,000 --> 0:11:5,000
will go into government

265
0:11:51.189,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and the nonprofit sector,

266
0:11:52.388,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and they will build the institutions that we need.

267
0:11:56.01,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But they won't just learn academics.

268
0:11:59.4,000 --> 0:12:01,000
They will also learn how to become leaders,

269
0:12:02.19,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and they will develop their skills as entrepreneurs.

270
0:12:04.074,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So think of this as Africa's Ivy League,

271
0:12:07.938,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but instead of getting admitted because of your SAT scores

272
0:12:11.22,000 --> 0:12:12,000
or because of how much money you have

273
0:12:13.101,000 --> 0:12:14,000
or which family you come from,

274
0:12:14.303,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the main criteria for getting into this university

275
0:12:17.225,000 --> 0:12:18,000
will be what is the potential that you have

276
0:12:19.199,000 --> 0:12:22,000
for transforming Africa?

277
0:12:22.461,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But what we're doing is just one group of institutions.

278
0:12:25.97,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We cannot transform Africa by ourselves.

279
0:12:30.06,000 --> 0:12:31,000
My hope

280
0:12:31.762,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is that many, many other home-grown

281
0:12:33.9,000 --> 0:12:36,000
African institutions will blossom,

282
0:12:37.318,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and these institutions will all come together

283
0:12:39.02,000 --> 0:12:41,000
with a common vision of developing

284
0:12:41.48,000 --> 0:12:42,000
this next generation of African leaders,

285
0:12:43.363,000 --> 0:12:44,000
generation four,

286
0:12:45.296,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and they will teach them this common message:

287
0:12:47.76,000 --> 0:12:51,000
create jobs, build our institutions.

288
0:12:52.54,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Nelson Mandela once said,

289
0:12:54.79,000 --> 0:12:55,000
"Every now and then,

290
0:12:56.592,000 --> 0:12:59,000
a generation is called upon to be great.

291
0:12:59.828,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You can be that great generation."

292
0:13:03.036,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I believe that if we carefully identify and cultivate

293
0:13:06.588,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the next generation of African leaders,

294
0:13:09.561,000 --> 0:13:11,000
then this generation four that is coming up

295
0:13:12.336,000 --> 0:13:15,000
will be the greatest generation that Africa

296
0:13:15.768,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and indeed the entire world has ever seen.

297
0:13:20.18,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Thank you.

298
0:13:22.212,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Applause)

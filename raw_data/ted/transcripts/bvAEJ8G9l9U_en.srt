1
0:00:12.24,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Wow, what an honor. I always wondered what this would feel like.

2
0:00:15.28,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So eight years ago, I got the worst career advice of my life.

3
0:00:20.08,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I had a friend tell me,

4
0:00:21.56,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"Don't worry about how much you like the work you're doing now.

5
0:00:24.52,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's all about just building your resume."

6
0:00:26.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I'd just come back from living in Spain for a while,

7
0:00:29.24,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I'd joined this Fortune 500 company. I thought, "This is fantastic.

8
0:00:32.598,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'm going to have big impact on the world."

9
0:00:34.638,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I had all these ideas. And within about two months,

10
0:00:37.36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I noticed at about 10am every morning I had this strange urge

11
0:00:40.384,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to want to slam my head through the monitor of my computer.

12
0:00:43.96,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I don't know if anyone's ever felt that.

13
0:00:45.889,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I noticed pretty soon after that that all the competitors in our space

14
0:00:49.44,000 --> 0:00:51,000
had already automated my job role.

15
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this is right about when I got this sage advice to build up my resume.

16
0:00:56.6,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well, as I'm trying to figure out

17
0:00:58.64,000 --> 0:01:04,000
what two-story window I'm going to jump out of and change things up,

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I read some altogether different advice from Warren Buffett, and he said,

19
0:01:08.92,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Taking jobs to build up your resume is the same as saving up sex for old age."

20
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:16.319,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I heard that, and that was all I needed.

22
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Within two weeks, I was out of there, and I left with one intention:

23
0:01:21.88,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to find something that I could screw up. That's how tough it was.

24
0:01:24.96,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I wanted to have some type of impact. It didn't matter what it was.

25
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I found pretty quickly that I wasn't alone:

26
0:01:30.739,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it turns out that over 80 percent of the people around

27
0:01:33.6,000 --> 0:01:34,000
don't enjoy their work.

28
0:01:35.12,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I'm guessing this room is different,

29
0:01:36.68,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but that's the average that Deloitte has done with their studies.

30
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So I wanted to find out, what is it that sets these people apart,

31
0:01:42.632,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the people who do the passionate, world-changing work,

32
0:01:44.992,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that wake up inspired every day,

33
0:01:46.64,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and then these people, the other 80 percent

34
0:01:48.44,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who lead these lives of quiet desperation.

35
0:01:50.52,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I started to interview all these people doing this inspiring work,

36
0:01:53.8,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I read books and did case studies,

37
0:01:56.64,000 --> 0:01:58,000
300 books altogether on purpose and career and all this,

38
0:01:59.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
totally just self-immersion, really for the selfish reason of --

39
0:02:04.24,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I wanted to find the work that I couldn't not do,

40
0:02:06.76,000 --> 0:02:07,000
what that was for me.

41
0:02:08.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But as I was doing this, more and more people started to ask me,

42
0:02:10.986,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"You're into this career thing.

43
0:02:12.48,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I don't like my job. Can we sit down for lunch?"

44
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I'd say, "Sure." But I would have to warn them,

45
0:02:16.92,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because at this point, my quit rate was also 80 percent.

46
0:02:19.24,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Of the people I'd sit down with for lunch, 80 percent would quit their job

47
0:02:22.491,000 --> 0:02:23,000
within two months.

48
0:02:23.68,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was proud of this, and it wasn't that I had any special magic.

49
0:02:27.92,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It was that I would ask one simple question.

50
0:02:29.992,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It was, "Why are you doing the work that you're doing?"

51
0:02:32.632,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And so often their answer would be,

52
0:02:34.76,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Well, because somebody told me I'm supposed to."

53
0:02:37.08,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I realized that so many people around us

54
0:02:39.24,000 --> 0:02:42,000
are climbing their way up this ladder that someone tells them to climb,

55
0:02:42.88,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it ends up being leaned up against the wrong wall,

56
0:02:45.44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or no wall at all.

57
0:02:47.12,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The more time I spent around these people and saw this problem,

58
0:02:49.84,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I thought, what if we could create a community,

59
0:02:52.08,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a place where people could feel like they belonged

60
0:02:54.48,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and that it was OK to do things differently,

61
0:02:56.647,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to take the road less traveled, where that was encouraged,

62
0:02:59.386,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and inspire people to change?

63
0:03:01.96,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And that later became what I now call Live Your Legend,

64
0:03:04.68,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which I'll explain in a little bit.

65
0:03:06.371,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But as I've made these discoveries, I noticed a framework

66
0:03:10.08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of really three simple things

67
0:03:11.485,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that all these different passionate world-changers have in common,

68
0:03:14.64,000 --> 0:03:16,000
whether you're a Steve Jobs or if you're just, you know,

69
0:03:17.32,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the person that has the bakery down the street.

70
0:03:19.4,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But you're doing work that embodies who you are.

71
0:03:21.44,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I want to share those three with you, so we can use them as a lens

72
0:03:24.36,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for the rest of today and hopefully the rest of our life.

73
0:03:27.051,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The first part of this three-step passionate work framework

74
0:03:29.851,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is becoming a self-expert and understanding yourself,

75
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because if you don't know what you're looking for,

76
0:03:35.48,000 --> 0:03:36,000
you're never going to find it.

77
0:03:37.12,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the thing is that no one is going to do this for us.

78
0:03:39.764,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There's no major in university on passion and purpose and career.

79
0:03:43.48,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I don't know how that's not a required double major,

80
0:03:45.76,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but don't even get me started on that.

81
0:03:47.6,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I mean, you spend more time picking out a dorm room TV set

82
0:03:50.6,000 --> 0:03:52,000
than you do you picking your major and your area of study.

83
0:03:53.56,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But the point is, it's on us to figure that out,

84
0:03:56.2,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and we need a framework, we need a way to navigate through this.

85
0:03:59.44,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And so the first step of our compass is finding out what our unique strengths are.

86
0:04:03.322,000 --> 0:04:06,000
What are the things that we wake up loving to do no matter what,

87
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:09,000
whether we're paid or we're not paid, the things that people thank us for?

88
0:04:09.88,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And the Strengths Finder 2.0 is a book and also an online tool.

89
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I highly recommend it for sorting out what it is that you're naturally good at.

90
0:04:16.64,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And next, what's our framework or our hierarchy for making decisions?

91
0:04:21.08,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Do we care about the people, our family, health,

92
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:27,000
or is it achievement, success, all this stuff?

93
0:04:27.48,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We have to figure out what it is to make these decisions,

94
0:04:30.171,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so we know what our soul is made of,

95
0:04:31.92,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so that we don't go selling it to some cause we don't give a shit about.

96
0:04:36.64,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And then the next step is our experiences.

97
0:04:40.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
All of us have these experiences. We learn things every day, every minute

98
0:04:43.84,000 --> 0:04:44,000
about what we love, what we hate,

99
0:04:45.56,000 --> 0:04:47,000
what we're good at, what we're terrible at.

100
0:04:47.584,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And if we don't spend time paying attention to that

101
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and assimilating that learning

102
0:04:51.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and applying it to the rest of our lives, it's all for nothing.

103
0:04:54.56,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Every day, every week, every month of every year

104
0:04:57.24,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I spend some time just reflecting on what went right,

105
0:04:59.72,000 --> 0:05:01,000
what went wrong, and what do I want to repeat,

106
0:05:01.887,000 --> 0:05:02,000
what can I apply more to my life.

107
0:05:03.487,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And even more so than that, as you see people, especially today,

108
0:05:06.6,000 --> 0:05:08,000
who inspire you, who are doing things where you say

109
0:05:09.005,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Oh God, what Jeff is doing, I want to be like him."

110
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Why are you saying that? Open up a journal.

111
0:05:13.706,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Write down what it is about them that inspires you.

112
0:05:15.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's not going to be everything about their life,

113
0:05:17.88,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but whatever it is, take note on that,

114
0:05:19.72,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so over time we'll have this repository of things

115
0:05:22.04,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that we can use to apply to our life and have a more passionate existence

116
0:05:26.28,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and make a better impact.

117
0:05:27.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Because when we start to put these things together,

118
0:05:30.205,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we can then define what success actually means to us,

119
0:05:33.52,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and without these different parts of the compass, it's impossible.

120
0:05:36.68,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We end up in the situation -- we have that scripted life

121
0:05:39.324,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that everybody seems to be living going up this ladder to nowhere.

122
0:05:42.48,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's kind of like in Wall Street 2, if anybody saw that,

123
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the peon employee asks the big Wall Street banker CEO,

124
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"What's your number? Everyone's got a number,

125
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
where if they make this money, they'll leave it all."

126
0:05:53.72,000 --> 0:05:55,000
He says, "Oh, it's simple. More."

127
0:05:57.12,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And he just smiles.

128
0:05:58.44,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And it's the sad state of most of the people

129
0:06:00.24,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that haven't spent time understanding what matters for them,

130
0:06:02.8,000 --> 0:06:04,000
who keep reaching for something that doesn't mean anything to us,

131
0:06:05.56,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but we're doing it because everyone said we're supposed to.

132
0:06:08.08,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But once we have this framework together,

133
0:06:09.84,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we can start to identify the things that make us come alive.

134
0:06:12.48,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You know, before this, a passion could come and hit you in the face,

135
0:06:15.72,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or maybe in your possible line of work, you might throw it away

136
0:06:18.44,000 --> 0:06:2,000
because you don't have a way of identifying it.

137
0:06:20.655,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But once you do, you can see something that's congruent with my strengths,

138
0:06:24.215,000 --> 0:06:25,000
my values, who I am as a person,

139
0:06:26.04,000 --> 0:06:29,000
so I'm going to grab ahold of this, I'm going to do something with it,

140
0:06:29.35,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and I'm going to pursue it and try to make an impact with it.

141
0:06:32.232,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And Live Your Legend and the movement we've built

142
0:06:34.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
wouldn't exist if I didn't have this compass to identify,

143
0:06:37.491,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"Wow, this is something I want to pursue and make a difference with."

144
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
If we don't know what we're looking for, we're never going to find it,

145
0:06:43.84,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but once we have this framework, this compass,

146
0:06:46.4,000 --> 0:06:5,000
then we can move on to what's next -- and that's not me up there --

147
0:06:50.88,000 --> 0:06:52,000
doing the impossible and pushing our limits.

148
0:06:53.12,000 --> 0:06:55,000
There's two reasons why people don't do things.

149
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
One is they tell themselves they can't do them,

150
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or people around them tell them they can't do them.

151
0:06:59.32,000 --> 0:07:,000
Either way, we start to believe it.

152
0:07:00.88,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Either we give up, or we never start in the first place.

153
0:07:03.28,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The things is, everything was impossible until somebody did it.

154
0:07:06.2,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Every invention, every new thing in the world,

155
0:07:08.76,000 --> 0:07:09,000
people thought were crazy at first.

156
0:07:10.451,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Roger Bannister and the four-minute mile, it was a physical impossibility

157
0:07:13.904,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to break the four-minute mile in a foot race

158
0:07:16.32,000 --> 0:07:18,000
until Roger Bannister stood up and did it.

159
0:07:18.36,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And then what happened?

160
0:07:19.6,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Two months later, 16 people broke the four-minute mile.

161
0:07:22.24,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The things that we have in our head that we think are impossible

162
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
are often just milestones waiting to be accomplished

163
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
if we can push those limits a bit.

164
0:07:28.804,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And I think this starts with probably your physical body and fitness

165
0:07:32.2,000 --> 0:07:34,000
more than anything, because we can control that.

166
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:35,000
If you don't think you can run a mile,

167
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you show yourself you can run a mile or two,

168
0:07:38.48,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or a marathon, or lose five pounds, or whatever it is,

169
0:07:41.04,000 --> 0:07:43,000
you realize that confidence compounds

170
0:07:43.56,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and can be transferred into the rest of your world.

171
0:07:46.08,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And I've actually gotten into the habit of this a little bit with my friends.

172
0:07:49.76,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We have this little group. We go on physical adventures,

173
0:07:52.52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and recently, I found myself in a kind of precarious spot.

174
0:07:55.64,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I'm terrified of deep, dark, blue water.

175
0:07:58.68,000 --> 0:08:,000
I don't know if anyone's ever had that same fear

176
0:08:00.72,000 --> 0:08:02,000
ever since they watched Jaws 1, 2, 3 and 4 like six times

177
0:08:03.344,000 --> 0:08:04,000
when I was a kid.

178
0:08:04.52,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But anything above here, if it's murky, I can already feel it right now.

179
0:08:09.08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I swear there's something in there.

180
0:08:10.88,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Even if it's Lake Tahoe, it's fresh water, totally unfounded fear,

181
0:08:14.04,000 --> 0:08:15,000
ridiculous, but it's there.

182
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Anyway, three years ago I find myself on this tugboat

183
0:08:18.24,000 --> 0:08:19,000
right down here in the San Francisco Bay.

184
0:08:20.24,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's a rainy, stormy, windy day, and people are getting sick on the boat,

185
0:08:23.72,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I'm sitting there wearing a wetsuit, and I'm looking out the window

186
0:08:27.078,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in pure terror thinking I'm about to swim to my death.

187
0:08:30.08,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'm going to try to swim across the Golden Gate.

188
0:08:32.36,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And my guess is some people in this room might have done that before.

189
0:08:36.2,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I'm sitting there, and my buddy Jonathan, who had talked me into it,

190
0:08:39.44,000 --> 0:08:41,000
he comes up to me and he could see the state I was in.

191
0:08:41.72,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And he says, "Scott, hey man, what's the worst that could happen?

192
0:08:44.48,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You're wearing a wetsuit. You're not going to sink.

193
0:08:46.64,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And If you can't make it, just hop on one of the 20 kayaks.

194
0:08:49.48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Plus, if there's a shark attack, why are they going to pick you

195
0:08:52.32,000 --> 0:08:54,000
over the 80 people in the water?" So thanks, that helps.

196
0:08:54.964,000 --> 0:08:56,000
He's like, "But really, just have fun with this. Good luck."

197
0:08:57.844,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And he dives in, swims off. OK.

198
0:09:00.36,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Turns out, the pep talk totally worked, and I felt this total feeling of calm,

199
0:09:04.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and I think it was because Jonathan was 13 years old.

200
0:09:07.72,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:09.68,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And of the 80 people swimming that day,

202
0:09:12.4,000 --> 0:09:14,000
65 of them were between the ages of nine and 13.

203
0:09:15.24,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Think how you would have approached your world differently

204
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:21,000
if at nine years old you found out you could swim a mile and a half

205
0:09:21.2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in 56-degree water from Alcatraz to San Francisco.

206
0:09:23.92,000 --> 0:09:24,000
What would you have said yes to?

207
0:09:25.36,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What would you have not given up on? What would you have tried?

208
0:09:28.24,000 --> 0:09:3,000
As I'm finishing this swim, I get to Aquatic Park,

209
0:09:30.36,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and I'm getting out of the water

210
0:09:31.76,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and of course half the kids are already finished,

211
0:09:33.88,000 --> 0:09:35,000
so they're cheering me on and they're all excited.

212
0:09:36.238,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And I got total popsicle head, if anyone's ever swam in the Bay,

213
0:09:39.278,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and I'm trying to just thaw my face out, and I'm watching people finish.

214
0:09:42.81,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And I see this one kid, something didn't look right.

215
0:09:45.84,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And he's just flailing like this.

216
0:09:47.88,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And he's barely able to sip some air before he slams his head back down.

217
0:09:51.32,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And I notice other parents were watching too,

218
0:09:53.56,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and I swear they were thinking the same thing I was:

219
0:09:56.04,000 --> 0:09:59,000
this is why you don't let nine-year-olds swim from Alcatraz.

220
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:01,000
This was not fatigue.

221
0:10:01.24,000 --> 0:10:03,000
All of a sudden, two parents run up and grab him,

222
0:10:03.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and they put him on their shoulders, and they're dragging him like this,

223
0:10:07.36,000 --> 0:10:08,000
totally limp.

224
0:10:09.24,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And then all of a sudden they walk a few more feet

225
0:10:11.6,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and they plop him down in his wheelchair.

226
0:10:13.6,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And he puts his fists up in the most insane show of victory I've ever seen.

227
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I can still feel the warmth and the energy on this guy

228
0:10:19.84,000 --> 0:10:2,000
when he made this accomplishment.

229
0:10:21.44,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I had seen him earlier that day in his wheelchair.

230
0:10:24.44,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I just had no idea he was going to swim.

231
0:10:26.44,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I mean, where is he going to be in 20 years?

232
0:10:29.56,000 --> 0:10:32,000
How many people told him he couldn't do that, that he would die if he tried that?

233
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You prove people wrong, you prove yourself wrong,

234
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that you can make little incremental pushes

235
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:38,000
of what you believe is possible.

236
0:10:38.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
You don't have to be the fastest marathoner in the world,

237
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
just your own impossibilities, to accomplish those,

238
0:10:43.405,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and it starts with little bitty steps.

239
0:10:45.405,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And the best way to do this

240
0:10:47.76,000 --> 0:10:49,000
is to surround yourself with passionate people.

241
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The fastest things to do things you don't think can be done

242
0:10:52.786,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is to surround yourself with people already doing them.

243
0:10:55.382,000 --> 0:10:57,000
There's this quote by Jim Rohn and it says.

244
0:10:57.84,000 --> 0:11:,000
"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with."

245
0:11:01.24,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And there is no bigger lifehack in the history of the world

246
0:11:04.56,000 --> 0:11:07,000
from getting where you are today to where you want to be

247
0:11:07.64,000 --> 0:11:09,000
than the people you choose to put in your corner.

248
0:11:10.56,000 --> 0:11:12,000
They change everything, and it's a proven fact.

249
0:11:12.88,000 --> 0:11:16,000
In 1898, Norman Triplett did this study with a bunch of cyclists,

250
0:11:17.2,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and he would measure their times around the track in a group,

251
0:11:20.025,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and also individually.

252
0:11:21.2,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And he found that every time the cyclists in the group would cycle faster.

253
0:11:24.92,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And it's been repeated in all kinds of walks of life since then,

254
0:11:27.76,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and it proves the same thing over again,

255
0:11:29.68,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that the people around you matter, and environment is everything.

256
0:11:32.56,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But it's on you to control it, because it can go both ways.

257
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
With 80 percent of people who don't like the work they do,

258
0:11:37.76,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that means most people around us, not in this room, but everywhere else,

259
0:11:40.96,000 --> 0:11:43,000
are encouraging complacency and keeping us from pursuing the things that matter to us

260
0:11:44.64,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so we have to manage those surroundings.

261
0:11:46.72,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I found myself in this situation --

262
0:11:50.68,000 --> 0:11:52,000
personal example, a couple years ago.

263
0:11:53.6,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Has anyone ever had a hobby or a passion they poured their heart and soul into,

264
0:11:57.8,000 --> 0:12:,000
unbelievable amount of time, and they so badly want to call it a business,

265
0:12:01.32,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but no one's paying attention and it doesn't make a dime?

266
0:12:05.48,000 --> 0:12:09,000
OK, I was there for four years trying to build this Live Your Legend movement

267
0:12:09.6,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to help people do work that they genuinely cared about and that inspired them,

268
0:12:12.96,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and I was doing all I could,

269
0:12:14.32,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and there were only three people paying attention,

270
0:12:16.52,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and they're all right there: my mother, father and my wife, Chelsea.

271
0:12:19.783,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you guys for the support.

272
0:12:21.303,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Applause)

273
0:12:22.8,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And this is how badly I wanted it, it grew at zero percent for four years,

274
0:12:27.52,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and I was about to shut it down,

275
0:12:29.52,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and right about then,

276
0:12:31.24,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I moved to San Francisco and started to meet some pretty interesting people

277
0:12:34.8,000 --> 0:12:36,000
who had these crazy lifestyles of adventure,

278
0:12:37.04,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of businesses and websites and blogs

279
0:12:39.08,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that surrounded their passions and helped people in a meaningful way.

280
0:12:42.36,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And one of my friends, now, he has a family of eight,

281
0:12:45.04,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and he supports his whole family

282
0:12:47.4,000 --> 0:12:49,000
with a blog that he writes for twice a week.

283
0:12:50.28,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They just came back from a month in Europe, all of them together.

284
0:12:53.352,000 --> 0:12:55,000
This blew my mind. How does this even exist?

285
0:12:55.44,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And I got unbelievably inspired by seeing this,

286
0:12:58.96,000 --> 0:13:,000
and instead of shutting it down, I decided, let's take it seriously.

287
0:13:01.96,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I did everything I could to spend my time,

288
0:13:03.96,000 --> 0:13:05,000
every waking hour possible trying to hound these guys,

289
0:13:06.48,000 --> 0:13:08,000
hanging out and having beers and workouts, whatever it was.

290
0:13:09.28,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And after four years of zero growth,

291
0:13:11.04,000 --> 0:13:13,000
within six months of hanging around these people,

292
0:13:13.4,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the community at Live Your Legend grew by 10 times.

293
0:13:16.12,000 --> 0:13:19,000
In another 12 months, it grew by 160 times.

294
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And today over 30,000 people from 158 countries

295
0:13:23.08,000 --> 0:13:26,000
use our career and connection tools on a monthly basis.

296
0:13:26.2,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And those people have made up that community of passionate folks

297
0:13:30.6,000 --> 0:13:32,000
who inspired that possibility that I dreamed of

298
0:13:32.84,000 --> 0:13:35,000
for Live Your Legend so many years back.

299
0:13:36.04,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The people change everything, and this is why --

300
0:13:38.32,000 --> 0:13:4,000
you know, you ask what was going on.

301
0:13:40.56,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Well, for four years, I knew nobody in this space,

302
0:13:43.04,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and I didn't even know it existed, that people could do this stuff,

303
0:13:46.56,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that you could have movements like this.

304
0:13:48.56,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And then I'm over here in San Francisco, and everyone around me was doing it.

305
0:13:52.24,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It became normal, so my thinking went from how could I possibly do this

306
0:13:56.36,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to how could I possibly not.

307
0:13:58.2,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And right then, when that happens, that switch goes on in your head,

308
0:14:01.44,000 --> 0:14:02,000
it ripples across your whole world.

309
0:14:03.131,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And without even trying, your standards go from here to here.

310
0:14:06.08,000 --> 0:14:09,000
You don't need to change your goals. You just need to change your surroundings.

311
0:14:09.819,000 --> 0:14:13,000
That's it, and that's why I love being around this whole group of people,

312
0:14:14.2,000 --> 0:14:15,000
why I go to every TED event I can,

313
0:14:15.844,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and watch them on my iPad on the way to work, whatever it is.

314
0:14:18.8,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Because this is the group of people that inspires possibility.

315
0:14:22.24,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We have a whole day to spend together and plenty more.

316
0:14:25.28,000 --> 0:14:28,000
To sum things up, in terms of these three pillars,

317
0:14:28.76,000 --> 0:14:31,000
they all have one thing in common more than anything else.

318
0:14:32.72,000 --> 0:14:34,000
They are 100 percent in our control.

319
0:14:35.2,000 --> 0:14:38,000
No one can tell you you can't learn about yourself.

320
0:14:38.28,000 --> 0:14:4,000
No one can tell you you can't push your limits

321
0:14:40.447,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and learn your own impossible and push that.

322
0:14:42.76,000 --> 0:14:44,000
No one can tell you you can't surround yourself with inspiring people

323
0:14:45.72,000 --> 0:14:47,000
or get away from the people who bring you down.

324
0:14:47.935,000 --> 0:14:48,000
You can't control a recession.

325
0:14:49.388,000 --> 0:14:52,000
You can't control getting fired or getting in a car accident.

326
0:14:52.6,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Most things are totally out of our hands.

327
0:14:54.72,000 --> 0:14:56,000
These three things are totally on us,

328
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and they can change our whole world if we decide to do something about it.

329
0:15:04.08,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And the thing is, it's starting to happen on a widespread level.

330
0:15:07.104,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I just read in Forbes, the US Government reported for the first time

331
0:15:10.319,000 --> 0:15:12,000
in a month where more people had quit their jobs

332
0:15:13.04,000 --> 0:15:14,000
than had been laid off.

333
0:15:14.4,000 --> 0:15:17,000
They thought this was an anomaly, but it's happened three months straight.

334
0:15:17.64,000 --> 0:15:19,000
In a time where people claim it's kind of a tough environment,

335
0:15:20.36,000 --> 0:15:22,000
people are giving a middle finger to this scripted life,

336
0:15:22.72,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the things that people say you're supposed to do,

337
0:15:24.8,000 --> 0:15:27,000
in exchange for things that matter to them and do the things that inspire them.

338
0:15:28.56,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And the thing is, people are waking up to this possibility,

339
0:15:31.36,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that really the only thing that limits possibility now is imagination.

340
0:15:37.36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
That's not a cliché anymore.

341
0:15:39.36,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I don't care what it is that you're into, what passion, what hobby.

342
0:15:42.56,000 --> 0:15:45,000
If you're into knitting, you can find someone who is killing it knitting,

343
0:15:46.04,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and you can learn from them. It's wild.

344
0:15:48.4,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And that's what this whole day is about, to learn from the folks speaking,

345
0:15:51.92,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and we profile these people on Live Your Legend every day,

346
0:15:55.36,000 --> 0:15:57,000
because when ordinary people are doing the extraordinary,

347
0:15:58.08,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and we can be around that,

348
0:15:59.88,000 --> 0:16:,000
it becomes normal.

349
0:16:01.64,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And this isn't about being Gandhi or Steve Jobs, doing something crazy.

350
0:16:05.76,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It's just about doing something that matters to you,

351
0:16:08.213,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and makes an impact that only you can make.

352
0:16:11.6,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Speaking of Gandhi, he was a recovering lawyer,

353
0:16:15.28,000 --> 0:16:16,000
as I've heard the term,

354
0:16:16.64,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and he was called to a greater cause, something that mattered to him,

355
0:16:19.92,000 --> 0:16:2,000
he couldn't not do.

356
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And he has this quote that I absolutely live by.

357
0:16:23.423,000 --> 0:16:25,000
"First they ignore you, then they laugh at you,

358
0:16:25.76,000 --> 0:16:27,000
then they fight you, then you win."

359
0:16:29.96,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Everything was impossible until somebody did it.

360
0:16:32.64,000 --> 0:16:35,000
You can either hang around the people who tell you it can't be done

361
0:16:35.84,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and tell you you're stupid for trying,

362
0:16:37.68,000 --> 0:16:4,000
or surround yourself with the people who inspire possibility,

363
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:42,000
the people who are in this room.

364
0:16:43.6,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Because I see it as our responsibility to show the world

365
0:16:47.52,000 --> 0:16:5,000
that what's seen as impossible can become that new normal.

366
0:16:50.96,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And that's already starting to happen.

367
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
First, do the things that inspire us,

368
0:16:55.88,000 --> 0:16:58,000
so we can inspire other people to do the things that inspire them.

369
0:16:59.6,000 --> 0:17:,000
But we can't find that

370
0:17:02.2,000 --> 0:17:04,000
unless we know what we're looking for.

371
0:17:04.28,000 --> 0:17:06,000
We have to do our work on ourself,

372
0:17:06.4,000 --> 0:17:08,000
be intentional about that, and make those discoveries.

373
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Because I imagine a world where 80 percent of people love the work they do.

374
0:17:12.548,000 --> 0:17:13,000
What would that look like?

375
0:17:13.88,000 --> 0:17:17,000
What would the innovation be like? How would you treat the people around you?

376
0:17:17.92,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Things would start to change.

377
0:17:20.8,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And as we finish up, I have just one question to ask you guys,

378
0:17:24.04,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and I think it's the only question that matters.

379
0:17:26.8,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And it's what is the work you can't not do?

380
0:17:30.48,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Discover that, live it,

381
0:17:32.76,000 --> 0:17:34,000
not just for you, but for everybody around you,

382
0:17:36.4,000 --> 0:17:38,000
because that is what starts to change the world.

383
0:17:39.28,000 --> 0:17:41,000
What is the work you can't not do?

384
0:17:42.4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Thank you guys.

385
0:17:43.64,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Applause)

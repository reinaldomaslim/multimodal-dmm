1
0:00:12.958,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Do you ever think about what would happen

2
0:00:14.935,000 --> 0:00:16,000
if the world were a little bit different?

3
0:00:17.542,000 --> 0:00:18,000
How your life would be different

4
0:00:19.125,000 --> 0:00:21,000
if you were born 5,000 years from now

5
0:00:21.792,000 --> 0:00:22,000
instead of today?

6
0:00:23.958,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How history would be different

7
0:00:25.5,000 --> 0:00:27,000
if the continents were at different latitudes

8
0:00:27.667,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or how life in the Solar system would have developed

9
0:00:31.625,000 --> 0:00:33,000
if the Sun were 10 percent larger.

10
0:00:35.292,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, playing with these kinds of possibilities

11
0:00:38.208,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is what I get to do for a living

12
0:00:39.833,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but with the entire universe.

13
0:00:43.042,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I make model universes in a computer.

14
0:00:45.875,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Digital universes that have different starting points

15
0:00:48.833,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and are made of different amounts of different kinds of material.

16
0:00:53.458,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And then I compare these universes to our own

17
0:00:56.792,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to see what it is made of and how it evolved.

18
0:01:02.542,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This process of testing models with measurements of the sky

19
0:01:06.917,000 --> 0:01:08,000
has taught us a huge amount about our universe so far.

20
0:01:10.625,000 --> 0:01:12,000
One of the strangest things we have learned

21
0:01:12.875,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is that most of the material in the universe

22
0:01:15.458,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is made of something entirely different than you and me.

23
0:01:20.75,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But without it,

24
0:01:23.5,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the universe as we know it wouldn't exist.

25
0:01:28.958,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Everything we can see with telescopes

26
0:01:32.583,000 --> 0:01:36,000
makes up just about 15 percent of the total mass in the universe.

27
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Everything else, 85 percent of it,

28
0:01:42.417,000 --> 0:01:44,000
doesn't emit or absorb light.

29
0:01:45.708,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We can't see it with our eyes,

30
0:01:48.083,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we can't detect it with radio waves

31
0:01:51.625,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or microwaves or any other kind of light.

32
0:01:55.083,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But we know it is there

33
0:01:57.042,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because of its influence on what we can see.

34
0:02:01.208,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It's a little bit like,

35
0:02:02.5,000 --> 0:02:04,000
if you wanted to map the surface of our planet

36
0:02:04.708,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and everything on it

37
0:02:06.708,000 --> 0:02:09,000
using this picture of the Earth from space at night.

38
0:02:11.708,000 --> 0:02:13,000
You get some clues from where the light is,

39
0:02:14.208,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but there's a lot that you can't see,

40
0:02:16.042,000 --> 0:02:19,000
everything from people to mountain ranges.

41
0:02:19.708,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And you have to infer what is there from these limited clues.

42
0:02:25.958,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We call this unseen stuff "dark matter."

43
0:02:29.708,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Now, a lot of people have heard of dark matter,

44
0:02:32.625,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but even if you have heard of it,

45
0:02:34.958,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it probably seems abstract,

46
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
far away, probably even irrelevant.

47
0:02:42.625,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well, the interesting thing is,

48
0:02:45.458,000 --> 0:02:47,000
dark matter is all around us

49
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and probably right here.

50
0:02:50.958,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In fact, dark matter particles

51
0:02:52.917,000 --> 0:02:55,000
are probably going through your body right now

52
0:02:56.083,000 --> 0:02:57,000
as you sit in this room.

53
0:02:58.083,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Because we are on Earth

54
0:02:59.458,000 --> 0:03:,000
and Earth is spinning around the Sun,

55
0:03:01.333,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and the Sun is hurtling through our galaxy

56
0:03:04.292,000 --> 0:03:07,000
at about half a million miles per hour.

57
0:03:07.542,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But dark matter doesn't bump into us,

58
0:03:09.375,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it just goes right through us.

59
0:03:12.583,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So how do we figure out more about this?

60
0:03:17.042,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What is it,

61
0:03:18.333,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and what does it have to do with our existence?

62
0:03:20.792,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Well, in order to figure out how we came to be,

63
0:03:25.583,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we first need to understand how our galaxy came to be.

64
0:03:29.583,000 --> 0:03:33,000
This is a picture of our galaxy, the Milky Way, today.

65
0:03:34.083,000 --> 0:03:36,000
What did it look like 10 billion years in the past

66
0:03:36.458,000 --> 0:03:39,000
or what would it look like 10 billion years in the future?

67
0:03:40.917,000 --> 0:03:41,000
What about the stories

68
0:03:42.375,000 --> 0:03:44,000
of the hundreds of millions of other galaxies

69
0:03:45.042,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that we've already mapped out with large surveys of the sky?

70
0:03:49.208,000 --> 0:03:51,000
How would their histories be different

71
0:03:51.458,000 --> 0:03:53,000
if the universe was made of something else

72
0:03:54.375,000 --> 0:03:57,000
or if there was more or less matter in it?

73
0:03:57.5,000 --> 0:04:,000
So the interesting thing about these model universes

74
0:04:01.375,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is that they allow us to test these possibilities.

75
0:04:05.5,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Let's go back to the first moment of the universe --

76
0:04:11.542,000 --> 0:04:15,000
just a fraction of a second after the big bang.

77
0:04:17.875,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In this first moment,

78
0:04:19.833,000 --> 0:04:21,000
there was no matter at all.

79
0:04:21.958,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The universe was expanding very fast.

80
0:04:25.458,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And quantum mechanics tells us

81
0:04:28.25,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that matter is being created and destroyed

82
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
all the time, in every moment.

83
0:04:34.357,000 --> 0:04:36,000
At this time, the universe was expanding so fast

84
0:04:36.667,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that the matter that got created couldn't get destroyed.

85
0:04:40.833,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And thus we think that all of the matter was created during this time.

86
0:04:45.667,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Both the dark matter

87
0:04:47.875,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and the regular matter that makes up you and me.

88
0:04:52.167,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, let's go a little bit further

89
0:04:54.625,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to a time after the matter was created,

90
0:04:57.125,000 --> 0:04:59,000
after protons and neutrons formed,

91
0:04:59.458,000 --> 0:05:,000
after hydrogen formed,

92
0:05:01.208,000 --> 0:05:05,000
about 400,000 years after the big bang.

93
0:05:05.25,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The universe was hot and dense and really smooth

94
0:05:09.542,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but not perfectly smooth.

95
0:05:12.292,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This image, taken with a space telescope called the Planck satellite,

96
0:05:17.083,000 --> 0:05:19,000
shows us the temperature of the universe

97
0:05:19.583,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in all directions.

98
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And what we see

99
0:05:23.417,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is that there were places that were a little bit hotter

100
0:05:26.458,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and denser than others.

101
0:05:28.875,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The spots in this image

102
0:05:30.583,000 --> 0:05:34,000
represent places where there was more or less mass in the early universe.

103
0:05:37.125,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Those spots got big because of gravity.

104
0:05:41.5,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The universe was expanding and getting less dense overall

105
0:05:45.958,000 --> 0:05:48,000
over the last 13.8 billion years.

106
0:05:49.667,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But gravity worked hard in those spots

107
0:05:52.542,000 --> 0:05:54,000
where there was a little bit more mass

108
0:05:54.708,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and pulled more and more mass into those regions.

109
0:05:59.042,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, all of this is a little hard to imagine,

110
0:06:01.833,000 --> 0:06:04,000
so let me just show you what I am talking about.

111
0:06:05.208,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Those computer models I mentioned allow us to test these ideas,

112
0:06:08.792,000 --> 0:06:09,000
so let's take a look at one of them.

113
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This movie, made by my research group,

114
0:06:14.583,000 --> 0:06:18,000
shows us what happened to the universe after its earliest moments.

115
0:06:20.375,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You see the universe started out pretty smooth,

116
0:06:23.292,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but there were some regions

117
0:06:24.75,000 --> 0:06:27,000
where there was a little bit more material.

118
0:06:27.833,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Gravity turned on and brought more and more mass

119
0:06:31.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
into those spots that started out with a little bit extra.

120
0:06:36.167,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Over time,

121
0:06:37.625,000 --> 0:06:39,000
you get enough stuff in one place

122
0:06:40.5,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that the hydrogen gas,

123
0:06:41.792,000 --> 0:06:44,000
which was initially well mixed with the dark matter,

124
0:06:44.833,000 --> 0:06:45,000
starts to separate from it,

125
0:06:46.667,000 --> 0:06:48,000
cool down, form stars,

126
0:06:49.25,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and you get a small galaxy.

127
0:06:51.708,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Over time, over billions and billions of years,

128
0:06:54.75,000 --> 0:06:56,000
those small galaxies crash into each other

129
0:06:57.208,000 --> 0:07:,000
and merge and grow to become larger galaxies,

130
0:07:00.25,000 --> 0:07:02,000
like our own galaxy, the Milky Way.

131
0:07:03.875,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, what happens if you don't have dark matter?

132
0:07:08.292,000 --> 0:07:09,000
If you don't have dark matter,

133
0:07:10.208,000 --> 0:07:12,000
those spots never get clumpy enough.

134
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It turns out, you need at least a million times the mass of the Sun

135
0:07:19.167,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in one dense region,

136
0:07:20.833,000 --> 0:07:22,000
before you can start forming stars.

137
0:07:23.375,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And without dark matter,

138
0:07:25.042,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you never get enough stuff in one place.

139
0:07:28.833,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So here, we're looking at two universes, side by side.

140
0:07:33.458,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In one of them you can see

141
0:07:35.958,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that things get clumpy quickly.

142
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:4,000
In that universe,

143
0:07:40.292,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it's really easy to form galaxies.

144
0:07:43.458,000 --> 0:07:44,000
In the other universe,

145
0:07:44.958,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the things that start out like small clumps,

146
0:07:47.5,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they just stay really small.

147
0:07:49.417,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Not very much happens.

148
0:07:51.542,000 --> 0:07:54,000
In that universe, you wouldn't get our galaxy.

149
0:07:54.917,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Or any other galaxy.

150
0:07:56.625,000 --> 0:07:57,000
You wouldn't get the Milky Way,

151
0:07:58.5,000 --> 0:07:59,000
you wouldn't get the Sun,

152
0:08:00.333,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you wouldn't get us.

153
0:08:02.083,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We just couldn't exist in that universe.

154
0:08:07.083,000 --> 0:08:1,000
OK, so this crazy stuff, dark matter,

155
0:08:10.417,000 --> 0:08:11,000
it's most of the mass in the universe,

156
0:08:12.251,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it's going through us right now, we wouldn't be here without it.

157
0:08:15.375,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What is it?

158
0:08:17.625,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Well, we have no idea.

159
0:08:18.917,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

160
0:08:21.208,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But we have a lot of educated guesses,

161
0:08:24.292,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and a lot of ideas for how to find out more.

162
0:08:27.583,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So, most physicists think that dark matter is a particle,

163
0:08:32.125,000 --> 0:08:35,000
similar in many ways to the subatomic particles that we know of,

164
0:08:35.208,000 --> 0:08:38,000
like protons and neutrons and electrons.

165
0:08:38.25,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Whatever it is,

166
0:08:39.542,000 --> 0:08:42,000
it behaves very similarly with respect to gravity.

167
0:08:44.333,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But it doesn't emit or absorb light,

168
0:08:47.542,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and it goes right through normal matter,

169
0:08:49.5,000 --> 0:08:5,000
as if it wasn't even there.

170
0:08:52.375,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We'd like to know what particle it is.

171
0:08:54.792,000 --> 0:08:56,000
For example, how heavy is it?

172
0:08:57.292,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Or, does anything at all happen if it interacts with normal matter?

173
0:09:02.375,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Physicists have lots of great ideas for what it could be,

174
0:09:05.208,000 --> 0:09:07,000
they're very creative.

175
0:09:07.25,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But it's really hard,

176
0:09:09.083,000 --> 0:09:12,000
because those ideas span a huge range.

177
0:09:12.792,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It could be as small as the smallest subatomic particles,

178
0:09:16.042,000 --> 0:09:19,000
or it could be as large as the mass of 100 Suns.

179
0:09:20.958,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So, how do we figure out what it is?

180
0:09:24.667,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Well, physicists and astronomers

181
0:09:26.5,000 --> 0:09:29,000
have a lot of ways to look for dark matter.

182
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
One of the things we're doing is building sensitive detectors

183
0:09:34.208,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in deep underground mines,

184
0:09:37.167,000 --> 0:09:39,000
waiting for the possibility

185
0:09:40.042,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that a dark matter particle, which goes through us and the Earth,

186
0:09:43.917,000 --> 0:09:45,000
would hit a denser material

187
0:09:46.25,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and leave behind some trace of its passage.

188
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We're looking for dark matter in the sky,

189
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for the possibility that dark matter particles

190
0:09:55.208,000 --> 0:09:56,000
would crash into each other

191
0:09:56.625,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and create high-energy light that we could see

192
0:09:59.625,000 --> 0:10:01,000
with special gamma-ray telescopes.

193
0:10:02.625,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We're even trying to make dark matter here on Earth,

194
0:10:06.375,000 --> 0:10:1,000
by smashing particles together and looking for what happens,

195
0:10:10.958,000 --> 0:10:13,000
using the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland.

196
0:10:15.083,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, so far,

197
0:10:17.292,000 --> 0:10:2,000
all of these experiments have taught us a lot

198
0:10:20.583,000 --> 0:10:21,000
about what dark matter isn't

199
0:10:22.25,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Laughter)

200
0:10:23.458,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but not yet what it is.

201
0:10:25.875,000 --> 0:10:28,000
There were really good ideas that dark matter could have been,

202
0:10:29.042,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that these experiments would have seen.

203
0:10:31.125,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And they didn't see them yet,

204
0:10:32.542,000 --> 0:10:34,000
so we have to keep looking and thinking harder.

205
0:10:37.458,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now, another way to get a clue to what dark matter is

206
0:10:42.292,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is to study galaxies.

207
0:10:44.583,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We already talked about

208
0:10:46.042,000 --> 0:10:49,000
how our galaxy and many other galaxies wouldn't even be here

209
0:10:49.625,000 --> 0:10:5,000
without dark matter.

210
0:10:51.5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Those models also make predictions

211
0:10:53.875,000 --> 0:10:55,000
for many other things about galaxies:

212
0:10:55.958,000 --> 0:10:56,000
How they're distributed in the universe,

213
0:10:57.887,000 --> 0:10:58,000
how they move,

214
0:10:59.167,000 --> 0:11:01,000
how they evolve over time.

215
0:11:01.208,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And we can test those predictions with observations of the sky.

216
0:11:06.042,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So let me just give you two examples

217
0:11:08.875,000 --> 0:11:11,000
of these kinds of measurements we can make with galaxies.

218
0:11:13.208,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The first is that we can make maps of the universe with galaxies.

219
0:11:18.125,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I am part of a survey called the Dark Energy Survey,

220
0:11:20.875,000 --> 0:11:23,000
which has made the largest map of the universe so far.

221
0:11:25.167,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We measured the positions and shapes of 100 million galaxies

222
0:11:30.625,000 --> 0:11:32,000
over one-eighth of the sky.

223
0:11:34.458,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And this map is showing us all the matter in this region of the sky,

224
0:11:39.917,000 --> 0:11:44,000
which is inferred by the light distorted from these 100 million galaxies.

225
0:11:46.708,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The light distorted from all of the matter

226
0:11:49.792,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that was between those galaxies and us.

227
0:11:54.333,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The gravity of the matter is strong enough to bend the path of light.

228
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And it gives us this image.

229
0:12:04.25,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So these kinds of maps

230
0:12:05.708,000 --> 0:12:08,000
can tell us about how much dark matter there is,

231
0:12:08.792,000 --> 0:12:1,000
they also tell us where it is

232
0:12:11.083,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and how it changes over time.

233
0:12:14.583,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So we're trying to learn about what the universe is made of

234
0:12:18.792,000 --> 0:12:2,000
on the very largest scales.

235
0:12:21.125,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It turns out that the tiniest galaxies in the universe

236
0:12:25.875,000 --> 0:12:28,000
provide some of the best clues.

237
0:12:29.042,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So why is that?

238
0:12:31.375,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Here are two example simulated universes

239
0:12:34.833,000 --> 0:12:36,000
with two different kinds of dark matter.

240
0:12:37.458,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Both of these pictures are showing you a region

241
0:12:39.708,000 --> 0:12:41,000
around a galaxy like the Milky Way.

242
0:12:42.625,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And you can see that there's a lot of other material around it,

243
0:12:45.625,000 --> 0:12:46,000
little small clumps.

244
0:12:47.333,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Now, in the image on the right,

245
0:12:49.542,000 --> 0:12:54,000
dark matter particles are moving slower than they are in the one on the left.

246
0:12:54.75,000 --> 0:12:57,000
If those dark matter particles are moving really fast,

247
0:12:57.875,000 --> 0:12:59,000
then the gravity in small clumps is not strong enough

248
0:13:00.708,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to slow those fast particles down.

249
0:13:03.167,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And they keep going.

250
0:13:04.458,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They never collapse into these small clumps.

251
0:13:06.958,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So you end up with fewer of them than in the universe on the right.

252
0:13:11.75,000 --> 0:13:12,000
If you don't have those small clumps,

253
0:13:13.708,000 --> 0:13:15,000
then you get fewer small galaxies.

254
0:13:18.208,000 --> 0:13:19,000
If you look up at the southern sky,

255
0:13:19.917,000 --> 0:13:22,000
you can actually see two of these small galaxies,

256
0:13:23.292,000 --> 0:13:26,000
the largest of the small galaxies that are orbiting our Milky Way,

257
0:13:26.792,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud.

258
0:13:30.958,000 --> 0:13:31,000
In the last several years,

259
0:13:32.25,000 --> 0:13:35,000
we have detected a whole bunch more even smaller galaxies.

260
0:13:35.625,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This is an example of one of them

261
0:13:37.458,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that we detected with the same dark energy survey

262
0:13:40.417,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that we used to make maps of the universe.

263
0:13:43.542,000 --> 0:13:45,000
These really small galaxies,

264
0:13:45.792,000 --> 0:13:46,000
some of them are extremely small.

265
0:13:48.458,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Some of them have as few as a few hundred stars,

266
0:13:51.417,000 --> 0:13:54,000
compared to the few hundred billion stars in our Milky Way.

267
0:13:55.083,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So that makes them really hard to find.

268
0:13:57.917,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But in the last decade,

269
0:13:59.833,000 --> 0:14:01,000
we've actually found a whole bunch more of these.

270
0:14:02.542,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We now know of 60 of these tiny galaxies

271
0:14:05.292,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that are orbiting our own Milky Way.

272
0:14:08.333,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And these little guys are a big clue to dark matter.

273
0:14:12.833,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Because just the existence of these galaxies tells us

274
0:14:16.667,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that dark matter can't be moving very fast,

275
0:14:19.5,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and not much can be happening when it runs into normal matter.

276
0:14:24.583,000 --> 0:14:25,000
In the next several years,

277
0:14:26.042,000 --> 0:14:29,000
we're going to make much more precise maps of the sky.

278
0:14:31.292,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And those will help refine our movies

279
0:14:33.75,000 --> 0:14:36,000
of the whole universe and the entire galaxy.

280
0:14:37.708,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Physicists are also making new, more sensitive experiments

281
0:14:41.792,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to try to catch some sign of dark matter in their laboratories.

282
0:14:47.042,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Dark matter is still a huge mystery.

283
0:14:50.333,000 --> 0:14:53,000
But it's a really exciting time to be working on it.

284
0:14:54.75,000 --> 0:14:56,000
We have really clear evidence it exists.

285
0:14:57.125,000 --> 0:14:59,000
From the scale of the smallest galaxies

286
0:14:59.542,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to the scale of the whole universe.

287
0:15:03.458,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Will we actually find it and figure out what it is?

288
0:15:08.542,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I have no idea.

289
0:15:10.333,000 --> 0:15:12,000
But it's going to be a lot of fun to find out.

290
0:15:13.292,000 --> 0:15:15,000
We have a lot of possibilities for discovery,

291
0:15:15.708,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and we definitely will learn more about what it is doing

292
0:15:19.208,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and about what it isn't.

293
0:15:21.833,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Regardless of whether we find that particle anytime soon,

294
0:15:24.917,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I hope I have convinced you

295
0:15:26.667,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that this mystery is actually really close to home.

296
0:15:30.75,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The search for dark matter

297
0:15:32.292,000 --> 0:15:35,000
may just be the key to a whole new understanding of physics

298
0:15:35.625,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and our place in the universe.

299
0:15:37.5,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Thank you.

300
0:15:38.792,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Applause)

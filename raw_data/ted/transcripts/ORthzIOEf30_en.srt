1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Chris Anderson: So Robert spent the last few years

2
0:00:15.3,000 --> 0:00:17,000
think about how weird human behavior is,

3
0:00:17.66,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and how inadequate most of our language trying to explain it is.

4
0:00:21.9,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And it's very exciting to hear him explain some of the thinking behind it

5
0:00:26.3,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in public for the first time.

6
0:00:27.98,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky.

7
0:00:30.1,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Applause)

8
0:00:34.86,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.

9
0:00:36.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The fantasy always runs something like this.

10
0:00:39.78,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I've overpowered his elite guard,

11
0:00:41.98,000 --> 0:00:42,000
burst into his secret bunker

12
0:00:43.939,000 --> 0:00:44,000
with my machine gun ready.

13
0:00:45.78,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He lunges for his Luger.

14
0:00:47.7,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I knock it out of his hand.

15
0:00:49.54,000 --> 0:00:51,000
He lunges for his cyanide pill.

16
0:00:51.9,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I knock that out of his hand.

17
0:00:53.66,000 --> 0:00:54,000
He snarls,

18
0:00:54.98,000 --> 0:00:56,000
comes at me with otherworldly strength.

19
0:00:57.22,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We grapple, we fight,

20
0:00:58.94,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I manage to pin him down

21
0:01:00.86,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and put on handcuffs.

22
0:01:03.3,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"Adolf Hitler," I say,

23
0:01:05.34,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"I arrest you for crimes against humanity."

24
0:01:09.82,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Here's where the Medal of Honor version of the fantasy ends

25
0:01:12.82,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the imagery darkens.

26
0:01:14.7,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What would I do if I had Hitler?

27
0:01:16.98,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's not hard to imagine once I allow myself.

28
0:01:20.54,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Sever his spine at the neck.

29
0:01:22.7,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.

30
0:01:25.1,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.

31
0:01:27.9,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Leave him alive on a respirator,

32
0:01:30.06,000 --> 0:01:35,000
tube-fed, not able to speak or move or see or hear, just to feel,

33
0:01:35.38,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and then inject him with something cancerous

34
0:01:38.66,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that's going to fester and pustulate

35
0:01:40.94,000 --> 0:01:43,000
until every cell in his body is screaming in agony,

36
0:01:44.9,000 --> 0:01:47,000
until every second feels like an eternity in hell.

37
0:01:49.5,000 --> 0:01:5,000
That's what I would do to Hitler.

38
0:01:53.74,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,

39
0:01:55.78,000 --> 0:01:56,000
still do sometimes,

40
0:01:57.3,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and when I do, my heart speeds up --

41
0:01:59.98,000 --> 0:02:03,000
all these plans for the most evil, wicked soul in history.

42
0:02:05.66,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But there's a problem,

43
0:02:06.94,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which is I don't actually believe in souls or evil,

44
0:02:09.86,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and I think wicked belongs in a musical.

45
0:02:12.42,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But there's some people I would like to see killed,

46
0:02:14.86,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but I'm against the death penalty.

47
0:02:16.7,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But I like schlocky violent movies,

48
0:02:18.82,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but I'm for strict gun control.

49
0:02:20.62,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But then there was a time I was at a laser tag place,

50
0:02:23.7,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and I had such a good time hiding in a corner shooting at people.

51
0:02:28.18,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In other words, I'm your basic confused human when it comes to violence.

52
0:02:33.58,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, as a species, we obviously have problems with violence.

53
0:02:36.94,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,

54
0:02:40.02,000 --> 0:02:43,000
letters with anthrax, airplanes as weapons,

55
0:02:43.14,000 --> 0:02:44,000
mass rape as a military strategy.

56
0:02:45.02,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We're a miserably violent species.

57
0:02:47.74,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But there's a complication,

58
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
which is we don't hate violence,

59
0:02:51.66,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we hate the wrong kind.

60
0:02:53.54,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And when it's the right kind,

61
0:02:55.02,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we cheer it on, we hand out medals,

62
0:02:57.54,000 --> 0:03:,000
we vote for, we mate with our champions of it.

63
0:03:00.7,000 --> 0:03:01,000
When it's the right kind of violence,

64
0:03:02.54,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we love it.

65
0:03:04.34,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And there's another complication,

66
0:03:06.02,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which is, in addition to us being this miserably violent species,

67
0:03:10.1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we're also this extraordinarily altruistic, compassionate one.

68
0:03:15.34,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So how do you make sense of the biology of our best behaviors,

69
0:03:18.66,000 --> 0:03:22,000
our worst ones and all of those ambiguously in between?

70
0:03:22.7,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, for starters,

71
0:03:23.98,000 --> 0:03:27,000
what's totally boring is understanding the motoric aspects of the behavior.

72
0:03:28.3,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Your brain tells your spine, tells your muscles

73
0:03:31.5,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to do something or other,

74
0:03:32.78,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and hooray, you've behaved.

75
0:03:34.74,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What's hard is understanding the meaning of the behavior,

76
0:03:38.42,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because in some settings, pulling a trigger is an appalling act;

77
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in others, it's heroically self-sacrificial.

78
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
In some settings, putting your hand one someone else's

79
0:03:48.22,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is deeply compassionate.

80
0:03:49.7,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In others, it's a deep betrayal.

81
0:03:51.62,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The challenge is to understand

82
0:03:53.18,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the biology of the context of our behaviors,

83
0:03:56.46,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and that's real tough.

84
0:03:58.86,000 --> 0:04:01,000
One thing that's clear, though, is you're not going to get anywhere

85
0:04:02.06,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if you think there's going to be the brain region or the hormone

86
0:04:06.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
or the gene or the childhood experience

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or the evolutionary mechanism that explains everything.

88
0:04:12.86,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Instead, every bit of behavior has multiple levels of causality.

89
0:04:18.62,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Let's look at an example.

90
0:04:20.66,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You have a gun.

91
0:04:22.54,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There's a crisis going on:

92
0:04:24.14,000 --> 0:04:26,000
rioting, violence, people running around.

93
0:04:26.74,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A stranger is running at you in an agitated state --

94
0:04:29.94,000 --> 0:04:34,000
you can't quite tell if the expression is frightened, threatening, angry --

95
0:04:35.06,000 --> 0:04:38,000
holding something that kind of looks like a handgun.

96
0:04:38.3,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You're not sure.

97
0:04:39.54,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The stranger comes running at you

98
0:04:41.46,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and you pull the trigger.

99
0:04:43.22,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And it turns out that thing in this person's hand

100
0:04:46.18,000 --> 0:04:47,000
was a cell phone.

101
0:04:48.02,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So we asked this biological question:

102
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
what was going on that caused this behavior?

103
0:04:53.46,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What caused this behavior?

104
0:04:55.38,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And this is a multitude of questions.

105
0:04:57.7,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We start.

106
0:04:58.94,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What was going on in your brain one second before you pulled that trigger?

107
0:05:03.38,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And this brings us into the realm of a brain region called the amygdala.

108
0:05:07.1,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The amygdala, which is central to violence, central to fear,

109
0:05:11.06,000 --> 0:05:13,000
initiates volleys of cascades

110
0:05:13.78,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that produce pulling of a trigger.

111
0:05:16.06,000 --> 0:05:19,000
What was the level of activity in your amygdala one second before?

112
0:05:20.7,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But to understand that, we have to step back a little bit.

113
0:05:24.1,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What was going on in the environment seconds to minutes before

114
0:05:27.7,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that impacted the amygdala?

115
0:05:29.46,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, obviously, the sights, the sounds of the rioting,

116
0:05:32.58,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that was pertinent.

117
0:05:33.82,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But in addition,

118
0:05:35.06,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you're more likely to mistake a cell phone for a handgun

119
0:05:38.54,000 --> 0:05:4,000
if that stranger was male

120
0:05:40.82,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and large and of a different race.

121
0:05:44.18,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Furthermore, if you're in pain,

122
0:05:46.34,000 --> 0:05:48,000
if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,

123
0:05:48.54,000 --> 0:05:5,000
your frontal cortex is not going to work as well,

124
0:05:51.1,000 --> 0:05:54,000
part of the brain whose job it is to get to the amygdala in time

125
0:05:54.78,000 --> 0:05:57,000
saying, "Are you really sure that's a gun there?"

126
0:05:58.62,000 --> 0:06:,000
But we need to step further back.

127
0:06:00.78,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now we have to look at hours to days before,

128
0:06:03.98,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and with this, we have entered the realm of hormones.

129
0:06:06.98,000 --> 0:06:08,000
For example, testosterone,

130
0:06:09.14,000 --> 0:06:1,000
where regardless of your sex,

131
0:06:10.9,000 --> 0:06:12,000
if you have elevated testosterone levels in your blood,

132
0:06:13.78,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you're more likely to think a face with a neutral expression

133
0:06:17.18,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is instead looking threatening.

134
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Elevated testosterone levels, elevated levels of stress hormones,

135
0:06:23.14,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and your amygdala is going to be more active

136
0:06:25.46,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and your frontal cortex will be more sluggish.

137
0:06:29.02,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Pushing back further, weeks to months before,

138
0:06:31.9,000 --> 0:06:32,000
where's the relevance there?

139
0:06:33.38,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is the realm of neural plasticity,

140
0:06:35.94,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the fact that your brain can change in response to experience,

141
0:06:39.9,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and if your previous months have been filled with stress and trauma,

142
0:06:44.1,000 --> 0:06:45,000
your amygdala will have enlarged.

143
0:06:45.98,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The neurons will have become more excitable,

144
0:06:48.22,000 --> 0:06:5,000
your frontal cortex would have atrophied,

145
0:06:50.58,000 --> 0:06:52,000
all relevant to what happens in that one second.

146
0:06:54.14,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But we push back even more, back years,

147
0:06:56.82,000 --> 0:06:58,000
back, for example, to your adolescence.

148
0:06:59.34,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Now, the central fact of the adolescent brain

149
0:07:01.86,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is all of it is going full blast

150
0:07:04.62,000 --> 0:07:05,000
except the frontal cortex,

151
0:07:06.34,000 --> 0:07:07,000
which is still half-baked.

152
0:07:08.1,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It doesn't fully mature until you're around 25.

153
0:07:11.3,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And thus, adolescence and early adulthood

154
0:07:14.54,000 --> 0:07:19,000
are the years where environment and experience sculpt your frontal cortex

155
0:07:19.7,000 --> 0:07:22,000
into the version you're going to have as an adult in that critical moment.

156
0:07:24.62,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But pushing back even further,

157
0:07:26.42,000 --> 0:07:29,000
even further back to childhood and fetal life

158
0:07:29.9,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and all the different versions that that could come in.

159
0:07:32.74,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, obviously, that's the time that your brain is being constructed,

160
0:07:36.02,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and that's important,

161
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but in addition, experience during those times

162
0:07:40.58,000 --> 0:07:42,000
produce what are called epigenetic changes,

163
0:07:43.58,000 --> 0:07:44,000
permanent, in some cases,

164
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
permanently activating certain genes, turning off others.

165
0:07:49.62,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And as an example of this,

166
0:07:51.14,000 --> 0:07:56,000
if as a fetus you were exposed to a lot of stress hormones through your mother,

167
0:07:56.18,000 --> 0:07:59,000
epigenetics is going to produce your amygdala in adulthood

168
0:07:59.62,000 --> 0:08:,000
as a more excitable form,

169
0:08:01.58,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and you're going to have elevated stress hormone levels.

170
0:08:04.78,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But pushing even further back,

171
0:08:06.7,000 --> 0:08:07,000
back to when you were just a fetus,

172
0:08:08.42,000 --> 0:08:1,000
back to when all you were was a collection of genes.

173
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, genes are really important to all of this,

174
0:08:13.66,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but critically, genes don't determine anything,

175
0:08:16.42,000 --> 0:08:19,000
because genes work differently in different environments.

176
0:08:20.46,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Key example here:

177
0:08:21.74,000 --> 0:08:24,000
there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,

178
0:08:24.9,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and if you have that variant,

179
0:08:26.58,000 --> 0:08:3,000
you are far more likely to commit antisocial violence

180
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
if, and only if, you were abused as a child.

181
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Genes and environment interact,

182
0:08:37.66,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and what's happening in that one second before you pull that trigger

183
0:08:41.3,000 --> 0:08:45,000
reflects your lifetime of those gene-environment interactions.

184
0:08:46.499,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Now, remarkably enough, we've got to push even further back now,

185
0:08:50.14,000 --> 0:08:51,000
back centuries.

186
0:08:51.54,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What were your ancestors up to.

187
0:08:53.9,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And if, for example, they were nomadic pastoralists,

188
0:08:57.1,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they were pastoralists,

189
0:08:58.38,000 --> 0:09:,000
people living in deserts or grasslands

190
0:09:00.98,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with their herds of camels, cows, goats,

191
0:09:03.66,000 --> 0:09:07,000
odds are they would have invented what's called a culture of honor

192
0:09:07.74,000 --> 0:09:09,000
filled with warrior classes,

193
0:09:09.98,000 --> 0:09:11,000
retributive violence, clan vendettas,

194
0:09:12.7,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and amazingly, centuries later,

195
0:09:14.98,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that would still be influencing the values with which you were raised.

196
0:09:19.62,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But we've got to push even further back,

197
0:09:21.78,000 --> 0:09:22,000
back millions of years,

198
0:09:23.54,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because if we're talking about genes,

199
0:09:25.62,000 --> 0:09:28,000
implicitly we're now talking about the evolution of genes.

200
0:09:29.3,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And what you see is, for example,

201
0:09:31.54,000 --> 0:09:33,000
patterns across different primate species.

202
0:09:34.06,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Some of them have evolved for extremely low levels of aggression,

203
0:09:38.5,000 --> 0:09:4,000
others have evolved in the opposite direction,

204
0:09:41.06,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and floating there in between by every measure are humans,

205
0:09:44.98,000 --> 0:09:47,000
once again this confused, barely defined species

206
0:09:48.9,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that has all these potentials to go one way or the other.

207
0:09:53.38,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So what has this gotten us to?

208
0:09:55.22,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Basically, what we're seeing here is,

209
0:09:57.22,000 --> 0:09:58,000
if you want to understand a behavior,

210
0:09:59.14,000 --> 0:10:01,000
whether it's an appalling one, a wondrous one,

211
0:10:02.02,000 --> 0:10:03,000
or confusedly in between,

212
0:10:03.78,000 --> 0:10:04,000
if you want to understand that,

213
0:10:05.34,000 --> 0:10:08,000
you've got take into account what happened a second before

214
0:10:08.82,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to a million years before,

215
0:10:10.3,000 --> 0:10:11,000
everything in between.

216
0:10:11.98,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So what can we conclude at this point?

217
0:10:13.98,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Officially, it's complicated.

218
0:10:16.3,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Wow, that's really helpful.

219
0:10:17.94,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It's complicated,

220
0:10:19.22,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and you'd better be real careful, real cautious

221
0:10:22.82,000 --> 0:10:25,000
before you conclude you know what causes a behavior,

222
0:10:26.18,000 --> 0:10:28,000
especially if it's a behavior you're judging harshly.

223
0:10:30.42,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Now, to me, the single most important point about all of this

224
0:10:34.42,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is one having to do with change.

225
0:10:36.82,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Every bit of biology I have mentioned here can change in different circumstances.

226
0:10:43.22,000 --> 0:10:45,000
For example, ecosystems change.

227
0:10:46.06,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Thousands of years ago, the Sahara was a lush grassland.

228
0:10:50.5,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Cultures change.

229
0:10:52.14,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In the 17th century, the most terrifying people in Europe were the Swedes,

230
0:10:56.5,000 --> 0:10:57,000
rampaging all over the place.

231
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
This is what the Swedish military does now.

232
0:11:00.46,000 --> 0:11:01,000
They haven't had a war in 200 years.

233
0:11:03.1,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Most importantly,

234
0:11:04.58,000 --> 0:11:05,000
brains change.

235
0:11:06.22,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Neurons grow new processes.

236
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Circuits disconnect.

237
0:11:09.74,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Everything in the brain changes,

238
0:11:11.42,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and out of this come extraordinary examples of human change.

239
0:11:17.22,000 --> 0:11:18,000
First one:

240
0:11:18.86,000 --> 0:11:19,000
this is a man named John Newton,

241
0:11:20.58,000 --> 0:11:21,000
a British theologian

242
0:11:21.94,000 --> 0:11:25,000
who played a central role in the abolition of slavery from the British Empire

243
0:11:26.7,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in the early 1800s.

244
0:11:28.74,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And amazingly, this man spent decades as a younger man

245
0:11:33.5,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as the captain of a slave ship,

246
0:11:35.66,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and then as an investor in slavery,

247
0:11:38.62,000 --> 0:11:4,000
growing rich from this.

248
0:11:40.78,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And then something changed.

249
0:11:43.46,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Something changed in him,

250
0:11:45.02,000 --> 0:11:5,000
something that Newton himself celebrated in the thing that he's most famous for,

251
0:11:50.3,000 --> 0:11:51,000
a hymn that he wrote:

252
0:11:51.94,000 --> 0:11:52,000
"Amazing Grace."

253
0:11:54.86,000 --> 0:11:58,000
This is a man named Zenji Abe on the morning of December 6, 1941,

254
0:11:59.78,000 --> 0:12:03,000
about to lead a squadron of Japanese bombers to attack Pearl Harbor.

255
0:12:04.78,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And this is the same man 50 years later to the day

256
0:12:08.34,000 --> 0:12:11,000
hugging a man who survived the attack on the ground.

257
0:12:11.94,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And as an old man,

258
0:12:13.38,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Zenji Abe came to a collection of Pearl Harbor survivors

259
0:12:17.82,000 --> 0:12:18,000
at a ceremony there

260
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and in halting English apologized for what he had done as a young man.

261
0:12:24.58,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Now, it doesn't always require decades.

262
0:12:26.5,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Sometimes, extraordinary change could happen in just hours.

263
0:12:30.22,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Consider the World War I Christmas truce of 1914.

264
0:12:34.62,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The powers that be had negotiated a brief truce

265
0:12:37.78,000 --> 0:12:38,000
so that soldiers could go out,

266
0:12:39.42,000 --> 0:12:42,000
collect bodies from no-man's-land in between the trench lines.

267
0:12:43.34,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And soon British and German soldiers

268
0:12:46.3,000 --> 0:12:47,000
were doing that,

269
0:12:47.78,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and then helping each other carry bodies,

270
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and then helping each other dig graves in the frozen ground,

271
0:12:53.94,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and then praying together,

272
0:12:55.22,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and then having Christmas together and exchanging gifts,

273
0:12:58.06,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and by the next day, they were playing soccer together

274
0:13:01.3,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and exchanging addresses so they could meet after the war.

275
0:13:04.7,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That truce kept going until the officers had to arrive

276
0:13:08.7,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and said, "We will shoot you

277
0:13:10.22,000 --> 0:13:12,000
unless you go back to trying to kill each other."

278
0:13:12.74,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And all it took here was hours

279
0:13:14.9,000 --> 0:13:18,000
for these men to develop a completely new category of "us,"

280
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
all of us in the trenches here

281
0:13:21.18,000 --> 0:13:23,000
on both sides, dying for no damn reason,

282
0:13:23.98,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and who is a "them," those faceless powers behind the lines

283
0:13:27.66,000 --> 0:13:28,000
who were using them as pawns.

284
0:13:30.5,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And sometimes, change can occur in seconds.

285
0:13:34.54,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Probably the most horrifying event in the Vietnam War

286
0:13:37.9,000 --> 0:13:38,000
was the My Lai Massacre.

287
0:13:39.82,000 --> 0:13:41,000
A brigade of American soldiers

288
0:13:41.86,000 --> 0:13:44,000
went into an undefended village full of civilians

289
0:13:44.9,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and killed between 350 and 500 of them,

290
0:13:48.46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
mass-raped women and children,

291
0:13:51.34,000 --> 0:13:52,000
mutilated bodies.

292
0:13:52.94,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It was appalling.

293
0:13:54.18,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It was appalling because it occurred, because the government denied it,

294
0:13:58.46,000 --> 0:14:02,000
because the US government eventually did nothing more than a slap on the wrist,

295
0:14:02.86,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and appalling because it almost certainly was not a singular event.

296
0:14:07.14,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man who stopped the My Lai Massacre.

297
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
He was piloting a helicopter gunship,

298
0:14:14.9,000 --> 0:14:15,000
landed there, got out

299
0:14:16.74,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and saw American soldiers shooting babies,

300
0:14:19.82,000 --> 0:14:2,000
shooting old women,

301
0:14:21.22,000 --> 0:14:22,000
figured out what was going on,

302
0:14:23.14,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and he then took his helicopter

303
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and did something that undid his lifetime of conditioning

304
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
as to who is an "us" and who is a "them."

305
0:14:31.34,000 --> 0:14:32,000
He landed his helicopter

306
0:14:33.22,000 --> 0:14:36,000
in between some surviving villagers and American soldiers

307
0:14:36.86,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and he trained his machine guns on his fellow Americans,

308
0:14:40.54,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and said, "If you don't stop the killing, I will mow you down."

309
0:14:46.38,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Now, these people are no more special than any of us.

310
0:14:49.38,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Same neurons, same neurochemicals,

311
0:14:51.98,000 --> 0:14:52,000
same biology.

312
0:14:54.22,000 --> 0:14:57,000
What we're left with here is this inevitable cliche:

313
0:14:57.62,000 --> 0:14:59,000
"Those who don't study history are destined to repeat it."

314
0:15:00.38,000 --> 0:15:02,000
What we have here is the opposite of it.

315
0:15:02.58,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Those who don't study the history of extraordinary human change,

316
0:15:06.86,000 --> 0:15:09,000
those who don't study the biology of what can transform us

317
0:15:10.42,000 --> 0:15:12,000
from our worst to our best behaviors,

318
0:15:12.94,000 --> 0:15:15,000
those who don't do this are destined not to be able

319
0:15:16.02,000 --> 0:15:19,000
to repeat these incandescent, magnificent moments.

320
0:15:20.3,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So thank you.

321
0:15:21.86,000 --> 0:15:25,000

323
0:15:35.38,000 --> 0:15:36,000
those are some of my favorite TED Talks,

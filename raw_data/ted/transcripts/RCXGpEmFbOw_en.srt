1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:13,000
What started as a platform for hobbyists

2
0:00:14.92,000 --> 0:00:16,000
is poised to become a multibillion-dollar industry.

3
0:00:17.88,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Inspection, environmental monitoring, photography and film and journalism:

4
0:00:21.96,000 --> 0:00:24,000
these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones,

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and their enablers are the capabilities being developed

6
0:00:27.8,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at research facilities around the world.

7
0:00:29.76,000 --> 0:00:31,000
For example, before aerial package delivery

8
0:00:32.4,000 --> 0:00:33,000
entered our social consciousness,

9
0:00:34.24,000 --> 0:00:37,000
an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-meter-tall tower

10
0:00:38.24,000 --> 0:00:39,000
composed of 1,500 bricks

11
0:00:40.2,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in front of a live audience at the FRAC Centre in France,

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and several years ago, they started to fly with ropes.

13
0:00:45.76,000 --> 0:00:46,000
By tethering flying machines,

14
0:00:47.2,000 --> 0:00:5,000
they can achieve high speeds and accelerations in very tight spaces.

15
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
They can also autonomously build tensile structures.

16
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Skills learned include how to carry loads,

17
0:00:56.56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
how to cope with disturbances,

18
0:00:58.04,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and in general, how to interact with the physical world.

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Today we want to show you some new projects that we've been working on.

20
0:01:04.52,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Their aim is to push the boundary of what can be achieved

21
0:01:07.48,000 --> 0:01:08,000
with autonomous flight.

22
0:01:09.04,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now, for a system to function autonomously,

23
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it must collectively know the location of its mobile objects in space.

24
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Back at our lab at ETH Zurich,

25
0:01:17.92,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we often use external cameras to locate objects,

26
0:01:20.8,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which then allows us to focus our efforts

27
0:01:22.8,000 --> 0:01:24,000
on the rapid development of highly dynamic tasks.

28
0:01:25.48,000 --> 0:01:27,000
For the demos you will see today, however,

29
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we will use new localization technology developed by Verity Studios,

30
0:01:30.88,000 --> 0:01:31,000
a spin-off from our lab.

31
0:01:32.52,000 --> 0:01:33,000
There are no external cameras.

32
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Each flying machine uses onboard sensors to determine its location in space

33
0:01:39.24,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and onboard computation to determine what its actions should be.

34
0:01:43.28,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The only external commands are high-level ones

35
0:01:45.48,000 --> 0:01:46,000
such as "take off" and "land."

36
0:02:10.56,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is a so-called tail-sitter.

37
0:02:12.48,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's an aircraft that tries to have its cake and eat it.

38
0:02:15.96,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight,

39
0:02:19.24,000 --> 0:02:22,000
much more so than helicopters and variations thereof.

40
0:02:22.479,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Unlike most other fixed-wing aircraft, however,

41
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it is capable of hovering,

42
0:02:26.44,000 --> 0:02:29,000
which has huge advantages for takeoff, landing

43
0:02:29.6,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and general versatility.

44
0:02:31.48,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There is no free lunch, unfortunately.

45
0:02:33.6,000 --> 0:02:34,000
One of the limitations with tail-sitters

46
0:02:35.56,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is that they're susceptible to disturbances such as wind gusts.

47
0:02:38.56,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We're developing new control architectures and algorithms

48
0:02:41.28,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that address this limitation.

49
0:02:50.56,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The idea is for the aircraft to recover

50
0:02:52.84,000 --> 0:02:54,000
no matter what state it finds itself in,

51
0:03:03.4,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and through practice, improve its performance over time.

52
0:03:15.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Applause)

53
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:23,000
OK.

54
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
When doing research,

55
0:03:34.72,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions

56
0:03:37.72,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that try to get at the heart of a matter.

57
0:03:41.24,000 --> 0:03:43,000
For example, one such question would be,

58
0:03:43.48,000 --> 0:03:47,000
what is the minimum number of moving parts needed for controlled flight?

59
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, there are practical reasons

60
0:03:49.12,000 --> 0:03:51,000
why you may want to know the answer to such a question.

61
0:03:51.76,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Helicopters, for example,

62
0:03:53.04,000 --> 0:03:56,000
are affectionately known as machines with a thousand moving parts

63
0:03:56.92,000 --> 0:03:58,000
all conspiring to do you bodily harm.

64
0:04:00.64,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It turns out that decades ago,

65
0:04:02.52,000 --> 0:04:05,000
skilled pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft

66
0:04:05.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that had only two moving parts:

67
0:04:07.64,000 --> 0:04:08,000
a propeller and a tail rudder.

68
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We recently discovered that it could be done with just one.

69
0:04:13.6,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This is the monospinner,

70
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the world's mechanically simplest controllable flying machine,

71
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
invented just a few months ago.

72
0:04:19.96,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It has only one moving part, a propeller.

73
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It has no flaps, no hinges, no ailerons,

74
0:04:26.72,000 --> 0:04:28,000
no other actuators, no other control surfaces,

75
0:04:29.279,000 --> 0:04:3,000
just a simple propeller.

76
0:04:31.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Even though it's mechanically simple,

77
0:04:33.399,000 --> 0:04:35,000
there's a lot going on in its little electronic brain

78
0:04:35.92,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to allow it to fly in a stable fashion and to move anywhere it wants in space.

79
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Even so, it doesn't yet have

80
0:04:41.64,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the sophisticated algorithms of the tail-sitter,

81
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which means that in order to get it to fly,

82
0:04:46.024,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I have to throw it just right.

83
0:04:48.8,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And because the probability of me throwing it just right is very low,

84
0:04:52.84,000 --> 0:04:53,000
given everybody watching me,

85
0:04:54.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
what we're going to do instead

86
0:04:56.24,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is show you a video that we shot last night.

87
0:04:58.44,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:10.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Applause)

89
0:05:23.08,000 --> 0:05:26,000
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality,

90
0:05:26.84,000 --> 0:05:29,000
this machine here, the omnicopter, with its eight propellers,

91
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is an exercise in excess.

92
0:05:32.92,000 --> 0:05:34,000
What can you do with all this surplus?

93
0:05:35.08,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The thing to notice is that it is highly symmetric.

94
0:05:37.92,000 --> 0:05:39,000
As a result, it is ambivalent to orientation.

95
0:05:40.8,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This gives it an extraordinary capability.

96
0:05:43.52,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It can move anywhere it wants in space

97
0:05:45.76,000 --> 0:05:47,000
irrespective of where it is facing

98
0:05:48.52,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and even of how it is rotating.

99
0:05:51.04,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It has its own complexities,

100
0:05:52.44,000 --> 0:05:54,000
mainly having to do with the interacting flows

101
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
from its eight propellers.

102
0:05:56.68,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Some of this can be modeled, while the rest can be learned on the fly.

103
0:06:00.56,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Let's take a look.

104
0:06:44.76,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Applause)

105
0:06:52.72,000 --> 0:06:54,000
If flying machines are going to enter part of our daily lives,

106
0:06:55.649,000 --> 0:06:57,000
they will need to become extremely safe and reliable.

107
0:06:58.76,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This machine over here

108
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is actually two separate two-propeller flying machines.

109
0:07:03.32,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This one wants to spin clockwise.

110
0:07:05.08,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This other one wants to spin counterclockwise.

111
0:07:07.6,000 --> 0:07:08,000
When you put them together,

112
0:07:08.96,000 --> 0:07:1,000
they behave like one high-performance quadrocopter.

113
0:07:23.64,000 --> 0:07:24,000
If anything goes wrong, however --

114
0:07:25.32,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a motor fails, a propeller fails, electronics, even a battery pack --

115
0:07:29.8,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the machine can still fly, albeit in a degraded fashion.

116
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We're going to demonstrate this to you now by disabling one of its halves.

117
0:07:56.24,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Applause)

118
0:08:03.32,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This last demonstration

119
0:08:04.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is an exploration of synthetic swarms.

120
0:08:07.56,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The large number of autonomous, coordinated entities

121
0:08:10.56,000 --> 0:08:12,000
offers a new palette for aesthetic expression.

122
0:08:13.32,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We've taken commercially available micro quadcopters,

123
0:08:16.32,000 --> 0:08:18,000
each weighing less than a slice of bread, by the way,

124
0:08:18.84,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and outfitted them with our localization technology

125
0:08:21.28,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and custom algorithms.

126
0:08:22.88,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Because each unit knows where it is in space

127
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and is self-controlled,

128
0:08:26.4,000 --> 0:08:28,000
there is really no limit to their number.

129
0:08:55.84,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause)

130
0:09:19.36,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

131
0:10:18.04,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

132
0:10:35.96,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to dream up

133
0:10:39.08,000 --> 0:10:41,000
new revolutionary roles for flying machines.

134
0:10:42.56,000 --> 0:10:44,000
That ultrasafe one over there for example

135
0:10:44.68,000 --> 0:10:47,000
has aspirations to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.

136
0:10:47.72,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Laughter)

137
0:10:49.8,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The reality is that it is difficult to predict

138
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:53,000
the impact of nascent technology.

139
0:10:54.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And for folks like us, the real reward is the journey and the act of creation.

140
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:,000
It's a continual reminder

141
0:11:00.44,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of how wonderful and magical the universe we live in is,

142
0:11:03.84,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that it allows creative, clever creatures

143
0:11:06.8,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to sculpt it in such spectacular ways.

144
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The fact that this technology

145
0:11:11.6,000 --> 0:11:14,000
has such huge commercial and economic potential

146
0:11:15.04,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is just icing on the cake.

147
0:11:16.48,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Thank you.

148
0:11:17.72,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.071,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How can landscapes imbue memory?

2
0:00:16.933,000 --> 0:00:2,000
When we think about this notion "e pluribus unum" --

3
0:00:21.25,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"out of many, one,"

4
0:00:23.579,000 --> 0:00:25,000
it's a pretty strange concept, right?

5
0:00:26.011,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I mean, with all different races and cultures of people,

6
0:00:29.719,000 --> 0:00:31,000
how do you boil it down to one thing?

7
0:00:33.019,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I want to share with you today this idea of "e pluribus unum"

8
0:00:37.792,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and how our landscape might imbue those memories of diverse perspectives,

9
0:00:44.472,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as well as force us to stop trying to narrow things down

10
0:00:50.544,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to a single, clean set of identities.

11
0:00:54.614,000 --> 0:00:56,000
As an educator, designer,

12
0:00:57.695,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'd like to share with you five simple concepts

13
0:01:01.163,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that I've developed through my work.

14
0:01:03.293,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I'd like to share with you five projects

15
0:01:06.529,000 --> 0:01:1,000
where we can begin to see how the memory around us,

16
0:01:10.78,000 --> 0:01:12,000
where things have happened,

17
0:01:12.949,000 --> 0:01:17,000
can actually force us to look at one another in a different way.

18
0:01:18.002,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And lastly: this is not just an American motto anymore.

19
0:01:22.158,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I think e pluribus unum is global.

20
0:01:24.835,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We're in this thing together.

21
0:01:28.069,000 --> 0:01:32,000
First, great things happen when we exist in each other's world --

22
0:01:32.556,000 --> 0:01:33,000
like today, right?

23
0:01:36.127,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The world of community gardens --

24
0:01:37.886,000 --> 0:01:39,000
most of you have probably seen a community garden.

25
0:01:40.282,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They're all about subsistence and food. Right?

26
0:01:43.589,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'll tell you a little story,

27
0:01:45.079,000 --> 0:01:47,000
what happened in New York more than a decade ago.

28
0:01:47.477,000 --> 0:01:49,000
They tried to sell all of their community gardens,

29
0:01:50.058,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and Bette Midler developed a nonprofit, the New York Restoration Project.

30
0:01:54.718,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They literally brought all the gardens

31
0:01:57.485,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and decided to save them.

32
0:01:59.28,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And then they had another novel idea:

33
0:02:01.813,000 --> 0:02:04,000
let's bring in world-class designers

34
0:02:05.245,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and let them go out into communities and make these beautiful gardens,

35
0:02:08.608,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and maybe they might not just be about food.

36
0:02:11.929,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And so they called me,

37
0:02:14.221,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I designed one in Jamaica, Queens.

38
0:02:16.855,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And on the way to designing this garden,

39
0:02:19.192,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I went to the New York Restoration Project Office,

40
0:02:21.955,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and I noticed a familiar name on the door downstairs.

41
0:02:25.338,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I go upstairs, and I said,

42
0:02:27.131,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"Do you guys know who is downstairs?"

43
0:02:29.407,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And they said, "Gunit."

44
0:02:31.666,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And I said, "Gunit?

45
0:02:33.253,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You mean G-Unit?

46
0:02:35.35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson?"

47
0:02:37.486,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:38.69,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And they said, "Yeah?"

49
0:02:40.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I said, "Yes."

50
0:02:41.658,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so we went downstairs, and before you knew it,

51
0:02:45.294,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Curtis, Bette and the rest of them formed this collaboration,

52
0:02:50.559,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and they built this garden in Jamaica, Queens.

53
0:02:52.77,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And it turned out Curtis, 50 Cent, grew up in Jamaica.

54
0:02:56.615,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so again, when you start bringing these worlds together --

55
0:02:59.545,000 --> 0:03:,000
me, Curtis, Bette --

56
0:03:01.007,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you get something more incredible.

57
0:03:04.009,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You get a garden

58
0:03:05.237,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that last year was voted one of the top 10 secret gardens in New York.

59
0:03:10.664,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Right?

60
0:03:11.843,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

61
0:03:13.019,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's for young and old,

62
0:03:15.602,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but more importantly, it's a place --

63
0:03:17.784,000 --> 0:03:19,000
there was a story in the Times about six months ago

64
0:03:20.222,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where this young woman found solace in going to the garden.

65
0:03:24.569,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It had nothing to do with me. It had more to do with 50, I'm sure,

66
0:03:28.185,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but it has inspired people to think about gardens

67
0:03:32.268,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and sharing each other's worlds in a different way.

68
0:03:36.242,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This next concept, "two-ness" --

69
0:03:39.397,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's not as simple as I thought it would be to explain,

70
0:03:43.531,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but as I left to go to college, my father looked at me,

71
0:03:46.268,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and said, "Junior, you're going to have to be both black and white

72
0:03:49.62,000 --> 0:03:5,000
when you go out there."

73
0:03:50.837,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And if you go back to the early parts of the 20th century,

74
0:03:53.65,000 --> 0:03:56,000
W.E.B. Du Bois, the famous activist,

75
0:03:56.74,000 --> 0:03:58,000
said it's this peculiar sensation

76
0:03:59.188,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that the Negro has to walk around

77
0:04:02.49,000 --> 0:04:05,000
being viewed through the lens of other people,

78
0:04:05.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and this two-ness, this double consciousness.

79
0:04:08.741,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I want to argue that more than a hundred years later,

80
0:04:12.975,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that two-ness has made us strong and resilient,

81
0:04:16.97,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and I would say for brown people, women --

82
0:04:19.233,000 --> 0:04:24,000
all of us who have had to navigate the world through the eyes of others --

83
0:04:24.301,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we should now share that strength to the rest of those

84
0:04:28.224,000 --> 0:04:3,000
who have had the privilege to be singular.

85
0:04:31.319,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I'd like to share with you a project,

86
0:04:33.144,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because I do think this two-ness can find itself in the world around us.

87
0:04:36.594,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And it's beginning to happen where we're beginning to share these stories.

88
0:04:40.13,000 --> 0:04:41,000
At the University of Virginia,

89
0:04:41.635,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the academical village by Thomas Jefferson,

90
0:04:44.117,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it's a place that we're beginning to notice now was built by African hands.

91
0:04:49.282,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So we have to begin to say,

92
0:04:50.966,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"OK, how do we talk about that?"

93
0:04:53.157,000 --> 0:04:55,000
As the University was expanding to the south,

94
0:04:56.139,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they found a site that was the house of Kitty Foster,

95
0:05:01.591,000 --> 0:05:04,000
free African American woman.

96
0:05:04.871,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And she was there,

97
0:05:06.076,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and her descendants,

98
0:05:07.326,000 --> 0:05:08,000
they all lived there,

99
0:05:08.891,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and she cleaned for the boys of UVA.

100
0:05:12.757,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But as they found the archaeology,

101
0:05:14.458,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they asked me if I would do a commemorative piece.

102
0:05:17.278,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So the two-ness of this landscape, both black and white ...

103
0:05:20.131,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I decided to do a piece based on shadows and light.

104
0:05:24.722,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And through that, we were able to develop a shadow-catcher

105
0:05:27.504,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that would talk about this two-ness in a different way.

106
0:05:30.493,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So when the light came down,

107
0:05:32.549,000 --> 0:05:34,000
there would be this ride to heaven.

108
0:05:35.221,000 --> 0:05:37,000
When there's no light, it's silent.

109
0:05:37.871,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And in the landscape of Thomas Jefferson,

110
0:05:40.529,000 --> 0:05:41,000
it's a strange thing.

111
0:05:42.228,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's not made of brick.

112
0:05:44.477,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's a strange thing,

113
0:05:45.802,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it allows these two things to be unresolved.

114
0:05:50.417,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And we don't have to resolve these things.

115
0:05:52.899,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I want to live in a world

116
0:05:54.906,000 --> 0:05:55,000
where the resolution --

117
0:05:56.446,000 --> 0:05:58,000
there's an ambiguity between things,

118
0:05:58.502,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because that ambiguity allows us to have a conversation.

119
0:06:03.215,000 --> 0:06:04,000
When things are clear and defined,

120
0:06:05.087,000 --> 0:06:06,000
we forget.

121
0:06:08.948,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The next example? Empathy.

122
0:06:11.527,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I've heard that a couple of times in this conference,

123
0:06:15.024,000 --> 0:06:16,000
this notion of caring.

124
0:06:17.546,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Twenty-five years ago, when I was a young pup,

125
0:06:21.11,000 --> 0:06:22,000
very optimistic,

126
0:06:22.736,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we wanted to design a park in downtown Oakland, California

127
0:06:26.186,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for the homeless people.

128
0:06:27.676,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And we said, homeless people can be in the same space

129
0:06:30.986,000 --> 0:06:31,000
as people who wear suits.

130
0:06:32.767,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And everyone was like, "That's never going to work.

131
0:06:35.49,000 --> 0:06:38,000
People are not going to eat lunch with the homeless people."

132
0:06:39.315,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We built the park.

133
0:06:41.584,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It cost 1.1 million dollars.

134
0:06:43.984,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We wanted a bathroom.

135
0:06:46.161,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We wanted horseshoes, barbecue pits, smokers,

136
0:06:49.853,000 --> 0:06:51,000
picnic tables, shelter and all of that.

137
0:06:52.208,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We had the design, we went to the then-mayor

138
0:06:54.382,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and said, "Mr. Mayor, it's only going to cost you 1.1 million dollars."

139
0:06:58.148,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And he looked at me.

140
0:07:00.392,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"For homeless people?"

141
0:07:03.158,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And he didn't give us the money.

142
0:07:04.922,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So we walked out, unfettered, and we raised the money.

143
0:07:07.797,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Clorox gave us money.

144
0:07:09.828,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The National Park Service built the bathroom.

145
0:07:13.489,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So we were able to go ahead

146
0:07:15.582,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because we had empathy.

147
0:07:17.552,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, 25 years later,

148
0:07:20.263,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we have an even larger homeless problem in the Bay Area.

149
0:07:25.736,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But the park is still there,

150
0:07:27.888,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and the people are still there.

151
0:07:29.855,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So for me, that's a success.

152
0:07:31.722,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And when people see that,

153
0:07:33.596,000 --> 0:07:37,000
hopefully, they'll have empathy for the people under freeways and tents,

154
0:07:37.825,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and why can't our public spaces

155
0:07:40.356,000 --> 0:07:43,000
house them and force us to be empathetic?

156
0:07:44.56,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The image on the left is Lafayette Square Park today.

157
0:07:48.112,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The image on the right is 1906, Golden Gate Park after the earthquake.

158
0:07:53.21,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Why do we have to have cataclysmic events

159
0:07:56.769,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to be empathetic?

160
0:07:58.859,000 --> 0:08:,000
Our fellow men are out there starving,

161
0:08:01.366,000 --> 0:08:04,000
women sleeping on the street, and we don't see them.

162
0:08:04.97,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Put them in those spaces, and they'll be visible.

163
0:08:09.936,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Applause)

164
0:08:15.431,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And to show you that there are still people out there with empathy,

165
0:08:19.308,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the Oakland Raiders' Bruce Irvin

166
0:08:21.705,000 --> 0:08:23,000
fries fish every Friday afternoon

167
0:08:24.56,000 --> 0:08:25,000
for anyone who wants it.

168
0:08:26.714,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And by going to that park, that park became the vehicle for him.

169
0:08:32.218,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The traditional belongs to all of us,

170
0:08:34.872,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and this is a simple one.

171
0:08:37.269,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You go into some neighborhoods -- beautiful architecture, beautiful parks --

172
0:08:40.975,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but if people look a different way,

173
0:08:42.693,000 --> 0:08:43,000
it's not traditional.

174
0:08:44.001,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's not until they leave and then new people come in

175
0:08:48.097,000 --> 0:08:5,000
where the traditional gets valued.

176
0:08:50.365,000 --> 0:08:51,000
A little quick story here:

177
0:08:52.572,000 --> 0:08:53,000
1888 opera house,

178
0:08:54.586,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the oldest in San Francisco,

179
0:08:56.553,000 --> 0:08:58,000
sits in Bayview–Hunters Point.

180
0:08:58.894,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Over its history,

181
0:09:00.893,000 --> 0:09:01,000
it's provided theater,

182
0:09:02.857,000 --> 0:09:05,000
places for businesses, places for community gatherings, etc.

183
0:09:07.453,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's also a place where Ruth Williams taught many black actors.

184
0:09:11.423,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Think: Danny Glover --

185
0:09:14.39,000 --> 0:09:15,000
came from this place.

186
0:09:16.118,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But over time, with our 1980s federal practices,

187
0:09:20.657,000 --> 0:09:24,000
a lot of these community institutions fell into disrepair.

188
0:09:25.346,000 --> 0:09:29,000
With the San Francisco Arts Council, we were able to raise money

189
0:09:30.038,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and to actually refurbish the place.

190
0:09:31.854,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And we were able to have a community meeting.

191
0:09:33.996,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And within the community meeting, people got up and said,

192
0:09:37.037,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"This place feels like a plantation. Why are we locked in?

193
0:09:40.254,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Why can't we learn theater?"

194
0:09:41.772,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Over the years, people had started putting in chicken coops, hay bales,

195
0:09:45.256,000 --> 0:09:47,000
community gardens and all of these things,

196
0:09:47.284,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and they could not see that traditional thing behind them.

197
0:09:50.095,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But we said, we're bringing the community back.

198
0:09:53.118,000 --> 0:09:56,000
American Disability Act -- we were able to get five million dollars.

199
0:09:56.9,000 --> 0:10:,000
And now, the tradition belongs to these brown and black people,

200
0:10:01.451,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and they use it.

201
0:10:02.643,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And they learn theater,

202
0:10:04.107,000 --> 0:10:05,000
after-school programs.

203
0:10:05.551,000 --> 0:10:07,000
There's no more chickens.

204
0:10:07.602,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But there is art.

205
0:10:09.99,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And lastly, I want to share with you a project that we're currently working on,

206
0:10:15.019,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and I think it will force us all to remember in a really different way.

207
0:10:19.789,000 --> 0:10:22,000
There are lots of things in the landscape around us,

208
0:10:22.835,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and most of the time we don't know what's below the ground.

209
0:10:26.529,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Here in Charleston, South Carolina,

210
0:10:28.999,000 --> 0:10:29,000
a verdant piece of grass.

211
0:10:30.316,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Most people just pass by it daily.

212
0:10:33.018,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But underneath it,

213
0:10:35.223,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it's where they discovered Gadsden’s Wharf.

214
0:10:39.773,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We think more than 40 percent of the African diaspora landed here.

215
0:10:45.044,000 --> 0:10:46,000
How could you forget that?

216
0:10:47.843,000 --> 0:10:48,000
How could you forget?

217
0:10:49.5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So we dug, dug, and we found the wharf.

218
0:10:53.04,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And so in 2020,

219
0:10:55.107,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Harry Cobb and myself and others

220
0:10:57.677,000 --> 0:11:,000
are building the International African American Museum.

221
0:11:00.836,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And it will celebrate --

222
0:11:02.74,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Applause)

223
0:11:07.077,000 --> 0:11:1,000
this place where we know, beneath the ground,

224
0:11:11.072,000 --> 0:11:13,000
thousands died, perished,

225
0:11:13.369,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the food chain of the bay changed.

226
0:11:15.619,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Sharks came closer to the bay.

227
0:11:18.651,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's where slaves were stored.

228
0:11:21.305,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Imagine this hallowed ground.

229
0:11:23.707,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So in this new design, the ground will erupt,

230
0:11:26.22,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and it will talk about this tension that sits below.

231
0:11:30.773,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The columns and the ground is made of tabby shales

232
0:11:34.289,000 --> 0:11:35,000
scooped up from the Atlantic,

233
0:11:35.868,000 --> 0:11:37,000
a reminder of that awful crossing.

234
0:11:39.315,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And as you make your way through on the other side,

235
0:11:41.843,000 --> 0:11:44,000
you are forced to walk through the remains of the warehouse,

236
0:11:45.27,000 --> 0:11:46,000
where slaves were stored

237
0:11:47.026,000 --> 0:11:49,000
on hot, sultry days, for days,

238
0:11:49.906,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and perished.

239
0:11:51.172,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And you'll have to come face-to-face

240
0:11:53.698,000 --> 0:11:54,000
with the Negro,

241
0:11:56.391,000 --> 0:11:58,000
who worked in the marshes,

242
0:11:59.007,000 --> 0:12:03,000
who was able to, with the sickle-cell trait,

243
0:12:03.083,000 --> 0:12:06,000
able to stand in high waters for long, long days.

244
0:12:07.204,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And at night, it'll be open 24/7,

245
0:12:09.579,000 --> 0:12:1,000
for everybody to experience.

246
0:12:11.868,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But we'll also talk about those other beautiful things

247
0:12:15.367,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that my African ancestors brought with them:

248
0:12:17.777,000 --> 0:12:18,000
a love of landscape,

249
0:12:19.104,000 --> 0:12:23,000
a respect for the spirits that live in trees and rocks and water,

250
0:12:24.72,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the ethnobotanical aspects,

251
0:12:27.065,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the plants that we use for medicinal purposes.

252
0:12:31.621,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But more importantly,

253
0:12:34.1,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we want to remind people in Charleston, South Carolina,

254
0:12:37.007,000 --> 0:12:39,000
of the black bodies,

255
0:12:39.062,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because when you go to Charleston today,

256
0:12:41.331,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the Confederacy is celebrated,

257
0:12:43.946,000 --> 0:12:44,000
probably more than any other city,

258
0:12:46.527,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and you don't have a sense of blackness at all.

259
0:12:49.828,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The Brookes map,

260
0:12:51.031,000 --> 0:12:55,000
which was an image that helped abolitionists see

261
0:12:55.391,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and be merciful for that condition of the crossing,

262
0:12:58.514,000 --> 0:13:,000
is something that we want to repeat.

263
0:13:01.482,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And I was taken by the conceptuality

264
0:13:04.582,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of this kind of digital print that sits in a museum in Charleston.

265
0:13:08.196,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So we decided to bring the water up on top of the surface,

266
0:13:13.097,000 --> 0:13:15,000
seven feet above tide,

267
0:13:16.125,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and then cast the figures full length, six feet,

268
0:13:20.746,000 --> 0:13:22,000
multiply them across the surface,

269
0:13:23.178,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in tabby,

270
0:13:24.567,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and then allow people to walk across that divide.

271
0:13:28.822,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And hopefully, as people come,

272
0:13:31.071,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the water will drain out,

273
0:13:33.304,000 --> 0:13:34,000
fill up,

274
0:13:34.543,000 --> 0:13:35,000
drain out and fill up.

275
0:13:36.983,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And you'll be forced to come to terms with that memory of place,

276
0:13:43.185,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that memory of that crossing,

277
0:13:45.086,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that at times seems very lucid and clear,

278
0:13:49.093,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but at other times, forces us again to reconcile the scale.

279
0:13:55.471,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And hopefully, as people move through this landscape every day,

280
0:13:59.538,000 --> 0:14:01,000
unreconciled, they'll remember,

281
0:14:02.109,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and hopefully when we remember,

282
0:14:04.567,000 --> 0:14:05,000
e pluribus unum.

283
0:14:05.878,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Thank you.

284
0:14:07.188,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

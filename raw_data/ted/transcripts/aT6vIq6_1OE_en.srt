1
0:00:12.152,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let me start by asking you a question, just with a show of hands:

2
0:00:15.101,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Who has an iPhone?

3
0:00:17.236,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Who has an Android phone?

4
0:00:20.326,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Who has a Blackberry?

5
0:00:22.394,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Who will admit in public to having a Blackberry?

6
0:00:24.768,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:27.351,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And let me guess, how many of you,

8
0:00:29.439,000 --> 0:00:31,000
when you arrived here, like me, went and bought

9
0:00:31.447,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a pay-as-you-go SIM card? Yeah?

10
0:00:35.237,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'll bet you didn't even know

11
0:00:36.637,000 --> 0:00:37,000
you're using African technology.

12
0:00:38.615,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Pay-as-you-go was a technology, or an idea,

13
0:00:40.898,000 --> 0:00:43,000
pioneered in Africa by a company called Vodacom

14
0:00:43.968,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a good 15 years ago,

15
0:00:46.371,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and now, like franchising,

16
0:00:48.916,000 --> 0:00:5,000
pay-as-you-go is one of the most dominant forces

17
0:00:51.199,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of economic activity in the world.

18
0:00:53.776,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I'm going to talk about innovation in Africa,

19
0:00:55.668,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which I think is the purest form,

20
0:00:57.738,000 --> 0:00:59,000
innovation out of necessity.

21
0:00:59.746,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But first, I'm going to ask you some other questions.

22
0:01:02.208,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You don't have to put your hands up.

23
0:01:03.843,000 --> 0:01:05,000
These are rhetorical.

24
0:01:06.475,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Why did Nikola Tesla have to invent

25
0:01:08.745,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the alternating current that powers the lights

26
0:01:10.746,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in this building or the city that we're in?

27
0:01:13.277,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Why did Henry Ford have to invent the production line

28
0:01:15.965,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to produce these Fords that came in anything

29
0:01:18.582,000 --> 0:01:19,000
as long as they were black?

30
0:01:20.043,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And why did Eric Merrifield have to invent the dolos?

31
0:01:24.822,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Blank stares. That is what a dolos looks like,

32
0:01:27.42,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and in the background, you can see Robben Island.

33
0:01:30.241,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This is a small dolos, and Eric Merrifield

34
0:01:34.29,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is the most famous inventor you've never heard of.

35
0:01:37.053,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In 1963, a storm ripped up the harbor

36
0:01:41.273,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in a small South African town called East London,

37
0:01:43.645,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and while he was watching his kids playing

38
0:01:46.688,000 --> 0:01:48,000
with toys made from oxen bones called dolosse,

39
0:01:49.234,000 --> 0:01:5,000
he had the idea for this.

40
0:01:50.856,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's a bit like a huge jumping jack,

41
0:01:53.073,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and they have used this in every harbor in the world

42
0:01:56.515,000 --> 0:01:57,000
as a breakwater.

43
0:01:58.135,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The global shipping economy would not be possible

44
0:02:01.324,000 --> 0:02:03,000
without African technology like this.

45
0:02:04.224,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So whenever you talk about Africa,

46
0:02:07.973,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you have to put up this picture of the world from space,

47
0:02:10.9,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and people go, "Look, it's the Dark Continent."

48
0:02:14.727,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Actually, it isn't.

49
0:02:16.386,000 --> 0:02:18,000
What it is is a map of innovation.

50
0:02:18.415,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And it's really easy to see where innovation's going on.

51
0:02:21.9,000 --> 0:02:25,000
All the places with lots of electricity, it isn't.

52
0:02:25.96,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:28.987,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Applause)

54
0:02:33.52,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And the reason it isn't is because everybody's

55
0:02:35.97,000 --> 0:02:38,000
watching television or playing Angry Birds.

56
0:02:39.155,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

57
0:02:42.624,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So where it's happening is in Africa.

58
0:02:45.828,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now, this is real innovation,

59
0:02:47.646,000 --> 0:02:5,000
not the way people have expropriated the word

60
0:02:50.801,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to talk about launching new products.

61
0:02:52.994,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is real innovation, and I define it as problem-solving.

62
0:02:56.751,000 --> 0:02:58,000
People are solving real problems in Africa.

63
0:02:59.315,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Why? Because we have to.

64
0:03:01.581,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Because we have real problems.

65
0:03:03.314,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And when we solve real problems for people,

66
0:03:05.91,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we solve them for the rest of the world

67
0:03:08.307,000 --> 0:03:1,000
at the same time.

68
0:03:10.411,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So in California, everybody's really excited

69
0:03:13.746,000 --> 0:03:16,000
about a little square of plastic that you plug into a phone

70
0:03:16.752,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and you can swipe your credit card,

71
0:03:18.443,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and people say, "We've liberated the credit card

72
0:03:21.322,000 --> 0:03:23,000
from the point of sale terminal."

73
0:03:23.996,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Fantastic. Why do you even need a credit card?

74
0:03:27.41,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In Africa, we've been doing that for years,

75
0:03:30.758,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and we've been doing it on phones like this.

76
0:03:32.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
This is a picture I took at a place called Kitengela,

77
0:03:35.294,000 --> 0:03:36,000
about an hour south of Nairobi,

78
0:03:37.243,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and the thing that's so remarkable about the payment system

79
0:03:40.123,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that's been pioneered in Africa called M-Pesa

80
0:03:42.325,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is that it works on phones like this.

81
0:03:45.069,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It works on every single phone possible,

82
0:03:48.835,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because it uses SMS.

83
0:03:50.653,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You can pay bills with it, you can buy your groceries,

84
0:03:53.551,000 --> 0:03:54,000
you can pay your kids' school fees,

85
0:03:55.549,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I'm told you can even bribe customs officials.

86
0:03:59.582,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:01.063,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Something like 25 million dollars a day

88
0:04:04.055,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is transacted through M-Pesa.

89
0:04:06.226,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Forty percent of Kenya's GDP

90
0:04:08.537,000 --> 0:04:11,000
moves through M-Pesa using phones like this.

91
0:04:11.738,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And you think this is just a feature phone.

92
0:04:13.828,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Actually it's the smartphone of Africa.

93
0:04:16.9,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's also a radio, and it's also a torch,

94
0:04:19.359,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and more than anything else,

95
0:04:20.771,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it has really superb battery life.

96
0:04:23.539,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Why? Because that's what we need.

97
0:04:25.641,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We have really severe energy problems in Africa.

98
0:04:29.054,000 --> 0:04:3,000
By the way, you can update Facebook

99
0:04:30.599,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and send Gmail from a phone like this.

100
0:04:34.272,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So we have found a way to use

101
0:04:36.852,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the available technology to send money via M-Pesa,

102
0:04:39.745,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which is a bit like a check system

103
0:04:41.766,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for the mobile age.

104
0:04:44.008,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I come from Johannesburg, which is a mining town.

105
0:04:46.63,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's built on gold.

106
0:04:48.094,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This is a picture I Instagrammed earlier.

107
0:04:50.383,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And the difference today is that the gold of today is mobile.

108
0:04:55.748,000 --> 0:04:59,000
If you think about the railroad system in North America and how that worked,

109
0:04:59.991,000 --> 0:05:,000
first came the infrastructure,

110
0:05:01.873,000 --> 0:05:04,000
then came the industry around it, the brothels --

111
0:05:05.153,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it's a bit like the Internet today, right? —

112
0:05:07.145,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and everything else that worked with it:

113
0:05:09.613,000 --> 0:05:11,000
bars, saloons, etc.

114
0:05:11.68,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The gold of today is mobile,

115
0:05:13.898,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and mobile is the enabler that makes all of this possible.

116
0:05:16.919,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So what are some of the things that you can do with it?

117
0:05:18.945,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Well, this is by a guy called Bright Simons from Ghana,

118
0:05:22.531,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and what you do is you take medication,

119
0:05:24.945,000 --> 0:05:27,000
something that some people might spend their entire month's salary on,

120
0:05:28.183,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and you scratch off the code,

121
0:05:30.948,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and you send that to an SMS number,

122
0:05:32.89,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it tells you if that is legitimate

123
0:05:34.885,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or if it's expired.

124
0:05:36.675,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Really simple, really effective, really life-saving.

125
0:05:40.244,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In Kenya, there's a service called iCow,

126
0:05:42.433,000 --> 0:05:44,000
which just sends you really important information

127
0:05:45.372,000 --> 0:05:46,000
about how to look after your dairy.

128
0:05:47.25,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The dairy business in Kenya

129
0:05:48.791,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is a $463 million business,

130
0:05:51.597,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and the difference between a subsistence farmer

131
0:05:54.214,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and an abundance farmer

132
0:05:55.911,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is only a couple of liters of milk a day.

133
0:05:58.285,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And if you can do that, you can rise out of poverty.

134
0:06:01.305,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Really simple, using a basic phone.

135
0:06:05.276,000 --> 0:06:07,000
If you don't have electricity, no problem!

136
0:06:08.061,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We'll just make it out of old bicycle parts

137
0:06:10.022,000 --> 0:06:12,000
using a windmill, as William Kamkwamba did.

138
0:06:12.506,000 --> 0:06:14,000
There's another great African that you've heard

139
0:06:14.586,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that's busy disrupting the automobile industry in the world.

140
0:06:18.318,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He's also finding a way to reinvent solar power

141
0:06:21.077,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and the electricity industry in North America,

142
0:06:23.848,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and if he's lucky, he'll get us to Mars,

143
0:06:26.931,000 --> 0:06:27,000
hopefully in my lifetime.

144
0:06:28.796,000 --> 0:06:31,000
He comes from Pretoria, the capital of [South Africa],

145
0:06:31.879,000 --> 0:06:33,000
about 50 kilometers from where I live.

146
0:06:34.815,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So back to Joburg, which is sometimes called Egoli,

147
0:06:38.397,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which means City of Gold.

148
0:06:40.546,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And not only is mobile the gold of today,

149
0:06:44.557,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I don't believe that the gold is under the ground.

150
0:06:46.927,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I believe we are the gold.

151
0:06:48.659,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Like you've heard the other economists say,

152
0:06:51.003,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we are at the point where China was

153
0:06:53.035,000 --> 0:06:55,000
when its boom years began,

154
0:06:55.468,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and that's where we're going.

155
0:06:56.838,000 --> 0:07:,000
So, you hear the West talk about innovation at the edge.

156
0:07:01.826,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Well, of course it's happening at the edge,

157
0:07:03.735,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because in the middle, everybody's updating Facebook,

158
0:07:06.732,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or worse still, they're trying to understand

159
0:07:08.731,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Facebook's privacy settings.

160
0:07:10.858,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:12.762,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is not that catchy catchphrase.

162
0:07:15.308,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This is innovation over the edge.

163
0:07:19.21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So, people like to call Africa a mobile-first continent,

164
0:07:24.176,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but actually it's mobile-only,

165
0:07:26.85,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so while everybody else is doing all of those things,

166
0:07:30.495,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we're solving the world's problems.

167
0:07:31.835,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So there's only one thing left to say.

168
0:07:34.158,000 --> 0:07:36,000
["You're welcome"] (Laughter)

169
0:07:36.638,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.984,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So one of the most important solutions

2
0:00:15.231,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to the global challenge posed by climate change

3
0:00:18.531,000 --> 0:00:21,000
lies right under our foot every day.

4
0:00:22.478,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's soil.

5
0:00:24.385,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Soil's just the thin veil that covers the surface of land,

6
0:00:29.21,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but it has the power to shape our planet's destiny.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
See, a six-foot or so of soil,

8
0:00:37.783,000 --> 0:00:4,000
loose soil material that covers the earth's surface,

9
0:00:41.271,000 --> 0:00:45,000
represents the difference between life and lifelessness in the earth system,

10
0:00:47.493,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and it can also help us combat climate change

11
0:00:50.748,000 --> 0:00:53,000
if we can only stop treating it like dirt.

12
0:00:54.851,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:56.237,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Climate change is happening,

14
0:00:58.236,000 --> 0:01:,000
the earth's atmosphere is warming,

15
0:01:00.756,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because of the increasing amount of greenhouse gases

16
0:01:03.892,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we keep releasing into the atmosphere.

17
0:01:06.209,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You all know that.

18
0:01:08.373,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But what I assume you might not have heard

19
0:01:10.718,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is that one of the most important things our human society could do

20
0:01:15.89,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to address climate change

21
0:01:17.616,000 --> 0:01:18,000
lies right there in the soil.

22
0:01:21.846,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I'm a soil scientist who has been studying soil since I was 18,

23
0:01:26.105,000 --> 0:01:29,000
because I'm interested in unlocking the secrets of soil

24
0:01:29.83,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and helping people understand this really important climate change solution.

25
0:01:35.782,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So here are the facts about climate.

26
0:01:38.051,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The concentration of carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere

27
0:01:41.755,000 --> 0:01:43,000
has increased by 40 percent

28
0:01:44.156,000 --> 0:01:46,000
just in the last 150 years or so.

29
0:01:46.95,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Human actions are now releasing 9.4 billion metric tons of carbon

30
0:01:52.894,000 --> 0:01:53,000
into the atmosphere,

31
0:01:54.696,000 --> 0:01:57,000
from activities such as burning fossil fuels

32
0:01:58.044,000 --> 0:02:,000
and intensive agricultural practices,

33
0:02:01.045,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and other ways we change the way we use land,

34
0:02:03.902,000 --> 0:02:04,000
including deforestation.

35
0:02:07.254,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But the concentration of carbon dioxide that stays in the atmosphere

36
0:02:12.66,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is only increasing by about half of that,

37
0:02:16.314,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and that's because half of the carbon we keep releasing into the atmosphere

38
0:02:20.474,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is currently being taken up by land and the seas

39
0:02:24.202,000 --> 0:02:26,000
through a process we know as carbon sequestration.

40
0:02:27.752,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So in essence, whatever consequence you think we're facing

41
0:02:32.436,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from climate change right now,

42
0:02:34.728,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we're only experiencing the consequence of 50 percent of our pollution,

43
0:02:41.148,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because the natural ecosystems are bailing us out.

44
0:02:45.495,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But don't get too comfortable,

45
0:02:47.995,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because we have two major things working against us right now.

46
0:02:52.71,000 --> 0:02:56,000
One: unless we do something big,

47
0:02:57.695,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and then fast,

48
0:02:59.638,000 --> 0:03:,000
emissions will continue to rise.

49
0:03:02.511,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And second: the ability of these natural ecosystems

50
0:03:07.582,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

51
0:03:10.534,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and sequester it in the natural habitats

52
0:03:13.964,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is currently getting compromised,

53
0:03:15.901,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as they're experiencing serious degradation because of human actions.

54
0:03:21.616,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So it's not entirely clear

55
0:03:23.759,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that we will continue to get bailed out by these natural ecosystems

56
0:03:27.727,000 --> 0:03:3,000
if we continue on this business-as-usual path that we've been.

57
0:03:33.107,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Here's where the soil comes in:

58
0:03:35.021,000 --> 0:03:39,000
there is about three thousand billion metric tons of carbon in the soil.

59
0:03:40.281,000 --> 0:03:43,000
That's roughly about 315 times the amount of carbon

60
0:03:43.976,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that we release into the atmosphere currently.

61
0:03:46.701,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And there's twice more carbon in soil than there is in vegetation and air.

62
0:03:52.091,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Think about that for a second.

63
0:03:54.386,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There's more carbon in soil

64
0:03:56.671,000 --> 0:03:59,000
than there is in all of the world's vegetation,

65
0:04:00.479,000 --> 0:04:05,000
including the lush tropical rainforests and the giant sequoias,

66
0:04:05.915,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the expansive grasslands,

67
0:04:08.225,000 --> 0:04:1,000
all of the cultivated systems,

68
0:04:11.002,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and every kind of flora you can imagine on the face of the earth,

69
0:04:15.703,000 --> 0:04:2,000
plus all the carbon that's currently up in the atmosphere, combined,

70
0:04:20.907,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and then twice over.

71
0:04:23.539,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Hence, a very small change in the amount of carbon stored in soil

72
0:04:28.823,000 --> 0:04:32,000
can make a big difference in maintenance of the earth's atmosphere.

73
0:04:34.597,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But soil's not just simply a storage box for carbon, though.

74
0:04:38.596,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It operates more like a bank account,

75
0:04:41.578,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the amount of carbon that's in soil at any given time

76
0:04:44.651,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is a function of the amount of carbon coming in and out of the soil.

77
0:04:49.516,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Carbon comes into the soil through the process of photosynthesis,

78
0:04:53.27,000 --> 0:04:56,000
when green plants take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

79
0:04:56.469,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and use it to make their bodies,

80
0:04:59.253,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and upon death, their bodies enter the soil.

81
0:05:02.753,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And carbon leaves the soil

82
0:05:04.556,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and goes right back up into the atmosphere

83
0:05:07.488,000 --> 0:05:09,000
when the bodies of those formerly living organisms

84
0:05:10.282,000 --> 0:05:12,000
decay in soil by the activity of microbes.

85
0:05:14.057,000 --> 0:05:18,000
See, decomposition releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,

86
0:05:18.129,000 --> 0:05:22,000
as well as other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide,

87
0:05:22.635,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but it also releases all the nutrients we all need to survive.

88
0:05:28.359,000 --> 0:05:32,000
One of the things that makes soil such a fundamental component

89
0:05:32.789,000 --> 0:05:34,000
of any climate change mitigation strategy

90
0:05:35.701,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is because it represents a long-term storage of carbon.

91
0:05:39.91,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Carbon that would have lasted maybe a year or two

92
0:05:43.062,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in decaying residue if it was left on the surface

93
0:05:46.965,000 --> 0:05:5,000
can stay in soil for hundreds of years, even thousands and more.

94
0:05:52.568,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Soil biogeochemists like me

95
0:05:55.237,000 --> 0:05:59,000
study exactly how the soil system makes this possible,

96
0:05:59.973,000 --> 0:06:03,000
by locking away the carbon in physical association with minerals,

97
0:06:04.864,000 --> 0:06:06,000
inside aggregates of soil minerals,

98
0:06:07.801,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and formation of strong chemical bonds

99
0:06:11.343,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that bind the carbon to the surfaces of the minerals.

100
0:06:16.05,000 --> 0:06:18,000
See when carbon is entrapped in soil,

101
0:06:18.555,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in these kinds of associations with soil minerals,

102
0:06:21.821,000 --> 0:06:25,000
even the wiliest of the microbes can't easily degrade it.

103
0:06:25.861,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And carbon that's not degrading fast

104
0:06:28.433,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is carbon that's not going back into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases.

105
0:06:33.601,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But the benefit of carbon sequestration

106
0:06:35.784,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is not just limited to climate change mitigation.

107
0:06:39.006,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Soil that stores large amounts of carbon is healthy, fertile, soft.

108
0:06:45.699,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's malleable. It's workable.

109
0:06:48.977,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It makes it like a sponge.

110
0:06:51.484,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It can hold on to a lot of water and nutrients.

111
0:06:55.112,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Healthy and fertile soils like this

112
0:06:57.7,000 --> 0:07:02,000
support the most dynamic, abundant and diverse habitat for living things

113
0:07:02.771,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that we know of anywhere on the earth system.

114
0:07:07.483,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It makes life possible for everything from the tiniest of the microbes,

115
0:07:13.654,000 --> 0:07:15,000
such as bacteria and fungi,

116
0:07:15.928,000 --> 0:07:17,000
all the way to higher plants,

117
0:07:18.151,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and fulfills the food, feed and fiber needs for all animals,

118
0:07:23.222,000 --> 0:07:24,000
including you and I.

119
0:07:25.915,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So at this point, you would assume that we should be treating soil

120
0:07:29.813,000 --> 0:07:31,000
like the precious resource that it is.

121
0:07:32.198,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Unfortunately, that's not the case.

122
0:07:34.83,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Soils around the world are experiencing unprecedented rates of degradation

123
0:07:40.525,000 --> 0:07:45,000
through a variety of human actions that include deforestation,

124
0:07:45.852,000 --> 0:07:47,000
intensive agricultural production systems,

125
0:07:48.651,000 --> 0:07:49,000
overgrazing,

126
0:07:49.984,000 --> 0:07:52,000
excessive application of agricultural chemicals,

127
0:07:53.431,000 --> 0:07:55,000
erosion and similar things.

128
0:07:57.318,000 --> 0:08:,000
Half of the world's soils are currently considered degraded.

129
0:08:02.284,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Soil degradation is bad for many reasons,

130
0:08:05.967,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but let me just tell you a couple.

131
0:08:08.752,000 --> 0:08:14,000
One: degraded soils have diminished potential to support plant productivity.

132
0:08:15.154,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And hence, by degrading soil,

133
0:08:18.036,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we're compromising our own abilities to provide the food and other resources

134
0:08:23.979,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that we need for us

135
0:08:25.877,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and every member of living things on the face of the earth.

136
0:08:31.478,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And second:

137
0:08:34.043,000 --> 0:08:38,000
soil use and degradation, just in the last 200 years or so,

138
0:08:38.844,000 --> 0:08:42,000
has released 12 times more carbon into the atmosphere

139
0:08:43.748,000 --> 0:08:46,000
compared to the rate at which we're releasing carbon

140
0:08:47.329,000 --> 0:08:48,000
into the atmosphere right now.

141
0:08:50.028,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I'm afraid there's even more bad news.

142
0:08:52.565,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This is a story of soils at high latitudes.

143
0:08:56.504,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Peatlands in polar environments

144
0:08:59.386,000 --> 0:09:02,000
store about a third of the global soil carbon reserves.

145
0:09:03.177,000 --> 0:09:06,000
These peatlands have a permanently frozen ground underneath,

146
0:09:06.236,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the permafrost,

147
0:09:07.748,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and the carbon was able to build up in these soils over long periods of time

148
0:09:13.155,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because even though plants are able to photosynthesize during the short,

149
0:09:18.139,000 --> 0:09:2,000
warm summer months,

150
0:09:20.385,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the environment quickly turns cold and dark,

151
0:09:24.171,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and then microbes are not able to efficiently break down the residue.

152
0:09:28.821,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So the soil carbon bank in these polar environments

153
0:09:31.83,000 --> 0:09:34,000
built up over hundreds of thousands of years.

154
0:09:36.001,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But right now, with atmospheric warming,

155
0:09:39.617,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the permafrost is thawing and draining.

156
0:09:43.845,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And when permafrost thaws and drains,

157
0:09:46.77,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it makes it possible for microbes to come in

158
0:09:49.631,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and rather quickly decompose all this carbon,

159
0:09:52.847,000 --> 0:09:56,000
with the potential to release hundreds of billions of metric tons of carbon

160
0:09:57.569,000 --> 0:09:59,000
into the atmosphere in the form of greenhouse gases.

161
0:10:01.145,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And this release of additional greenhouse gases into the atmosphere

162
0:10:05.224,000 --> 0:10:07,000
will only contribute to further warming

163
0:10:08.199,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that makes this predicament even worse,

164
0:10:11.856,000 --> 0:10:16,000
as it starts a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop

165
0:10:17.01,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that could go on and on and on,

166
0:10:19.855,000 --> 0:10:21,000
dramatically changing our climate future.

167
0:10:23.558,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Fortunately, I can also tell you that there is a solution

168
0:10:28.201,000 --> 0:10:32,000
for these two wicked problems of soil degradation and climate change.

169
0:10:32.83,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Just like we created these problems,

170
0:10:35.242,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we do know the solution,

171
0:10:37.47,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and the solution lies in simultaneously working

172
0:10:40.368,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to address these two things together,

173
0:10:43.628,000 --> 0:10:46,000
through what we call climate-smart land management practices.

174
0:10:48.333,000 --> 0:10:49,000
What do I mean here?

175
0:10:49.762,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I mean managing land in a way that's smart

176
0:10:53.043,000 --> 0:10:56,000
about maximizing how much carbon we store in soil.

177
0:10:57.521,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And we can accomplish this

178
0:10:59.358,000 --> 0:11:03,000
by putting in place deep-rooted perennial plants,

179
0:11:03.772,000 --> 0:11:05,000
putting back forests whenever possible,

180
0:11:06.146,000 --> 0:11:1,000
reducing tillage and other disturbances from agricultural practices,

181
0:11:10.629,000 --> 0:11:14,000
including optimizing the use of agricultural chemicals and grazing

182
0:11:15.353,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and even adding carbon to soil, whenever possible,

183
0:11:19.062,000 --> 0:11:23,000
from recycled resources such as compost and even human waste.

184
0:11:24.721,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This kind of land stewardship is not a radical idea.

185
0:11:29.164,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's what made it possible for fertile soils

186
0:11:32.68,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to be able to support human civilizations since time immemorial.

187
0:11:37.522,000 --> 0:11:39,000
In fact, some are doing it just right now.

188
0:11:41.04,000 --> 0:11:45,000
There's a global effort underway to accomplish exactly this goal.

189
0:11:46.193,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This effort that started in France is known as the "4 per 1000" effort,

190
0:11:51.557,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and it sets an aspirational goal

191
0:11:55.24,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to increase the amount of carbon stored in soil by 0.4 percent annually,

192
0:12:03.01,000 --> 0:12:06,000
using the same kind of climate-smart land management practices

193
0:12:06.87,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I mentioned earlier.

194
0:12:08.748,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And if this effort's fully successful,

195
0:12:12.169,000 --> 0:12:15,000
it can offset a third of the global emissions

196
0:12:15.584,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of fossil-fuel-derived carbon into the atmosphere.

197
0:12:19.409,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But even if this effort is not fully successful,

198
0:12:23.175,000 --> 0:12:26,000
but we just start heading in that direction,

199
0:12:26.589,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we still end up with soils that are healthier, more fertile,

200
0:12:31.238,000 --> 0:12:35,000
are able to produce all the food and resources that we need

201
0:12:35.419,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for human populations and more,

202
0:12:37.754,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and also soils that are better capable

203
0:12:40.204,000 --> 0:12:43,000
of sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere

204
0:12:43.624,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and helping with climate change mitigation.

205
0:12:47.402,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I'm pretty sure that's what politicians call a win-win solution.

206
0:12:51.945,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And we all can have a role to play here.

207
0:12:55.622,000 --> 0:13:,000
We can start by treating the soil with the respect that it deserves:

208
0:13:01.122,000 --> 0:13:06,000
respect for its ability as the basis of all life on earth,

209
0:13:06.448,000 --> 0:13:09,000
respect for its ability to serve as a carbon bank

210
0:13:10.43,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and respect for its ability to control our climate.

211
0:13:15.591,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And if we do so,

212
0:13:17.195,000 --> 0:13:19,000
we can then simultaneously address

213
0:13:19.673,000 --> 0:13:23,000
two of the most pressing global challenges of our time:

214
0:13:24.06,000 --> 0:13:26,000
climate change and soil degradation.

215
0:13:26.72,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And in the process, we would be able to provide food and nutritional security

216
0:13:32.927,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to our growing human family.

217
0:13:35.441,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Thank you.

218
0:13:36.616,000 --> 0:13:4,000

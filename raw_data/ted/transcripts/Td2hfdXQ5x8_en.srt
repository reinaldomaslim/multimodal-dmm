1
0:00:13.957,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let me tell you a story

2
0:00:15.518,000 --> 0:00:18,000
about a little girl named Naghma.

3
0:00:18.724,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Naghma lived in a refugee camp

4
0:00:20.546,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with her parents and her eight brothers and sisters.

5
0:00:23.425,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Every morning, her father would wake up

6
0:00:25.361,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in the hopes he'd be picked for construction work,

7
0:00:27.801,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and on a good month he would earn 50 dollars.

8
0:00:31.367,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The winter was very harsh,

9
0:00:32.755,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and unfortunately, Naghma's brother died

10
0:00:35.439,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and her mother became very ill.

11
0:00:37.359,000 --> 0:00:39,000
In desperation, her father went to a neighbor

12
0:00:39.939,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to borrow 2,500 dollars.

13
0:00:42.336,000 --> 0:00:43,000
After several months of waiting,

14
0:00:44.25,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the neighbor became very impatient,

15
0:00:45.767,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and he demanded that he be paid back.

16
0:00:48.485,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Unfortunately, Naghma's father didn't have the money,

17
0:00:50.929,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and so the two men agreed to a jirga.

18
0:00:53.764,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So simply put, a jirga is a form of mediation

19
0:00:56.294,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that's used in Afghanistan's informal justice system.

20
0:00:59.534,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's usually presided over by religious leaders

21
0:01:02.988,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and village elders,

22
0:01:04.686,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and jirgas are often used in rural countries like Afghanistan,

23
0:01:07.886,000 --> 0:01:08,000
where there's deep-seated resentment

24
0:01:09.737,000 --> 0:01:11,000
against the formal system.

25
0:01:11.999,000 --> 0:01:13,000
At the jirga, the men sat together

26
0:01:14.337,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and they decided that the best way to satisfy the debt

27
0:01:17.251,000 --> 0:01:21,000
would be if Naghma married the neighbor's 21-year-old son.

28
0:01:21.84,000 --> 0:01:23,000
She was six.

29
0:01:24.5,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, stories like Naghma's unfortunately

30
0:01:26.565,000 --> 0:01:27,000
are all too common,

31
0:01:28.253,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and from the comforts of our home,

32
0:01:29.748,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we may look at these stories as another

33
0:01:31.503,000 --> 0:01:33,000
crushing blow to women's rights.

34
0:01:33.763,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And if you watched Afghanistan on the news,

35
0:01:36.294,000 --> 0:01:39,000
you may have this view that it's a failed state.

36
0:01:39.993,000 --> 0:01:42,000
However, Afghanistan does have a legal system,

37
0:01:43.809,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and while jirgas are built on long-standing tribal customs,

38
0:01:47.671,000 --> 0:01:5,000
even in jirgas, laws are supposed to be followed,

39
0:01:51.034,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it goes without saying

40
0:01:52.962,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that giving a child to satisfy a debt

41
0:01:55.583,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is not only grossly immoral, it's illegal.

42
0:01:59.649,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In 2008, I went to Afghanistan

43
0:02:02.176,000 --> 0:02:04,000
for a justice funded program,

44
0:02:04.496,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I went there originally on this nine-month program

45
0:02:07.203,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to train Afghan lawyers.

46
0:02:09.115,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In that nine months, I went around the country

47
0:02:11.376,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I talked to hundreds of people that were locked up,

48
0:02:14.312,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I talked to many businesses

49
0:02:15.91,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that were also operating in Afghanistan.

50
0:02:18.44,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And within these conversations,

51
0:02:19.784,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I started hearing the connections

52
0:02:21.655,000 --> 0:02:22,000
between the businesses and the people,

53
0:02:23.645,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and how laws that were meant to protect them

54
0:02:25.715,000 --> 0:02:26,000
were being underused,

55
0:02:27.416,000 --> 0:02:31,000
while gross and illegal punitive measures were overused.

56
0:02:31.474,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And so this put me on a quest for justness,

57
0:02:34.298,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and what justness means to me

58
0:02:37.02,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is using laws for their intended purpose,

59
0:02:40.715,000 --> 0:02:42,000
which is to protect.

60
0:02:43.04,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The role of laws is to protect.

61
0:02:46.543,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So as a result, I decided to open up a private practice,

62
0:02:50.258,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and I became the first foreigner to litigate

63
0:02:52.599,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in Afghan courts.

64
0:02:54.815,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Throughout this time, I also studied many laws,

65
0:02:57.672,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I talked to many people,

66
0:02:59.202,000 --> 0:03:,000
I read up on many cases,

67
0:03:00.373,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I found that the lack of justness

68
0:03:02.763,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is not just a problem in Afghanistan,

69
0:03:04.749,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but it's a global problem.

70
0:03:07.07,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And while I originally shied away from

71
0:03:08.821,000 --> 0:03:1,000
representing human rights cases

72
0:03:10.938,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because I was really concerned about how it would

73
0:03:13.117,000 --> 0:03:15,000
affect me both professionally and personally,

74
0:03:15.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I decided that the need for justness was so great

75
0:03:18.513,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that I couldn't continue to ignore it.

76
0:03:20.384,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And so I started representing people like Naghma

77
0:03:22.701,000 --> 0:03:24,000
pro bono also.

78
0:03:25.157,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, since I've been in Afghanistan

79
0:03:26.863,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and since I've been an attorney for over 10 years,

80
0:03:29.326,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I've represented from CEOs of Fortune 500 companies

81
0:03:33.04,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to ambassadors to little girls like Naghma,

82
0:03:35.368,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and with much success.

83
0:03:36.918,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And the reason for my success is very simple:

84
0:03:39.833,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I work the system from the inside out

85
0:03:41.843,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and use the laws in the ways

86
0:03:43.262,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that they're intended to be used.

87
0:03:45.998,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I find that

88
0:03:48.12,000 --> 0:03:51,000
achieving justness in places like Afghanistan

89
0:03:51.536,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is difficult, and there's three reasons.

90
0:03:53.684,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The first reason is that simply put,

91
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:59,000
people are very uneducated as to what their legal rights were,

92
0:03:59.339,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and I find that this is a global problem.

93
0:04:01.93,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The second issue

94
0:04:03.144,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is that even with laws on the books,

95
0:04:06.583,000 --> 0:04:08,000
it's often superseded or ignored

96
0:04:08.848,000 --> 0:04:1,000
by tribal customs, like in the first jirga

97
0:04:11.17,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that sold Naghma off.

98
0:04:12.702,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the third problem with achieving justness

99
0:04:15.404,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is that even with good, existing laws on the books,

100
0:04:18.216,000 --> 0:04:2,000
there aren't people or lawyers that are willing to fight

101
0:04:20.862,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for those laws.

102
0:04:22.558,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And that's what I do: I use existing laws,

103
0:04:25.432,000 --> 0:04:26,000
often unused laws,

104
0:04:27.231,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and I work those to the benefits of my clients.

105
0:04:30.865,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We all need to create a global culture

106
0:04:33.413,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of human rights

107
0:04:35.241,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and be investors in a global human rights economy,

108
0:04:37.99,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and by working in this mindset,

109
0:04:39.757,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we can significantly improve justice globally.

110
0:04:42.474,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now let's get back to Naghma.

111
0:04:44.866,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Several people heard about this story,

112
0:04:47.265,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and so they contacted me because they wanted

113
0:04:48.79,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to pay the $2,500 debt.

114
0:04:51.355,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And it's not just that simple;

115
0:04:53.216,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you can't just throw money at this problem

116
0:04:54.998,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and think that it's going to disappear.

117
0:04:56.151,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's not how it works in Afghanistan.

118
0:04:58.632,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So I told them I'd get involved,

119
0:05:02.03,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but in order to get involved, what needed to happen

120
0:05:04.318,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is a second jirga needed to be called,

121
0:05:07.141,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a jirga of appeals.

122
0:05:09.25,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And so in order for that to happen,

123
0:05:11.501,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we needed to get the village elders together,

124
0:05:14.206,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we needed to get the tribal leaders together,

125
0:05:16.467,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the religious leaders.

126
0:05:18.056,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Naghma's father needed to agree,

127
0:05:19.63,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the neighbor needed to agree,

128
0:05:20.881,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and also his son needed to agree.

129
0:05:23.085,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I thought, if I'm going to get involved in this thing,

130
0:05:27.11,000 --> 0:05:3,000
then they also need to agree that I preside over it.

131
0:05:30.765,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, after hours of talking

132
0:05:33.735,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and tracking them down,

133
0:05:34.943,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and about 30 cups of tea,

134
0:05:37.806,000 --> 0:05:38,000
they finally agreed that we could sit down

135
0:05:39.718,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for a second jirga, and we did.

136
0:05:43.05,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And what was different about the second jirga

137
0:05:45.134,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is this time, we put the law at the center of it,

138
0:05:47.709,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it was very important for me

139
0:05:49.053,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that they all understood that Naghma

140
0:05:50.811,000 --> 0:05:52,000
had a right to be protected.

141
0:05:53.15,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And at the end of this jirga,

142
0:05:54.696,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it was ordered by the judge

143
0:05:56.989,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that the first decision was erased,

144
0:06:00.825,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and that the $2,500 debt was satisfied,

145
0:06:04.257,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and we all signed a written order

146
0:06:06.09,000 --> 0:06:07,000
where all the men acknowledged

147
0:06:07.481,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that what they did was illegal,

148
0:06:09.601,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and if they did it again, that they would go to prison.

149
0:06:14.399,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Most —

150
0:06:16.168,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Applause)

151
0:06:17.636,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Thanks.

152
0:06:19.483,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And most importantly,

153
0:06:21.299,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the engagement was terminated

154
0:06:22.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and Naghma was free.

155
0:06:24.809,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Protecting Naghma and her right to be free

156
0:06:27.666,000 --> 0:06:29,000
protects us.

157
0:06:30.3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, with my job, there's above-average

158
0:06:33.762,000 --> 0:06:35,000
amount of risks that are involved.

159
0:06:36.505,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I've been temporarily detained.

160
0:06:39.212,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I've been accused of running a brothel,

161
0:06:41.805,000 --> 0:06:43,000
accused of being a spy.

162
0:06:44.11,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I've had a grenade thrown at my office.

163
0:06:46.238,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It didn't go off, though.

164
0:06:48.937,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But I find that with my job,

165
0:06:50.537,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that the rewards far outweigh the risks,

166
0:06:53.503,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and as many risks as I take,

167
0:06:55.877,000 --> 0:06:56,000
my clients take far greater risks,

168
0:06:57.846,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because they have a lot more to lose

169
0:06:59.349,000 --> 0:07:,000
if their cases go unheard,

170
0:07:00.839,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or worse, if they're penalized for having me as their lawyer.

171
0:07:03.962,000 --> 0:07:04,000
With every case that I take,

172
0:07:05.736,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I realize that as much as I'm standing behind my clients,

173
0:07:08.656,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that they're also standing behind me,

174
0:07:10.669,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and that's what keeps me going.

175
0:07:14.462,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Law as a point of leverage

176
0:07:16.359,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is crucial in protecting all of us.

177
0:07:18.881,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Journalists are very vital in making sure

178
0:07:21.517,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that that information is given to the public.

179
0:07:24.791,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Too often, we receive information from journalists

180
0:07:27.277,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but we forget how that information was given.

181
0:07:30.921,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This picture is a picture of the

182
0:07:33.507,000 --> 0:07:34,000
British press corps in Afghanistan.

183
0:07:35.5,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It was taken a couple of years ago by my friend David Gill.

184
0:07:38.649,000 --> 0:07:39,000
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists,

185
0:07:40.517,000 --> 0:07:42,000
since 2010, there have been thousands of journalists

186
0:07:43.363,000 --> 0:07:44,000
who have been threatened, injured,

187
0:07:45.241,000 --> 0:07:47,000
killed, detained.

188
0:07:47.873,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Too often, when we get this information,

189
0:07:50.112,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we forget who it affects

190
0:07:51.336,000 --> 0:07:54,000
or how that information is given to us.

191
0:07:54.634,000 --> 0:07:56,000
What many journalists do, both foreign and domestic,

192
0:07:57.244,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is very remarkable, especially in places like Afghanistan,

193
0:08:01.315,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and it's important that we never forget that,

194
0:08:02.887,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because what they're protecting

195
0:08:04.243,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is not only our right to receive that information

196
0:08:06.525,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but also the freedom of the press, which is vital

197
0:08:08.582,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to a democratic society.

198
0:08:11.458,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Matt Rosenberg is a journalist in Afghanistan.

199
0:08:15.343,000 --> 0:08:16,000
He works for The New York Times,

200
0:08:17.233,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and unfortunately, a few months ago

201
0:08:18.85,000 --> 0:08:2,000
he wrote an article that displeased

202
0:08:20.99,000 --> 0:08:21,000
people in the government.

203
0:08:22.296,000 --> 0:08:25,000
As a result, he was temporarily detained

204
0:08:25.546,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and he was illegally exiled out of the country.

205
0:08:29.859,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I represent Matt,

206
0:08:31.911,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and after dealing with the government,

207
0:08:34.039,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I was able to get legal acknowledgment

208
0:08:35.719,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that in fact he was illegally exiled,

209
0:08:38.78,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and that freedom of the press does exist in Afghanistan,

210
0:08:41.84,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and there's consequences if that's not followed.

211
0:08:44.372,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And I'm happy to say that

212
0:08:46.118,000 --> 0:08:48,000
as of a few days ago,

213
0:08:48.206,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the Afghan government

214
0:08:49.532,000 --> 0:08:51,000
formally invited him back into the country

215
0:08:51.744,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and they reversed their exile order of him.

216
0:08:55.377,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause)

217
0:09:00.049,000 --> 0:09:03,000
If you censor one journalist, then it intimidates others,

218
0:09:03.252,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and soon nations are silenced.

219
0:09:05.224,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's important that we protect our journalists

220
0:09:07.942,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and freedom of the press,

221
0:09:09.719,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because that makes governments more accountable to us

222
0:09:11.778,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and more transparent.

223
0:09:13.763,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Protecting journalists and our right

224
0:09:15.67,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to receive information protects us.

225
0:09:19.844,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Our world is changing. We live in a different world now,

226
0:09:22.86,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and what were once individual problems

227
0:09:25.243,000 --> 0:09:27,000
are really now global problems for all of us.

228
0:09:28.061,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Two weeks ago, Afghanistan had its first

229
0:09:31.7,000 --> 0:09:32,000
democratic transfer of power

230
0:09:33.691,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and elected president Ashraf Ghani, which is huge,

231
0:09:36.943,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and I'm very optimistic about him,

232
0:09:39.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and I'm hopeful that he'll give Afghanistan

233
0:09:41.419,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the changes that it needs,

234
0:09:42.69,000 --> 0:09:44,000
especially within the legal sector.

235
0:09:45.187,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We live in a different world.

236
0:09:47.09,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We live in a world where my eight-year-old daughter

237
0:09:49.439,000 --> 0:09:51,000
only knows a black president.

238
0:09:52.153,000 --> 0:09:54,000
There's a great possibility that our next president

239
0:09:54.861,000 --> 0:09:55,000
will be a woman,

240
0:09:56.197,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and as she gets older, she may question,

241
0:09:59.1,000 --> 0:10:,000
can a white guy be president?

242
0:10:00.845,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

243
0:10:02.619,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Applause)

244
0:10:05.73,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Our world is changing, and we need to change with it,

245
0:10:08.91,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and what were once individual problems

246
0:10:10.542,000 --> 0:10:12,000
are problems for all of us.

247
0:10:13.39,000 --> 0:10:15,000
According to UNICEF,

248
0:10:15.468,000 --> 0:10:21,000
there are currently over 280 million

249
0:10:21.509,000 --> 0:10:22,000
boys and girls who are married

250
0:10:23.394,000 --> 0:10:24,000
under the age of 15.

251
0:10:25.176,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Two hundred and eighty million.

252
0:10:27.219,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Child marriages prolong the vicious cycle

253
0:10:29.761,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of poverty, poor health, lack of education.

254
0:10:34.181,000 --> 0:10:38,000
At the age of 12, Sahar was married.

255
0:10:38.868,000 --> 0:10:39,000
She was forced into this marriage

256
0:10:40.717,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and sold by her brother.

257
0:10:42.417,000 --> 0:10:44,000
When she went to her in-laws' house,

258
0:10:44.485,000 --> 0:10:46,000
they forced her into prostitution.

259
0:10:47.173,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Because she refused, she was tortured.

260
0:10:50.986,000 --> 0:10:54,000
She was severely beaten with metal rods.

261
0:10:55.011,000 --> 0:10:57,000
They burned her body.

262
0:10:57.803,000 --> 0:11:,000
They tied her up in a basement and starved her.

263
0:11:01.293,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They used pliers to take out her fingernails.

264
0:11:05.503,000 --> 0:11:06,000
At one point,

265
0:11:07.332,000 --> 0:11:1,000
she managed to escape from this torture chamber

266
0:11:10.537,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to a neighbor's house,

267
0:11:12.91,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and when she went there, instead of protecting her,

268
0:11:16.206,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they dragged her back

269
0:11:18.221,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to her husband's house,

270
0:11:19.857,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and she was tortured even worse.

271
0:11:25.864,000 --> 0:11:28,000
When I met first Sahar, thankfully,

272
0:11:28.975,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Women for Afghan Women

273
0:11:30.206,000 --> 0:11:33,000
gave her a safe haven to go to.

274
0:11:33.534,000 --> 0:11:36,000
As a lawyer, I try to be very strong

275
0:11:36.72,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for all my clients,

276
0:11:38.379,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because that's very important to me,

277
0:11:42.193,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but seeing her,

278
0:11:45.122,000 --> 0:11:48,000
how broken and very weak as she was,

279
0:11:49.024,000 --> 0:11:52,000
was very difficult.

280
0:11:52.321,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It took weeks for us to really get to

281
0:11:55.808,000 --> 0:11:58,000
what happened to her

282
0:11:59.164,000 --> 0:12:,000
when she was in that house,

283
0:12:01.12,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but finally she started opening up to me,

284
0:12:03.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and when she opened up,

285
0:12:06.08,000 --> 0:12:07,000
what I heard was

286
0:12:07.552,000 --> 0:12:09,000
she didn't know what her rights were,

287
0:12:10.152,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but she did know she had a certain level of protection

288
0:12:12.355,000 --> 0:12:14,000
by her government that failed her,

289
0:12:14.982,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and so we were able to talk about

290
0:12:16.584,000 --> 0:12:18,000
what her legal options were.

291
0:12:19.126,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And so we decided to take this case

292
0:12:21.134,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to the Supreme Court.

293
0:12:22.89,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Now, this is extremely significant,

294
0:12:24.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because this is the first time

295
0:12:26.673,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that a victim of domestic violence in Afghanistan

296
0:12:29.509,000 --> 0:12:31,000
was being represented by a lawyer,

297
0:12:32.302,000 --> 0:12:34,000
a law that's been on the books for years and years,

298
0:12:35.037,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but until Sahar, had never been used.

299
0:12:38.443,000 --> 0:12:4,000
In addition to this, we also decided

300
0:12:40.655,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to sue for civil damages,

301
0:12:42.378,000 --> 0:12:44,000
again using a law that's never been used,

302
0:12:45.325,000 --> 0:12:48,000
but we used it for her case.

303
0:12:48.353,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So there we were at the Supreme Court

304
0:12:50.615,000 --> 0:12:53,000
arguing in front of 12 Afghan justices,

305
0:12:53.857,000 --> 0:12:55,000
me as an American female lawyer,

306
0:12:56.493,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and Sahar, a young woman

307
0:12:59.98,000 --> 0:13:04,000
who when I met her couldn't speak above a whisper.

308
0:13:05.163,000 --> 0:13:06,000
She stood up,

309
0:13:06.834,000 --> 0:13:08,000
she found her voice,

310
0:13:09.12,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and my girl told them that she wanted justice,

311
0:13:11.917,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and she got it.

312
0:13:14.556,000 --> 0:13:16,000
At the end of it all, the court unanimously agreed

313
0:13:17.385,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that her in-laws should be arrested for what they did to her,

314
0:13:21.568,000 --> 0:13:23,000
her fucking brother should also be arrested

315
0:13:24.177,000 --> 0:13:25,000
for selling her —

316
0:13:26.123,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Applause) —

317
0:13:30.543,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and they agreed that she did have a right

318
0:13:32.546,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to civil compensation.

319
0:13:34.964,000 --> 0:13:36,000
What Sahar has shown us is that we can attack

320
0:13:37.743,000 --> 0:13:39,000
existing bad practices by using the laws

321
0:13:40.521,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in the ways that they're intended to be used,

322
0:13:43.459,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and by protecting Sahar,

323
0:13:45.94,000 --> 0:13:48,000
we are protecting ourselves.

324
0:13:49.52,000 --> 0:13:5,000
After having worked in Afghanistan

325
0:13:51.152,000 --> 0:13:52,000
for over six years now,

326
0:13:53.15,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a lot of my family and friends think

327
0:13:55.201,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that what I do looks like this.

328
0:13:57.993,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

329
0:14:00.499,000 --> 0:14:04,000
But in all actuality, what I do looks like this.

330
0:14:05.137,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Now, we can all do something.

331
0:14:07.01,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I'm not saying we should all buy a plane ticket and go to Afghanistan,

332
0:14:09.79,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but we can all be contributors

333
0:14:12.812,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to a global human rights economy.

334
0:14:14.871,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We can create a culture of transparency

335
0:14:17.139,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and accountability to the laws,

336
0:14:18.463,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and make governments more accountable to us,

337
0:14:20.874,000 --> 0:14:23,000
as we are to them.

338
0:14:23.897,000 --> 0:14:24,000
A few months ago, a South African lawyer

339
0:14:25.889,000 --> 0:14:26,000
visited me in my office

340
0:14:27.644,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and he said, "I wanted to meet you.

341
0:14:29.569,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I wanted to see what a crazy person looked like."

342
0:14:33.563,000 --> 0:14:34,000
The laws are ours,

343
0:14:35.542,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and no matter what your ethnicity,

344
0:14:37.575,000 --> 0:14:39,000
nationality, gender, race,

345
0:14:40.466,000 --> 0:14:42,000
they belong to us,

346
0:14:42.585,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and fighting for justice is not an act of insanity.

347
0:14:47.374,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Businesses also need to get with the program.

348
0:14:49.615,000 --> 0:14:5,000
A corporate investment in human rights

349
0:14:51.336,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is a capital gain on your businesses,

350
0:14:53.214,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and whether you're a business, an NGO,

351
0:14:55.34,000 --> 0:14:59,000
or a private citizen, rule of law benefits all of us.

352
0:14:59.435,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And by working together with a concerted mindset,

353
0:15:01.75,000 --> 0:15:04,000
through the people, public and private sector,

354
0:15:05.206,000 --> 0:15:07,000
we can create a global human rights economy

355
0:15:07.503,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and all become global investors in human rights.

356
0:15:11.036,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And by doing this,

357
0:15:12.82,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we can achieve justness together.

358
0:15:15.48,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Thank you.

359
0:15:17.573,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Applause)

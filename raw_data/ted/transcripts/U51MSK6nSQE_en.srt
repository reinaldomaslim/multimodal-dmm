0:00:13.2,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Three years ago,

2
0:00:14.48,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I started building a decentralized web

3
0:00:17.52,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because I was worried about the future of our internet.

4
0:00:21.68,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The current internet we are using is about gatekeepers.

5
0:00:24.32,000 --> 0:00:26,000
If you want to reach something on the web,

6
0:00:26.72,000 --> 0:00:28,000
then you need to go through multiple middlemen.

7
0:00:29.12,000 --> 0:00:31,000
First, a domain name server,

8
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:33,000
then a server hosting company,

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which usually points you to a third party,

10
0:00:37.92,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to a web hosting service.

11
0:00:41.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And this happens every time you want to reach a website on the web.

12
0:00:45.44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But these gatekeepers are vulnerable to internet attacks

13
0:00:49.92,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and also makes the censorship and the surveillance easier.

14
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And the situation is getting worse.

15
0:00:57.84,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Everything is moving to the cloud,

16
0:00:59.56,000 --> 0:01:02,000
where the data is hosted by giant corporations.

17
0:01:03.4,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This move creates much, much more powerful middlemen.

18
0:01:08.56,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, move to the cloud makes sense

19
0:01:10.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because this way it's easier and cheaper

20
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for the developers and the service operators.

21
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They don't have to worry about maintaining the physical servers.

22
0:01:20.72,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I can't blame them, but I found this trend to be very dangerous,

23
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:27,000
because this way, these giant corporations

24
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:31,000
have unlimited control over the hosting services.

25
0:01:32.92,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And it's very easy to abuse this power.

26
0:01:37.44,000 --> 0:01:4,000
For example, last year, a CEO of a company

27
0:01:41.24,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that acts as a gatekeeper for nine million websites

28
0:01:45.88,000 --> 0:01:47,000
decided, after some public pressure,

29
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that one of the sites it manages,

30
0:01:50.44,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a far right page, should be blocked.

31
0:01:54.52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
He then sent an internal email to his coworkers.

32
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"This was an arbitrary decision.

33
0:02:02.64,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I woke up this morning in a bad mood

34
0:02:05.2,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and decided to kick them off the Internet."

35
0:02:09.96,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Even he admits,

36
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"No one should have this power."

37
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
As a response, one of the employees asked him,

38
0:02:18.64,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"Is this the day the Internet dies?"

39
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I don't think we are actually killing the internet,

40
0:02:26.24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but I do think that we are in the middle

41
0:02:28.2,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of a kind of irresponsible centralization process

42
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that makes our internet more fragile.

43
0:02:35.12,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The decentralized, people-to-people web

44
0:02:38.48,000 --> 0:02:41,000
solves this problem by removing the central points,

45
0:02:41.56,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the web-hosting services.

46
0:02:43.88,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It empowers the users

47
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to have host sites they want to preserve.

48
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:56,000
On this network, the sites get downloaded directly from other visitors.

49
0:02:57.12,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This means, if you have a site with 100 visitors,

50
0:02:59.48,000 --> 0:03:02,000
then it's hosted [by] 100 computers around the world.

51
0:03:04.04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Basically, this is a people-powered version of the internet.

52
0:03:10.72,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The security of the network is provided by public-key cryptography.

53
0:03:14.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This makes sure that no one can modify the sites

54
0:03:18.28,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but only the real owner.

55
0:03:21.36,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Think of it like instead of getting electricity from big power plants,

56
0:03:25.84,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you put solar panels on top of your house,

57
0:03:27.92,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and if your neighbor down the street needs some extra energy,

58
0:03:30.84,000 --> 0:03:32,000
then they can just download some from your house.

59
0:03:36.76,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So by using the decentralized web,

60
0:03:39.6,000 --> 0:03:43,000
we can help to keep content accessible for other visitors.

61
0:03:44.8,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And by that, it means

62
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that we can also fight against things

63
0:03:51.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that we feel are unjust,

64
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:55,000
like censorship.

65
0:03:56.48,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In China, the internet is tightly controlled.

66
0:04:00.6,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They can't criticize the government,

67
0:04:04.48,000 --> 0:04:06,000
organize a protest,

68
0:04:06.52,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and it's also forbidden to post

69
0:04:09.28,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a kind of emoticon to remember the victims of the Tiananmen Square Massacre.

70
0:04:15.04,000 --> 0:04:18,000
With the decentralized web, it's not the government that decides

71
0:04:18.126,000 --> 0:04:19,000
what gets seen and what doesn't.

72
0:04:21.08,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's the people,

73
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which makes the web more democratic.

74
0:04:26.6,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But at the same time, it's hard to use this network

75
0:04:29.04,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to do something that is clearly illegal

76
0:04:31.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
everywhere in the world,

77
0:04:33.24,000 --> 0:04:36,000
as the users probably don't want to endanger themselves

78
0:04:36.8,000 --> 0:04:38,000
hosting these kinds of problematic content.

79
0:04:41.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Another increasing threat

80
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to internet freedom

81
0:04:47.4,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is overregulation.

82
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I have the impression

83
0:04:53.28,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that our delegates

84
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who vote on the internet regulation laws

85
0:04:57.88,000 --> 0:05:,000
are not fully aware of their decisions.

86
0:05:01.76,000 --> 0:05:04,000
For example, the European Parliament has a new law on the table,

87
0:05:05.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a new copyright protection law,

88
0:05:07.44,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that has a part called Article 13.

89
0:05:11.68,000 --> 0:05:15,000
If it passes, it would require every big website

90
0:05:16.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to implement a filter

91
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that automatically blocks content

92
0:05:21.64,000 --> 0:05:23,000
based on rules controlled by big corporations.

93
0:05:25.8,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The original idea is to protect copyrighted materials,

94
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but it would endanger many other things we do on the internet:

95
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
blogging, criticizing, discussing, linking and sharing.

96
0:05:36.76,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Google and YouTube already have similar systems

97
0:05:40.6,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and they are receiving 100,000 takedown requests every hour.

98
0:05:47.44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Of course, they can't process this amount of data by hand,

99
0:05:50.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
so they are using machine learning

100
0:05:52.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to decide if it's really a copyright violation or not.

101
0:05:56.6,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But these filters do make mistakes.

102
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They're removing everything from documentation of human rights abuses,

103
0:06:06.84,000 --> 0:06:08,000
lectures about copyrights

104
0:06:09.76,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and search results

105
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that point to criticism of this new Article 13.

106
0:06:18.84,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Beside of that, they are also removing many other things.

107
0:06:24.48,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And sometimes, these filters aren't just removing the specific content,

108
0:06:30.8,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but it could also lead to loss of your linked accounts:

109
0:06:35.6,000 --> 0:06:39,000
your email address, your documents, your photos,

110
0:06:39.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or your unfinished book,

111
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
which happened with the writer Dennis Cooper.

112
0:06:45.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's not hard to see how a system like this could be abused

113
0:06:50.44,000 --> 0:06:53,000
by politicians and corporate competitors.

114
0:06:55.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This Article 13, the extension of these automated filters to the whole internet,

115
0:07:02.08,000 --> 0:07:04,000
got strong opposition

116
0:07:04.24,000 --> 0:07:09,000
from Wikipedia, Github, Mozilla, and many others,

117
0:07:09.64,000 --> 0:07:14,000
including the original founders of the internet and the World Wide Web,

118
0:07:15.2,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Vint Cerf and Tim Berners-Lee.

119
0:07:18.12,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But despite this strong opposition,

120
0:07:21.04,000 --> 0:07:23,000
on the last European Parliament vote,

121
0:07:23.44,000 --> 0:07:26,000
two thirds of the representatives supported this law.

122
0:07:29.08,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The final vote will be early 2019.

123
0:07:32.92,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The result is important,

124
0:07:34.92,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but whatever happens,

125
0:07:37.64,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I'm pretty sure it will be followed by many other similar proposals

126
0:07:42.96,000 --> 0:07:43,000
around the world.

127
0:07:45.28,000 --> 0:07:48,000
These kinds of regulations would be very hard to enforce

128
0:07:48.48,000 --> 0:07:49,000
through a decentralized web,

129
0:07:49.96,000 --> 0:07:51,000
as there is no hosting companies.

130
0:07:53.28,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The websites are served by the visitors themselves.

131
0:07:58.24,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I started to build this network three years ago.

132
0:08:03.12,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Since then, I've spent thousands, tens of thousands of hours

133
0:08:07.4,000 --> 0:08:08,000
on the development.

134
0:08:09.8,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Why?

135
0:08:11.4,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Why would anyone spend thousands of hours on something anyone can freely copy,

136
0:08:15.2,000 --> 0:08:17,000
rename, or even sell?

137
0:08:19.6,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Well, in my case,

138
0:08:21.36,000 --> 0:08:23,000
one of the reasons was to do something meaningful.

139
0:08:24.72,000 --> 0:08:26,000
During my daily regular job as a web developer,

140
0:08:27.28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I didn't have the feeling that I'm working on something

141
0:08:30.52,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that had a chance to be a bigger than me.

142
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Simply, I just wanted to make my short presence in this world

143
0:08:38.84,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to be meaningful.

144
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Last year, the Great Firewall of China started blocking this network I created.

145
0:08:49.4,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This move officially made me the enemy

146
0:08:52.679,000 --> 0:08:55,000
of the government-supported internet censorship.

147
0:08:57.68,000 --> 0:09:,000
Since then, it's been really a game of cat and mouse.

148
0:09:00.72,000 --> 0:09:02,000
They make new rules in the firewall

149
0:09:03.48,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and I try to react to it as fast as I can

150
0:09:06.52,000 --> 0:09:1,000
so the users can keep hosting content and create websites

151
0:09:10.64,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that otherwise would be censored by the centralized Chinese internet.

152
0:09:17.68,000 --> 0:09:21,000
My other motivation to create this network was worry.

153
0:09:23.08,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I fear that the future of our internet is out of our control.

154
0:09:28.32,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The increasing centralization and the proposed laws

155
0:09:31.76,000 --> 0:09:33,000
are threatening our freedom of speech

156
0:09:34.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and, by that, our democracy.

157
0:09:37.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So for me, building a decentralized web

158
0:09:40.8,000 --> 0:09:43,000
means creating a safe harbor,

159
0:09:44.04,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a space where the rules are not written by big corporations and political parties,

160
0:09:50.88,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but by the people.

161
0:09:53.84,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Thank you.

162
0:09:55.08,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:16.249,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I want to talk about social innovation

3
0:00:19.879,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and social entrepreneurship.

4
0:00:23.314,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I happen to have triplets.

5
0:00:26.033,000 --> 0:00:27,000
They're little. They're five years old.

6
0:00:28.341,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Sometimes I tell people I have triplets. They say, "Really? How many?"

7
0:00:31.69,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:33.079,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Here's a picture of the kids -- that's Sage, and Annalisa and Rider.

9
0:00:38.656,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, I also happen to be gay.

10
0:00:43.75,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Being gay and fathering triplets is by far

11
0:00:45.842,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the most socially innovative, socially entrepreneurial thing

12
0:00:48.708,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I have ever done.

13
0:00:50.28,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:51.359,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:55.031,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The real social innovation I want to talk about involves charity.

16
0:00:59.436,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I want to talk about how the things we've been taught to think

17
0:01:02.83,000 --> 0:01:04,000
about giving and about charity

18
0:01:05.088,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and about the nonprofit sector,

19
0:01:06.993,000 --> 0:01:09,000
are actually undermining the causes we love,

20
0:01:10.962,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and our profound yearning to change the world.

21
0:01:14.647,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But before I do that, I want to ask if we even believe

22
0:01:17.352,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that the nonprofit sector has any serious role to play

23
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in changing the world.

24
0:01:22.514,000 --> 0:01:25,000
A lot of people say now that business will lift up the developing economies,

25
0:01:26.18,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and social business will take care of the rest.

26
0:01:29.426,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I do believe that business will move the great mass of humanity forward.

27
0:01:35.017,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But it always leaves behind that 10 percent or more

28
0:01:38.937,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that is most disadvantaged or unlucky.

29
0:01:43.13,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And social business needs markets,

30
0:01:44.774,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and there are some issues for which you just can't develop

31
0:01:47.56,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the kind of money measures that you need for a market.

32
0:01:50.394,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled,

33
0:01:53.972,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and these people want laughter

34
0:01:56.306,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and compassion and they want love.

35
0:02:00.718,000 --> 0:02:01,000
How do you monetize that?

36
0:02:03.909,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And that's where the nonprofit sector and philanthropy come in.

37
0:02:08.266,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Philanthropy is the market for love.

38
0:02:11.855,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It is the market for all those people

39
0:02:14.276,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for whom there is no other market coming.

40
0:02:17.116,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And so if we really want, like Buckminster Fuller said,

41
0:02:19.847,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a world that works for everyone,

42
0:02:22.236,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with no one and nothing left out,

43
0:02:24.74,000 --> 0:02:26,000
then the nonprofit sector has to be

44
0:02:26.902,000 --> 0:02:28,000
a serious part of the conversation.

45
0:02:30.01,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But it doesn't seem to be working.

46
0:02:32.433,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Why have our breast cancer charities not come close

47
0:02:34.862,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to finding a cure for breast cancer,

48
0:02:36.608,000 --> 0:02:37,000
or our homeless charities not come close

49
0:02:38.584,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to ending homelessness in any major city?

50
0:02:41.667,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Why has poverty remained stuck

51
0:02:43.669,000 --> 0:02:47,000
at 12 percent of the U.S. population for 40 years?

52
0:02:49.275,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And the answer is,

53
0:02:50.905,000 --> 0:02:53,000
these social problems are massive in scale,

54
0:02:54.184,000 --> 0:02:56,000
our organizations are tiny up against them,

55
0:02:56.962,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and we have a belief system that keeps them tiny.

56
0:03:00.707,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We have two rulebooks.

57
0:03:01.901,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We have one for the nonprofit sector,

58
0:03:03.791,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and one for the rest of the economic world.

59
0:03:07.183,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's an apartheid, and it discriminates

60
0:03:09.274,000 --> 0:03:11,000
against the nonprofit sector in five different areas,

61
0:03:12.224,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the first being compensation.

62
0:03:15.234,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So in the for-profit sector, the more value you produce,

63
0:03:17.902,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the more money you can make.

64
0:03:19.464,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But we don't like nonprofits to use money

65
0:03:21.572,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to incentivize people to produce more in social service.

66
0:03:25.524,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We have a visceral reaction to the idea that anyone

67
0:03:28.035,000 --> 0:03:3,000
would make very much money helping other people.

68
0:03:31.476,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Interestingly, we don't have a visceral reaction

69
0:03:33.745,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to the notion that people would make a lot of money

70
0:03:36.174,000 --> 0:03:37,000
not helping other people.

71
0:03:37.423,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You know, you want to make 50 million dollars

72
0:03:39.548,000 --> 0:03:41,000
selling violent video games to kids, go for it.

73
0:03:41.794,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We'll put you on the cover of Wired magazine.

74
0:03:43.939,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But you want to make half a million dollars

75
0:03:45.987,000 --> 0:03:46,000
trying to cure kids of malaria,

76
0:03:47.5,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and you're considered a parasite yourself.

77
0:03:50.644,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Applause)

78
0:03:55.596,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And we think of this as our system of ethics,

79
0:03:58.041,000 --> 0:04:,000
but what we don't realize is that this system

80
0:04:00.208,000 --> 0:04:03,000
has a powerful side effect, which is:

81
0:04:03.39,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It gives a really stark, mutually exclusive choice

82
0:04:07.168,000 --> 0:04:1,000
between doing very well for yourself and your family

83
0:04:10.826,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or doing good for the world,

84
0:04:13.244,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to the brightest minds coming out of our best universities,

85
0:04:16.062,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and sends tens of thousands of people

86
0:04:18.196,000 --> 0:04:2,000
who could make a huge difference in the nonprofit sector,

87
0:04:20.918,000 --> 0:04:22,000
marching every year directly into the for-profit sector

88
0:04:23.538,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because they're not willing to make that kind of lifelong economic sacrifice.

89
0:04:28.664,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Businessweek did a survey, looked at the compensation packages

90
0:04:31.633,000 --> 0:04:33,000
for MBAs 10 years out of business school.

91
0:04:34.676,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And the median compensation for a Stanford MBA,

92
0:04:37.424,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with bonus, at the age of 38, was 400,000 dollars.

93
0:04:42.232,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Meanwhile, for the same year, the average salary

94
0:04:44.526,000 --> 0:04:46,000
for the CEO of a $5 million-plus medical charity in the U.S.

95
0:04:47.379,000 --> 0:04:51,000
was 232,000 dollars, and for a hunger charity, 84,000 dollars.

96
0:04:53.025,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now, there's no way you're going to get a lot of people

97
0:04:55.645,000 --> 0:04:59,000
with $400,000 talent to make a $316,000 sacrifice every year

98
0:04:59.724,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to become the CEO of a hunger charity.

99
0:05:03.027,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Some people say, "Well, that's just because those MBA types are greedy."

100
0:05:06.576,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Not necessarily. They might be smart.

101
0:05:09.283,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's cheaper for that person to donate

102
0:05:11.302,000 --> 0:05:14,000
100,000 dollars every year to the hunger charity;

103
0:05:15.136,000 --> 0:05:16,000
save 50,000 dollars on their taxes --

104
0:05:17.074,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so still be roughly 270,000 dollars a year ahead of the game --

105
0:05:21.523,000 --> 0:05:23,000
now be called a philanthropist because they donated

106
0:05:24.142,000 --> 0:05:25,000
100,000 dollars to charity;

107
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
probably sit on the board of the hunger charity;

108
0:05:28.282,000 --> 0:05:29,000
indeed, probably supervise the poor SOB

109
0:05:30.202,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity;

110
0:05:32.972,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:34.003,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence

112
0:05:37.378,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and popular praise still ahead of them.

113
0:05:41.106,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The second area of discrimination is advertising and marketing.

114
0:05:44.588,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So we tell the for-profit sector, "Spend, spend, spend on advertising,

115
0:05:48.093,000 --> 0:05:51,000
until the last dollar no longer produces a penny of value."

116
0:05:51.955,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But we don't like to see our donations spent on advertising in charity.

117
0:05:55.329,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Our attitude is, "Well, look, if you can get the advertising donated,

118
0:05:59.328,000 --> 0:06:02,000
you know, to air at four o'clock in the morning, I'm okay with that.

119
0:06:02.597,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But I don't want my donation spent on advertising,

120
0:06:04.985,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I want it go to the needy."

121
0:06:06.576,000 --> 0:06:07,000
As if the money invested in advertising

122
0:06:08.458,000 --> 0:06:1,000
could not bring in dramatically greater sums of money

123
0:06:11.112,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to serve the needy.

124
0:06:13.113,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In the 1990s, my company created

125
0:06:15.228,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the long-distance AIDSRide bicycle journeys,

126
0:06:18.627,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and the 60 mile-long breast cancer three-day walks,

127
0:06:23.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and over the course of nine years,

128
0:06:26.184,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we had 182,000 ordinary heroes participate,

129
0:06:31.247,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and they raised a total of 581 million dollars.

130
0:06:35.167,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Applause)

131
0:06:38.331,000 --> 0:06:4,000
They raised more money more quickly for these causes

132
0:06:40.808,000 --> 0:06:41,000
than any events in history,

133
0:06:42.498,000 --> 0:06:44,000
all based on the idea that people are weary

134
0:06:45.316,000 --> 0:06:47,000
of being asked to do the least they can possibly do.

135
0:06:48.142,000 --> 0:06:52,000
People are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential

136
0:06:52.732,000 --> 0:06:54,000
on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply.

137
0:06:56.073,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But they have to be asked.

138
0:06:59.097,000 --> 0:07:,000
We got that many people to participate

139
0:07:00.954,000 --> 0:07:02,000
by buying full-page ads in The New York Times,

140
0:07:03.189,000 --> 0:07:06,000
in The Boston Globe, in prime time radio and TV advertising.

141
0:07:06.626,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Do you know how many people we would've gotten

142
0:07:08.809,000 --> 0:07:09,000
if we put up fliers in the laundromat?

143
0:07:12.274,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Charitable giving has remained stuck in the U.S., at two percent of GDP,

144
0:07:16.504,000 --> 0:07:18,000
ever since we started measuring it in the 1970s.

145
0:07:19.287,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That's an important fact, because it tells us

146
0:07:21.624,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that in 40 years, the nonprofit sector

147
0:07:24.338,000 --> 0:07:27,000
has not been able to wrestle any market share

148
0:07:27.443,000 --> 0:07:29,000
away from the for-profit sector.

149
0:07:30.2,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And if you think about it, how could one sector

150
0:07:32.418,000 --> 0:07:35,000
possibly take market share away from another sector

151
0:07:35.499,000 --> 0:07:37,000
if it isn't really allowed to market?

152
0:07:38.701,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And if we tell the consumer brands,

153
0:07:40.439,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"You may advertise all the benefits of your product,"

154
0:07:43.019,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but we tell charities, "You cannot advertise all the good that you do,"

155
0:07:46.424,000 --> 0:07:48,000
where do we think the consumer dollars are going to flow?

156
0:07:50.415,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The third area of discrimination is the taking of risk

157
0:07:53.273,000 --> 0:07:56,000
in pursuit of new ideas for generating revenue.

158
0:07:57.388,000 --> 0:08:,000
So Disney can make a new $200 million movie that flops,

159
0:08:01.059,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and nobody calls the attorney general.

160
0:08:03.996,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But you do a little $1 million community fundraiser for the poor,

161
0:08:07.919,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and it doesn't produce a 75 percent profit to the cause in the first 12 months,

162
0:08:11.836,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and your character is called into question.

163
0:08:14.656,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So nonprofits are really reluctant to attempt any brave,

164
0:08:18.116,000 --> 0:08:2,000
daring, giant-scale new fundraising endeavors,

165
0:08:21.067,000 --> 0:08:22,000
for fear that if the thing fails,

166
0:08:22.692,000 --> 0:08:24,000
their reputations will be dragged through the mud.

167
0:08:25.088,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Well, you and I know

168
0:08:26.271,000 --> 0:08:28,000
when you prohibit failure, you kill innovation.

169
0:08:29.119,000 --> 0:08:32,000
If you kill innovation in fundraising, you can't raise more revenue;

170
0:08:32.357,000 --> 0:08:34,000
if you can't raise more revenue, you can't grow;

171
0:08:34.662,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and if you can't grow, you can't possibly solve large social problems.

172
0:08:38.868,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The fourth area is time.

173
0:08:41.36,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So Amazon went for six years without returning any profit to investors,

174
0:08:45.183,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and people had patience.

175
0:08:47.042,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They knew that there was a long-term objective down the line,

176
0:08:49.947,000 --> 0:08:5,000
of building market dominance.

177
0:08:51.557,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But if a nonprofit organization ever had a dream

178
0:08:54.164,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of building magnificent scale that required that for six years,

179
0:08:58.438,000 --> 0:08:59,000
no money was going to go to the needy,

180
0:09:00.326,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it was all going to be invested in building this scale,

181
0:09:02.986,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we would expect a crucifixion.

182
0:09:05.803,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The last area is profit itself.

183
0:09:07.454,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So the for-profit sector can pay people profits

184
0:09:09.994,000 --> 0:09:11,000
in order to attract their capital for their new ideas,

185
0:09:12.591,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but you can't pay profits in a nonprofit sector,

186
0:09:15.731,000 --> 0:09:16,000
so the for-profit sector has a lock

187
0:09:17.727,000 --> 0:09:19,000
on the multi-trillion-dollar capital markets,

188
0:09:20.232,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and the nonprofit sector is starved for growth and risk and idea capital.

189
0:09:26.024,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Well, you put those five things together --

190
0:09:28.064,000 --> 0:09:31,000
you can't use money to lure talent away from the for-profit sector;

191
0:09:31.242,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you can't advertise on anywhere near the scale

192
0:09:33.457,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the for-profit sector does for new customers;

193
0:09:35.835,000 --> 0:09:37,000
you can't take the kinds of risks in pursuit of those customers

194
0:09:38.823,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that the for-profit sector takes;

195
0:09:40.535,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you don't have the same amount of time to find them as the for-profit sector;

196
0:09:44.192,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and you don't have a stock market with which to fund any of this,

197
0:09:47.28,000 --> 0:09:49,000
even if you could do it in the first place --

198
0:09:49.416,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and you've just put the nonprofit sector

199
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
at an extreme disadvantage to the for-profit sector,

200
0:09:54.044,000 --> 0:09:55,000
on every level.

201
0:09:57.321,000 --> 0:10:,000
If we have any doubts about the effects of this separate rule book,

202
0:10:00.511,000 --> 0:10:01,000
this statistic is sobering:

203
0:10:02.059,000 --> 0:10:04,000
From 1970 to 2009,

204
0:10:04.423,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the number of nonprofits that really grew,

205
0:10:07.178,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that crossed the $50 million annual revenue barrier,

206
0:10:10.382,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is 144.

207
0:10:12.534,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In the same time, the number of for-profits that crossed it

208
0:10:15.368,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is 46,136.

209
0:10:18.436,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So we're dealing with social problems that are massive in scale,

210
0:10:21.523,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and our organizations can't generate any scale.

211
0:10:23.873,000 --> 0:10:25,000
All of the scale goes to Coca-Cola and Burger King.

212
0:10:28.388,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So why do we think this way?

213
0:10:31.039,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Well, like most fanatical dogma in America,

214
0:10:35.276,000 --> 0:10:37,000
these ideas come from old Puritan beliefs.

215
0:10:38.741,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The Puritans came here for religious reasons, or so they said,

216
0:10:41.836,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but they also came here because they wanted to make a lot of money.

217
0:10:45.343,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They were pious people,

218
0:10:46.796,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but they were also really aggressive capitalists,

219
0:10:49.835,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and they were accused of extreme forms of profit-making tendencies,

220
0:10:53.379,000 --> 0:10:54,000
compared to the other colonists.

221
0:10:55.784,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But at the same time, the Puritans were Calvinists,

222
0:10:58.804,000 --> 0:11:,000
so they were taught literally to hate themselves.

223
0:11:01.351,000 --> 0:11:04,000
They were taught that self-interest was a raging sea

224
0:11:04.419,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that was a sure path to eternal damnation.

225
0:11:07.84,000 --> 0:11:09,000
This created a real problem for these people.

226
0:11:09.982,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here they've come all the way across the Atlantic to make all this money,

227
0:11:13.523,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but making all this money will get you sent directly to Hell.

228
0:11:16.722,000 --> 0:11:17,000
What were they to do about this?

229
0:11:18.594,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Well, charity became their answer.

230
0:11:20.256,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It became this economic sanctuary,

231
0:11:22.711,000 --> 0:11:25,000
where they could do penance for their profit-making tendencies --

232
0:11:26.354,000 --> 0:11:28,000
at five cents on the dollar.

233
0:11:29.339,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So of course, how could you make money in charity

234
0:11:31.697,000 --> 0:11:33,000
if charity was your penance for making money?

235
0:11:34.442,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Financial incentive was exiled from the realm of helping others,

236
0:11:38.323,000 --> 0:11:41,000
so that it could thrive in the area of making money for yourself,

237
0:11:41.752,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and in 400 years, nothing has intervened

238
0:11:44.943,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to say, "That's counterproductive and that's unfair."

239
0:11:50.375,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now, this ideology gets policed by this one very dangerous question,

240
0:11:54.064,000 --> 0:11:58,000
which is, "What percentage of my donation goes to the cause versus overhead?"

241
0:11:58.653,000 --> 0:12:,000
There are a lot of problems with this question.

242
0:12:00.884,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I'm going to just focus on two.

243
0:12:02.408,000 --> 0:12:06,000
First, it makes us think that overhead is a negative,

244
0:12:06.497,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that it is somehow not part of the cause.

245
0:12:10.282,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But it absolutely is, especially if it's being used for growth.

246
0:12:15.251,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now, this idea that overhead is somehow an enemy of the cause

247
0:12:19.196,000 --> 0:12:21,000
creates this second, much larger problem,

248
0:12:21.721,000 --> 0:12:24,000
which is, it forces organizations to go without the overhead things

249
0:12:25.581,000 --> 0:12:26,000
they really need to grow,

250
0:12:27.213,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in the interest of keeping overhead low.

251
0:12:30.184,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So we've all been taught that charities should spend

252
0:12:32.716,000 --> 0:12:34,000
as little as possible on overhead things like fundraising

253
0:12:35.515,000 --> 0:12:38,000
under the theory that, well, the less money you spend on fundraising,

254
0:12:38.913,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the more money there is available for the cause.

255
0:12:42.595,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Well, that's true if it's a depressing world

256
0:12:44.962,000 --> 0:12:46,000
in which this pie cannot be made any bigger.

257
0:12:48.38,000 --> 0:12:51,000
But if it's a logical world in which investment in fundraising

258
0:12:51.769,000 --> 0:12:54,000
actually raises more funds and makes the pie bigger,

259
0:12:55.279,000 --> 0:12:56,000
then we have it precisely backwards,

260
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
and we should be investing more money, not less, in fundraising,

261
0:13:00.732,000 --> 0:13:01,000
because fundraising is the one thing

262
0:13:02.485,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that has the potential to multiply the amount of money

263
0:13:05.12,000 --> 0:13:07,000
available for the cause that we care about so deeply.

264
0:13:09.747,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I'll give you two examples.

265
0:13:11.064,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We launched the AIDSRides

266
0:13:12.334,000 --> 0:13:15,000
with an initial investment of 50,000 dollars in risk capital.

267
0:13:15.866,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Within nine years, we had multiplied that 1,982 times,

268
0:13:20.869,000 --> 0:13:24,000
into 108 million dollars after all expenses, for AIDS services.

269
0:13:26.478,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We launched the breast cancer three-days

270
0:13:28.415,000 --> 0:13:31,000
with an initial investment of 350,000 dollars in risk capital.

271
0:13:32.243,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Within just five years, we had multiplied that 554 times,

272
0:13:36.997,000 --> 0:13:39,000
into 194 million dollars after all expenses,

273
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:41,000
for breast cancer research.

274
0:13:42.23,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Now, if you were a philanthropist really interested in breast cancer,

275
0:13:45.568,000 --> 0:13:46,000
what would make more sense:

276
0:13:46.885,000 --> 0:13:49,000
go out and find the most innovative researcher in the world

277
0:13:50.76,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and give her 350,000 dollars for research,

278
0:13:54.164,000 --> 0:13:57,000
or give her fundraising department the 350,000 dollars

279
0:13:57.807,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to multiply it into 194 million dollars for breast cancer research?

280
0:14:03.06,000 --> 0:14:06,000
2002 was our most successful year ever.

281
0:14:06.109,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We netted for breast cancer alone, that year alone,

282
0:14:09.267,000 --> 0:14:12,000
71 million dollars after all expenses.

283
0:14:13.113,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And then we went out of business,

284
0:14:15.457,000 --> 0:14:16,000
suddenly and traumatically.

285
0:14:18.569,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Why? Well, the short story is, our sponsors split on us.

286
0:14:23.307,000 --> 0:14:25,000
They wanted to distance themselves from us

287
0:14:25.394,000 --> 0:14:27,000
because we were being crucified in the media

288
0:14:28.275,000 --> 0:14:31,000
for investing 40 percent of the gross in recruitment

289
0:14:31.677,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and customer service and the magic of the experience,

290
0:14:35.065,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and there is no accounting terminology to describe

291
0:14:37.952,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that kind of investment in growth and in the future,

292
0:14:41.126,000 --> 0:14:43,000
other than this demonic label of "overhead."

293
0:14:46.038,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So on one day, all 350 of our great employees

294
0:14:51.436,000 --> 0:14:52,000
lost their jobs ...

295
0:14:55.92,000 --> 0:14:56,000
because they were labeled "overhead."

296
0:14:59.078,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Our sponsor went and tried the events on their own.

297
0:15:01.642,000 --> 0:15:02,000
The overhead went up.

298
0:15:02.999,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Net income for breast cancer research went down by 84 percent,

299
0:15:06.792,000 --> 0:15:08,000
or 60 million dollars, in one year.

300
0:15:11.244,000 --> 0:15:16,000
This is what happens when we confuse morality with frugality.

301
0:15:18.619,000 --> 0:15:21,000
We've all been taught that the bake sale with five percent overhead

302
0:15:21.809,000 --> 0:15:23,000
is morally superior to the professional fundraising enterprise

303
0:15:24.784,000 --> 0:15:25,000
with 40 percent overhead,

304
0:15:26.474,000 --> 0:15:29,000
but we're missing the most important piece of information, which is:

305
0:15:29.775,000 --> 0:15:31,000
What is the actual size of these pies?

306
0:15:32.934,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Who cares if the bake sale only has five percent overhead if it's tiny?

307
0:15:37.573,000 --> 0:15:39,000
What if the bake sale only netted 71 dollars for charity

308
0:15:40.429,000 --> 0:15:42,000
because it made no investment in its scale

309
0:15:42.477,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and the professional fundraising enterprise netted

310
0:15:44.882,000 --> 0:15:46,000
71 million dollars because it did?

311
0:15:47.831,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Now which pie would we prefer,

312
0:15:49.45,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and which pie do we think people who are hungry would prefer?

313
0:15:53.577,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Here's how all of this impacts the big picture.

314
0:15:57.251,000 --> 0:16:,000
I said that charitable giving is two percent of GDP in the United States.

315
0:16:00.752,000 --> 0:16:02,000
That's about 300 billion dollars a year.

316
0:16:03.466,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But only about 20 percent of that, or 60 billion dollars,

317
0:16:06.853,000 --> 0:16:07,000
goes to health and human services causes.

318
0:16:08.83,000 --> 0:16:11,000
The rest goes to religion and higher education and hospitals,

319
0:16:12.48,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and that 60 billion dollars is not nearly enough

320
0:16:15.402,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to tackle these problems.

321
0:16:17.609,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But if we could move charitable giving from two percent of GDP,

322
0:16:21.983,000 --> 0:16:27,000
up just one step to three percent of GDP, by investing in that growth,

323
0:16:28.645,000 --> 0:16:32,000
that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions,

324
0:16:32.704,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and if that money could go disproportionately

325
0:16:35.086,000 --> 0:16:36,000
to health and human services charities,

326
0:16:36.969,000 --> 0:16:39,000
because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth,

327
0:16:40.232,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector.

328
0:16:44.573,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Now we're talking scale.

329
0:16:46.205,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Now we're talking the potential for real change.

330
0:16:49.831,000 --> 0:16:52,000
But it's never going to happen by forcing these organizations

331
0:16:52.95,000 --> 0:16:53,000
to lower their horizons

332
0:16:54.802,000 --> 0:16:57,000
to the demoralizing objective of keeping their overhead low.

333
0:17:00.397,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Our generation does not want its epitaph to read,

334
0:17:03.753,000 --> 0:17:05,000
"We kept charity overhead low."

335
0:17:05.904,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Laughter)

336
0:17:10.452,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Applause)

337
0:17:14.308,000 --> 0:17:16,000
We want it to read that we changed the world,

338
0:17:16.539,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and that part of the way we did that

339
0:17:18.278,000 --> 0:17:2,000
was by changing the way we think about these things.

340
0:17:21.566,000 --> 0:17:23,000
So the next time you're looking at a charity,

341
0:17:23.717,000 --> 0:17:25,000
don't ask about the rate of their overhead.

342
0:17:25.822,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Ask about the scale of their dreams,

343
0:17:28.161,000 --> 0:17:31,000
their Apple-, Google-, Amazon-scale dreams,

344
0:17:31.741,000 --> 0:17:33,000
how they measure their progress toward those dreams,

345
0:17:34.234,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and what resources they need to make them come true,

346
0:17:36.893,000 --> 0:17:37,000
regardless of what the overhead is.

347
0:17:38.68,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Who cares what the overhead is

348
0:17:40.308,000 --> 0:17:42,000
if these problems are actually getting solved?

349
0:17:43.627,000 --> 0:17:45,000
If we can have that kind of generosity --

350
0:17:46.627,000 --> 0:17:48,000
a generosity of thought --

351
0:17:48.779,000 --> 0:17:5,000
then the non-profit sector can play a massive role

352
0:17:51.679,000 --> 0:17:54,000
in changing the world for all those citizens

353
0:17:55.135,000 --> 0:17:57,000
most desperately in need of it to change.

354
0:18:01.076,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And if that can be our generation's enduring legacy --

355
0:18:05.922,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that we took responsibility

356
0:18:08.818,000 --> 0:18:1,000
for the thinking that had been handed down to us,

357
0:18:11.337,000 --> 0:18:13,000
that we revisited it, we revised it,

358
0:18:14.177,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and we reinvented the whole way humanity thinks about changing things,

359
0:18:18.283,000 --> 0:18:21,000
forever, for everyone --

360
0:18:21.783,000 --> 0:18:24,000
well, I thought I would let the kids sum up what that would be.

361
0:18:26.561,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Annalisa Smith-Pallotta: That would be

362
0:18:28.436,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Sage Smith-Pallotta: a real social

363
0:18:30.442,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Rider Smith-Pallotta: innovation.

364
0:18:32.688,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Dan Pallotta: Thank you very much.

365
0:18:34.363,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Thank you.

366
0:18:35.642,000 --> 0:18:41,000
(Applause)

367
0:18:44.778,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Thank you.

368
0:18:45.975,000 --> 0:18:48,000
(Applause)

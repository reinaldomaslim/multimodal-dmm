1
0:00:13.563,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hi. My name is Aparna.

2
0:00:16.118,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I am a shopaholic --

3
0:00:18.487,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:19.658,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I'm addicted to online returns.

5
0:00:22.488,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.513,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Well, at least I was.

7
0:00:27.83,000 --> 0:00:32,000
At one time, I had two or three packages of clothing delivered to me

8
0:00:32.87,000 --> 0:00:33,000
every other day.

9
0:00:34.728,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I would intentionally buy the same item

10
0:00:37.518,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in a couple different sizes and many colors,

11
0:00:40.839,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because I did not know what I really wanted.

12
0:00:43.651,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I overordered, I tried things on, and then I sent what didn't work back.

13
0:00:50.331,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Once my daughter was watching me return some of those packages back,

14
0:00:54.324,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and she said, "Mom, I think you have a problem."

15
0:00:56.649,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:58.698,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I didn't think so.

17
0:00:59.89,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I mean, it's free shipping and free returns, right?

18
0:01:02.512,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:04.424,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I didn't even think twice about it,

20
0:01:07.214,000 --> 0:01:11,000
until I heard a statistic at work that shocked me.

21
0:01:12.431,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You see, I'm a global solutions director for top-tier retail,

22
0:01:16.268,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and we were in a meeting with one of my largest customers,

23
0:01:19.563,000 --> 0:01:21,000
discussing how to streamline costs.

24
0:01:22.482,000 --> 0:01:25,000
One of their biggest concerns was managing returns.

25
0:01:26.218,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Just this past holiday season alone,

26
0:01:29.486,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they had 7.5 million pieces of clothing returned to them.

27
0:01:36.212,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I could not stop thinking about it.

28
0:01:38.325,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What happens to all these returned clothes?

29
0:01:41.31,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So I came home and researched.

30
0:01:44.818,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I learned that every year,

31
0:01:48.455,000 --> 0:01:54,000
four billion pounds of returned clothing ends up in the landfill.

32
0:01:55.864,000 --> 0:02:01,000
That's like every resident in the US did a load of laundry last night

33
0:02:01.896,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and decided to throw it in the trash today.

34
0:02:05.278,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I was horrified.

35
0:02:08.363,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'm like, "Of all people,

36
0:02:10.584,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I should be able to help prevent this."

37
0:02:12.791,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:13.953,000 --> 0:02:17,000
My job is to find solutions to logistical issues like these --

39
0:02:18.899,000 --> 0:02:19,000
not create them.

40
0:02:20.937,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So this issue became very personal to me.

41
0:02:25.011,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I said, "You know what? We have to solve this."

42
0:02:27.717,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And we can, with some of the existing systems we already have in place.

43
0:02:33.289,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And then I started to wonder: How did we get here?

44
0:02:36.936,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I mean, it was only like six years ago when a study recommended

45
0:02:41.677,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that offering free online returns would drive customers to spend more.

46
0:02:46.814,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We started seeing companies offering free online returns

47
0:02:50.266,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to drive more sales and provide a better experience.

48
0:02:54.611,000 --> 0:02:55,000
What we didn't realize

49
0:02:56.287,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is that this would lead to more items being returned as well.

50
0:03:01.075,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In the US, companies lost $351 billion in sales

51
0:03:08.087,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in 2017 alone.

52
0:03:11.067,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Retailers are scrambling to recover their losses.

53
0:03:15.382,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They try to place that returned item online to be sold again,

54
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or they'll sell it to a discount partner

55
0:03:21.066,000 --> 0:03:22,000
or a liquidator.

56
0:03:22.818,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Basically, if companies cannot find a place for this item

57
0:03:26.561,000 --> 0:03:28,000
quickly and economically,

58
0:03:28.758,000 --> 0:03:3,000
its place becomes the trash.

59
0:03:32.413,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Suddenly, I felt very guilty for being that shopper,

60
0:03:37.041,000 --> 0:03:39,000
somebody who contributes to this.

61
0:03:39.659,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Who would have thought my innocent shopping behavior

62
0:03:42.707,000 --> 0:03:44,000
would be hurting not only me,

63
0:03:45.693,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but our planet as well?

64
0:03:48.4,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And as I thought about what to do,

65
0:03:50.988,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I kept thinking:

66
0:03:52.783,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Why does the item have to be returned to the retailer in the first place?

67
0:03:58.454,000 --> 0:04:,000
What if there was another way,

68
0:04:01.972,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a win-win for everyone?

69
0:04:05.348,000 --> 0:04:09,000
What if when a person is trying to return something,

70
0:04:09.442,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it could go to the next shopper who wants it,

71
0:04:12.622,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and not the retailer?

72
0:04:14.99,000 --> 0:04:17,000
What if, instead of a return,

73
0:04:18.847,000 --> 0:04:22,000
they could do what I call a "green turn"?

74
0:04:24.783,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Consumers could use an app to take pictures of the item

75
0:04:28.774,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and verify the condition while returning it.

76
0:04:31.954,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Artificial intelligence systems could then sort these clothes by condition --

77
0:04:37.093,000 --> 0:04:39,000
mint condition or slightly used --

78
0:04:39.401,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and direct it to the next appropriate person.

79
0:04:42.059,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Mint-condition clothes could automatically go to the next buyer,

80
0:04:45.81,000 --> 0:04:47,000
while slightly used clothes could be marked down

81
0:04:48.493,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and offered online again.

82
0:04:50.686,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The retailer can decide the business rules

83
0:04:53.021,000 --> 0:04:56,000
on the number of times a particular item can be resold.

84
0:04:57.616,000 --> 0:05:01,000
All that the consumer would need to do is obtain a mobile code,

85
0:05:02.044,000 --> 0:05:05,000
take it to the nearest shipping place to be packed and shipped,

86
0:05:05.668,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and off it goes from one buyer to the next,

87
0:05:08.875,000 --> 0:05:09,000
not the landfill.

88
0:05:11.565,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now you will ask,

89
0:05:13.164,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"Would people really go through all this trouble?"

90
0:05:16.359,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I think they would if they had incentives,

91
0:05:19.742,000 --> 0:05:21,000
like loyalty points or cash back.

92
0:05:22.698,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Let's call it "green cash."

93
0:05:25.419,000 --> 0:05:28,000
There would be a whole new opportunity to make money

94
0:05:28.596,000 --> 0:05:31,000
from this new customer base looking to buy these returns.

95
0:05:33.026,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This system would make a fun thing like shopping

96
0:05:36.365,000 --> 0:05:37,000
a spiritual experience

97
0:05:38.165,000 --> 0:05:4,000
that helps save our planet.

98
0:05:40.834,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Applause)

99
0:05:49.144,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This is doable

100
0:05:50.565,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and would probably take six months to weave some of our existing systems

101
0:05:54.639,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and run a pilot.

102
0:05:57.208,000 --> 0:06:,000
Even before any of these logistical systems are in place,

103
0:06:00.968,000 --> 0:06:03,000
each of us shoppers can act now,

104
0:06:05.82,000 --> 0:06:1,000
if every single adult in the US made a few small changes

105
0:06:11.027,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to our shopping behavior.

106
0:06:13.128,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Take the extra time to research and think --

107
0:06:17.539,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Do I really need this item?

108
0:06:20.425,000 --> 0:06:23,000
No: Do I really want this item? --

109
0:06:24.884,000 --> 0:06:25,000
before making a purchase.

110
0:06:26.978,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And if every one of us adults in the US

111
0:06:30.045,000 --> 0:06:33,000
returned five less items this year,

112
0:06:33.654,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we would keep 240 million pounds of clothes out of the landfill.

113
0:06:40.443,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Six percent reduction, just like that.

114
0:06:44.125,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This environmental problem that we have created

115
0:06:48.028,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is not thousands of years away;

116
0:06:50.416,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it's happening today,

117
0:06:52.169,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and must stop now to prevent growing landfills across the globe.

118
0:06:58.184,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I want to leave my daughter and my daughter's daughter

119
0:07:01.379,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a better and cleaner place than I found it,

120
0:07:04.912,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so I have not only stopped overordering,

121
0:07:08.004,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I recycle religiously as well.

122
0:07:10.604,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And you can, too. It's not difficult.

123
0:07:13.739,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Before we fill our shopping carts and our landfills

124
0:07:17.667,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with extra items that we don't want,

125
0:07:20.322,000 --> 0:07:23,000
let's pause next time we are shopping online

126
0:07:23.962,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and think twice about what we all hopefully really do want:

127
0:07:29.67,000 --> 0:07:31,000
a beautiful Earth to call home.

128
0:07:32.394,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Thank you.

129
0:07:33.58,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Applause)

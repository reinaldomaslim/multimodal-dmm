1
0:00:13.031,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Paula Stone Williams: So, I was the CEO of a large, religious nonprofit,

2
0:00:17.878,000 --> 0:00:21,000
spoke at some of the largest churches in America,

3
0:00:22.246,000 --> 0:00:25,000
was on television in 70 different markets,

4
0:00:25.724,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but more than anything else,

5
0:00:28.488,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I just wanted to be a good parent.

6
0:00:31.577,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I told all three of my children,

7
0:00:33.308,000 --> 0:00:34,000
"When the going gets tough,

8
0:00:35.261,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you have to choose the road less traveled,

9
0:00:38.375,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the narrow path."

10
0:00:39.693,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I had no idea how difficult that was going to become.

11
0:00:45.432,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I knew from the time I was three or four years of age

12
0:00:47.933,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that I was transgender.

13
0:00:50.395,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I knew if I came out, I would lose everything.

14
0:00:54.37,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But the call toward authenticity is sacred

15
0:00:58.281,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and for the greater good,

16
0:01:00.288,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it asks you to trust that the truth not only sets you free,

17
0:01:04.749,000 --> 0:01:06,000
it will set everyone free.

18
0:01:08.018,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I decided to stake my life on it.

19
0:01:10.891,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So I came out.

20
0:01:12.692,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Turns out, if you spend most of your life

21
0:01:15.029,000 --> 0:01:17,000
working in the conservative religious world,

22
0:01:17.315,000 --> 0:01:21,000
coming out as transgender is not all that great for your career.

23
0:01:21.437,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:24.08,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Who knew?

25
0:01:25.254,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:28.12,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Within seven days, I lost every single one of my jobs.

27
0:01:33.572,000 --> 0:01:36,000
My family was supportive but struggling.

28
0:01:36.669,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Most of my friends and coworkers had rejected me;

29
0:01:39.218,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the rest were confused.

30
0:01:41.473,000 --> 0:01:44,000
One friend said, "You really messed with me."

31
0:01:45.503,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I said, "Yeah, well, get in line."

32
0:01:48.161,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They said, "You were my only example of an alpha male who was gentle."

33
0:01:53.958,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I thought, "Oh. You're right."

34
0:01:57.108,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I was an alpha male.

35
0:01:59.396,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I was gentle.

36
0:02:01.715,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And if it was hard for him,

37
0:02:04.089,000 --> 0:02:07,000
how much more difficult was it for my own son?

38
0:02:09.13,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Jonathan Williams: Estrangement was not an option.

39
0:02:11.527,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It was Father's Day and my girls brought me craft beer

40
0:02:14.591,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and a homemade jar of pickles, which, in my estimation,

41
0:02:17.223,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is the perfect Father's Day gift.

42
0:02:19.051,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:20.226,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But the question remained:

44
0:02:22.089,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Do I call my own father?

45
0:02:24.134,000 --> 0:02:26,000
To call him, and I continue down this spiral of denial,

46
0:02:26.96,000 --> 0:02:27,000
pretending that my dad was still --

47
0:02:28.709,000 --> 0:02:3,000
well, my dad.

48
0:02:31.335,000 --> 0:02:34,000
To not call was to acknowledge that everything had changed.

49
0:02:35.306,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It meant that I was in for years of pain and mourning and sadness,

50
0:02:40.384,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but ultimately, hope for reconciliation.

51
0:02:44.465,000 --> 0:02:47,000
There's no playbook for when one's father of 30 plus years decides to transition

52
0:02:48.402,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to the female gender.

53
0:02:50.071,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But my dad did teach me one thing.

54
0:02:52.29,000 --> 0:02:55,000
He said the road to redemption always comes from choosing the narrow path.

55
0:02:56.906,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And so I decided not to call that day,

56
0:02:58.912,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and a few months later, Paula flew out and met me at a hotel in New York,

57
0:03:02.565,000 --> 0:03:03,000
my wife and I.

58
0:03:04.315,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I knocked on the door, and this woman answered.

59
0:03:06.654,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It definitely wasn't my dad.

60
0:03:09.839,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"It's good to see you," she said.

61
0:03:11.834,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It didn't sound like my dad, either.

62
0:03:14.376,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We went to lunch, and the waiter came to take our order.

63
0:03:17.03,000 --> 0:03:18,000
He said, "Let's start with the ladies,"

64
0:03:18.89,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but there was only one lady at the table and it was my wife,

65
0:03:21.73,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and -- oh my God, there are two women at the table.

66
0:03:24.237,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And my dad ordered something like lettuce,

67
0:03:26.267,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and I was like, I have fries on my plate.

68
0:03:28.244,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Did my dad like fries? I don't remember.

69
0:03:31.367,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I think he liked them.

70
0:03:33.524,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But she wasn't eating them.

71
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Here's this woman who knew everything about me,

72
0:03:39.947,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and I knew nothing about her.

73
0:03:42.83,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I don't even remember saying goodbye.

74
0:03:46.721,000 --> 0:03:47,000
PSW: All I could think about that day

75
0:03:48.527,000 --> 0:03:5,000
was that it was late September in New York,

76
0:03:50.607,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I was wearing white jeans.

77
0:03:53.394,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:54.522,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You don't wear white after Labor Day in New York.

79
0:03:58.675,000 --> 0:03:59,000
There was a knock at the door,

80
0:04:00.162,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and all I could think about was, here I stand in my wrong jeans.

81
0:04:03.975,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then I saw these big, blue eyes I love so much,

82
0:04:06.418,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and they were staring back at me in disbelief.

83
0:04:09.012,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I thought, "Oh, this is not going to be easy."

84
0:04:13.66,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When one person in a family transitions,

85
0:04:16.728,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the entire family transitions whether they want to or not.

86
0:04:21.083,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, for those on the fringes it was easy.

87
0:04:23.702,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The liberals said, "Oh, wonderful!

88
0:04:25.555,000 --> 0:04:27,000
She's found her truth, how delightful."

89
0:04:27.858,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And the conservatives said, "That's messed up, I'm out of here."

90
0:04:30.968,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:32.118,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But for my family, neither extreme was going to work.

92
0:04:36.052,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Their anger, their hurt,

93
0:04:39.127,000 --> 0:04:41,000
their love and loyalty --

94
0:04:41.85,000 --> 0:04:44,000
all of it had to be brought on to the road of trials.

95
0:04:47.333,000 --> 0:04:48,000
JW: Was it all a lie?

96
0:04:48.913,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Every game of catch in the front yard, the Mets season tickets --

97
0:04:52.057,000 --> 0:04:55,000
was that with my dad or was that with her?

98
0:04:56.503,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I remember this one time,

99
0:04:58.106,000 --> 0:05:,000
my dad took me on a bike ride through Heckscher Park

100
0:05:00.59,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to teach me about sex.

101
0:05:02.276,000 --> 0:05:06,000
He explained the parts of the body that I now know he wished weren't hers.

102
0:05:08.308,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Had my father ever even existed?

103
0:05:11.508,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, grief --

104
0:05:12.73,000 --> 0:05:13,000
grief is without rules.

105
0:05:15.332,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Grief borrows your car without asking,

106
0:05:17.364,000 --> 0:05:18,000
wrecks it

107
0:05:18.544,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and then doesn't apologize.

108
0:05:20.312,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I was a wreck.

109
0:05:22.018,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This was heavy.

110
0:05:23.192,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I retreated into myself.

111
0:05:24.418,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I was angry.

112
0:05:25.698,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I felt betrayed.

113
0:05:27.762,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I guess I should have known

114
0:05:29.263,000 --> 0:05:31,000
by the fact that you encouraged me to be a Mets fan

115
0:05:31.67,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that you were preparing me for life's really big disappointments.

116
0:05:34.792,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:35.866,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's true.

118
0:05:37.678,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And yet, there were the games of catch,

119
0:05:39.78,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and there were the season tickets

120
0:05:41.396,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches every Saturday

121
0:05:43.832,000 --> 0:05:44,000
from the best bagel place on Long Island.

122
0:05:45.833,000 --> 0:05:47,000
My father lived this life he didn't want to live,

123
0:05:48.157,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but he lived it so that I could have a dad.

124
0:05:52.545,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I stopped wondering if my dad had ever existed.

125
0:05:55.991,000 --> 0:06:,000
He had existed -- willfully, consciously, intentionally --

126
0:06:01.117,000 --> 0:06:03,000
each and every day of my growing up.

127
0:06:03.993,000 --> 0:06:04,000
For that, I was thankful.

128
0:06:06.506,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Paula's body was hers now and her transformation was complete,

129
0:06:10.172,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but my transformation was just beginning.

130
0:06:12.558,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I had another trial, another journey, another choice to heed my father's advice

131
0:06:16.718,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and continue down that narrow path.

132
0:06:21.088,000 --> 0:06:24,000
PSW: So most days I believe there is a God.

133
0:06:24.466,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Tuesdays and Thursdays can be tough,

134
0:06:26.84,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and any day that you're on the New Jersey Turnpike.

135
0:06:29.445,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I mean, really, you know?

136
0:06:30.772,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:31.767,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's hard to believe in God when your soul is in the wrong body.

138
0:06:35.869,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Still, somehow I ended up in ministry.

139
0:06:38.68,000 --> 0:06:4,000
When I lost all my jobs, it was nothing personal.

140
0:06:41.368,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It's what religious tribes do.

141
0:06:43.972,000 --> 0:06:46,000
They believe an enemy is necessary for the tribe to survive,

142
0:06:47.382,000 --> 0:06:49,000
so where no enemy exists,

143
0:06:49.43,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they create one.

144
0:06:51.245,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Right now, sexual minorities are the enemy;

145
0:06:53.546,000 --> 0:06:55,000
my departure was swift and sure.

146
0:06:56.76,000 --> 0:07:,000
I was surprised when my son left his job teaching in West Philadelphia

147
0:07:01.35,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to go into the ministry.

148
0:07:03.052,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I did not see that one coming.

149
0:07:06.145,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And now I wondered:

150
0:07:08.226,000 --> 0:07:09,000
What would he do?

151
0:07:10.172,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I didn't have to wait that long to find an answer.

152
0:07:13.392,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Six months after that first visit,

153
0:07:16.173,000 --> 0:07:18,000
he invited me back to New York.

154
0:07:19.371,000 --> 0:07:2,000
JW: The designers of the Brooklyn Bridge,

155
0:07:21.348,000 --> 0:07:22,000
they had their share of bad luck.

156
0:07:23.46,000 --> 0:07:26,000
John Roebling, he died shortly after the bridge's construction began.

157
0:07:26.914,000 --> 0:07:27,000
His son Washington took over,

158
0:07:28.327,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but he suffered from decompression sickness.

159
0:07:30.678,000 --> 0:07:33,000
His wife Emily became the surrogate executive engineer

160
0:07:33.704,000 --> 0:07:34,000
who oversaw the bridge's completion.

161
0:07:36.227,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Father and son,

162
0:07:37.724,000 --> 0:07:38,000
John and Washington,

163
0:07:39.448,000 --> 0:07:4,000
done in by their work.

164
0:07:41.672,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It was this sunny day in May

165
0:07:43.218,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and my father and I sat in the shadow of that Brooklyn Bridge.

166
0:07:47.016,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Would our lives follow the Roeblings' --

167
0:07:49.001,000 --> 0:07:51,000
father and son, done in by our work?

168
0:07:52.751,000 --> 0:07:54,000
My father thought that her friends in church

169
0:07:55.206,000 --> 0:07:57,000
would carry her through her transition,

170
0:07:57.403,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and they did not.

171
0:07:59.497,000 --> 0:08:,000
They ditched her and they clung to me.

172
0:08:01.361,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I was the pastor of a new church in Brooklyn.

173
0:08:03.529,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This wonderful group of forward-thinking people,

174
0:08:06.151,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and yet, we were financially tied to really conservative churches.

175
0:08:10.016,000 --> 0:08:14,000
To hold space for Paula meant jeopardizing our own church's livelihood.

176
0:08:15.081,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I sort of straddled the line between these warring worlds.

177
0:08:18.985,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So I said to my dad,

178
0:08:20.197,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"Dad, I still live and work in your old world.

179
0:08:22.68,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Is it possible that you might extend an olive branch for my sake?"

180
0:08:27.325,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And her response was impassioned.

181
0:08:32.01,000 --> 0:08:35,000
You said to me, "Do you have any idea what it feels like

182
0:08:35.89,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to finally show yourself to your true friends

183
0:08:38.098,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and have them completely reject you?

184
0:08:40.606,000 --> 0:08:41,000
To ask you to live a lie?

185
0:08:42.115,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Do you know what that feels like?"

186
0:08:45.105,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And I didn't know what that felt like.

187
0:08:48.721,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But I knew I had a decision to make.

188
0:08:51.354,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It was the decision to continue down that narrow path through nights,

189
0:08:55.093,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but for the first time,

190
0:08:57.073,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I caught a glimpse of light.

191
0:08:59.88,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I cannot ask my father to be anything other than her true self.

192
0:09:06.259,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

193
0:09:12.494,000 --> 0:09:14,000
PSW: So as we sat by the river that day,

194
0:09:15.345,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Jonathan talked about his pain, his suffering, his grief, his confusion.

195
0:09:21.21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
He brought all of himself to that conversation,

196
0:09:26.956,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and it tore at me

197
0:09:31.346,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to be the cause of such pain.

198
0:09:36.566,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But as he talked, there was something redemptive going on,

199
0:09:40.304,000 --> 0:09:42,000
full of tension but possibility,

200
0:09:43.275,000 --> 0:09:45,000
grounded in that narrow path.

201
0:09:47.169,000 --> 0:09:51,000
He said, "This is always going to be hard.

202
0:09:51.384,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It always will be.

203
0:09:52.755,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But Dad,

204
0:09:54.739,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I love you."

205
0:09:56.954,000 --> 0:09:59,000
My son is the best of me and more.

206
0:10:00.975,000 --> 0:10:02,000
He's bold and strong,

207
0:10:03.538,000 --> 0:10:05,000
sensitive and thoughtful.

208
0:10:06.781,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I guess you could say,

209
0:10:10.087,000 --> 0:10:12,000
he's an alpha male who's gentle.

210
0:10:14.703,000 --> 0:10:17,000
JW: It was time for my daughters to meet their -- Paula.

211
0:10:18.003,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We went back to my apartment,

212
0:10:19.42,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and my daughters were coloring at the dining room table,

213
0:10:22.097,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and there was this awkward silence.

214
0:10:23.806,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And finally, my youngest asked a single, confident question.

215
0:10:28.241,000 --> 0:10:31,000
"So, Grandpa, do you have a penis?"

216
0:10:31.51,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:34.186,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And after the tension abated and the laughter subsided,

218
0:10:36.782,000 --> 0:10:39,000
my girls took their grandpa back into their room

219
0:10:39.903,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and showed her their new toys,

220
0:10:41.36,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and they christened her with a new name.

221
0:10:43.316,000 --> 0:10:45,000
They called her "GrandPaula."

222
0:10:45.361,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:49.629,000 --> 0:10:52,000
PSW: So this past summer, I had all five of my granddaughters at my home,

224
0:10:53.58,000 --> 0:10:55,000
there in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.

225
0:10:56.153,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We went swimming in the cool waters of the river

226
0:10:58.429,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that flows through our little town.

227
0:11:00.123,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And one day, one of Jonathan's girls said to me,

228
0:11:02.411,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"GrandPaula, can we go tubing on the river?"

229
0:11:06.303,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And I said, "Well, you know,

230
0:11:07.789,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I'd really wait until your daddy gets here for that.

231
0:11:10.307,000 --> 0:11:12,000
That feels to me like that ought to be his call."

232
0:11:12.674,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And she said, "Oh, but GrandPaula,

233
0:11:16.704,000 --> 0:11:18,000
he'll exactly make the same decision you would.

234
0:11:19.377,000 --> 0:11:21,000
He's a lot like you, you know."

235
0:11:21.787,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Laughter)

236
0:11:23.355,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And I thought, yeah, he is a lot like me,

237
0:11:28.489,000 --> 0:11:31,000
both of us determined to find the narrow path

238
0:11:31.747,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and follow it through the long, dark night,

239
0:11:35.843,000 --> 0:11:37,000
all the way to the light of dawn.

240
0:11:39.711,000 --> 0:11:41,000
JW: Have you ever noticed that a child who is secure,

241
0:11:42.239,000 --> 0:11:43,000
a child who knows love,

242
0:11:43.515,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that child will dance?

243
0:11:45.815,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They wave their arms,

244
0:11:47.555,000 --> 0:11:49,000
they kick their legs to music that only they can hear.

245
0:11:50.413,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's the music of a child who is safe and unharmed

246
0:11:54.051,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and wholly loved.

247
0:11:57.419,000 --> 0:11:59,000
The day after my children met their GrandPaula,

248
0:11:59.702,000 --> 0:12:,000
she took them to go get doughnuts,

249
0:12:01.378,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and I watched as they walked down the street,

250
0:12:03.534,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and my girls took my father's arms,

251
0:12:05.245,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and they danced.

252
0:12:07.606,000 --> 0:12:09,000
My father's arms swung wildly.

253
0:12:11.012,000 --> 0:12:14,000
You bought them one too many doughnuts, because you always do --

254
0:12:14.128,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Laughter)

255
0:12:15.191,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I watched my older daughter take a bite of her doughnut,

256
0:12:17.869,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and she unleashed two jumps and a twirl.

257
0:12:20.294,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It was perfect.

258
0:12:22.931,000 --> 0:12:23,000
That narrow path,

259
0:12:24.369,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it always has its share of burdens and challenges.

260
0:12:27.659,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But I was certain that we were going to see this through to redemption.

261
0:12:32.77,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I looked at my dad

262
0:12:33.944,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I looked at my girls who were dancing and eating their doughnuts,

263
0:12:37.957,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and I said aloud to no one in particular,

264
0:12:40.329,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I said, "This ...

265
0:12:42.503,000 --> 0:12:44,000
this is how God sees my dad."

266
0:12:46.033,000 --> 0:12:48,000
My father was literally born again.

267
0:12:49.059,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And by choosing the narrow path of redemption,

268
0:12:52.176,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I was born again with her.

269
0:12:54.234,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Thank you.

270
0:12:55.912,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause and cheers)

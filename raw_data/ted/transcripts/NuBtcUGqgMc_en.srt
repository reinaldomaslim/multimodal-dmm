If you do it right, it should sound like:

3
0:00:14.69,000 --> 0:00:17,000
TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat, TICK-tat.

4
0:00:18.593,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If you do it wrong, it sounds like:

5
0:00:20.324,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Tick-TAT, tick-TAT, tick-TAT.

[Kyra Gaunt on the Jump Rope]

8
0:00:28.321,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The jump rope is such a simple object.

9
0:00:31.918,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It can be made out of rope, a clothesline, twine.

10
0:00:34.541,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It has, like, a twirl on it. (Laughs)

11
0:00:37.091,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm not sure how to describe that.

12
0:00:38.887,000 --> 0:00:4,000
What's important is that it has a certain weight,

13
0:00:41.416,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and that they have that kind of whip sound.

14
0:00:44.817,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's not clear what the origin of the jump rope is.

15
0:00:48.639,000 --> 0:00:51,000
There's some evidence that it began in ancient Egypt, Phoenicia,

16
0:00:52.599,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and then it most likely traveled to North America with Dutch settlers.

17
0:00:56.695,000 --> 0:01:,000
The rope became a big thing when women's clothes became more fitted

18
0:01:01.357,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and the pantaloon came into being.

19
0:01:03.659,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And so, girls were able to jump rope

20
0:01:06.563,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because their skirts wouldn't catch the ropes.

21
0:01:09.293,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Governesses used it to train their wards to jump rope.

22
0:01:13.197,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Even formerly enslaved African children in the antebellum South

23
0:01:16.462,000 --> 0:01:17,000
jumped rope, too.

24
0:01:17.928,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In the 1950s, in Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens,

25
0:01:22.563,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you could see on the sidewalk, lots of girls playing with ropes.

26
0:01:27.063,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Sometimes they would take two ropes and turn them as a single rope together,

27
0:01:30.809,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but you could separate them and turn them in like an eggbeater on each other.

28
0:01:34.619,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The skipping rope was like a steady timeline --

29
0:01:37.156,000 --> 0:01:38,000
tick, tick, tick, tick --

30
0:01:38.697,000 --> 0:01:42,000
upon which you can add rhymes and rhythms and chants.

31
0:01:42.783,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Those ropes created a space

32
0:01:44.855,000 --> 0:01:46,000
where we were able to contribute to something

33
0:01:47.101,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that was far greater than the neighborhood.

34
0:01:49.602,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Double Dutch jump rope remains a powerful symbol of culture and identity

35
0:01:53.312,000 --> 0:01:54,000
for black women.

36
0:01:54.489,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Back from the 1950s to the 1970s,

37
0:01:56.831,000 --> 0:01:58,000
girls weren't supposed to play sports.

38
0:01:58.99,000 --> 0:02:,000
Boys played baseball, basketball and football,

39
0:02:01.815,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and girls weren't allowed.

40
0:02:03.18,000 --> 0:02:05,000
A lot has changed, but in that era,

41
0:02:05.728,000 --> 0:02:06,000
girls would rule the playground.

42
0:02:07.593,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They'd make sure that boys weren't a part of that.

43
0:02:10.037,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's their space, it's a girl-power space.

44
0:02:12.307,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's where they get to shine.

45
0:02:14.427,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But I also think it's for boys,

46
0:02:16.013,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because boys overheard those,

47
0:02:17.513,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which is why, I think, so many hip-hop artists

48
0:02:19.981,000 --> 0:02:22,000
sampled from things that they heard in black girls' game songs.

49
0:02:23.301,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Chanting) ... cold, thick shake, act like you know how to flip,

50
0:02:26.401,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Filet-O-Fish, Quarter Pounder, french fries, ice cold, thick shake,

51
0:02:29.426,000 --> 0:02:3,000
act like you know how to jump.

52
0:02:30.905,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Why "Country Grammar" by Nelly became a Grammy Award-winning single

53
0:02:34.949,000 --> 0:02:36,000
was because people already knew

54
0:02:37.331,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"We're going down down baby your street in a Range Rover ... "

55
0:02:40.83,000 --> 0:02:43,000
That's the beginning of "Down down, baby, down down the roller coaster,

56
0:02:44.267,000 --> 0:02:46,000
sweet, sweet baby, I'll never let you go."

57
0:02:46.72,000 --> 0:02:48,000
All people who grew up in any black urban community

58
0:02:49.593,000 --> 0:02:51,000
would know that music.

59
0:02:51.902,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And so, it was a ready-made hit.

60
0:02:54.656,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The Double Dutch rope playing helped maintain these songs

61
0:02:58.799,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and helped maintain the chants and the gestures that go along with it,

62
0:03:02.824,000 --> 0:03:06,000
which is very natural to what I call "kinetic orality" --

63
0:03:06.855,000 --> 0:03:07,000
word of mouth and word of body.

64
0:03:09.133,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's the thing that gets passed down over generations.

65
0:03:12.03,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In some ways, the rope is the thing that helps carry it.

66
0:03:15.696,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You need some object to carry memory through.

67
0:03:18.943,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So, a jump rope, you can use it for all different kinds of things.

68
0:03:22.911,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It crosses cultures.

69
0:03:24.49,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I think it lasted because people need to move.

70
0:03:28.519,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And I think sometimes the simplest objects can make the most creative uses.

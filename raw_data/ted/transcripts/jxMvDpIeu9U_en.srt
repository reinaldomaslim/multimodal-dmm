1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Namaste. Salaam.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Shalom. Sat Sri Akal.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Because it has provoked, and does provoke,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul,

8
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
of turbulence and turmoil.

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And what follows is a stream of images,

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
most dynamic and young photographers,

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that aims to give you an alternative glimpse,

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
a look inside the hearts and minds

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of some ordinary Pakistani citizens.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I hope that you will be able to see

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
not just my Taliban-like beard,

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but also the richness and color

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams,

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim.

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I hope to become a vet when I grow up

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who wander around the streets of the village

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
through technicolored glass.

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
with the pink polka dots?

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
My name is Zamin.

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person,

35
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
from Swat.

36
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Do you see me on the other side of this fence?

37
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Do I matter, or really exist for you?

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
My name is Iman. I am a fashion model,

39
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
an up-and-coming model from Lahore.

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth?

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Or can you move beyond my veil

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and see me for who I truly am inside?

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee

44
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
from the Khyber agency.

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I have come from a place of intense darkness.

46
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And that is why I want to illuminate the world.

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
My name is Papusay.

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
My heart and drum beat as one.

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
If religion is the opium of the masses,

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
then for me, music is my one and only ganja.

51
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
A rising tide lifts all boats.

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And the rising tide of India's

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
spectacular economic growth

54
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
has lifted over 400 million

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Indians into a buoyant middle class.

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But there are still over 650 million Indians,

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese,

58
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.

59
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Therefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I,

60
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it behooves us to transcend our differences,

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to celebrate our diversity,

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to leverage our common humanity.

63
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan,

64
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which for many of you, as you all recognize,

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
means "new life" in Urdu and Hindi,

66
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families

67
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
by providing them with affordable access

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to catastrophic health care.

69
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Indeed it is the emerging world's first

70
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
HMO for the urban working poor.

71
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis?

72
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth.

73
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And if our fates are intertwined,

74
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune.

75
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie

76
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you.

77
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

78
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here.

79
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That was fantastic.

80
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I found that really moving.

81
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
You know, we fought hard to get at least

82
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
a small Pakistani contingent to come.

83
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It felt like it was really important.

84
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They went through a lot to get here.

85
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please?

86
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I just really wanted to acknowledge you.

87
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Applause)

88
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Thank you so much.

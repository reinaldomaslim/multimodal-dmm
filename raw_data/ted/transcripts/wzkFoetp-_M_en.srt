1
0:00:13.015,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What do you think when you look at me?

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
A woman of faith? An expert?

3
0:00:19.145,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Maybe even a sister.

4
0:00:21.391,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Or oppressed,

5
0:00:23.702,000 --> 0:00:24,000
brainwashed,

6
0:00:25.237,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a terrorist.

7
0:00:28.061,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Or just an airport security line delay.

8
0:00:32.571,000 --> 0:00:33,000
That one's actually true.

9
0:00:34.104,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:35.684,000 --> 0:00:38,000
If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you.

11
0:00:38.931,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That's just how the media has been portraying

12
0:00:41.075,000 --> 0:00:42,000
people who look like me.

13
0:00:42.629,000 --> 0:00:43,000
One study found

14
0:00:44.059,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.

15
0:00:48.828,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim.

16
0:00:53.088,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers.

17
0:00:55.968,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:59.365,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Well, for those of you who have never met a Muslim,

19
0:01:02.988,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it's great to meet you.

20
0:01:05.738,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Let me tell you who I am.

21
0:01:08.731,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I'm a mom, a coffee lover --

22
0:01:11.858,000 --> 0:01:12,000
double espresso, cream on the side.

23
0:01:14.103,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm an introvert.

24
0:01:16.089,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic.

25
0:01:18.12,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim.

26
0:01:23.788,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But not like Lady Gaga says, because baby, I wasn't born this way.

27
0:01:28.931,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It was a choice.

28
0:01:31.64,000 --> 0:01:34,000
When I was 17, I decided to come out.

29
0:01:35.679,000 --> 0:01:38,000
No, not as a gay person like some of my friends,

30
0:01:38.864,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but as a Muslim,

31
0:01:40.388,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and decided to start wearing the hijab, my head covering.

32
0:01:44.216,000 --> 0:01:47,000
My feminist friends were aghast:

33
0:01:47.771,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"Why are you oppressing yourself?"

34
0:01:51.436,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The funny thing was,

35
0:01:52.992,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it was actually at that time a feminist declaration of independence

36
0:01:58.898,000 --> 0:02:01,000
from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old,

37
0:02:02.88,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to conform to a perfect and unattainable standard of beauty.

38
0:02:07.582,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I didn't just passively accept the faith of my parents.

39
0:02:12.658,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I wrestled with the Quran.

40
0:02:14.888,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I read and reflected and questioned and doubted

41
0:02:20.428,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and, ultimately, believed.

42
0:02:23.621,000 --> 0:02:27,000
My relationship with God -- it was not love at first sight.

43
0:02:29.614,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It was a trust and a slow surrender

44
0:02:32.512,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that deepened with every reading of the Quran.

45
0:02:36.133,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Its rhythmic beauty sometimes moves me to tears.

46
0:02:40.909,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I see myself in it. I feel that God knows me.

47
0:02:45.069,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Have you ever felt like someone sees you, completely understands you

48
0:02:50.685,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and yet loves you anyway?

49
0:02:52.923,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's how it feels.

50
0:02:55.773,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And so later, I got married,

51
0:02:58.477,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and like all good Egyptians,

52
0:03:00.365,000 --> 0:03:02,000
started my career as an engineer.

53
0:03:02.848,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:06.602,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I later had a child, after getting married,

55
0:03:11.603,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I was living essentially the Egyptian-American dream.

56
0:03:18.448,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And then that terrible morning of September, 2001.

57
0:03:24.417,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I think a lot of you probably remember exactly where you were that morning.

58
0:03:31.181,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I was sitting in my kitchen finishing breakfast,

59
0:03:34.912,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and I look up on the screen and see the words "Breaking News."

60
0:03:39.075,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There was smoke, airplanes flying into buildings,

61
0:03:42.49,000 --> 0:03:44,000
people jumping out of buildings.

62
0:03:45.277,000 --> 0:03:46,000
What was this?

63
0:03:47.456,000 --> 0:03:48,000
An accident?

64
0:03:49.786,000 --> 0:03:5,000
A malfunction?

65
0:03:53.084,000 --> 0:03:56,000
My shock quickly turned to outrage.

66
0:03:56.55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Who would do this?

67
0:03:59.385,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And I switch the channel and I hear,

68
0:04:02.111,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"... Muslim terrorist ...,"

69
0:04:04.191,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"... in the name of Islam ...,"

70
0:04:06.212,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"... Middle-Eastern descent ...,"

71
0:04:08.585,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"... jihad ...,"

72
0:04:10.42,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"... we should bomb Mecca."

73
0:04:12.294,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Oh my God.

74
0:04:15.232,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Not only had my country been attacked,

75
0:04:19.08,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but in a flash,

76
0:04:20.446,000 --> 0:04:23,000
somebody else's actions had turned me from a citizen

77
0:04:24.376,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to a suspect.

78
0:04:27.021,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That same day, we had to drive across Middle America

79
0:04:31.982,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to move to a new city to start grad school.

80
0:04:36.908,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I remember sitting in the passenger seat

81
0:04:39.015,000 --> 0:04:4,000
as we drove in silence,

82
0:04:41.871,000 --> 0:04:43,000
crouched as low as I could go in my seat,

83
0:04:44.481,000 --> 0:04:49,000
for the first time in my life, afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim.

84
0:04:50.943,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We moved into our apartment that night in a new town

85
0:04:54.11,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in what felt like a completely different world.

86
0:04:57.928,000 --> 0:05:,000
And then I was hearing and seeing and reading

87
0:05:01.906,000 --> 0:05:03,000
warnings from national Muslim organizations

88
0:05:04.627,000 --> 0:05:06,000
saying things like, "Be alert," "Be aware,"

89
0:05:08.312,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Stay in well-lit areas," "Don't congregate."

90
0:05:12.18,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I stayed inside all week.

91
0:05:14.988,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And then it was Friday that same week,

92
0:05:17.756,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the day that Muslims congregate for worship.

93
0:05:22.035,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And again the warnings were, "Don't go that first Friday,

94
0:05:26.625,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it could be a target."

95
0:05:29.512,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I was watching the news, wall-to-wall coverage.

96
0:05:32.187,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Emotions were so raw, understandably,

97
0:05:35.076,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and I was also hearing about attacks on Muslims,

98
0:05:38.778,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or people who were perceived to be Muslim, being pulled out

99
0:05:41.62,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and beaten in the street.

100
0:05:42.866,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Mosques were actually firebombed.

101
0:05:45.004,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And I thought, we should just stay home.

102
0:05:47.777,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And yet, something didn't feel right.

103
0:05:51.335,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Because those people who attacked our country

104
0:05:53.792,000 --> 0:05:55,000
attacked our country.

105
0:05:58.611,000 --> 0:06:,000
I get it that people were angry at the terrorists.

106
0:06:01.441,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Guess what? So was I.

107
0:06:04.897,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And so to have to explain yourself all the time isn't easy.

108
0:06:10.193,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I don't mind questions. I love questions.

109
0:06:13.582,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It's the accusations that are tough.

110
0:06:16.583,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Today we hear people actually saying things like,

111
0:06:20.278,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"There's a problem in this country, and it's called Muslims.

112
0:06:23.108,000 --> 0:06:24,000
When are we going to get rid of them?"

113
0:06:25.504,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So, some people want to ban Muslims and close down mosques.

114
0:06:29.197,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They talk about my community kind of like we're a tumor

115
0:06:32.279,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in the body of America.

116
0:06:33.944,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And the only question is, are we malignant or benign?

117
0:06:37.866,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You know, a malignant tumor you extract altogether,

118
0:06:40.871,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and a benign tumor you just keep under surveillance.

119
0:06:47.467,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The choices don't make sense, because it's the wrong question.

120
0:06:51.893,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Muslims, like all other Americans, aren't a tumor in the body of America,

121
0:06:55.818,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we're a vital organ.

122
0:06:58.109,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:59.134,000 --> 0:07:,000
Thank you.

124
0:07:00.317,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

125
0:07:05.937,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Muslims are inventors and teachers,

126
0:07:08.527,000 --> 0:07:11,000
first responders and Olympic athletes.

127
0:07:12.341,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now, is closing down mosques going to make America safer?

128
0:07:16.194,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It might free up some parking spots,

129
0:07:19.294,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but it will not end terrorism.

130
0:07:22.134,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Going to a mosque regularly is actually linked

131
0:07:24.611,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to having more tolerant views of people of other faiths

132
0:07:28.541,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and greater civic engagement.

133
0:07:31.561,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And as one police chief in the Washington, DC area

134
0:07:34.866,000 --> 0:07:35,000
recently told me,

135
0:07:36.041,000 --> 0:07:38,000
people don't actually get radicalized at mosques.

136
0:07:38.925,000 --> 0:07:42,000
They get radicalized in their basement or bedroom, in front of a computer.

137
0:07:44.526,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And what you find about the radicalization process

138
0:07:47.38,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is it starts online,

139
0:07:49.027,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but the first thing that happens

140
0:07:50.622,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is the person gets cut off from their community,

141
0:07:53.64,000 --> 0:07:54,000
from even their family,

142
0:07:55.306,000 --> 0:07:57,000
so that the extremist group can brainwash them

143
0:07:58.098,000 --> 0:08:02,000
into believing that they, the terrorists, are the true Muslims,

144
0:08:02.42,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and everyone else who abhors their behavior and ideology

145
0:08:06.46,000 --> 0:08:08,000
are sellouts or apostates.

146
0:08:09.607,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So if we want to prevent radicalization,

147
0:08:11.886,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we have to keep people going to the mosque.

148
0:08:16.765,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Now, some will still argue Islam is a violent religion.

149
0:08:20.517,000 --> 0:08:24,000
After all, a group like ISIS bases its brutality on the Quran.

150
0:08:26.318,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now, as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being,

151
0:08:29.676,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I think we need to do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.

152
0:08:35.72,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But we would be giving in to their narrative

153
0:08:40.624,000 --> 0:08:45,000
if we cast them as representatives of a faith of 1.6 billion people.

154
0:08:46.373,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

155
0:08:49.89,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Thank you.

156
0:08:53.809,000 --> 0:08:56,000
ISIS has as much to do with Islam

157
0:08:57.117,000 --> 0:09:,000
as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.

158
0:09:00.491,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Applause)

159
0:09:06.795,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Both groups claim to base their ideology on their holy book.

160
0:09:12.349,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But when you look at them, they're not motivated

161
0:09:15.397,000 --> 0:09:17,000
by what they read in their holy book.

162
0:09:17.705,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It's their brutality that makes them read these things into the scripture.

163
0:09:24.098,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Recently, a prominent imam told me a story that really took me aback.

164
0:09:27.772,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He said that a girl came to him

165
0:09:29.535,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because she was thinking of going to join ISIS.

166
0:09:32.556,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And I was really surprised and asked him,

167
0:09:34.628,000 --> 0:09:37,000
had she been in contact with a radical religious leader?

168
0:09:37.898,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And he said the problem was quite the opposite,

169
0:09:40.217,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that every cleric that she had talked to had shut her down

170
0:09:43.968,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and said that her rage, her sense of injustice in the world,

171
0:09:47.589,000 --> 0:09:49,000
was just going to get her in trouble.

172
0:09:49.698,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And so with nowhere to channel and make sense of this anger,

173
0:09:53.403,000 --> 0:09:55,000
she was a prime target to be exploited

174
0:09:55.442,000 --> 0:09:57,000
by extremists promising her a solution.

175
0:09:58.605,000 --> 0:10:02,000
What this imam did was to connect her back to God and to her community.

176
0:10:03.319,000 --> 0:10:07,000
He didn't shame her for her rage -- instead, he gave her constructive ways

177
0:10:08.19,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to make real change in the world.

178
0:10:10.751,000 --> 0:10:14,000
What she learned at that mosque prevented her from going to join ISIS.

179
0:10:16.983,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I've told you a little bit

180
0:10:18.262,000 --> 0:10:2,000
about how Islamophobia affects me and my family.

181
0:10:21.076,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But how does it impact ordinary Americans?

182
0:10:23.64,000 --> 0:10:24,000
How does it impact everyone else?

183
0:10:25.569,000 --> 0:10:3,000
How does consuming fear 24 hours a day affect the health of our democracy,

184
0:10:31.359,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the health of our free thought?

185
0:10:33.527,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Well, one study -- actually, several studies in neuroscience --

186
0:10:37.422,000 --> 0:10:4,000
show that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.

187
0:10:41.857,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We become more accepting of authoritarianism,

188
0:10:46.002,000 --> 0:10:48,000
conformity and prejudice.

189
0:10:49.194,000 --> 0:10:54,000
One study showed that when subjects were exposed to news stories

190
0:10:55.005,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that were negative about Muslims,

191
0:10:58.013,000 --> 0:11:02,000
they became more accepting of military attacks on Muslim countries

192
0:11:02.152,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and policies that curtail the rights of American Muslims.

193
0:11:06.192,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Now, this isn't just academic.

194
0:11:08.373,000 --> 0:11:12,000
When you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment spiked

195
0:11:13.555,000 --> 0:11:16,000
between 2001 and 2013,

196
0:11:17.127,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it happened three times,

197
0:11:18.718,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but it wasn't around terrorist attacks.

198
0:11:21.294,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It was in the run up to the Iraq War and during two election cycles.

199
0:11:26.155,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So Islamophobia isn't just the natural response to Muslim terrorism

200
0:11:30.723,000 --> 0:11:31,000
as I would have expected.

201
0:11:33.218,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It can actually be a tool of public manipulation,

202
0:11:37.72,000 --> 0:11:4,000
eroding the very foundation of a free society,

203
0:11:41.727,000 --> 0:11:45,000
which is rational and well-informed citizens.

204
0:11:46.605,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Muslims are like canaries in the coal mine.

205
0:11:49.655,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We might be the first to feel it,

206
0:11:51.37,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.

207
0:11:56.251,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

208
0:12:03.58,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And assigning collective guilt

209
0:12:06.003,000 --> 0:12:08,000
isn't just about having to explain yourself all the time.

210
0:12:09.777,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple

211
0:12:13.449,000 --> 0:12:14,000
living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina,

212
0:12:15.472,000 --> 0:12:16,000
where they both went to school.

213
0:12:17.686,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Deah was an athlete.

214
0:12:20.125,000 --> 0:12:23,000
He was in dental school, talented, promising ...

215
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest,

216
0:12:28.502,000 --> 0:12:3,000
most generous human being she knew.

217
0:12:30.561,000 --> 0:12:33,000
She was visiting him there and he showed her his resume,

218
0:12:34.439,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and she was amazed.

219
0:12:35.725,000 --> 0:12:39,000
She said, "When did my baby brother become such an accomplished young man?"

220
0:12:41.119,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his new wife,

221
0:12:46.237,000 --> 0:12:47,000
their neighbor,

222
0:12:48.732,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Craig Stephen Hicks,

223
0:12:50.897,000 --> 0:12:51,000
murdered them,

224
0:12:52.666,000 --> 0:12:56,000
as well as Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting for the afternoon,

225
0:12:57.471,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in their apartment,

226
0:12:59.754,000 --> 0:13:,000
execution style,

227
0:13:01.533,000 --> 0:13:04,000
after posting anti-Muslim statements on his Facebook page.

228
0:13:06.058,000 --> 0:13:07,000
He shot Deah eight times.

229
0:13:09.254,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So bigotry isn't just immoral, it can even be lethal.

230
0:13:14.355,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So, back to my story.

231
0:13:15.7,000 --> 0:13:16,000
What happened after 9/11?

232
0:13:17.424,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Did we go to the mosque or did we play it safe and stay home?

233
0:13:21.39,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Well, we talked it over,

234
0:13:23.296,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and it might seem like a small decision, but to us,

235
0:13:26.009,000 --> 0:13:29,000
it was about what kind of America we wanted to leave for our kids:

236
0:13:29.889,000 --> 0:13:32,000
one that would control us by fear

237
0:13:33.293,000 --> 0:13:36,000
or one where we were practicing our religion freely.

238
0:13:36.811,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So we decided to go to the mosque.

239
0:13:39.823,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And we put my son in his car seat,

240
0:13:41.59,000 --> 0:13:44,000
buckled him in, and we drove silently, intensely, to the mosque.

241
0:13:45.305,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I took him out, I took off my shoes, I walked into the prayer hall

242
0:13:50.609,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and what I saw made me stop.

243
0:13:53.271,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The place was completely full.

244
0:13:55.492,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And then the imam made an announcement,

245
0:13:57.704,000 --> 0:14:01,000
thanking and welcoming our guests,

246
0:14:02.564,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because half the congregation

247
0:14:05.833,000 --> 0:14:07,000
were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists,

248
0:14:08.585,000 --> 0:14:1,000
people of faith and no faith,

249
0:14:11.029,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who had come not to attack us, but to stand in solidarity with us.

250
0:14:16.419,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Applause)

251
0:14:25.599,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I just break down at this time.

252
0:14:28.674,000 --> 0:14:32,000
These people were there because they chose courage and compassion

253
0:14:33.242,000 --> 0:14:35,000
over panic and prejudice.

254
0:14:36.731,000 --> 0:14:37,000
What will you choose?

255
0:14:39.122,000 --> 0:14:44,000
What will you choose at this time of fear and bigotry?

256
0:14:45.397,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Will you play it safe?

257
0:14:47.914,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Or will you join those who say

258
0:14:50.237,000 --> 0:14:51,000
we are better than that?

259
0:14:52.249,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Thank you.

260
0:14:53.424,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Applause)

261
0:15:07.91,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Thank you so much.

262
0:15:12.497,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Helen Walters: So Dalia, you seem to have struck a chord.

263
0:15:16.865,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But I wonder,

264
0:15:18.426,000 --> 0:15:2,000
what would you say to those who might argue

265
0:15:20.909,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that you're giving a TED Talk,

266
0:15:22.69,000 --> 0:15:23,000
you're clearly a deep thinker,

267
0:15:24.269,000 --> 0:15:26,000
you work at a fancy think tank,

268
0:15:26.3,000 --> 0:15:28,000
you're an exception, you're not the rule.

269
0:15:28.437,000 --> 0:15:29,000
What would you say to those people?

270
0:15:30.841,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't let this stage distract you,

271
0:15:33.787,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I'm completely ordinary.

272
0:15:35.821,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I'm not an exception.

273
0:15:37.447,000 --> 0:15:39,000
My story is not unusual.

274
0:15:39.491,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I am as ordinary as they come.

275
0:15:42.498,000 --> 0:15:46,000
When you look at Muslims around the world --

276
0:15:46.72,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and I've done this, I've done the largest study ever done

277
0:15:49.575,000 --> 0:15:5,000
on Muslims around the world --

278
0:15:51.141,000 --> 0:15:52,000
people want ordinary things.

279
0:15:52.615,000 --> 0:15:53,000
They want prosperity for their family,

280
0:15:54.464,000 --> 0:15:55,000
they want jobs

281
0:15:55.639,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and they want to live in peace.

282
0:15:57.269,000 --> 0:16:,000
So I am not in any way an exception.

283
0:16:00.339,000 --> 0:16:02,000
When you meet people who seem like an exception to the rule,

284
0:16:03.214,000 --> 0:16:05,000
oftentimes it's that the rule is broken,

285
0:16:06.292,000 --> 0:16:08,000
not that they're an exception to it.

286
0:16:08.536,000 --> 0:16:1,000
HW: Thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.

287
0:16:11.02,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Applause)

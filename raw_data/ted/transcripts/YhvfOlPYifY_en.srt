1
0:00:16.148,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I, like many of you,

2
0:00:18.053,000 --> 0:00:24,000
am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities.

3
0:00:24.735,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And there are days -- I don't know about the rest of you --

4
0:00:27.674,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but there are days when I palpably feel

5
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
how much I rely on other people

6
0:00:33.761,000 --> 0:00:35,000
for pretty much everything in my life.

7
0:00:36.609,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And some days, that can even be a little scary.

8
0:00:39.954,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But what I'm here to talk to you about today

9
0:00:42.062,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is how that same interdependence

10
0:00:44.868,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure

11
0:00:49.381,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that we can actually harness

12
0:00:51.389,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to help heal some of our deepest civic issues,

13
0:00:55.824,000 --> 0:00:58,000
if we apply open-source collaboration.

14
0:01:00.248,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A couple of years ago,

15
0:01:01.616,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Pollan,

16
0:01:05.138,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in which he argued that growing even some of our own food

17
0:01:09.261,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is one of the best things that we can do for the environment.

18
0:01:13.296,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now at the time that I was reading this,

19
0:01:15.225,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it was the middle of the winter

20
0:01:16.89,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt

21
0:01:20.221,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in my New York City apartment.

22
0:01:22.374,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So I was basically just willing to settle

23
0:01:24.364,000 --> 0:01:25,000
for just reading the next Wired magazine

24
0:01:26.334,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and finding out how the experts were going to figure out

25
0:01:28.978,000 --> 0:01:31,000
how to solve all these problems for us in the future.

26
0:01:32.078,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But that was actually exactly the point

27
0:01:34.351,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that Michael Pollan was making in this article --

28
0:01:36.661,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's precisely when we hand over

29
0:01:38.894,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the responsibility for all these things to specialists

30
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that we cause the kind of messes that we see with the food system.

31
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So, I happen to know a little bit from my own work

32
0:01:50.618,000 --> 0:01:54,000
about how NASA has been using hydroponics

33
0:01:54.897,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to explore growing food in space.

34
0:01:58.144,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And that you can actually get optimal nutritional yield

35
0:02:02.583,000 --> 0:02:07,000
by running a kind of high-quality liquid soil over plants' root systems.

36
0:02:09.191,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now to a vegetable plant,

37
0:02:10.8,000 --> 0:02:14,000
my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space.

38
0:02:15.31,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But I can offer some natural light

39
0:02:17.795,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and year-round climate control.

40
0:02:20.49,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Fast-forward two years later:

41
0:02:22.21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
we now have window farms,

42
0:02:23.958,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which are vertical, hydroponic platforms

43
0:02:26.035,000 --> 0:02:28,000
for food-growing indoors.

44
0:02:28.884,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And the way it works is that there's a pump at the bottom,

45
0:02:31.663,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which periodically sends this liquid nutrient solution up to the top,

46
0:02:35.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which then trickles down through plants' root systems

47
0:02:37.908,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that are suspended in clay pellets --

48
0:02:40.073,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so there's no dirt involved.

49
0:02:42.567,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now light and temperature vary with each window's microclimate,

50
0:02:47.298,000 --> 0:02:5,000
so a window farm requires a farmer,

51
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and she must decide

52
0:02:52.601,000 --> 0:02:55,000
what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm,

53
0:02:56.36,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and whether she is going to feed her food organically.

54
0:03:00.293,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Back at the time,

55
0:03:01.468,000 --> 0:03:04,000
a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea

56
0:03:04.673,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that was going to require a lot of testing.

57
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And I really wanted it to be an open project,

58
0:03:10.034,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because hydroponics

59
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is one of the fastest growing areas of patenting

60
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in the United States right now,

61
0:03:15.686,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and could possibly become another area like Monsanto,

62
0:03:19.381,000 --> 0:03:22,000
where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property

63
0:03:22.445,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in the way of people's food.

64
0:03:25.372,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So I decided that, instead of creating a product,

65
0:03:29.019,000 --> 0:03:3,000
what I was going to do

66
0:03:30.21,000 --> 0:03:33,000
was open this up to a whole bunch of codevelopers.

67
0:03:34.619,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The first few systems that we created, they kind of worked.

68
0:03:37.405,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week

69
0:03:39.763,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in a typical New York City apartment window.

70
0:03:42.177,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And we were able to grow cherry tomatoes

71
0:03:44.23,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and cucumbers, all kinds of stuff.

72
0:03:46.234,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But the first few systems

73
0:03:47.737,000 --> 0:03:5,000
were these leaky, loud power-guzzlers

74
0:03:51.292,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved.

75
0:03:54.074,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:55.946,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So to bring on more codevelopers,

77
0:03:58.355,000 --> 0:04:,000
what we did was we created a social media site

78
0:04:01.281,000 --> 0:04:02,000
on which we published the designs,

79
0:04:03.25,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we explained how they worked,

80
0:04:05.268,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and we even went so far

81
0:04:07.671,000 --> 0:04:1,000
as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems.

82
0:04:10.939,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And then we invited people all over the world

83
0:04:13.331,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to build them and experiment with us.

84
0:04:16.62,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So actually now on this website,

85
0:04:18.807,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we have 18,000 people.

86
0:04:21.528,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And we have window farms all over the world.

87
0:04:25.701,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What we're doing is what NASA or a large corporation

88
0:04:29.497,000 --> 0:04:32,000
would call R&D, or research and development.

89
0:04:33.012,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But what we call it is R&D-I-Y,

90
0:04:35.949,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or "research and develop it yourself."

91
0:04:38.612,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:40.108,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So, for example, Jackson came along

93
0:04:42.687,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps.

94
0:04:45.862,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right,

95
0:04:48.601,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but once we did, we were able to cut our carbon footprint nearly in half.

96
0:04:53.134,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments,

97
0:04:56.142,000 --> 0:04:57,000
like lots of other window farmers,

98
0:04:57.82,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and he's been able to get his strawberries to fruit

99
0:05:00.807,000 --> 0:05:02,000
for nine months of the year in low-light conditions

100
0:05:03.59,000 --> 0:05:05,000
by simply changing out the organic nutrients.

101
0:05:07.541,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And window farmers in Finland have been customizing their window farms

102
0:05:11.939,000 --> 0:05:13,000
for the dark days of the Finnish winters

103
0:05:14.303,000 --> 0:05:16,000
by outfitting them with LED grow lights

104
0:05:16.404,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that they're now making open source and part of the project.

105
0:05:19.721,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So window farms have been evolving

106
0:05:22.114,000 --> 0:05:25,000
through a rapid versioning process similar to software.

107
0:05:25.899,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And with every open source project,

108
0:05:28.593,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the real benefit is the interplay

109
0:05:30.331,000 --> 0:05:34,000
between the specific concerns of people customizing their systems

110
0:05:34.794,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for their own particular concerns,

111
0:05:36.637,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the universal concerns.

112
0:05:38.709,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So my core team and I

113
0:05:40.666,000 --> 0:05:42,000
are able to concentrate on the improvements

114
0:05:43.24,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that really benefit everyone.

115
0:05:45.508,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And we're able to look out for the needs of newcomers.

116
0:05:48.751,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So for do-it-yourselfers,

117
0:05:50.505,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we provide free, very well-tested instructions

118
0:05:54.651,000 --> 0:05:56,000
so that anyone, anywhere around the world,

119
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
can build one of these systems for free.

120
0:05:58.933,000 --> 0:06:,000
And there's a patent pending on these systems as well

121
0:06:01.679,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that's held by the community.

122
0:06:03.47,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And to fund the project,

123
0:06:05.398,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we partner to create products

124
0:06:07.724,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that we then sell to schools and to individuals

125
0:06:10.625,000 --> 0:06:12,000
who don't have time to build their own systems.

126
0:06:13.996,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now within our community, a certain culture has appeared.

127
0:06:17.485,000 --> 0:06:19,000
In our culture, it is better to be a tester

128
0:06:20.222,000 --> 0:06:22,000
who supports someone else's idea

129
0:06:22.515,000 --> 0:06:24,000
than it is to be just the idea guy.

130
0:06:25.709,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What we get out of this project is support for our own work,

131
0:06:29.861,000 --> 0:06:32,000
as well as an experience of actually contributing

132
0:06:33.806,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to the environmental movement

133
0:06:35.956,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in a way other than just screwing in new light bulbs.

134
0:06:39.415,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But I think that Eleen expresses best

135
0:06:42.086,000 --> 0:06:43,000
what we really get out of this,

136
0:06:43.587,000 --> 0:06:45,000
which is the actual joy of collaboration.

137
0:06:46.946,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So she expresses here what it's like

138
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to see someone halfway across the world

139
0:06:51.761,000 --> 0:06:53,000
having taken your idea, built upon it

140
0:06:54.087,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then acknowledging you for contributing.

141
0:06:56.8,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change

142
0:07:00.731,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that we're all talking about as environmentalists and food people,

143
0:07:04.41,000 --> 0:07:06,000
maybe we just need to ditch the term "consumer"

144
0:07:06.819,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and get behind the people who are doing stuff.

145
0:07:10.639,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own.

146
0:07:13.835,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And what we're seeing is that R&D-I-Y

147
0:07:15.899,000 --> 0:07:18,000
has moved beyond just window farms and LEDs

148
0:07:19.702,000 --> 0:07:22,000
into solar panels and aquaponic systems.

149
0:07:23.893,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And we're building upon innovations of generations who went before us.

150
0:07:27.835,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And we're looking ahead at generations

151
0:07:29.673,000 --> 0:07:31,000
who really need us to retool our lives now.

152
0:07:33.675,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So we ask that you join us

153
0:07:35.464,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in rediscovering the value of citizens united,

154
0:07:39.814,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and to declare that we are all still pioneers.

155
0:07:44.53,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Applause)

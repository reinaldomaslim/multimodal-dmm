Translator: Jenny Zurawell

2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So my name is Taylor Wilson.

3
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I am 17 years old

4
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I am a nuclear physicist,

5
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which may be a little hard to believe, but I am.

6
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I would like to make the case

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that nuclear fusion

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
will be that point,

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that the bridge that T. Boone Pickens talked about

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
will get us to.

11
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So nuclear fusion is our energy future.

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And the second point,

13
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
making the case that kids can really change the world.

14
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So you may ask --

15
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Applause)

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You may ask me,

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
well how do you know what our energy future is?

18
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Well I built a fusion reactor

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when I was 14 years old.

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
That is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor.

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I started building this project

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
when I was about 12 or 13 years old.

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I decided I wanted to make a star.

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now most of you are probably saying,

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion.

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I don't see any nuclear power plants with fusion energy.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Well it doesn't break even.

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It doesn't produce more energy out than I put in,

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but it still does some pretty cool stuff.

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I assembled this in my garage,

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and it now lives in the physics department

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of the University of Nevada, Reno.

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And it slams together deuterium,

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron in it.

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So this is similar to the reaction

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun.

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I'm slamming it together so hard

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that that hydrogen fuses together,

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and in the process it has some byproducts,

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I utilize those byproducts.

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So this previous year,

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that Homeland Security has.

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
For hundreds of dollars,

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I've developed a system that exceeds the sensitivity

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I built this in my garage.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And I've developed a system

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to produce medical isotopes.

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Instead of requiring multi-million-dollar facilities

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I've developed a device that, on a very small scale,

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
can produce these isotopes.

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So that's my fusion reactor in the background there.

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That is me at the control panel

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
of my fusion reactor.

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Oh, by the way, I make yellowcake in my garage,

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
so my nuclear program is as advanced as the Iranians.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So maybe I don't want to admit to that.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is me at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And this is me with President Obama,

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
showing him my Homeland Security research.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Applause)

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So in about seven years

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
of doing nuclear research,

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I started out with a dream

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to make a "star in a jar," a star in my garage,

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and I ended up meeting the president

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and developing things that I think can change the world,

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and I think other kids can too.

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So thank you very much.

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.116,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What stands between Africa's current prostrate condition

2
0:00:17.251,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and a future of prosperity and abundance for its long-suffering populations?

3
0:00:22.912,000 --> 0:00:23,000
One word:

4
0:00:24.725,000 --> 0:00:25,000
knowledge.

5
0:00:26.798,000 --> 0:00:3,000
If Africa is to become a continent that offers the best life for humans,

6
0:00:31.34,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it must become a knowledge society

7
0:00:34.322,000 --> 0:00:35,000
immediately.

8
0:00:35.994,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is what I have called "Africa's knowledge imperative."

9
0:00:41.923,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Our universities must reduce emphasis on producing manpower

10
0:00:45.778,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for running our civil society,

11
0:00:48.333,000 --> 0:00:49,000
our economy

12
0:00:50.123,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and our political institutions.

13
0:00:53.148,000 --> 0:00:56,000
They should be dedicated mainly to knowledge production.

14
0:00:58.114,000 --> 0:01:01,000
What sense is there in producing civil engineers

15
0:01:02.068,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who are not supported by soil scientists and geologists,

16
0:01:05.719,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who make it their business to create knowledge about our soil

17
0:01:10.031,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and our rocks?

18
0:01:12.417,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What use is there in producing lawyers

19
0:01:15.66,000 --> 0:01:18,000
without juries who produce knowledge

20
0:01:20.447,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of the underlying philosophical foundations of the legal system?

21
0:01:25.642,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We must seek knowledge.

22
0:01:28.466,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We must approach the matter of knowledge

23
0:01:31.556,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with a maniacal commitment,

24
0:01:34.445,000 --> 0:01:36,000
without let or hindrance.

25
0:01:37.48,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Though we must seek knowledge to solve problems we know of,

26
0:01:41.86,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we must also seek knowledge

27
0:01:44.14,000 --> 0:01:45,000
when there is no problem in view --

28
0:01:46.849,000 --> 0:01:49,000
especially when there is no problem in view.

29
0:01:51.263,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We must seek to know as much of what there is to know of all things,

30
0:01:56.439,000 --> 0:02:,000
limited only by the insufficiency of our human nature,

31
0:02:00.742,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and not only when the need arises.

32
0:02:04.534,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Those who do not seek knowledge when it is not needed

33
0:02:09.561,000 --> 0:02:12,000
will not have it when they must have it.

34
0:02:14.777,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The biggest crisis in Africa today is the crisis of knowledge:

35
0:02:18.896,000 --> 0:02:2,000
how to produce it,

36
0:02:20.94,000 --> 0:02:21,000
how to manage it,

37
0:02:22.595,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and how to deploy it effectively.

38
0:02:26.421,000 --> 0:02:3,000
For instance, Africa does not have a water crisis.

39
0:02:31.284,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It has a knowledge crisis regarding its water,

40
0:02:35.251,000 --> 0:02:37,000
where and what types it is,

41
0:02:37.762,000 --> 0:02:43,000
how it can be tapped and made available where and when needed to all and sundry.

42
0:02:45.144,000 --> 0:02:47,000
How does a continent that is home

43
0:02:47.827,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to some of the largest bodies of water in the world --

44
0:02:51.708,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the Nile,

45
0:02:53.587,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the Niger,

46
0:02:55.291,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the Congo,

47
0:02:56.7,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the Zambezi

48
0:02:58.274,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and the Orange Rivers --

49
0:03:00.553,000 --> 0:03:02,000
be said to have a water crisis,

50
0:03:03.02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
including in countries

51
0:03:05.091,000 --> 0:03:06,000
where those rivers are?

52
0:03:08.387,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And that is only surface water.

53
0:03:11.045,000 --> 0:03:14,000
While we wrongly dissipate our energies fighting the wrong crises,

54
0:03:15.03,000 --> 0:03:17,000
all those who invest in knowledge about us

55
0:03:17.736,000 --> 0:03:22,000
are busy figuring out how to pipe water from Libya's aquifers

56
0:03:23.458,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to quench Europe's thirst.

57
0:03:26.811,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Such is our knowledge of our water resources

58
0:03:29.208,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that many of our countries have given up

59
0:03:31.364,000 --> 0:03:33,000
on making potable water a routine presence

60
0:03:34.125,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in the lives of Africans,

61
0:03:35.908,000 --> 0:03:36,000
rich or poor,

62
0:03:37.587,000 --> 0:03:38,000
high and low,

63
0:03:39.066,000 --> 0:03:4,000
rural and urban.

64
0:03:41.252,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We eagerly accept what the merchants of misery

65
0:03:44.746,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the global African Studies safari professoriat

66
0:03:48.293,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and their aid-addled,

67
0:03:50.273,000 --> 0:03:52,000
autonomy-fearing African minions

68
0:03:53.146,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in government, universities and civil society

69
0:03:56.408,000 --> 0:04:,000
tell us regarding how nature has been to stinting towards Africa

70
0:04:00.568,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when it comes to the distribution of water resources in the world.

71
0:04:04.947,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We are content to run our cities and rural dwellings alike

72
0:04:08.727,000 --> 0:04:09,000
on boreholes.

73
0:04:12.213,000 --> 0:04:16,000
How does one run metropolises on boreholes and wells?

74
0:04:19.055,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Does Africa have a food crisis?

75
0:04:21.861,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Again, the answer is no.

76
0:04:25.429,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It is yet another knowledge crisis regarding Africa's agricultural resources,

77
0:04:30.68,000 --> 0:04:32,000
what and where they are,

78
0:04:32.724,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and how they can be best managed to make Africans live more lives

79
0:04:37.261,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that are worth living.

80
0:04:39.907,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Otherwise, how does one explain the fact

81
0:04:42.279,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that geography puts the source of the River Nile in Ethiopia,

82
0:04:46.572,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and its people cannot have water for their lives?

83
0:04:50.736,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the same geography puts California in the desert,

84
0:04:54.641,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but it is a breadbasket.

85
0:04:57.578,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The difference, obviously, is not geography.

86
0:05:01.413,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It is knowledge.

87
0:05:03.686,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Colorado's aquifers

88
0:05:05.702,000 --> 0:05:07,000
grow California's pistachios.

89
0:05:08.9,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Why can't Libya's aquifers

90
0:05:11.102,000 --> 0:05:13,000
grow sorghum in northern Nigeria?

91
0:05:14.882,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Why does Nigeria not aspire

92
0:05:17.739,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to feed the world,

93
0:05:19.866,000 --> 0:05:2,000
not just itself?

94
0:05:21.797,000 --> 0:05:24,000
If Africa's land is so poor, as we are often told,

95
0:05:25.652,000 --> 0:05:27,000
why are outsiders,

96
0:05:27.884,000 --> 0:05:31,000
from the United Arab Emirates all the way to South Korea,

97
0:05:32.073,000 --> 0:05:35,000
buying up vast acreages of our land,

98
0:05:35.349,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to grow food, no less,

99
0:05:37.541,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to feed their people

100
0:05:39.262,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in lands that are truly more geographically stinting?

101
0:05:43.958,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The new landowners are not planning to import new topsoil

102
0:05:47.32,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to make their African acquisitions more arable.

103
0:05:50.246,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Again, a singular instance of knowledge deficiency.

104
0:05:56.99,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In the 19th century,

105
0:05:59.43,000 --> 0:06:,000
our predecessors,

106
0:06:00.914,000 --> 0:06:03,000
just years removed from the ravages of slavery and the slave trade,

107
0:06:05.837,000 --> 0:06:08,000
were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers

108
0:06:09.052,000 --> 0:06:13,000
with a view to turning Africa's resources to the advantage of its people

109
0:06:13.125,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and to the rest of humanity,

110
0:06:15.513,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and their 20th-century successors were dreaming of harnessing

111
0:06:19.64,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the powers of the River Congo

112
0:06:21.872,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to light up the whole continent.

113
0:06:24.642,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe

114
0:06:28.102,000 --> 0:06:3,000
are scheming of doing the same,

115
0:06:30.502,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but for exports to Europe and South Africa.

116
0:06:34.736,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And they are even suggesting

117
0:06:36.404,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that Congolese may not benefit from this scheme,

118
0:06:39.014,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because, according to them, Congolese communities are too small

119
0:06:43.029,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to make providing them with electricity

120
0:06:46.123,000 --> 0:06:48,000
a viable concern.

121
0:06:50.174,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The solution?

122
0:06:51.977,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Africa must become a knowledge society,

123
0:06:54.945,000 --> 0:06:57,000
a defining characteristic of the modern age.

124
0:06:58.866,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We neither are, nor are we on the path to becoming,

125
0:07:04.199,000 --> 0:07:05,000
a knowledge society.

126
0:07:07.01,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Things have not always been this way

127
0:07:10.696,000 --> 0:07:12,000
when it comes to knowledge production and Africa.

128
0:07:13.655,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In antiquity, the world went to Africa for intellectual enrichment.

129
0:07:19.339,000 --> 0:07:22,000
There were celebrated centers of learning,

130
0:07:22.482,000 --> 0:07:26,000
attracting questers from all parts of the then-known world,

131
0:07:26.586,000 --> 0:07:28,000
seeking knowledge about that world.

132
0:07:29.804,000 --> 0:07:32,000
What happened then has implications for our present.

133
0:07:33.968,000 --> 0:07:34,000
For example,

134
0:07:35.81,000 --> 0:07:41,000
how Roman Africa managed the relationship between settlers and natives

135
0:07:42.5,000 --> 0:07:45,000
between the second and fourth centuries of our era

136
0:07:46.116,000 --> 0:07:48,000
might have something to teach us when it comes to confronting

137
0:07:49.132,000 --> 0:07:52,000
not-too-dissimilar problems at the present time.

138
0:07:53.345,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But how many classics departments do we have in our universities?

139
0:07:58.423,000 --> 0:08:,000
Because we do not invest in knowledge,

140
0:08:00.97,000 --> 0:08:02,000
people come to Africa now

141
0:08:03.051,000 --> 0:08:05,000
not as a place of intellectual enrichment,

142
0:08:06.171,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but as a place where they sate their thirst for exotica.

143
0:08:12.538,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Yet for the last half-millennium,

144
0:08:15.544,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Africa has been hemorrhaging and exporting knowledge

145
0:08:19.057,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to the rest of the world.

146
0:08:21.273,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Regardless of the popular description of it as a trade in bodies,

147
0:08:25.986,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the European trans-Atlantic slave trade and slavery

148
0:08:29.787,000 --> 0:08:32,000
was one of the most radical and longest programs

149
0:08:33.232,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of African brains export in history.

150
0:08:36.831,000 --> 0:08:4,000
American slave owners may have pretended that Africans were mere brutes,

151
0:08:41.929,000 --> 0:08:42,000
beasts of burden,

152
0:08:43.597,000 --> 0:08:46,000
almost as inert and dumb as other farm implements

153
0:08:47.566,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they classified them with in their ledgers.

154
0:08:51.052,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And that's what they did.

155
0:08:53.099,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The enslaved Africans, on the other hand,

156
0:08:55.563,000 --> 0:08:58,000
knew their were embodiments of knowledge.

157
0:08:58.659,000 --> 0:09:,000
They were smiths, they were poets,

158
0:09:01.223,000 --> 0:09:04,000
they were political counselors, they were princes and princesses,

159
0:09:04.57,000 --> 0:09:06,000
they were mythologists, they were herbologists,

160
0:09:09.689,000 --> 0:09:1,000
they were chefs.

161
0:09:11.206,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The list is endless.

162
0:09:13.367,000 --> 0:09:15,000
They, to take a single example,

163
0:09:15.885,000 --> 0:09:17,000
brought the knowledge of rice cultivation

164
0:09:18.905,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to the American South.

165
0:09:22.101,000 --> 0:09:26,000
They created some of the most original civilizational elements

166
0:09:26.6,000 --> 0:09:28,000
for which the United States is now celebrated.

167
0:09:30.237,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They deployed their knowledge, for the most part,

168
0:09:33.361,000 --> 0:09:34,000
without compensation.

169
0:09:35.867,000 --> 0:09:38,000
For the last half-millennium, beginning with the slave trade,

170
0:09:39.399,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Africa has been exporting brains

171
0:09:42.069,000 --> 0:09:46,000
while simultaneously breaking the chains of knowledge transmission

172
0:09:46.815,000 --> 0:09:47,000
on the continent itself,

173
0:09:48.569,000 --> 0:09:52,000
with dire consequences for the systems of knowledge production in Africa.

174
0:09:53.664,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Successive generations are cut off from the intellectual production

175
0:09:58.258,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of their predecessors.

176
0:10:00.363,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We keep producing for external markets

177
0:10:03.43,000 --> 0:10:06,000
while beggaring our own internal needs.

178
0:10:07.411,000 --> 0:10:08,000
At present,

179
0:10:08.763,000 --> 0:10:1,000
much of the best knowledge about Africa

180
0:10:11.39,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is neither produced nor housed there,

181
0:10:14.722,000 --> 0:10:17,000
even when it is produced by Africans.

182
0:10:18.634,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Because we are dominated by immediate needs

183
0:10:21.119,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and relevant solutions when it comes to what we should know,

184
0:10:24.65,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we are happy to hand over to others

185
0:10:27.199,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the responsibility to produce knowledge,

186
0:10:29.683,000 --> 0:10:33,000
including knowledge about, of and for us,

187
0:10:33.985,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and to do so far away from us.

188
0:10:36.853,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We are ever eager to consume knowledge

189
0:10:40.02,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and have but a mere portion of it

190
0:10:42.443,000 --> 0:10:46,000
without any anxiety about ownership and location.

191
0:10:47.707,000 --> 0:10:5,000
African universities are now all too content

192
0:10:51.334,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to have e-connections with libraries elsewhere,

193
0:10:54.884,000 --> 0:10:56,000
having given up ambitions on building libraries

194
0:10:57.782,000 --> 0:11:,000
to which the world would come for intellectual edification.

195
0:11:02.411,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Control over who decides what should be stocked on our shelves

196
0:11:06.633,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and how access to collections should be determined

197
0:11:10.297,000 --> 0:11:13,000
are made to rest on our trust in our partners' good faith

198
0:11:14.152,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that they will not abandon us down the road.

199
0:11:17.981,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This must change.

200
0:11:21.093,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Africa must become a place of knowledge again.

201
0:11:25.433,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Knowledge production actually expands the economy.

202
0:11:31.262,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Take archaeological digs, for instance,

203
0:11:34.361,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and their impact on tourism.

204
0:11:37.527,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Our desires to unearth our antiquity,

205
0:11:40.931,000 --> 0:11:44,000
especially those remote times of which we have no written records,

206
0:11:45.728,000 --> 0:11:5,000
requires investment in archaeology and related disciplines,

207
0:11:50.766,000 --> 0:11:52,000
e.g., paleoanthropology.

208
0:11:53.715,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Yet, although it is our past we seek to know,

209
0:11:57.557,000 --> 0:11:58,000
by sheer serendipity,

210
0:11:59.935,000 --> 0:12:02,000
archaeology may shed light on the global human experience

211
0:12:03.824,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and yield economic payoffs

212
0:12:06.011,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that were no part of the original reasons for digging.

213
0:12:10.969,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We must find a way to make knowledge and its production sexy and rewarding;

214
0:12:17.985,000 --> 0:12:19,000
rewarding, not in the crass sense of moneymaking

215
0:12:21.6,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but in terms of making it worthwhile to indulge in the pursuit of knowledge,

216
0:12:27.101,000 --> 0:12:28,000
support the existence

217
0:12:28.519,000 --> 0:12:31,000
of knowledge-producing groups and intellectuals,

218
0:12:31.72,000 --> 0:12:33,000
ensuring that the continent

219
0:12:35.499,000 --> 0:12:38,000
becomes the immediate locus of knowledge production,

220
0:12:38.729,000 --> 0:12:39,000
distribution and consumption,

221
0:12:41.385,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and that instead of having its depositories

222
0:12:43.904,000 --> 0:12:44,000
beyond Africa's boundaries,

223
0:12:45.921,000 --> 0:12:48,000
people once more come from the rest of the world,

224
0:12:49.706,000 --> 0:12:52,000
even if in virtual space, to learn from us.

225
0:12:54.037,000 --> 0:12:59,000
All this we do as custodians on behalf of common humanity.

226
0:13:02.157,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Creating a knowledge society in Africa,

227
0:13:05.501,000 --> 0:13:1,000
for me, would be one way to celebrate and simultaneously enhance diversity

228
0:13:11.454,000 --> 0:13:15,000
by infinitely enriching it with material and additional artifacts --

229
0:13:16.887,000 --> 0:13:18,000
artifacts that we furnish

230
0:13:19.02,000 --> 0:13:2,000
by our strivings

231
0:13:21.019,000 --> 0:13:22,000
in the knowledge field.

232
0:13:23.047,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Thank you very much.

233
0:13:24.477,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Applause)

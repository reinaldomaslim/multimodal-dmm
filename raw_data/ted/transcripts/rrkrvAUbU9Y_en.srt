1
0:00:13.302,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I need to make a confession at the outset here.

2
0:00:15.842,000 --> 0:00:19,000
A little over 20 years ago, I did something that I regret,

3
0:00:21.671,000 --> 0:00:23,000
something that I'm not particularly proud of.

4
0:00:25.041,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Something that, in many ways, I wish no one would ever know,

5
0:00:28.44,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.

6
0:00:31.723,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In the late 1980s,

8
0:00:36.048,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in a moment of youthful indiscretion,

9
0:00:39.467,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I went to law school.

10
0:00:40.992,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:45.666,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In America, law is a professional degree:

12
0:00:48.127,000 --> 0:00:5,000
after your university degree, you go on to law school.

13
0:00:50.856,000 --> 0:00:51,000
When I got to law school,

14
0:00:53.133,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I didn't do very well.

15
0:00:55.743,000 --> 0:00:56,000
To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.

16
0:00:57.688,000 --> 0:01:,000
I, in fact, graduated in the part of my law school class

17
0:01:00.719,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that made the top 90% possible.

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Thank you.

20
0:01:10.985,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I never practiced law a day in my life;

21
0:01:14.564,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I pretty much wasn't allowed to.

22
0:01:16.572,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:19.31,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But today, against my better judgment,

24
0:01:22.815,000 --> 0:01:24,000
against the advice of my own wife,

25
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills --

26
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
what's left of those legal skills.

27
0:01:31.543,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I don't want to tell you a story.

28
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I want to make a case.

29
0:01:36.548,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I want to make a hard-headed,

30
0:01:38.938,000 --> 0:01:39,000
evidence-based,

31
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
dare I say lawyerly case,

32
0:01:43.358,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for rethinking how we run our businesses.

33
0:01:47.953,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

34
0:01:49.962,000 --> 0:01:5,000
take a look at this.

35
0:01:51.429,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is called the candle problem.

36
0:01:53.76,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Some of you might know it.

37
0:01:55.458,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It's created in 1945

38
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.

39
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
He created this experiment

40
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science.

41
0:02:04.315,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And here's how it works. Suppose I'm the experimenter.

42
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I bring you into a room.

43
0:02:08.804,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I give you a candle, some thumbtacks and some matches.

44
0:02:13.052,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I say to you,

45
0:02:14.147,000 --> 0:02:16,000
"Your job is to attach the candle to the wall

46
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
so the wax doesn't drip onto the table."

47
0:02:20.31,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now what would you do?

48
0:02:21.869,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Many people begin trying to thumbtack the candle to the wall.

49
0:02:25.488,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Doesn't work.

50
0:02:26.85,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I saw somebody kind of make the motion over here --

51
0:02:31.604,000 --> 0:02:34,000
some people have a great idea where they light the match,

52
0:02:34.732,000 --> 0:02:36,000
melt the side of the candle, try to adhere it to the wall.

53
0:02:37.685,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.

54
0:02:40.827,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And eventually, after five or ten minutes,

55
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
most people figure out the solution,

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which you can see here.

57
0:02:46.929,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The key is to overcome what's called functional fixedness.

58
0:02:50.743,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You look at that box and you see it only as a receptacle for the tacks.

59
0:02:54.731,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But it can also have this other function,

60
0:02:56.761,000 --> 0:02:58,000
as a platform for the candle.

61
0:02:59.047,000 --> 0:03:,000
The candle problem.

62
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I want to tell you about an experiment using the candle problem,

63
0:03:04.155,000 --> 0:03:06,000
done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,

64
0:03:06.638,000 --> 0:03:08,000
who is now at Princeton University, US,

65
0:03:08.783,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This shows the power of incentives.

66
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
He gathered his participants and said:

67
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"I'm going to time you, how quickly you can solve this problem."

68
0:03:18.009,000 --> 0:03:19,000
To one group he said,

69
0:03:19.509,000 --> 0:03:21,000
"I'm going to time you to establish norms,

70
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem."

71
0:03:26.725,000 --> 0:03:28,000
To the second group he offered rewards.

72
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
He said, "If you're in the top 25% of the fastest times,

73
0:03:33.907,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you get five dollars.

74
0:03:35.874,000 --> 0:03:38,000
If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today,

75
0:03:39.651,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you get 20 dollars."

76
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now this is several years ago, adjusted for inflation,

77
0:03:44.067,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work.

78
0:03:46.636,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's a nice motivator.

79
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Question:

80
0:03:49.327,000 --> 0:03:52,000
How much faster did this group solve the problem?

81
0:03:53.537,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Answer:

82
0:03:54.807,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It took them, on average, three and a half minutes longer.

83
0:04:00.473,000 --> 0:04:01,000
3.5 min longer.

84
0:04:01.712,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This makes no sense, right?

85
0:04:03.558,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I mean, I'm an American. I believe in free markets.

86
0:04:06.685,000 --> 0:04:08,000
That's not how it's supposed to work, right?

87
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:10.368,000 --> 0:04:13,000
If you want people to perform better, you reward them. Right?

89
0:04:14.307,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Bonuses, commissions, their own reality show.

90
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Incentivize them.

91
0:04:20.022,000 --> 0:04:21,000
That's how business works.

92
0:04:21.429,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But that's not happening here.

93
0:04:23.466,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You've got an incentive designed

94
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity,

95
0:04:28.98,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it does just the opposite.

96
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.

97
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
What's interesting about this experiment

98
0:04:36.115,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is that it's not an aberration.

99
0:04:37.709,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This has been replicated over and over again

100
0:04:40.818,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for nearly 40 years.

101
0:04:43.86,000 --> 0:04:45,000
These contingent motivators --

102
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
if you do this, then you get that --

103
0:04:48.558,000 --> 0:04:49,000
work in some circumstances.

104
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But for a lot of tasks, they actually either don't work

105
0:04:53.996,000 --> 0:04:54,000
or, often, they do harm.

106
0:04:56.848,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is one of the most robust findings in social science,

107
0:05:02.945,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and also one of the most ignored.

108
0:05:05.318,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I spent the last couple of years

109
0:05:06.932,000 --> 0:05:08,000
looking at the science of human motivation,

110
0:05:09.027,000 --> 0:05:11,000
particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators

111
0:05:11.413,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and intrinsic motivators.

112
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.

113
0:05:15.596,000 --> 0:05:17,000
If you look at the science, there is a mismatch

114
0:05:17.958,000 --> 0:05:18,000
between what science knows

115
0:05:19.835,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and what business does.

116
0:05:21.27,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What's alarming here is that our business operating system --

117
0:05:24.54,000 --> 0:05:27,000
think of the set of assumptions and protocols beneath our businesses,

118
0:05:27.872,000 --> 0:05:3,000
how we motivate people, how we apply our human resources--

119
0:05:32.63,000 --> 0:05:35,000
it's built entirely around these extrinsic motivators,

120
0:05:35.884,000 --> 0:05:36,000
around carrots and sticks.

121
0:05:37.479,000 --> 0:05:41,000
That's actually fine for many kinds of 20th century tasks.

122
0:05:41.692,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But for 21st century tasks,

123
0:05:43.827,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that mechanistic, reward-and-punishment approach

124
0:05:47.382,000 --> 0:05:48,000
doesn't work,

125
0:05:49.074,000 --> 0:05:5,000
often doesn't work,

126
0:05:50.58,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and often does harm.

127
0:05:51.775,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Let me show you.

128
0:05:52.982,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Glucksberg did another similar experiment,

129
0:05:56.083,000 --> 0:05:58,000
he presented the problem in a slightly different way,

130
0:05:58.72,000 --> 0:05:59,000
like this up here.

131
0:06:00.662,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Attach the candle to the wall so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.

132
0:06:03.963,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.

133
0:06:06.463,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You: we're incentivizing.

134
0:06:08.929,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What happened this time?

135
0:06:11.36,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This time, the incentivized group kicked the other group's butt.

136
0:06:17.588,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Why?

137
0:06:19.414,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Because when the tacks are out of the box,

138
0:06:21.945,000 --> 0:06:22,000
it's pretty easy isn't it?

139
0:06:25.421,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:27.895,000 --> 0:06:31,000
If-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks,

141
0:06:32.897,000 --> 0:06:33,000
where there is a simple set of rules

142
0:06:34.637,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and a clear destination to go to.

143
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Rewards, by their very nature,

144
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;

145
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that's why they work in so many cases.

146
0:06:43.519,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, for tasks like this,

147
0:06:45.622,000 --> 0:06:48,000
a narrow focus, where you just see the goal right there,

148
0:06:48.999,000 --> 0:06:49,000
zoom straight ahead to it,

149
0:06:50.403,000 --> 0:06:51,000
they work really well.

150
0:06:52.056,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But for the real candle problem,

151
0:06:54.8,000 --> 0:06:55,000
you don't want to be looking like this.

152
0:06:56.816,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The solution is on the periphery. You want to be looking around.

153
0:06:59.97,000 --> 0:07:01,000
That reward actually narrows our focus

154
0:07:02.621,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and restricts our possibility.

155
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Let me tell you why this is so important.

156
0:07:07.336,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In western Europe,

157
0:07:10.463,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in many parts of Asia,

158
0:07:11.572,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in North America, in Australia,

159
0:07:14.371,000 --> 0:07:17,000
white-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work,

160
0:07:17.961,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and more of this kind of work.

161
0:07:22.025,000 --> 0:07:24,000
That routine, rule-based, left-brain work --

162
0:07:25.02,000 --> 0:07:27,000
certain kinds of accounting, financial analysis,

163
0:07:27.76,000 --> 0:07:28,000
computer programming --

164
0:07:29.479,000 --> 0:07:31,000
has become fairly easy to outsource,

165
0:07:31.698,000 --> 0:07:33,000
fairly easy to automate.

166
0:07:33.753,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Software can do it faster.

167
0:07:35.953,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.

168
0:07:38.302,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So what really matters

169
0:07:41.294,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are the more right-brained creative, conceptual kinds of abilities.

170
0:07:45.946,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Think about your own work.

171
0:07:48.351,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Think about your own work.

172
0:07:51.033,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Are the problems that you face,

173
0:07:52.639,000 --> 0:07:54,000
or even the problems we've been talking about here,

174
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
do they have a clear set of rules,

175
0:07:58.072,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and a single solution?

176
0:07:59.683,000 --> 0:08:01,000
No. The rules are mystifying.

177
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The solution, if it exists at all,

178
0:08:04.43,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is surprising and not obvious.

179
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Everybody in this room

180
0:08:09.938,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is dealing with their own version of the candle problem.

181
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And for candle problems of any kind,

182
0:08:17.321,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in any field,

183
0:08:19.015,000 --> 0:08:21,000
those if-then rewards,

184
0:08:22.032,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the things around which we've built so many of our businesses,

185
0:08:26.298,000 --> 0:08:27,000
don't work!

186
0:08:28.155,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It makes me crazy.

187
0:08:30.635,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And here's the thing.

188
0:08:32.595,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is not a feeling.

189
0:08:35.856,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Okay? I'm a lawyer; I don't believe in feelings.

190
0:08:38.974,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is not a philosophy.

191
0:08:42.641,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I'm an American; I don't believe in philosophy.

192
0:08:44.927,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

193
0:08:47.525,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is a fact --

194
0:08:50.517,000 --> 0:08:52,000
or, as we say in my hometown of Washington, D.C.,

195
0:08:52.985,000 --> 0:08:53,000
a true fact.

196
0:08:54.599,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:57.067,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Applause)

198
0:09:00.885,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Let me give you an example.

199
0:09:02.551,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Let me marshal the evidence here.

200
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm not telling a story, I'm making a case.

201
0:09:06.297,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, some evidence:

202
0:09:08.592,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Dan Ariely, one of the great economists of our time,

203
0:09:11.991,000 --> 0:09:14,000
he and three colleagues did a study of some MIT students.

204
0:09:15.486,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They gave these MIT students a bunch of games,

205
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
games that involved creativity,

206
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and motor skills, and concentration.

207
0:09:22.462,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And the offered them, for performance,

208
0:09:24.567,000 --> 0:09:26,000
three levels of rewards:

209
0:09:26.605,000 --> 0:09:3,000
small reward, medium reward, large reward.

210
0:09:30.875,000 --> 0:09:34,000
If you do really well you get the large reward, on down.

211
0:09:35.036,000 --> 0:09:36,000
What happened?

212
0:09:36.394,000 --> 0:09:38,000
As long as the task involved only mechanical skill

213
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
bonuses worked as they would be expected:

214
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the higher the pay, the better the performance.

215
0:09:44.881,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Okay?

216
0:09:46.056,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But once the task called for even rudimentary cognitive skill,

217
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a larger reward led to poorer performance.

218
0:09:57.256,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Then they said,

219
0:09:58.43,000 --> 0:10:,000
"Let's see if there's any cultural bias here.

220
0:10:00.589,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Let's go to Madurai, India and test it."

221
0:10:02.566,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Standard of living is lower.

222
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
In Madurai, a reward that is modest in North American standards,

223
0:10:07.661,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is more meaningful there.

224
0:10:09.859,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Same deal. A bunch of games, three levels of rewards.

225
0:10:13.285,000 --> 0:10:14,000
What happens?

226
0:10:15.301,000 --> 0:10:18,000
People offered the medium level of rewards

227
0:10:18.325,000 --> 0:10:2,000
did no better than people offered the small rewards.

228
0:10:20.929,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But this time, people offered the highest rewards,

229
0:10:25.432,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they did the worst of all.

230
0:10:28.977,000 --> 0:10:31,000
In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments,

231
0:10:32.374,000 --> 0:10:35,000
higher incentives led to worse performance.

232
0:10:37.634,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Is this some kind of touchy-feely socialist conspiracy going on here?

233
0:10:43.634,000 --> 0:10:45,000
No, these are economists from MIT,

234
0:10:46.434,000 --> 0:10:48,000
from Carnegie Mellon, from the University of Chicago.

235
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Do you know who sponsored this research?

236
0:10:51.805,000 --> 0:10:55,000
The Federal Reserve Bank of the United States.

237
0:10:55.949,000 --> 0:10:56,000
That's the American experience.

238
0:10:57.793,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Let's go across the pond to the London School of Economics,

239
0:11:00.592,000 --> 0:11:02,000
LSE, London School of Economics,

240
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
alma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics.

241
0:11:06.628,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Training ground for great economic thinkers

242
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,

243
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and Mick Jagger.

244
0:11:13.471,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Laughter)

245
0:11:14.794,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Last month,

246
0:11:16.588,000 --> 0:11:17,000
just last month,

247
0:11:18.111,000 --> 0:11:21,000
economists at LSE looked at 51 studies

248
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies.

249
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Here's what they said:

250
0:11:25.635,000 --> 0:11:26,000
"We find that financial incentives

251
0:11:27.455,000 --> 0:11:31,000
can result in a negative impact on overall performance."

252
0:11:32.936,000 --> 0:11:35,000
There is a mismatch between what science knows

253
0:11:36.659,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and what business does.

254
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And what worries me, as we stand here in the rubble

255
0:11:41.461,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of the economic collapse,

256
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is that too many organizations are making their decisions,

257
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
their policies about talent and people,

258
0:11:49.556,000 --> 0:11:53,000
based on assumptions that are outdated,

259
0:11:53.707,000 --> 0:11:54,000
unexamined,

260
0:11:54.921,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and rooted more in folklore than in science.

261
0:11:58.564,000 --> 0:12:,000
And if we really want to get out of this economic mess,

262
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
if we really want high performance

263
0:12:03.277,000 --> 0:12:05,000
on those definitional tasks of the 21st century,

264
0:12:05.748,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the solution is not to do more of the wrong things,

265
0:12:11.712,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to entice people with a sweeter carrot,

266
0:12:14.059,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or threaten them with a sharper stick.

267
0:12:16.482,000 --> 0:12:17,000
We need a whole new approach.

268
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The good news is that the scientists

269
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
who've been studying motivation have given us this new approach.

270
0:12:23.372,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It's built much more around intrinsic motivation.

271
0:12:26.491,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Around the desire to do things because they matter,

272
0:12:28.97,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because we like it, they're interesting, or part of something important.

273
0:12:32.557,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And to my mind, that new operating system for our businesses

274
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
revolves around three elements:

275
0:12:37.885,000 --> 0:12:4,000
autonomy, mastery and purpose.

276
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Autonomy: the urge to direct our own lives.

277
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Mastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters.

278
0:12:48.429,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Purpose: the yearning to do what we do

279
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in the service of something larger than ourselves.

280
0:12:54.377,000 --> 0:12:57,000
These are the building blocks of an entirely new operating system

281
0:12:57.695,000 --> 0:12:58,000
for our businesses.

282
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I want to talk today only about autonomy.

283
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
In the 20th century, we came up with this idea of management.

284
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Management did not emanate from nature.

285
0:13:08.478,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Management is not a tree, it's a television set.

286
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Somebody invented it.

287
0:13:14.408,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It doesn't mean it's going to work forever.

288
0:13:16.432,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Management is great.

289
0:13:18.463,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Traditional notions of management are great

290
0:13:20.541,000 --> 0:13:21,000
if you want compliance.

291
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
But if you want engagement, self-direction works better.

292
0:13:25.367,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Some examples of some kind of radical notions of self-direction.

293
0:13:29.431,000 --> 0:13:31,000
You don't see a lot of it,

294
0:13:32.391,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but you see the first stirrings of something really interesting going on,

295
0:13:35.891,000 --> 0:13:38,000
what it means is paying people adequately and fairly, absolutely --

296
0:13:39.558,000 --> 0:13:41,000
getting the issue of money off the table,

297
0:13:41.867,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and then giving people lots of autonomy.

298
0:13:43.866,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Some examples.

299
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
How many of you have heard of the company Atlassian?

300
0:13:49.628,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It looks like less than half.

301
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
(Laughter)

302
0:13:52.589,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Atlassian is an Australian software company.

303
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And they do something incredibly cool.

304
0:13:59.155,000 --> 0:14:01,000
A few times a year they tell their engineers,

305
0:14:01.923,000 --> 0:14:05,000
"Go for the next 24 hours and work on anything you want,

306
0:14:05.953,000 --> 0:14:07,000
as long as it's not part of your regular job.

307
0:14:08.087,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Work on anything you want."

308
0:14:09.501,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Engineers use this time to come up with a cool patch for code,

309
0:14:13.288,000 --> 0:14:14,000
come up with an elegant hack.

310
0:14:14.754,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Then they present all of the stuff that they've developed

311
0:14:17.744,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to their teammates, to the rest of the company,

312
0:14:20.488,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in this wild and woolly all-hands meeting at the end of the day.

313
0:14:24.464,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Being Australians, everybody has a beer.

314
0:14:26.683,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They call them FedEx Days.

315
0:14:29.612,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Why?

316
0:14:31.675,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Because you have to deliver something overnight.

317
0:14:34.977,000 --> 0:14:35,000
It's pretty; not bad.

318
0:14:36.568,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It's a huge trademark violation, but it's pretty clever.

319
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Laughter)

320
0:14:40.621,000 --> 0:14:41,000
That one day of intense autonomy

321
0:14:42.323,000 --> 0:14:44,000
has produced a whole array of software fixes

322
0:14:44.399,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that might never have existed.

323
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
It's worked so well that Atlassian has taken it to the next level

324
0:14:49.252,000 --> 0:14:5,000
with 20% time --

325
0:14:50.334,000 --> 0:14:52,000
done, famously, at Google --

326
0:14:52.526,000 --> 0:14:54,000
where engineers can spend 20% of their time

327
0:14:54.612,000 --> 0:14:55,000
working on anything they want.

328
0:14:56.581,000 --> 0:14:57,000
They have autonomy over their time,

329
0:14:58.272,000 --> 0:15:,000
their task, their team, their technique.

330
0:15:00.509,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Radical amounts of autonomy.

331
0:15:02.487,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And at Google, as many of you know,

332
0:15:06.437,000 --> 0:15:08,000
about half of the new products in a typical year

333
0:15:08.794,000 --> 0:15:1,000
are birthed during that 20% time:

334
0:15:11.294,000 --> 0:15:13,000
things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.

335
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Let me give you an even more radical example of it:

336
0:15:17.104,000 --> 0:15:2,000
something called the Results Only Work Environment (the ROWE),

337
0:15:21.001,000 --> 0:15:23,000
created by two American consultants,

338
0:15:23.091,000 --> 0:15:25,000
in place at a dozen companies around North America.

339
0:15:25.794,000 --> 0:15:27,000
In a ROWE people don't have schedules.

340
0:15:29.728,000 --> 0:15:3,000
They show up when they want.

341
0:15:31.399,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They don't have to be in the office at a certain time, or any time.

342
0:15:35.477,000 --> 0:15:36,000
They just have to get their work done.

343
0:15:37.446,000 --> 0:15:41,000
How they do it, when they do it, where they do it, is totally up to them.

344
0:15:42.644,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional.

345
0:15:47.039,000 --> 0:15:48,000
What happens?

346
0:15:48.524,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Almost across the board,

347
0:15:50.259,000 --> 0:15:53,000
productivity goes up, worker engagement goes up,

348
0:15:53.493,000 --> 0:15:56,000
worker satisfaction goes up, turnover goes down.

349
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

350
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
the building blocks of a new way of doing things.

351
0:16:01.796,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Some of you might look at this and say,

352
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian."

353
0:16:07.518,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And I say, "Nope.

354
0:16:10.525,000 --> 0:16:11,000
I have proof."

355
0:16:12.638,000 --> 0:16:15,000
The mid-1990s, Microsoft started an encyclopedia called Encarta.

356
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
They had deployed all the right incentives,

357
0:16:19.501,000 --> 0:16:22,000
They paid professionals to write and edit thousands of articles.

358
0:16:23.374,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Well-compensated managers oversaw the whole thing

359
0:16:25.987,000 --> 0:16:27,000
to make sure it came in on budget and on time.

360
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
A few years later, another encyclopedia got started.

361
0:16:32.688,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Different model, right?

362
0:16:35.506,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Do it for fun.

363
0:16:37.19,000 --> 0:16:39,000
No one gets paid a cent, or a euro or a yen.

364
0:16:41.256,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Do it because you like to do it.

365
0:16:43.204,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Just 10 years ago,

366
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,

367
0:16:47.433,000 --> 0:16:5,000
"Hey, I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.

368
0:16:51.032,000 --> 0:16:53,000
If they went head to head, who would win?"

369
0:16:53.977,000 --> 0:16:56,000
10 years ago you could not have found a single sober economist

370
0:16:57.567,000 --> 0:16:59,000
anywhere on planet Earth

371
0:16:59.811,000 --> 0:17:01,000
who would have predicted the Wikipedia model.

372
0:17:02.707,000 --> 0:17:04,000
This is the titanic battle between these two approaches.

373
0:17:05.43,000 --> 0:17:08,000
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation, right?

374
0:17:08.522,000 --> 0:17:09,000
This is the Thrilla in Manila.

375
0:17:10.385,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators.

376
0:17:13.578,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,

377
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?

378
0:17:17.741,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Intrinsic motivation, autonomy, mastery and purpose, in a knockout.

379
0:17:21.295,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Let me wrap up.

380
0:17:24.683,000 --> 0:17:27,000
There is a mismatch between what science knows and what business does.

381
0:17:28.01,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Here is what science knows.

382
0:17:29.621,000 --> 0:17:3,000
One: Those 20th century rewards,

383
0:17:31.328,000 --> 0:17:33,000
those motivators we think are a natural part of business,

384
0:17:34.332,000 --> 0:17:37,000
do work, but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances.

385
0:17:38.057,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Two: Those if-then rewards often destroy creativity.

386
0:17:42.874,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Three: The secret to high performance isn't rewards and punishments,

387
0:17:46.698,000 --> 0:17:47,000
but that unseen intrinsic drive--

388
0:17:48.332,000 --> 0:17:5,000
the drive to do things for their own sake.

389
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
The drive to do things cause they matter.

390
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And here's the best part.

391
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
We already know this.

392
0:17:56.404,000 --> 0:17:58,000
The science confirms what we know in our hearts.

393
0:17:58.978,000 --> 0:18:02,000
So, if we repair this mismatch between science and business,

394
0:18:03.832,000 --> 0:18:05,000
if we bring our motivation, notions of motivation

395
0:18:06.789,000 --> 0:18:07,000
into the 21st century,

396
0:18:08.54,000 --> 0:18:12,000
if we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology

397
0:18:12.578,000 --> 0:18:14,000
of carrots and sticks,

398
0:18:14.634,000 --> 0:18:16,000
we can strengthen our businesses,

399
0:18:17.387,000 --> 0:18:19,000
we can solve a lot of those candle problems,

400
0:18:19.993,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and maybe, maybe --

401
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
we can change the world.

402
0:18:25.937,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I rest my case.

403
0:18:27.266,000 --> 0:18:3,000
(Applause)

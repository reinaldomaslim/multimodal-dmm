1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We lived on less than a dollar a day

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for about 15 years.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I got a scholarship, went to university,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
studied international agriculture, studied anthropology,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and decided I was going to give back.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I was going to work with small farmers.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I was going to help alleviate poverty.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I was going to work on international development,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and then I took a turn

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and ended up here.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you don't always end up in a place like this.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You could be in New York.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
What I found was,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I started working with refugees and famine victims --

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
small farmers, all, or nearly all --

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
who had been dispossessed and displaced.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, what I'd been trained to do

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
was methodological research on such people.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So I did it: I found out how many women

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
had been raped en route to these camps.

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I found out how many people had been put in jail,

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
how many family members had been killed.

26
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I assessed how long they were going to stay

27
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and how much it would take to feed them.

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I got really good at predicting

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
how many body bags you would need

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
for the people who were going to die in these camps.

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now this is God's work, but it's not my work.

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's not the work I set out to do.

33
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in 1988.

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I met a guy -- the guy on the left.

36
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
His name was Ben.

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?"

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?"

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"I make ice cream."

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So I said, "Well, you've got to make

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a rainforest ice cream.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to show that forests are worth more as forests

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
than they are as pasture."

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He said, "Okay."

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Within a year,

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves.

48
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It was a great success.

49
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We did our first million-dollars-worth of trade

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
by buying on 30 days and selling on 21.

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That gets your adrenaline going.

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because we were credit-worthy at that point.

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of the global Brazil-nut market.

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We paid two to three times more than anybody else.

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because we would buy it otherwise.

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
A great success.

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
generated 100 million in sales.

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It failed.

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Why did it fail?

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts

65
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
weren't the same people who were cutting the forests.

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And the people who made money from Brazil nuts

67
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
were not the people who made money from cutting the forests.

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We were attacking the wrong driver.

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We needed to be working on beef.

70
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We needed to be working on lumber.

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We needed to be working on soy --

72
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
things that we were not focused on.

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So let's go back to Sudan.

74
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I often talk to refugees:

75
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"Why was it that the West didn't realize

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that famines are caused by policies and politics,

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
not by weather?"

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And this farmer said to me, one day,

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
something that was very profound.

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
He said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep."

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Okay. Fast forward.

83
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We live on a planet.

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
There's just one of them.

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We've got to wake up to the fact

86
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that we don't have any more

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and that this is a finite planet.

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We know the limits of the resources we have.

89
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We may be able to use them differently.

90
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We may have some innovative, new ideas.

91
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But in general, this is what we've got.

92
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
There's no more of it.

93
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
There's a basic equation that we can't get away from.

94
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Population times consumption

95
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,

96
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and right now, it's a simple "not equal."

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Our work shows that we're living

98
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
at about 1.3 planets.

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Since 1990,

100
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we crossed the line

101
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.

102
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now we're at 1.3.

103
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.

104
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.

105
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is where we stand today.

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
A lot of people like to point

107
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to some place else as the cause of the problem.

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's always population growth.

109
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Population growth's important,

110
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but it's also about how much each person consumes.

111
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So when the average American

112
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
consumes 43 times as much

113
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
as the average African,

114
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we've got to think that consumption is an issue.

115
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's not just about population,

116
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it's not just about them; it's about us.

117
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But it's not just about people;

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it's about lifestyles.

119
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There's very good evidence --

120
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
again, we don't necessarily have

121
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
a peer-reviewed methodology

122
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that's bulletproof yet --

123
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but there's very good evidence

124
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that the average cat in Europe

125
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime

126
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
than the average African.

127
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
You think that's not an issue going forward?

128
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
You think that's not a question

129
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
as to how we should be using the Earth's resources?

130
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Let's go back and visit our equation.

131
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.

132
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They were consuming what they were consuming --

133
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
let's say one unit of consumption each.

134
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We have six billion units of consumption.

135
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
By 2050,

136
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree.

137
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do --

138
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
scientists, again, agree --

139
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because income is going to grow in developing countries

140
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
five times what it is today --

141
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
on global average, about [2.9].

142
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.

143
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Who have you heard talking lately

144
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that's said we have to triple production

145
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of goods and services?

146
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But that's what the math says.

147
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We're not going to be able to do that.

148
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We can get productivity up.

149
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We can get efficiency up.

150
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But we've also got to get consumption down.

151
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We need to use less

152
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to make more.

153
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And then we need to use less again.

154
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And then we need to consume less.

155
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
All of those things are part of that equation.

156
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But it basically raises a fundamental question:

157
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
should consumers have a choice

158
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
about sustainability, about sustainable products?

159
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable

160
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
sitting next to one that isn't,

161
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?

162
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,

163
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
how do you make that happen?

164
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.

165
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Okay, so let's be generous.

166
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.

167
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
How do you evaluate all the scientific data

168
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
around a product,

169
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?

170
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
How do you get informed?

171
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You don't.

172
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Here's a little question.

173
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
From a greenhouse gas perspective,

174
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is lamb produced in the U.K.

175
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
better than lamb produced in New Zealand,

176
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
frozen and shipped to the U.K.?

177
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef

178
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
better or worse than

179
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
a bad grazing operation for beef?

180
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Do organic potatoes

181
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
actually have fewer toxic chemicals

182
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
used to produce them

183
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
than conventional potatoes?

184
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
In every single case,

185
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the answer is "it depends."

186
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It depends on who produced it and how,

187
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in every single instance.

188
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And there are many others.

189
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?

190
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They're not.

191
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They may have a lot of opinions about it,

192
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but they're not going to be terribly informed.

193
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.

194
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's got to be something we all care about.

195
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And we need collusion.

196
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We need groups to work together that never have.

197
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We need Cargill to work with Bunge.

198
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We need Coke to work with Pepsi.

199
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge.

200
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We need Greenpeace to work with WWF.

201
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Everybody's got to work together --

202
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
China and the U.S.

203
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We need to begin to manage this planet

204
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as if our life depended on it,

205
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because it does,

206
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it fundamentally does.

207
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But we can't do everything.

208
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Even if we get everybody working on it,

209
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we've got to be strategic.

210
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We need to focus on the where,

211
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the what and the who.

212
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So, the where:

213
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.

214
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity

215
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.

216
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We have to work in these places.

217
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell

218
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of preserving biodiversity as we know it.

219
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We looked at the threats to these places.

220
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
These are the 15 commodities

221
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that fundamentally pose the biggest threats

222
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to these places

223
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because of deforestation,

224
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
soil loss, water use, pesticide use,

225
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
over-fishing, etc.

226
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So we've got 35 places,

227
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we've got 15 priority commodities,

228
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
who do we work with

229
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to change the way those commodities are produced?

230
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?

231
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Let's see, that's about 7,000 languages,

232
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
350 major languages --

233
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
a lot of work there.

234
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I don't see anybody actually being able

235
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to do that very effectively.

236
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?

237
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Again, a daunting task.

238
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
There must be a better way.

239
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
300 to 500 companies

240
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
control 70 percent or more

241
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
of the trade of each of the 15 commodities

242
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that we've identified as the most significant.

243
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
If we work with those, if we change those companies

244
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and the way they do business,

245
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
then the rest will happen automatically.

246
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So, we went through our 15 commodities.

247
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This is nine of them.

248
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We lined them up side-by-side,

249
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and we put the names of the companies that work

250
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
on each of those.

251
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And if you go through the first 25 or 30 names

252
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
of each of the commodities,

253
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
what you begin to see is,

254
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
gosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,

255
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
there's Cargill everywhere.

256
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
In fact, these names start coming up over and over again.

257
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So we did the analysis again a slightly different way.

258
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We said: if we take the top hundred companies,

259
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
what percentage

260
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
of all 15 commodities

261
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
do they touch, buy or sell?

262
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And what we found is it's 25 percent.

263
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So 100 companies

264
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
control 25 percent of the trade

265
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
of all 15 of the most significant

266
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
commodities on the planet.

267
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We can get our arms around a hundred companies.

268
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
A hundred companies, we can work with.

269
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Why is 25 percent important?

270
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Because if these companies demand sustainable products,

271
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.

272
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Companies can push producers

273
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
faster than consumers can.

274
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
By companies asking for this,

275
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
we can leverage production so much faster

276
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
than by waiting for consumers to do it.

277
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
After 40 years, the global organic movement

278
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
has achieved 0.7 of one percent

279
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of global food.

280
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We can't wait that long.

281
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We don't have that kind of time.

282
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We need change

283
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that's going to accelerate.

284
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Even working with individual companies

285
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is not probably going to get us there.

286
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We need to begin to work with industries.

287
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So we've started roundtables

288
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
where we bring together the entire value chain,

289
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
from producers

290
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
all the way to the retailers and brands.

291
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,

292
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we bring in researchers and scientists

293
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to have an informed discussion --

294
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
sometimes a battle royale --

295
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to figure out what are the key impacts

296
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
of these products,

297
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
what is a global benchmark,

298
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
what's an acceptable impact,

299
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and design standards around that.

300
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It's not all fun and games.

301
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
In salmon aquaculture,

302
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
we kicked off a roundtable

303
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
almost six years ago.

304
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Eight entities came to the table.

305
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We eventually got, I think, 60 percent

306
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
of global production at the table

307
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and 25 percent of demand at the table.

308
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Three of the original eight entities were suing each other.

309
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And yet, next week, we launch

310
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
globally verified, vetted and certified

311
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
standards for salmon aquaculture.

312
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It can happen.

313
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Applause)

314
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So what brings

315
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the different entities to the table?

316
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It's risk and demand.

317
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
For the big companies, it's reputational risk,

318
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
but more importantly,

319
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
they don't care what the price of commodities is.

320
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
If they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.

321
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
They care about availability,

322
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
so the big risk for them is not having product at all.

323
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
For the producers,

324
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,

325
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that's what brings them to the table.

326
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So it's the demand that brings them to the table.

327
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
The good news is

328
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
we identified a hundred companies two years ago.

329
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
In the last 18 months, we've signed agreements

330
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with 40 of those hundred companies

331
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
to begin to work with them on their supply chain.

332
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And in the next 18 months,

333
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
we will have signed up to work with another 40,

334
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and we think we'll get those signed as well.

335
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs

336
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
of these 80 companies together

337
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to help twist the arms of the final 20,

338
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to bring them to the table,

339
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,

340
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,

341
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
but we all need to be in this together.

342
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So we're pulling out all the stops.

343
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table.

344
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
One company we're working with that's begun --

345
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
in baby steps, perhaps --

346
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.

347
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They've funded research that shows

348
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that we can double global palm oil production

349
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,

350
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and do it all in Borneo alone

351
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
by planting on land that's already degraded.

352
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The study shows that the highest net present value

353
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
for palm oil

354
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
is on land that's been degraded.

355
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
They're also undertaking a study to look at

356
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
all of their supplies of palm oil

357
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
to see if they could be certified

358
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified

359
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
under a credible certification program.

360
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Why is Cargill important?

361
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent

362
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
of global palm oil.

363
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
If Cargill makes a decision,

364
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
the entire palm oil industry moves,

365
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
or at least 40 or 50 percent of it.

366
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
That's not insignificant.

367
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
More importantly, Cargill and one other company

368
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
ship 50 percent of the palm oil

369
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that goes to China.

370
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We don't have to change the way

371
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
a single Chinese company works

372
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
if we get Cargill to only send

373
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
sustainable palm oil to China.

374
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
It's a pre-competitive issue.

375
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
All the palm oil going there is good.

376
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Buy it.

377
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Mars is also on a similar journey.

378
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,

379
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
but Mars has made sustainability pledges

380
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to buy only certified product for all of its seafood.

381
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart

382
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
because of pet food.

383
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,

384
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and it all comes from the fact

385
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that Mars wants to be in business in the future.

386
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And what they see is that they need to

387
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
improve chocolate production.

388
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
On any given plantation,

389
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,

390
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
so Mars is looking at the genome,

391
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.

392
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
They're doing it with IBM and the USDA,

393
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and they're putting it in the public domain

394
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
because they want everybody to have access to this data,

395
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
because they want everybody to help them

396
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
make cocoa more productive and more sustainable.

397
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
What they've realized

398
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
is that if they can identify the traits

399
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
on productivity and drought tolerance,

400
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa

401
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
on 40 percent of the land.

402
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
The rest of the land can be used for something else.

403
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
It's more with less and less again.

404
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
That's what the future has got to be,

405
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and putting it in the public domain is smart.

406
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
They don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,

407
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
but they want to be a chocolate company forever.

408
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Now, the price of food, many people complain about,

409
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
but in fact, the price of food is going down,

410
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and that's odd because in fact,

411
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
consumers are not paying for the true cost of food.

412
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
If you take a look just at water,

413
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
what we see is that,

414
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
with four very common products,

415
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,

416
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and then you look at how much water input was put into them,

417
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and then you look at what the farmer was paid.

418
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
If you divide the amount of water

419
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
into what the farmer was paid,

420
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
the farmer didn't receive enough money

421
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.

422
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
That is an externality by definition.

423
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
This is the subsidy from nature.

424
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,

425
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts

426
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
with growers in Turkey

427
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
to sell juice into Europe,

428
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and they're doing that because they want to have a product

429
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
that's closer to the European market.

430
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
But they're not just buying the juice;

431
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
they're also buying the carbon in the trees

432
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon

433
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
to get the product into Europe.

434
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
There's carbon that's being bought with sugar,

435
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
with coffee, with beef.

436
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities

437
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
back into the price of the commodity.

438
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
We need to take what we've learned in private, voluntary standards

439
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
of what the best producers in the world are doing

440
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and use that to inform government regulation,

441
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
so we can shift the entire performance curve.

442
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
We can't just focus on identifying the best;

443
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
we've got to move the rest.

444
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
The issue isn't what to think, it's how to think.

445
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
These companies have begun to think differently.

446
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
They're on a journey; there's no turning back.

447
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
We're all on that same journey with them.

448
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
We have to really begin to change

449
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
the way we think about everything.

450
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion

451
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine.

452
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Thank you.

453
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
(Applause)

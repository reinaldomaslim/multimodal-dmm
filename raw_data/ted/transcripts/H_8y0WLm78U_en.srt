1
0:00:12.763,000 --> 0:00:16,000
You're looking at a woman who was publicly silent for a decade.

2
0:00:18.464,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Obviously, that's changed,

3
0:00:20.863,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but only recently.

4
0:00:22.971,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It was several months ago that I gave my very first major public talk,

5
0:00:27.432,000 --> 0:00:29,000
at the Forbes "30 Under 30 Summit" --

6
0:00:30.217,000 --> 0:00:34,000
1,500 brilliant people, all under the age of 30.

7
0:00:35.223,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That meant that in 1998, the oldest among the group were only 14,

8
0:00:41.649,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the youngest, just four.

9
0:00:44.967,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I joked with them that some might only have heard of me from rap songs.

10
0:00:50.485,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Yes, I'm in rap songs.

11
0:00:52.511,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:53.599,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Almost 40 rap songs.

13
0:00:56.607,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:58.59,000 --> 0:01:,000
But the night of my speech, a surprising thing happened.

15
0:01:02.144,000 --> 0:01:07,000
At the age of 41, I was hit on by a 27-year-old guy.

16
0:01:08.14,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:09.166,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I know, right?

18
0:01:12.301,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He was charming, and I was flattered,

19
0:01:14.722,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I declined.

20
0:01:17.212,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You know what his unsuccessful pickup line was?

21
0:01:20.91,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He could make me feel 22 again.

22
0:01:23.695,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:27.763,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Applause)

24
0:01:30.637,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I realized, later that night,

25
0:01:32.654,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I'm probably the only person over 40 who does not want to be 22 again.

26
0:01:38.163,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:41.109,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:47.554,000 --> 0:01:51,000
At the age of 22, I fell in love with my boss.

29
0:01:52.723,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And at the age of 24,

30
0:01:55.115,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I learned the devastating consequences.

31
0:01:59.46,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Can I see a show of hands of anyone here

32
0:02:02.871,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who didn't make a mistake or do something they regretted at 22?

33
0:02:09.232,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Yep. That's what I thought.

34
0:02:12.473,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So like me, at 22, a few of you may have also taken wrong turns

35
0:02:18.254,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and fallen in love with the wrong person,

36
0:02:21.608,000 --> 0:02:22,000
maybe even your boss.

37
0:02:24.313,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Unlike me, though,

38
0:02:26.059,000 --> 0:02:3,000
your boss probably wasn't the president of the United States of America.

39
0:02:30.54,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:31.604,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Of course, life is full of surprises.

41
0:02:35.877,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Not a day goes by that I'm not reminded of my mistake,

42
0:02:40.761,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I regret that mistake deeply.

43
0:02:45.57,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In 1998, after having been swept up into an improbable romance,

44
0:02:52.201,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I was then swept up into the eye of a political, legal and media maelstrom

45
0:02:57.985,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like we had never seen before.

46
0:03:01.082,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Remember, just a few years earlier,

47
0:03:03.734,000 --> 0:03:06,000
news was consumed from just three places:

48
0:03:07.071,000 --> 0:03:09,000
reading a newspaper or magazine,

49
0:03:09.337,000 --> 0:03:1,000
listening to the radio

50
0:03:11.075,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or watching television.

51
0:03:12.682,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That was it.

52
0:03:14.304,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But that wasn't my fate.

53
0:03:18.259,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Instead, this scandal was brought to you

54
0:03:21.758,000 --> 0:03:22,000
by the digital revolution.

55
0:03:24.43,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That meant we could access all the information we wanted,

56
0:03:27.886,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when we wanted it, anytime, anywhere.

57
0:03:32.976,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And when the story broke in January 1998,

58
0:03:37.057,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it broke online.

59
0:03:39.835,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It was the first time the traditional news was usurped by the internet

60
0:03:44.337,000 --> 0:03:45,000
for a major news story --

61
0:03:47.059,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a click that reverberated around the world.

62
0:03:52.56,000 --> 0:03:54,000
What that meant for me personally

63
0:03:54.922,000 --> 0:03:59,000
was that overnight, I went from being a completely private figure

64
0:04:00.335,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to a publicly humiliated one, worldwide.

65
0:04:05.272,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I was patient zero of losing a personal reputation on a global scale

66
0:04:11.286,000 --> 0:04:13,000
almost instantaneously.

67
0:04:15.381,000 --> 0:04:17,000
This rush to judgment, enabled by technology,

68
0:04:18.281,000 --> 0:04:21,000
led to mobs of virtual stone-throwers.

69
0:04:21.889,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Granted, it was before social media,

70
0:04:24.827,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but people could still comment online,

71
0:04:28.231,000 --> 0:04:29,000
e-mail stories,

72
0:04:29.93,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and, of course, e-mail cruel jokes.

73
0:04:34.714,000 --> 0:04:37,000
News sources plastered photos of me all over

74
0:04:38.001,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to sell newspapers, banner ads online,

75
0:04:41.605,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and to keep people tuned to the TV.

76
0:04:45.962,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Do you recall a particular image of me, say, wearing a beret?

77
0:04:53.48,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now, I admit I made mistakes --

78
0:04:56.108,000 --> 0:04:58,000
especially wearing that beret.

79
0:04:58.278,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:00.228,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But the attention and judgment that I received --

81
0:05:02.914,000 --> 0:05:05,000
not the story, but that I personally received --

82
0:05:06.261,000 --> 0:05:07,000
was unprecedented.

83
0:05:08.713,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I was branded as a tramp,

84
0:05:12.029,000 --> 0:05:13,000
tart,

85
0:05:13.65,000 --> 0:05:14,000
slut,

86
0:05:15.364,000 --> 0:05:16,000
whore,

87
0:05:16.999,000 --> 0:05:17,000
bimbo,

88
0:05:18.855,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and, of course, "that woman."

89
0:05:22.662,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I was seen by many,

90
0:05:24.733,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but actually known by few.

91
0:05:28.863,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I get it: it was easy to forget

92
0:05:31.982,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that that woman was dimensional,

93
0:05:34.787,000 --> 0:05:35,000
had a soul

94
0:05:36.578,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and was once unbroken.

95
0:05:41.346,000 --> 0:05:45,000
When this happened to me 17 years ago, there was no name for it.

96
0:05:46.604,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now we call it "cyberbullying" and "online harassment."

97
0:05:52.584,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Today, I want to share some of my experience with you,

98
0:05:55.724,000 --> 0:05:59,000
talk about how that experience has helped shape my cultural observations,

99
0:06:01.201,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and how I hope my past experience can lead to a change

100
0:06:04.621,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that results in less suffering for others.

101
0:06:09.887,000 --> 0:06:14,000
In 1998, I lost my reputation and my dignity.

102
0:06:15.734,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I lost almost everything.

103
0:06:19.226,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I almost lost my life.

104
0:06:25.031,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Let me paint a picture for you.

105
0:06:29.365,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It is September of 1998.

106
0:06:32.866,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm sitting in a windowless office room

107
0:06:35.714,000 --> 0:06:37,000
inside the Office of the Independent Counsel,

108
0:06:39.213,000 --> 0:06:41,000
underneath humming fluorescent lights.

109
0:06:42.892,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I'm listening to the sound of my voice,

110
0:06:46.974,000 --> 0:06:49,000
my voice on surreptitiously taped phone calls

111
0:06:50.374,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that a supposed friend had made the year before.

112
0:06:54.018,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'm here because I've been legally required

113
0:06:57.331,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to personally authenticate all 20 hours of taped conversation.

114
0:07:04.916,000 --> 0:07:08,000
For the past eight months, the mysterious content of these tapes

115
0:07:09.021,000 --> 0:07:11,000
has hung like the sword of Damocles over my head.

116
0:07:12.747,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I mean, who can remember what they said a year ago?

117
0:07:17.587,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Scared and mortified, I listen,

118
0:07:22.846,000 --> 0:07:25,000
listen as I prattle on about the flotsam and jetsam of the day;

119
0:07:27.771,000 --> 0:07:3,000
listen as I confess my love for the president,

120
0:07:31.152,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and, of course, my heartbreak;

121
0:07:34.71,000 --> 0:07:39,000
listen to my sometimes catty, sometimes churlish, sometimes silly self

122
0:07:40.158,000 --> 0:07:43,000
being cruel, unforgiving, uncouth;

123
0:07:45.031,000 --> 0:07:5,000
listen, deeply, deeply ashamed, to the worst version of myself,

124
0:07:51.363,000 --> 0:07:53,000
a self I don't even recognize.

125
0:07:56.537,000 --> 0:07:59,000
A few days later, the Starr Report is released to Congress,

126
0:08:00.406,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and all of those tapes and transcripts, those stolen words, form a part of it.

127
0:08:06.694,000 --> 0:08:09,000
That people can read the transcripts is horrific enough.

128
0:08:11.221,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But a few weeks later,

129
0:08:14.044,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the audiotapes are aired on TV,

130
0:08:16.733,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and significant portions made available online.

131
0:08:22.597,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The public humiliation was excruciating.

132
0:08:26.911,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Life was almost unbearable.

133
0:08:33.05,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This was not something that happened with regularity back then in 1998,

134
0:08:38.119,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and by "this," I mean the stealing of people's private words, actions,

135
0:08:43.836,000 --> 0:08:45,000
conversations or photos,

136
0:08:46.323,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and then making them public --

137
0:08:48.776,000 --> 0:08:49,000
public without consent,

138
0:08:51.214,000 --> 0:08:52,000
public without context

139
0:08:53.849,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and public without compassion.

140
0:08:57.63,000 --> 0:09:,000
Fast-forward 12 years, to 2010,

141
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and now social media has been born.

142
0:09:04.888,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The landscape has sadly become much more populated with instances like mine,

143
0:09:09.921,000 --> 0:09:11,000
whether or not someone actually made a mistake,

144
0:09:13.128,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and now, it's for both public and private people.

145
0:09:18.682,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The consequences for some have become dire, very dire.

146
0:09:26.198,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I was on the phone with my mom in September of 2010,

147
0:09:30.902,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and we were talking about the news of a young college freshman

148
0:09:34.32,000 --> 0:09:35,000
from Rutgers University,

149
0:09:36.077,000 --> 0:09:37,000
named Tyler Clementi.

150
0:09:38.724,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Sweet, sensitive, creative Tyler was secretly webcammed by his roommate

151
0:09:44.325,000 --> 0:09:46,000
while being intimate with another man.

152
0:09:48.666,000 --> 0:09:5,000
When the online world learned of this incident,

153
0:09:51.295,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the ridicule and cyberbullying ignited.

154
0:09:56.464,000 --> 0:09:57,000
A few days later,

155
0:09:58.67,000 --> 0:10:,000
Tyler jumped from the George Washington Bridge

156
0:10:01.665,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to his death.

157
0:10:03.524,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He was 18.

158
0:10:07.453,000 --> 0:10:11,000
My mom was beside herself about what happened to Tyler and his family,

159
0:10:12.085,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and she was gutted with pain

160
0:10:14.942,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in a way that I just couldn't quite understand.

161
0:10:18.618,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And then eventually, I realized she was reliving 1998,

162
0:10:24.021,000 --> 0:10:27,000
reliving a time when she sat by my bed every night,

163
0:10:30.57,000 --> 0:10:31,000
reliving -- (Chokes up)

164
0:10:31.745,000 --> 0:10:35,000
sorry -- reliving a time when she made me shower with the bathroom door open,

165
0:10:37.416,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and reliving a time when both of my parents feared

166
0:10:41.089,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that I would be humiliated to death,

167
0:10:43.912,000 --> 0:10:44,000
literally.

168
0:10:48.339,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Today, too many parents haven't had the chance

169
0:10:52.054,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to step in and rescue their loved ones.

170
0:10:55.071,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Too many have learned of their child's suffering and humiliation

171
0:10:58.873,000 --> 0:10:59,000
after it was too late.

172
0:11:02.116,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Tyler's tragic, senseless death was a turning point for me.

173
0:11:06.485,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It served to recontextualize my experiences,

174
0:11:10.356,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and I then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me

175
0:11:14.918,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and see something different.

176
0:11:18.593,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In 1998, we had no way of knowing

177
0:11:21.599,000 --> 0:11:25,000
where this brave new technology called the internet would take us.

178
0:11:26.403,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Since then, it has connected people in unimaginable ways --

179
0:11:30.515,000 --> 0:11:32,000
joining lost siblings,

180
0:11:32.591,000 --> 0:11:33,000
saving lives,

181
0:11:34.182,000 --> 0:11:35,000
launching revolutions ...

182
0:11:37.087,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But the darkness, cyberbullying, and slut-shaming that I experienced

183
0:11:41.216,000 --> 0:11:42,000
had mushroomed.

184
0:11:44.874,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Every day online, people -- especially young people,

185
0:11:49.599,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who are not developmentally equipped to handle this --

186
0:11:52.833,000 --> 0:11:54,000
are so abused and humiliated

187
0:11:55.211,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that they can't imagine living to the next day.

188
0:11:58.353,000 --> 0:12:,000
And some, tragically, don't.

189
0:12:01.302,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And there's nothing virtual about that.

190
0:12:04.892,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Childline, a UK nonprofit that's focused on helping young people on various issues,

191
0:12:11.398,000 --> 0:12:14,000
released a staggering statistic late last year:

192
0:12:15.558,000 --> 0:12:21,000
from 2012 to 2013, there was an 87 percent increase

193
0:12:22.024,000 --> 0:12:25,000
in calls and e-mails related to cyberbullying.

194
0:12:26.834,000 --> 0:12:28,000
A meta-analysis done out of the Netherlands

195
0:12:29.15,000 --> 0:12:3,000
showed that for the first time,

196
0:12:31.031,000 --> 0:12:36,000
cyberbullying was leading to suicidal ideations

197
0:12:36.203,000 --> 0:12:38,000
more significantly than offline bullying.

198
0:12:40.379,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And you know, what shocked me -- although it shouldn't have --

199
0:12:43.723,000 --> 0:12:45,000
was other research last year

200
0:12:45.789,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that determined humiliation was a more intensely felt emotion

201
0:12:51.228,000 --> 0:12:54,000
than either happiness or even anger.

202
0:12:56.371,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Cruelty to others is nothing new.

203
0:13:00.006,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But online, technologically enhanced shaming is amplified,

204
0:13:05.733,000 --> 0:13:06,000
uncontained

205
0:13:07.325,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and permanently accessible.

206
0:13:11.213,000 --> 0:13:16,000
The echo of embarrassment used to extend only as far as your family, village,

207
0:13:16.789,000 --> 0:13:17,000
school or community.

208
0:13:18.998,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But now, it's the online community too.

209
0:13:22.876,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Millions of people, often anonymously, can stab you with their words,

210
0:13:27.336,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and that's a lot of pain.

211
0:13:29.735,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And there are no perimeters around how many people can publicly observe you

212
0:13:34.942,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and put you in a public stockade.

213
0:13:39.415,000 --> 0:13:43,000
There is a very personal price to public humiliation,

214
0:13:45.239,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and the growth of the internet has jacked up that price.

215
0:13:52.045,000 --> 0:13:53,000
For nearly two decades now,

216
0:13:53.978,000 --> 0:13:57,000
we have slowly been sowing the seeds of shame and public humiliation

217
0:13:58.758,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in our cultural soil, both on- and offline.

218
0:14:03.968,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Gossip websites, paparazzi, reality programming, politics,

219
0:14:08.986,000 --> 0:14:11,000
news outlets and sometimes hackers

220
0:14:12.108,000 --> 0:14:14,000
all traffic in shame.

221
0:14:14.837,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It's led to desensitization and a permissive environment online,

222
0:14:19.395,000 --> 0:14:23,000
which lends itself to trolling, invasion of privacy and cyberbullying.

223
0:14:25.217,000 --> 0:14:29,000
This shift has created what Professor Nicolaus Mills calls

224
0:14:29.306,000 --> 0:14:31,000
"a culture of humiliation."

225
0:14:32.836,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Consider a few prominent examples just from the past six months alone.

226
0:14:38.015,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Snapchat, the service which is used mainly by younger generations

227
0:14:43.1,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and claims that its messages only have the life span of a few seconds.

228
0:14:47.674,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You can imagine the range of content that that gets.

229
0:14:51.026,000 --> 0:14:56,000
A third-party app which Snapchatters use to preserve the life span of the messages

230
0:14:56.65,000 --> 0:14:57,000
was hacked,

231
0:14:58.167,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and 100,000 personal conversations, photos and videos were leaked online,

232
0:15:04.717,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to now have a life span of forever.

233
0:15:08.983,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Jennifer Lawrence and several other actors had their iCloud accounts hacked,

234
0:15:13.195,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and private, intimate, nude photos were plastered across the internet

235
0:15:17.143,000 --> 0:15:18,000
without their permission.

236
0:15:18.868,000 --> 0:15:22,000
One gossip website had over five million hits

237
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
for this one story.

238
0:15:26.36,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And what about the Sony Pictures cyberhacking?

239
0:15:30.422,000 --> 0:15:33,000
The documents which received the most attention

240
0:15:33.523,000 --> 0:15:37,000
were private e-mails that had maximum public embarrassment value.

241
0:15:40.146,000 --> 0:15:42,000
But in this culture of humiliation,

242
0:15:42.526,000 --> 0:15:46,000
there is another kind of price tag attached to public shaming.

243
0:15:47.4,000 --> 0:15:5,000
The price does not measure the cost to the victim,

244
0:15:50.587,000 --> 0:15:52,000
which Tyler and too many others --

245
0:15:52.954,000 --> 0:15:56,000
notably, women, minorities and members of the LGBTQ community --

246
0:15:57.912,000 --> 0:15:58,000
have paid,

247
0:15:59.103,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but the price measures the profit of those who prey on them.

248
0:16:05.196,000 --> 0:16:08,000
This invasion of others is a raw material,

249
0:16:08.686,000 --> 0:16:13,000
efficiently and ruthlessly mined, packaged and sold at a profit.

250
0:16:15.479,000 --> 0:16:2,000
A marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity,

251
0:16:21.12,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and shame is an industry.

252
0:16:25.189,000 --> 0:16:26,000
How is the money made?

253
0:16:27.699,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Clicks.

254
0:16:29.493,000 --> 0:16:31,000
The more shame, the more clicks.

255
0:16:31.843,000 --> 0:16:34,000
The more clicks, the more advertising dollars.

256
0:16:37.428,000 --> 0:16:38,000
We're in a dangerous cycle.

257
0:16:39.914,000 --> 0:16:41,000
The more we click on this kind of gossip,

258
0:16:42.558,000 --> 0:16:44,000
the more numb we get to the human lives behind it.

259
0:16:46.08,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And the more numb we get, the more we click.

260
0:16:51.52,000 --> 0:16:52,000
All the while,

261
0:16:52.723,000 --> 0:16:56,000
someone is making money off of the back of someone else's suffering.

262
0:16:58.83,000 --> 0:17:,000
With every click, we make a choice.

263
0:17:01.358,000 --> 0:17:04,000
The more we saturate our culture with public shaming,

264
0:17:04.863,000 --> 0:17:05,000
the more accepted it is,

265
0:17:06.794,000 --> 0:17:1,000
the more we will see behavior like cyberbullying, trolling,

266
0:17:11.133,000 --> 0:17:12,000
some forms of hacking

267
0:17:13.122,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and online harassment.

268
0:17:15.443,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Why? Because they all have humiliation at their cores.

269
0:17:23.23,000 --> 0:17:27,000
This behavior is a symptom of the culture we've created.

270
0:17:27.527,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Just think about it.

271
0:17:30.993,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Changing behavior begins with evolving beliefs.

272
0:17:34.772,000 --> 0:17:37,000
We've seen that to be true with racism, homophobia

273
0:17:37.967,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and plenty of other biases,

274
0:17:39.862,000 --> 0:17:4,000
today and in the past.

275
0:17:42.695,000 --> 0:17:45,000
As we've changed beliefs about same-sex marriage,

276
0:17:45.743,000 --> 0:17:48,000
more people have been offered equal freedoms.

277
0:17:49.978,000 --> 0:17:51,000
When we began valuing sustainability,

278
0:17:52.788,000 --> 0:17:54,000
more people began to recycle.

279
0:17:55.434,000 --> 0:17:58,000
So as far as our culture of humiliation goes,

280
0:17:58.956,000 --> 0:18:,000
what we need is a cultural revolution.

281
0:18:02.481,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Public shaming as a blood sport has to stop,

282
0:18:06.274,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and it's time for an intervention on the internet and in our culture.

283
0:18:11.202,000 --> 0:18:13,000
The shift begins with something simple,

284
0:18:13.666,000 --> 0:18:14,000
but it's not easy.

285
0:18:15.985,000 --> 0:18:19,000
We need to return to a long-held value of compassion,

286
0:18:20.467,000 --> 0:18:21,000
compassion and empathy.

287
0:18:23.071,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Online, we've got a compassion deficit,

288
0:18:25.814,000 --> 0:18:26,000
an empathy crisis.

289
0:18:29.413,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Researcher Brené Brown said, and I quote,

290
0:18:32.803,000 --> 0:18:34,000
"Shame can't survive empathy."

291
0:18:36.305,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Shame cannot survive empathy.

292
0:18:42.515,000 --> 0:18:44,000
I've seen some very dark days in my life.

293
0:18:46.221,000 --> 0:18:51,000
It was the compassion and empathy from my family, friends, professionals

294
0:18:53.002,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and sometimes even strangers

295
0:18:54.766,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that saved me.

296
0:18:57.345,000 --> 0:19:,000
Even empathy from one person can make a difference.

297
0:19:02.369,000 --> 0:19:04,000
The theory of minority influence,

298
0:19:04.757,000 --> 0:19:07,000
proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici,

299
0:19:08.195,000 --> 0:19:1,000
says that even in small numbers,

300
0:19:10.825,000 --> 0:19:12,000
when there's consistency over time,

301
0:19:13.025,000 --> 0:19:14,000
change can happen.

302
0:19:15.794,000 --> 0:19:18,000
In the online world, we can foster minority influence

303
0:19:19.061,000 --> 0:19:2,000
by becoming upstanders.

304
0:19:21.353,000 --> 0:19:24,000
To become an upstander means instead of bystander apathy,

305
0:19:25.174,000 --> 0:19:29,000
we can post a positive comment for someone or report a bullying situation.

306
0:19:30.23,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Trust me, compassionate comments help abate the negativity.

307
0:19:35.202,000 --> 0:19:38,000
We can also counteract the culture by supporting organizations

308
0:19:39.097,000 --> 0:19:41,000
that deal with these kinds of issues,

309
0:19:41.198,000 --> 0:19:43,000
like the Tyler Clementi Foundation in the US;

310
0:19:44.78,000 --> 0:19:46,000
in the UK, there's Anti-Bullying Pro;

311
0:19:47.437,000 --> 0:19:49,000
and in Australia, there's PROJECT ROCKIT.

312
0:19:52.206,000 --> 0:19:57,000
We talk a lot about our right to freedom of expression.

313
0:19:58.333,000 --> 0:20:01,000
But we need to talk more about our responsibility

314
0:20:01.434,000 --> 0:20:02,000
to freedom of expression.

315
0:20:04.051,000 --> 0:20:06,000
We all want to be heard,

316
0:20:06.32,000 --> 0:20:1,000
but let's acknowledge the difference between speaking up with intention

317
0:20:11.104,000 --> 0:20:13,000
and speaking up for attention.

318
0:20:15.493,000 --> 0:20:17,000
The internet is the superhighway for the id.

319
0:20:19.597,000 --> 0:20:23,000
But online, showing empathy to others benefits us all

320
0:20:24.279,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and helps create a safer and better world.

321
0:20:27.905,000 --> 0:20:3,000
We need to communicate online with compassion,

322
0:20:30.981,000 --> 0:20:32,000
consume news with compassion

323
0:20:33.335,000 --> 0:20:35,000
and click with compassion.

324
0:20:36.114,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Just imagine walking a mile in someone else's headline.

325
0:20:43.261,000 --> 0:20:45,000
I'd like to end on a personal note.

326
0:20:47.561,000 --> 0:20:48,000
In the past nine months,

327
0:20:49.389,000 --> 0:20:52,000
the question I've been asked the most is "Why?"

328
0:20:52.786,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Why now?

329
0:20:53.97,000 --> 0:20:55,000
Why was I sticking my head above the parapet?

330
0:20:57.193,000 --> 0:20:59,000
You can read between the lines in those questions,

331
0:20:59.83,000 --> 0:21:01,000
and the answer has nothing to do with politics.

332
0:21:03.471,000 --> 0:21:07,000
The top-note answer was and is "Because it's time."

333
0:21:09.166,000 --> 0:21:11,000
Time to stop tiptoeing around my past,

334
0:21:12.031,000 --> 0:21:14,000
time to stop living a life of opprobrium

335
0:21:15.045,000 --> 0:21:17,000
and time to take back my narrative.

336
0:21:18.51,000 --> 0:21:21,000
It's also not just about saving myself.

337
0:21:23.003,000 --> 0:21:26,000
Anyone who is suffering from shame and public humiliation

338
0:21:26.673,000 --> 0:21:27,000
needs to know one thing:

339
0:21:29.446,000 --> 0:21:3,000
You can survive it.

340
0:21:32.016,000 --> 0:21:33,000
I know it's hard.

341
0:21:34.572,000 --> 0:21:37,000
It may not be painless, quick or easy,

342
0:21:38.109,000 --> 0:21:41,000
but you can insist on a different ending to your story.

343
0:21:42.942,000 --> 0:21:44,000
Have compassion for yourself.

344
0:21:46.27,000 --> 0:21:48,000
We all deserve compassion

345
0:21:49.39,000 --> 0:21:54,000
and to live both online and off in a more compassionate world.

346
0:21:55.684,000 --> 0:21:56,000
Thank you for listening.

347
0:21:57.205,000 --> 0:22:03,000
(Applause and cheers)

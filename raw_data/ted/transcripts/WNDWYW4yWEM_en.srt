1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Actually, I come from Britain,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So, that's home really.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
off the southwest coast of India here.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Capital, Malé, where I live.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Actually, sitting here today in Mysore,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And it has been my home these years.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
fantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I spend as much of my time as possible

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
investigating the marine life.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I study fish,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
also the bigger things, whales and dolphins.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is a blue whale. We have blue whales

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in the waters around here, off Maldives,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
One of the best places in the world to see blue whales

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is here in this region.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
during the northeast monsoon season,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
you can see blue whales very, very easily.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's probably the best place in the world to see them.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I need to explain a little bit about monsoons.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon"

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
comes from the word "season."

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That's what brings the monsoon rain.

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And then in the winter things cool down.

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
High pressure builds over India.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And the whole system goes into reverse.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, the wind is now coming from the northeast

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
out of India, across the Indian Ocean,

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
this way towards Africa.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Keep that in mind.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
including dragonflies. And I'm actually

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And one thing you need to know about dragonflies,

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
one important thing,

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is that they lay their eggs in fresh water.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They need fresh water to breed.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They lay the eggs into fresh water.

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So, they're very important.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They control mosquito larvae, among other things.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And typically, there is a lot of variation,

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
lives for 10 or 11 months.

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So it's essentially a freshwater animal.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It really does need fresh water.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now, the particular species of dragonfly

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I want to talk about is this one,

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But this guy is an exception.

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And this is called the Globe Skimmer,

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
or Wandering Glider.

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But it really hasn't been studied very much.

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is, it seems a bit dull you know.

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.

93
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
living in the Maldives.

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
When I first went to the Maldives,

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
as I could in and under the water.

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Didn't notice them.

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But after some time, after some months, one day

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
as I was going out and about,

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I didn't know at the time, but I know now,

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And they were there for some time. And then they were gone.

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I didn't think anything more of it until

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the following year, when it happened again,

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then the year after that, and then the year after that.

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I asked people about them and yes,

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they knew, but they didn't know anything,

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
where they came from, or anything.

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And again I didn't think too much of it.

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But slowly it began to dawn on me that something

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
rather special was happening.

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed.

122
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there --

123
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so here is home.

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So, Maldives, beautiful place.

125
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's built entirely of coral reefs.

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.

128
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Average height, about that much above sea level.

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But I'm not going to talk about that.

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Another important point of these sand banks

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is that when it rains,

133
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So, it stays under the soil.

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
The trees can put their roots into it.

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Humans can dig holes and make a well.

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But dragonflies -- a bit tricky.

138
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
There is no surface fresh water.

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,

140
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
nothing like that.

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So, why is it that every year

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
millions of dragonflies, millions,

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
millions of dragonflies turn up?

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
from India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.

147
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,

148
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
let me have a show of hands, who of you --

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
not yet, not yet!

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Wait for the go. I'll say go.

152
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Those of you who grew up in India,

153
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
do you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,

154
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
swarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
maybe tying little bits of string onto them?

156
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Maybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.

157
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.

158
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

159
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's a widespread phenomenon

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
throughout South Asia, including the Maldives.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I got a bit curious about it.

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water,

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?

164
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And the first thing I did was started recording

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
when they turned up in the Maldives.

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And there is the answer, 21st of October.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Not every year, that's the average date.

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.

170
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.

171
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's going towards India, not from India.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So, are these things, how are these things getting here?

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Are they coming from India against the wind?

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Seemed a bit unlikely.

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So, next thing I did is I got on the phone.

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Maldives is a long archipelago.

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
When do you see the dragonflies appear?

183
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And pretty soon, a picture started emerging.

184
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
information for three years, average,

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
24th of September, so late September.

187
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Down in Trivandrum, a bit later.

188
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Far north of Maldives, a bit later.

189
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Then Malé, then further south.

190
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And then the southernmost Maldives.

191
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.

192
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.

193
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
How on Earth are they doing that?

194
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
I didn't know.

195
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.

196
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I wanted to know about their seasonality,

197
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
what time of year, this is when they first arrive,

198
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?

199
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So, I started a very rigorous scientific process.

200
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I had a rigorous scientific transect.

201
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I got on my bicycle,

202
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and I cycled around the island of Malé.

203
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It's about five kilometers around,

204
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
counting the dragonflies as I go,

205
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.

206
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And they're here for a very short time,

207
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
October, November, December. That's it.

208
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.

209
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.

210
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That's not the southwest season.

211
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
That's the inter-monsoon,

212
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the time when the monsoon changes.

213
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,

214
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.

215
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass

216
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
going up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.

217
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
What happens, actually, is there is two air masses.

218
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And there is a front between them, and the front moves.

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So, if you've got India here,

220
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.

221
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.

222
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And that front in the middle is not vertical,

223
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
it's at an angle.

224
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So, as it comes over towards Malé

225
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I'm standing in Malé underneath the front.

226
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I can be in the southwest monsoon.

227
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.

228
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,

229
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.

230
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],

231
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
two inches long, five centimeters long,

232
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,

233
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
at 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.

234
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,

235
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,

236
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and that's okay,

237
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I know how they come here, but why do they come here?

238
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to their apparent doom?

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
What on Earth are they doing?

242
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Well, to cut a long story short,

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
they're actually flying right across the ocean.

244
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
They're making it all the way across to East Africa.

245
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels

246
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.

247
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I know because we have reports from Seychelles,

248
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which fit in as well, down here.

249
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I know because

250
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
when you look at the rainfall,

251
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
breed in temporary rain water pools.

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the monsoon rains.

255
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The larvae have to develop very quickly.

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They're up, and they're off.

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
the top is rainfall for India.

260
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.

261
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
By September, October, it's drying out.

262
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.

263
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.

264
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south

265
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.

266
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And then they run out of land.

267
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,

268
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it can fly for thousands of kilometers.

269
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind

270
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,

271
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
where it's raining.

272
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.

273
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of

274
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.

275
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.

276
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And the dragonflies you can see today

277
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
outside here, on the campus,

278
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
are the young of this generation.

279
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They hatched out in India.

280
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.

281
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,

282
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.

283
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
The wind will swoosh them out across here.

284
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,

285
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
nothing there, they'll carry on.

286
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Here, here, Kenya, East Africa,

287
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
they've actually just come out of a long drought.

288
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke

289
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and it's raining there now.

290
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.

291
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.

292
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time

294
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.

295
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is

296
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the wind is always converging to where the rain is.

297
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The rain occurs, these are summer rains.

298
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
This is a summer monsoon.

299
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.

300
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The sun is overhead, maximum heating,

301
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
maximum evaporation, maximum clouds,

302
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
maximum rainfall,

303
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
maximum opportunities for reproduction.

304
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Not only that, because you have this convection,

305
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
you have this rising of the air

306
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
where it's hot, air is drawn in.

307
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
There's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,

308
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.

309
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So, the little fellow that hatches out here,

310
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried

311
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
to where the rain is falling.

312
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up,

313
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
automatically carried to where the rain is falling.

314
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.

315
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So, in four generations, one, two, three,

316
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
four and then back.

317
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.

318
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.

319
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,

320
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.

321
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Those of you from North America

322
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.

323
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Which, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.

324
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's only half the length of this one.

325
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And this crossing here, of the ocean,

326
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing

327
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
of any insect.

328
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
A quite incredible feat.

329
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé,

330
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
in Maldives for long enough

331
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
for it to percolate into my brain

332
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that something rather special was going on.

333
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.

334
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
There is more to the story.

335
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar

336
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
with this fellow. This is a rather special bird.

337
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.

338
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But it's also called the Amur Falcon.

339
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And it's called the Amur Falcon

340
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because it breeds in Amurland.

341
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.

342
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
It's the border, much of it is the border

343
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
between China and Russia, up here in the far east.

344
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So, Siberia, Manchuria.

345
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And that's where it breeds.

346
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.

347
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.

348
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's, well, you can imagine.

349
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So, as any sensible bird would do,

350
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.

351
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
But then the being sensible stopped.

352
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So, now they don't stop here, or even down here.

353
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
No, they turn across here.

354
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.

355
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.

356
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.

357
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].

358
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration

359
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.

360
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And they are not the only one that makes the crossing.

361
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India

362
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.

363
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.

364
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this.

365
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It comes with the monsoons.

366
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
This time of year they cross back to Africa.

367
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.

368
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,

369
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
so it's known as the Kashmir Roller.

370
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,

371
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
all the available records of these birds,

372
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time

373
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
as the dragonflies.

374
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
They make use of exactly the same winds.

375
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds

376
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.

377
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,

378
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
one of these met an unfortunate end.

379
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
He was flying off the coast of Goa,

380
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.

381
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,

382
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
bang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet

383
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
got back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.

384
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters.

385
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Same height as the dragonflies go.

386
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So, they are using the same winds.

387
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And the other thing, the other important factor

388
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
for all these birds, all medium sized fellows,

389
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater.

390
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Bee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek.

391
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.

392
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And every one of these birds that makes the crossing

393
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
from India to East Africa

394
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
eats insects, large insects,

395
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.

396
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
(Applause)

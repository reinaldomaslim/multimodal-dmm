1
0:00:11.599,000 --> 0:00:19,000
it's um a great honor to be here with

2
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you the good news is I'm very aware of

3
0:00:19.95,000 --> 0:00:23,000
my responsibilities to get you out of

4
0:00:21.75,000 --> 0:00:28,000
here because I'm the only thing standing

5
0:00:24.09,000 --> 0:00:31,000
between you and the bar and the good

6
0:00:29.489,000 --> 0:00:34,000
news is I don't have a prepared speech

7
0:00:31.189,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they have a box of slides of pictures

8
0:00:35.3,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that represent my life and what I do for

9
0:00:39.18,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a living

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I've learned through experience that

11
0:00:44.28,000 --> 0:00:48,000
people remember pictures long after

12
0:00:46.32,000 --> 0:00:5,000
they've forgotten words and so I hope

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you'll remember some of the pictures I'm

14
0:00:50.94,000 --> 0:00:57,000
going to share with you for just a few

15
0:00:54.9,000 --> 0:01:,000
minutes the whole story really starts

16
0:00:58.589,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with me it's a high school kid

17
0:01:01.1,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in a tough

18
0:01:03.239,000 --> 0:01:05,000
neighborhood that everybody gave up one

19
0:01:05.129,000 --> 0:01:08,000
for dead

20
0:01:06.14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you know Wednesday afternoon I was

21
0:01:08.61,000 --> 0:01:19,000
walking down there was this hardest

22
0:01:16.71,000 --> 0:01:21,000
teacher they made a great big old

23
0:01:19.619,000 --> 0:01:23,000
ceramic vessel and I happened to be

24
0:01:21.869,000 --> 0:01:26,000
looking in the door in the art room if

25
0:01:23.759,000 --> 0:01:28,000
you've ever seen clay done its magic and

26
0:01:27.09,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I'd never seen anything like that before

27
0:01:28.83,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in my life so I walked through the art

28
0:01:32.31,000 --> 0:01:36,000
room and I said what is that he said

29
0:01:34.35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
ceramics and who are you and I said I'm

30
0:01:37.17,000 --> 0:01:42,000
bill speckle and I want you to teach me

31
0:01:38.91,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that and I said we'll get your homeroom

32
0:01:42.539,000 --> 0:01:45,000
teacher to sign a piece of paper that

33
0:01:44.009,000 --> 0:01:48,000
says you come me or not teacher to you

34
0:01:45.75,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and so for the remaining two years of my

35
0:01:48.45,000 --> 0:01:54,000
high school Kodama classes but I had the

36
0:01:52.709,000 --> 0:01:56,000
presence of mind to give the teachers

37
0:01:54.69,000 --> 0:01:58,000
classes that I cut the pottery that I

38
0:01:56.91,000 --> 0:02:,000
made

39
0:01:59.18,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they gave me passing grades and

40
0:02:01.22,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that's how I got out of high school

41
0:02:05.43,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and mr. Ross said you're too smart to

42
0:02:07.65,000 --> 0:02:12,000
die and I don't want it on my conscience

43
0:02:11.25,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I'm leaving this school and I'm taking

44
0:02:13.05,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you with me and he drove me out to the

45
0:02:15.48,000 --> 0:02:18,000
University of Pittsburgh will I filled

46
0:02:17.04,000 --> 0:02:22,000
out a college application and on

47
0:02:19.02,000 --> 0:02:25,000
probation well I'm now a trustee of the

48
0:02:22.92,000 --> 0:02:29,000
University began at my installation

49
0:02:25.29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
ceremony I said I'm the guy who came

50
0:02:30.51,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from the neighborhood who got into the

51
0:02:33.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
place on probation don't give up on the

52
0:02:35.1,000 --> 0:02:4,000
poor kids because you never know what's

53
0:02:38.04,000 --> 0:02:43,000
going to happen to those children in

54
0:02:40.53,000 --> 0:02:46,000
life what I'm going to show you for a

55
0:02:43.53,000 --> 0:02:48,000
couple minutes is a facility as I built

56
0:02:46.82,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the toughest neighborhoods in Pittsburgh

57
0:02:48.81,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I was the highest crime rate one is

58
0:02:53.49,000 --> 0:02:57,000
called bedwell training center it is a

59
0:02:55.38,000 --> 0:02:59,000
vocational school 4x steel workers and

60
0:02:57.95,000 --> 0:03:,000
single parents and welfare mothers

61
0:03:00.209,000 --> 0:03:03,000
remember we used to make steel in

62
0:03:01.53,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Pittsburgh well we don't make any steel

63
0:03:04.05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
anymore and the people used to make the

64
0:03:06.45,000 --> 0:03:12,000
steel we're having a very tough time

65
0:03:09.89,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I rebuild that would give a new life in

66
0:03:13.43,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Manchester craftsmen's guild is named

67
0:03:15.29,000 --> 0:03:2,000
after my neighborhood

68
0:03:18.11,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I was adopted by the Bishop of the

69
0:03:20.39,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Episcopal Diocese during the riots and

70
0:03:22.55,000 --> 0:03:26,000
he donated the row house in that row

71
0:03:25.1,000 --> 0:03:27,000
house I started Manchester craftsmen's

72
0:03:26.66,000 --> 0:03:31,000
guild

73
0:03:27.44,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I learned very quickly that wherever

74
0:03:32.03,000 --> 0:03:42,000
there are mr. fellows there's money in

75
0:03:34.13,000 --> 0:03:45,000
very close proximity and the bishop

76
0:03:42.13,000 --> 0:03:49,000
adopted me as his kid and last year I

77
0:03:46.04,000 --> 0:03:53,000
spoke at his memorial service and wished

78
0:03:49.76,000 --> 0:03:55,000
him well in this life

79
0:03:53.11,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I went out and hired a student of Frank

80
0:03:56.17,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Lloyd Wright the architect I asked him

81
0:03:59.35,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to build me the wrong class center and

82
0:04:02.29,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh and

83
0:04:05.14,000 --> 0:04:08,000
my building was a scale model for the

84
0:04:07.18,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Pittsburgh Airport and when you come to

85
0:04:08.68,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Pittsburgh and you're all invited you'll

86
0:04:11.5,000 --> 0:04:13,000
be flying into the blown-up version of

87
0:04:13.45,000 --> 0:04:17,000
my building

88
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that's the building built in a tough

89
0:04:18.19,000 --> 0:04:23,000
neighborhood where people have been

90
0:04:19.84,000 --> 0:04:24,000
given up for dead and my view is that if

91
0:04:23.74,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you want to involve yourself in the life

92
0:04:25.75,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of people who have been given up going

93
0:04:28.38,000 --> 0:04:33,000
you have to look like the solution and

94
0:04:30.88,000 --> 0:04:35,000
not the problem as you can see it has a

95
0:04:34.09,000 --> 0:04:38,000
fountain in the courtyard and the reason

96
0:04:36.669,000 --> 0:04:4,000
has a fountain in the courtyard is I

97
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
wanted one and I have the checkbook so I

98
0:04:40.99,000 --> 0:04:46,000
went there and now if I'm giving

99
0:04:44.169,000 --> 0:04:5,000
speeches at conferences like tour I got

100
0:04:47.95,000 --> 0:04:52,000
put on the board of the Carnegie Museum

101
0:04:50.46,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and at a reception in their courtyard I

102
0:04:53.35,000 --> 0:04:57,000
noticed that they had fire because they

103
0:04:56.5,000 --> 0:04:59,000
think that the people who go to the

104
0:04:58.27,000 --> 0:05:02,000
museum deserve a fountain

105
0:04:59.94,000 --> 0:05:04,000
no I think that welfare mothers and

106
0:05:03.25,000 --> 0:05:07,000
at-risk kids next steel workers deserve

107
0:05:05.35,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a fountain in their life and so the

108
0:05:07.72,000 --> 0:05:11,000
first thing that you see in my Center in

109
0:05:09.55,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the springtime is water that greets you

110
0:05:11.79,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Lord has life a water of human

111
0:05:15.58,000 --> 0:05:19,000
possibility and it sets an attitude and

112
0:05:18.37,000 --> 0:05:22,000
expectations about how you feel about

113
0:05:20.05,000 --> 0:05:26,000
people before you ever give them a

114
0:05:22.57,000 --> 0:05:29,000
speech so from that fountain

115
0:05:26.919,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I built this building

116
0:05:30.46,000 --> 0:05:36,000
as you can see it has world-class art

117
0:05:33.509,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and solve my taste because I raised all

118
0:05:37.389,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the money I said to my board when you

119
0:05:40.96,000 --> 0:05:43,000
raise the money we'll put your based on

120
0:05:42.58,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the law

121
0:05:44.81,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we have quotes and play and calligraphy

122
0:05:47.06,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and everywhere your eye turns there's

123
0:05:49.4,000 --> 0:05:54,000
something beautiful looking back at you

124
0:05:51.23,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that's deliberate that's intentional in

125
0:05:55.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
my view it is this kind of world that

126
0:05:59.95,000 --> 0:06:09,000
can redeem the soul of core people we

127
0:06:04.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
also created a boardroom and I heard a

128
0:06:10.61,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Japanese cabinet maker from Kyoto Japan

129
0:06:12.62,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of

130
0:06:15.86,000 --> 0:06:19,000
furniture for our building we have since

131
0:06:18.65,000 --> 0:06:22,000
spun him off into his own business he's

132
0:06:20.48,000 --> 0:06:24,000
making a ton of money who had custom

133
0:06:22.88,000 --> 0:06:26,000
furniture for rich people and I got 60

134
0:06:24.77,000 --> 0:06:28,000
pieces out of it for my school because I

135
0:06:27.68,000 --> 0:06:32,000
felt that welfare moms and ex

136
0:06:29.63,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Steelworkers and single parents deserve

137
0:06:33.02,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to come to a school where there was

138
0:06:34.58,000 --> 0:06:39,000
handcrafted furniture that greeted them

139
0:06:36.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
every day because it sets a tone and an

140
0:06:39.65,000 --> 0:06:44,000
attitude about how you feel about people

141
0:06:41.95,000 --> 0:06:46,000
long before you give them the speech

142
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
when you even have flowers in the

143
0:06:47.63,000 --> 0:06:52,000
hallway and they're not plastic goes

144
0:06:50.36,000 --> 0:06:54,000
real and they're in my building every

145
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
one and now that I've given lots of

146
0:06:55.34,000 --> 0:06:59,000
speeches we had a bunch of high school

147
0:06:57.02,000 --> 0:07:01,000
principals come and see me and they said

148
0:06:59.69,000 --> 0:07:03,000
mr. Strickland what an extraordinary

149
0:07:01.19,000 --> 0:07:05,000
story and what a great school and we

150
0:07:04.22,000 --> 0:07:07,000
were particularly touched by the flowers

151
0:07:06.08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and we were curious as to how the

152
0:07:07.37,000 --> 0:07:12,000
flowers got there I said well I got him

153
0:07:10.34,000 --> 0:07:13,000
a car and I went out to the greenhouse

154
0:07:12.5,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and I bargained I brought them back and

155
0:07:14.21,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I put them there you don't need a task

156
0:07:16.55,000 --> 0:07:21,000
force for a study group to buy flowers

157
0:07:19.22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
for your kids what you need to know is

158
0:07:22.37,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that the children those deserve flowers

159
0:07:24.92,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in their life the cost descents adapter

160
0:07:27.92,000 --> 0:07:32,000
buzz the gesture is huge and so in my

161
0:07:30.95,000 --> 0:07:35,000
building which is full of sunlight and

162
0:07:33.5,000 --> 0:07:38,000
full of flowers we believe in hope and

163
0:07:36.74,000 --> 0:07:41,000
human possibility that happens to be at

164
0:07:38.75,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Christmastime and so the next thing

165
0:07:42.08,000 --> 0:07:47,000
you'll see is a million dollar kitchen

166
0:07:45.46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that was built by the Heinz Company

167
0:07:47.99,000 --> 0:07:51,000
you've heard of them they did all right

168
0:07:50.24,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the Ketchum business and I happen to

169
0:07:52.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
know that company pretty well because

170
0:07:54.23,000 --> 0:07:59,000
John Heise was our u.s. senator who was

171
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:08:02,000
tragically killed in a plane accident

172
0:08:00.07,000 --> 0:08:04,000
had heard about my desire to build a new

173
0:08:02.84,000 --> 0:08:05,000
building because I had the cardboard box

174
0:08:05.03,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and of putting the garbage bag and I was

175
0:08:06.44,000 --> 0:08:1,000
walking over Pittsburgh trying to raise

176
0:08:07.85,000 --> 0:08:11,000
money for this thing and he called me

177
0:08:10.46,000 --> 0:08:14,000
into his office which is the equivalent

178
0:08:12.32,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of going to see the Wizard of Oz John

179
0:08:15.44,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Heinz had six hundred million dollars

180
0:08:16.82,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and at the time I had about 60 cent he

181
0:08:19.97,000 --> 0:08:22,000
said but we've heard about you and heard

182
0:08:22.07,000 --> 0:08:26,000
about your work with the kids and the X

183
0:08:23.87,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Steel Workers and we're inclined to want

184
0:08:26.9,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to support your desire to build a new

185
0:08:28.88,000 --> 0:08:32,000
building and you could do us a great

186
0:08:31.43,000 --> 0:08:36,000
service if you would add a culinary

187
0:08:33.349,000 --> 0:08:39,000
program to your program because back

188
0:08:36.86,000 --> 0:08:4,000
then we were building trades program and

189
0:08:39.44,000 --> 0:08:42,000
said that way we could fulfill our

190
0:08:41.18,000 --> 0:08:45,000
affirmative action goals for the Heinz

191
0:08:43.01,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Company and said senator I'm reluctant

192
0:08:45.68,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to go into a fields I don't know much

193
0:08:49.31,000 --> 0:08:53,000
about but I promise you that if you'll

194
0:08:52.04,000 --> 0:08:55,000
support my school I'll get it built in a

195
0:08:54.2,000 --> 0:08:59,000
couple years I'll come back and we'll

196
0:08:55.76,000 --> 0:09:01,000
add that program that you desire in

197
0:08:59.839,000 --> 0:09:04,000
central Hinds sat very quietly he said

198
0:09:02.75,000 --> 0:09:07,000
well what would your answer be if I said

199
0:09:05.63,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'll give you a million dollars

200
0:09:08.3,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I said senator it appears that we're

201
0:09:10.22,000 --> 0:09:13,000
going into the food training business

202
0:09:18.49,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and John Heinz did give me a million

203
0:09:21.86,000 --> 0:09:25,000
bucks and most importantly he loaned me

204
0:09:24.8,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the head of research for the Heinz

205
0:09:26.24,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Company and we should kind of bard the

206
0:09:28.1,000 --> 0:09:32,000
curriculum from the Culinary Institute

207
0:09:30.32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of America which in their mind is kind

208
0:09:32.69,000 --> 0:09:36,000
of the Harvard to cooking skills and we

209
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:39,000
created that gourmet cooks the program

210
0:09:37.13,000 --> 0:09:42,000
for welfare Rhodes in this million

211
0:09:39.44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
dollar kitchen in the military City I

212
0:09:42.14,000 --> 0:09:48,000
would never look back I would like to

213
0:09:45.68,000 --> 0:09:5,000
show you now some of the foods that

214
0:09:48.14,000 --> 0:09:52,000
there's welfare mothers do

215
0:09:50.74,000 --> 0:09:54,000
in this million dollar kitchen that

216
0:09:52.69,000 --> 0:09:58,000
happens to be our cafeteria line that's

217
0:09:55.54,000 --> 0:10:,000
puff pastry day why because the students

218
0:09:59.02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
made puffed pastry and that's what the

219
0:10:00.58,000 --> 0:10:06,000
school way every day but the concept was

220
0:10:04.06,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that I wanted to take the stigma out of

221
0:10:06.94,000 --> 0:10:11,000
food that good foods not for rich people

222
0:10:10.54,000 --> 0:10:14,000
good food for everybody on the planet

223
0:10:12.49,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and there's no excuse while we all can't

224
0:10:14.83,000 --> 0:10:19,000
be eating it so at my school we

225
0:10:17.52,000 --> 0:10:21,000
subsidize a gourmet and lunch program

226
0:10:20.02,000 --> 0:10:24,000
for welfare mothers in the mill the

227
0:10:22.51,000 --> 0:10:26,000
inner city because we've discovered that

228
0:10:24.25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
it's good for their stomachs but it's

229
0:10:26.529,000 --> 0:10:31,000
better for their heads because I wanted

230
0:10:29.5,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to let them know every day in their life

231
0:10:31.72,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that they have

232
0:10:33.939,000 --> 0:10:4,000
at this place I call my center we have

233
0:10:38.389,000 --> 0:10:44,000
students who sit together black kids and

234
0:10:41.839,000 --> 0:10:47,000
white kids the government discovered is

235
0:10:44.41,000 --> 0:10:49,000
you can solve the race problem by

236
0:10:48.379,000 --> 0:10:51,000
creating a world class environment

237
0:10:50.059,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because people will have a tendency to

238
0:10:52.359,000 --> 0:10:57,000
show you what class behavior if you

239
0:10:55.879,000 --> 0:10:59,000
treat them in that way

240
0:10:58.269,000 --> 0:11:02,000
this is examples of the food that

241
0:11:00.769,000 --> 0:11:05,000
welfare mothers are doing after six

242
0:11:02.959,000 --> 0:11:09,000
months in the training program no

243
0:11:06.559,000 --> 0:11:13,000
sophistication no class no dignity no

244
0:11:10.839,000 --> 0:11:16,000
history what we've discovered is the

245
0:11:14.089,000 --> 0:11:18,000
only thing wrong with poor people is

246
0:11:16.939,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they don't have any money

247
0:11:18.23,000 --> 0:11:23,000
what happens to be a curable condition

248
0:11:20.919,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it's all in the way that you think about

249
0:11:23.569,000 --> 0:11:27,000
people that often determines their

250
0:11:25.579,000 --> 0:11:31,000
behavior that was done by a student

251
0:11:28.489,000 --> 0:11:33,000
after seven months in the program done

252
0:11:31.699,000 --> 0:11:35,000
by our very brilliant young woman who

253
0:11:33.98,000 --> 0:11:37,000
was taught by our pastry chef I've

254
0:11:36.379,000 --> 0:11:42,000
actually eaten seven of those baskets

255
0:11:38.419,000 --> 0:11:42,000
they're very good they have no calories

256
0:11:42.76,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that's our dining room it looks like

257
0:11:46.22,000 --> 0:11:52,000
your average high school cafeteria in

258
0:11:49.25,000 --> 0:11:54,000
our average town in America but this is

259
0:11:52.31,000 --> 0:11:57,000
my view of how students ought to be

260
0:11:55.19,000 --> 0:11:59,000
treated particularly ones who have been

261
0:11:57.74,000 --> 0:12:01,000
pushed aside

262
0:11:59.29,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we trained pharmaceutical technicians

263
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:06,000
for the pharmacy industry we trained

264
0:12:05.18,000 --> 0:12:09,000
medical technicians for the medical

265
0:12:06.89,000 --> 0:12:11,000
industry and we trained chemical

266
0:12:10.1,000 --> 0:12:14,000
technicians for companies like bear and

267
0:12:12.2,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and

268
0:12:15.05,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Exxon and I will guarantee if you come

269
0:12:19.79,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to my Center in Pittsburgh and you're

270
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
all invited you'll see welfare mothers

271
0:12:24.38,000 --> 0:12:28,000
doing analytical chemistry with

272
0:12:26.03,000 --> 0:12:31,000
logarithmic calculators ten months from

273
0:12:29.09,000 --> 0:12:34,000
enrollment in the program there was

274
0:12:31.76,000 --> 0:12:36,000
absolutely no reason

275
0:12:34.77,000 --> 0:12:39,000
why poor people can't learn world-class

276
0:12:36.99,000 --> 0:12:41,000
technology what we've discovered is you

277
0:12:40.56,000 --> 0:12:46,000
have to give them flowers and sunlight

278
0:12:42.42,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of food and expectations and herb is

279
0:12:47.04,000 --> 0:12:54,000
music and you can cure a spiritual

280
0:12:50.22,000 --> 0:12:58,000
cancer every time we train corporate

281
0:12:54.72,000 --> 0:13:,000
travel agents for the travel industry we

282
0:12:58.23,000 --> 0:13:03,000
even teach people how to read the kid

283
0:13:00.87,000 --> 0:13:05,000
with a red stripe was in the program two

284
0:13:04.17,000 --> 0:13:08,000
years ago is now an instructor and I

285
0:13:06.57,000 --> 0:13:12,000
have children with high school diplomas

286
0:13:09.02,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that they can't read and so you must ask

287
0:13:12.99,000 --> 0:13:2,000
yourself the question how is it possible

288
0:13:15.68,000 --> 0:13:22,000
in the 21st century that we graduate

289
0:13:21.27,000 --> 0:13:24,000
children from schools who can't read the

290
0:13:23.13,000 --> 0:13:27,000
diplomas that they have in their hands

291
0:13:25.07,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and the reason is that the system gets

292
0:13:27.66,000 --> 0:13:32,000
reimbursed for the kids who they spit

293
0:13:29.79,000 --> 0:13:36,000
out the other end not the children who

294
0:13:32.67,000 --> 0:13:4,000
breathe I can take these children and in

295
0:13:37.35,000 --> 0:13:42,000
20 weeks demonstrated aptitude I can get

296
0:13:41.04,000 --> 0:13:46,000
them high school equivalent

297
0:13:42.68,000 --> 0:13:45,000
no big deal

298
0:13:46.819,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that our library was more handcrafted

299
0:13:49.459,000 --> 0:13:55,000
furniture and this is the arts program I

300
0:13:53.269,000 --> 0:13:58,000
started in 1968 remember I'm the black

301
0:13:56.179,000 --> 0:14:01,000
kid from the 60s you guys lifesaver

302
0:13:58.669,000 --> 0:14:02,000
ceramics while went out and decided to

303
0:14:01.309,000 --> 0:14:06,000
reproduce my experience with other kids

304
0:14:03.41,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in the neighborhood the theory being if

305
0:14:06.41,000 --> 0:14:09,000
you get kids flowers you give them food

306
0:14:08.449,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and you give them sunshine and

307
0:14:09.919,000 --> 0:14:14,000
enthusiasm you can bring a rag back to

308
0:14:12.559,000 --> 0:14:17,000
life I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh

309
0:14:15.169,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Public School System that come to me

310
0:14:17.6,000 --> 0:14:22,000
every day of the week for arts education

311
0:14:21.169,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and these are children who are flunking

312
0:14:23.059,000 --> 0:14:27,000
out of public school and last year I put

313
0:14:25.789,000 --> 0:14:29,000
88% of those kids in college not my

314
0:14:27.709,000 --> 0:14:32,000
average over 80 percent for 15 years

315
0:14:30.559,000 --> 0:14:36,000
we've made a fascinating discovery

316
0:14:33.699,000 --> 0:14:39,000
there's nothing wrong with the kids that

317
0:14:36.609,000 --> 0:14:44,000
affection and sunshine and food and

318
0:14:40.249,000 --> 0:14:47,000
enthusiasm Herbies music can't care for

319
0:14:44.929,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that I want a big old black man of the

320
0:14:47.389,000 --> 0:14:51,000
year and education of beat out all the

321
0:14:48.889,000 --> 0:14:52,000
phd's because I figured that if you

322
0:14:52.069,000 --> 0:14:55,000
treat children like human beings and

323
0:14:53.809,000 --> 0:14:57,000
increases the likelihood they're gonna

324
0:14:55.159,000 --> 0:15:01,000
behave that way and why we can't

325
0:14:58.129,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Institute that policy in every school

326
0:15:01.939,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and every city in every town

327
0:15:08.44,000 --> 0:15:13,000
let me show you what these people do we

328
0:15:11.27,000 --> 0:15:16,000
have ceramics and photography and

329
0:15:13.73,000 --> 0:15:19,000
computer imaging and these are all kids

330
0:15:16.28,000 --> 0:15:21,000
with no artistic ability no talent no

331
0:15:20.42,000 --> 0:15:23,000
imagination

332
0:15:21.55,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and we bring in the world's greatest

333
0:15:24.05,000 --> 0:15:28,000
artists Gordon Parks has been there

334
0:15:26.15,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Chester Higgins has been there and what

335
0:15:28.49,000 --> 0:15:33,000
we've learned is that the children will

336
0:15:31.25,000 --> 0:15:36,000
become like the people who teach them in

337
0:15:33.62,000 --> 0:15:38,000
fact I brought in a mosaic artist from

338
0:15:36.71,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the Vatican an african-american woman

339
0:15:39.2,000 --> 0:15:43,000
who had studied the old Vatican mosaic

340
0:15:41.45,000 --> 0:15:47,000
techniques and let me show you what they

341
0:15:44.09,000 --> 0:15:51,000
did over the world these were children

342
0:15:48.04,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the whole world had given up flocking

343
0:15:51.32,000 --> 0:15:55,000
out of public school and that's what

344
0:15:53.51,000 --> 0:16:04,000
they're capable of doing it was

345
0:15:55.7,000 --> 0:16:06,000
affection and sunlight we teach

346
0:16:05.06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
photography

347
0:16:06.9,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and this is examples of some of the kids

348
0:16:09.21,000 --> 0:16:13,000
work that boy won a four-year

349
0:16:12.51,000 --> 0:16:15,000
scholarship and the strands of that

350
0:16:13.77,000 --> 0:16:15,000
photograph

351
0:16:17.179,000 --> 0:16:22,000
mr. gallery we have a world-class

352
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
gallery because we believe that poor

353
0:16:22.499,000 --> 0:16:26,000
kids need a world-class gallery so I

354
0:16:25.019,000 --> 0:16:29,000
designed this thing we have smoked

355
0:16:27.389,000 --> 0:16:31,000
salmon at the Argo place we have a form

356
0:16:29.85,000 --> 0:16:32,000
of printed invitation and I even have

357
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
figured out a way to get their parents

358
0:16:33.629,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to come I couldn't buy a parent 15 years

359
0:16:36.989,000 --> 0:16:41,000
ago so I hired a guy who got off on the

360
0:16:39.869,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Jesus big time he was dragging guys out

361
0:16:42.839,000 --> 0:16:47,000
of bars and saving those lives for the

362
0:16:44.85,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Lord and I said bill I want to hire you

363
0:16:48.149,000 --> 0:16:51,000
then you have to turn down the Jesus

364
0:16:50.939,000 --> 0:16:57,000
stuff a little bit to keep the

365
0:16:52.019,000 --> 0:17:,000
enthusiasm I can't get these parents to

366
0:16:58.829,000 --> 0:17:02,000
come to the school he said I'll get them

367
0:17:00.569,000 --> 0:17:04,000
to come to school so he jumped in the

368
0:17:02.91,000 --> 0:17:05,000
van and went to Miss Jones's house and

369
0:17:04.74,000 --> 0:17:07,000
said Miss Jones I knew you wanted to

370
0:17:06.24,000 --> 0:17:1,000
come to your kids aren't opening but you

371
0:17:08.459,000 --> 0:17:13,000
probably didn't have a ride so I came to

372
0:17:11.13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
give you a ride and he got ten parents

373
0:17:14.159,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and the 20 parents the last show that we

374
0:17:16.199,000 --> 0:17:22,000
did 200 parents showed up and we didn't

375
0:17:20.039,000 --> 0:17:26,000
pick up one parent because now it's

376
0:17:22.889,000 --> 0:17:26,000
become socially not acceptable not to

377
0:17:26.039,000 --> 0:17:29,000
show up to support your children that

378
0:17:27.659,000 --> 0:17:31,000
the Manchester craftsmen's guild because

379
0:17:29.279,000 --> 0:17:35,000
people think you're bad parent and there

380
0:17:31.86,000 --> 0:17:36,000
is no statistical difference between the

381
0:17:35.399,000 --> 0:17:4,000
white parents and the black parents

382
0:17:37.789,000 --> 0:17:45,000
mothers will go where their children are

383
0:17:41.279,000 --> 0:17:48,000
being celebrated every time every town

384
0:17:45.98,000 --> 0:17:53,000
every city

385
0:17:48.9,000 --> 0:17:55,000
I wanted you to see this gallery because

386
0:17:54.6,000 --> 0:17:58,000
it's as good as it gets and by the time

387
0:17:56.76,000 --> 0:18:01,000
I cut these kids loose from high school

388
0:17:59.15,000 --> 0:18:04,000
they've got four shows on their resume

389
0:18:02.61,000 --> 0:18:07,000
before they apply to college because

390
0:18:04.41,000 --> 0:18:09,000
it's all up here you have to change the

391
0:18:07.92,000 --> 0:18:12,000
way that people see themselves before

392
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
you can change their behavior and it's

393
0:18:13.62,000 --> 0:18:21,000
worked out pretty good up to this day

394
0:18:17.31,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I even stuck up another room on the

395
0:18:21.87,000 --> 0:18:26,000
building which I'd like to show you this

396
0:18:24.3,000 --> 0:18:3,000
is brand new we just got the slide done

397
0:18:27.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
in time for the TED Conference I gave

398
0:18:31.14,000 --> 0:18:36,000
this little slide show at a place called

399
0:18:32.64,000 --> 0:18:37,000
the Silicon Valley and I did all right

400
0:18:36.36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and the woman came out of the audience

401
0:18:37.89,000 --> 0:18:39,000
she said that was a great story and I

402
0:18:39.51,000 --> 0:18:42,000
was very impressed with your

403
0:18:40.62,000 --> 0:18:44,000
presentation my only criticism is your

404
0:18:43.23,000 --> 0:18:48,000
computers are getting a little bit old

405
0:18:44.93,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and I said well what do you do for a

406
0:18:48.39,000 --> 0:18:5,000
living

407
0:18:48.93,000 --> 0:18:51,000
she said well I work for a company

408
0:18:50.76,000 --> 0:18:54,000
called hewlett-packard

409
0:18:52.14,000 --> 0:18:56,000
I said you're in the computer business

410
0:18:54.78,000 --> 0:18:57,000
is that right she said yes sir I said

411
0:18:56.73,000 --> 0:19:,000
well there's an easy solution of that

412
0:18:58.11,000 --> 0:19:04,000
problem well I'm very pleased to

413
0:19:00.78,000 --> 0:19:06,000
announce to you that HP and a furniture

414
0:19:04.77,000 --> 0:19:08,000
company called Steelcase have adopted us

415
0:19:07.02,000 --> 0:19:11,000
as a demonstration model for all of

416
0:19:09.45,000 --> 0:19:12,000
their technology and all their furniture

417
0:19:11.1,000 --> 0:19:16,000
for the United States of America and

418
0:19:13.05,000 --> 0:19:18,000
that's the room that's initiated

419
0:19:16.29,000 --> 0:19:2,000
relationship we've got it just done in

420
0:19:18.3,000 --> 0:19:22,000
time to show you so it's kind of the

421
0:19:20.64,000 --> 0:19:24,000
world debut of our digital imaging

422
0:19:22.89,000 --> 0:19:24,000
center

423
0:19:30.82,000 --> 0:19:35,000
I only have a couple more slides and

424
0:19:35.08,000 --> 0:19:38,000
this is where the story gets kind of

425
0:19:36.519,000 --> 0:19:4,000
interesting so I just want you to listen

426
0:19:38.889,000 --> 0:19:44,000
up for a couple more minutes and you'll

427
0:19:40.799,000 --> 0:19:47,000
understand why he's there and I'm here

428
0:19:44.94,000 --> 0:19:49,000
in 1986 I had the presence of mind to

429
0:19:48.58,000 --> 0:19:51,000
stick a music-hall on the north end of

430
0:19:50.35,000 --> 0:19:55,000
the building while I was building it and

431
0:19:51.929,000 --> 0:19:58,000
a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to

432
0:19:56.08,000 --> 0:20:02,000
play there because he knew this man over

433
0:19:59.44,000 --> 0:20:04,000
here Marty Ashby and I stood on that

434
0:20:02.679,000 --> 0:20:06,000
stage with Dizzy Gillespie on soundcheck

435
0:20:05.169,000 --> 0:20:09,000
on a Wednesday afternoon and I said

436
0:20:07.48,000 --> 0:20:11,000
dizzy why would you come to a black run

437
0:20:09.789,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Center in the middle of an industrial

438
0:20:11.919,000 --> 0:20:13,000
park

439
0:20:12.58,000 --> 0:20:16,000
with a high crime rate that doesn't even

440
0:20:14.679,000 --> 0:20:17,000
have a reputation in music he said

441
0:20:16.659,000 --> 0:20:19,000
because I heard you built the center and

442
0:20:18.25,000 --> 0:20:21,000
I didn't believe that you did it and I

443
0:20:20.559,000 --> 0:20:25,000
don't want to see for myself and now

444
0:20:22.149,000 --> 0:20:28,000
that I have I want to give you a gift I

445
0:20:26.169,000 --> 0:20:31,000
said you're the gift he said no sir

446
0:20:28.74,000 --> 0:20:32,000
you're the gift and I'm gonna allow you

447
0:20:31.45,000 --> 0:20:35,000
to record the concert and we'll give you

448
0:20:33.25,000 --> 0:20:37,000
the music have you ever choose to sell

449
0:20:35.769,000 --> 0:20:38,000
it you must sign an agreement that says

450
0:20:37.45,000 --> 0:20:43,000
the money will come back in sports too

451
0:20:39.509,000 --> 0:20:46,000
and I recorded dizzy and he died a year

452
0:20:43.899,000 --> 0:20:48,000
later but not before telling a fella

453
0:20:46.6,000 --> 0:20:5,000

454
0:20:49.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000

466
0:21:25.279,000 --> 0:21:3,000
center in the middle of an industrial

467
0:21:27.74,000 --> 0:21:31,000
park to sold-out audiences middle of the

468
0:21:31.1,000 --> 0:21:35,000
inner city and I'm very pleased to tell

469
0:21:32.69,000 --> 0:21:38,000
you that with their permission I have

470
0:21:35.36,000 --> 0:21:4,000
now accumulated 600 recordings of the

471
0:21:39.26,000 --> 0:21:46,000
greatest artists in the world including

472
0:21:40.669,000 --> 0:21:49,000

and he put his hand on my shoulder he

476
0:21:59.08,000 --> 0:22:07,000
said down gods picked you man to do this

477
0:22:06.01,000 --> 0:22:11,000
work

478
0:22:07.429,000 --> 0:22:15,000
and I want my music to be with you and

479
0:22:11.83,000 --> 0:22:17,000
that worked out alright when the basic

480
0:22:15.95,000 --> 0:22:19,000
band came they the band got so excited

481
0:22:18.289,000 --> 0:22:23,000
about the school they voted to give me

482
0:22:20.809,000 --> 0:22:26,000
the rights to the music and I recorded

483
0:22:23.839,000 --> 0:22:29,000
it and we won something called a Grammy

484
0:22:27.249,000 --> 0:22:32,000
like a fool I didn't go to ceremony does

485
0:22:30.259,000 --> 0:22:34,000
that think we're gonna win well we did

486
0:22:32.96,000 --> 0:22:4,000
win that our name was literally in

487
0:22:34.639,000 --> 0:22:43,000
lights over Madison Square Garden you

488
0:22:41.749,000 --> 0:22:45,000
and jazz rock mr. drop live and we

489
0:22:44.539,000 --> 0:22:5,000
recorded them and got nominated for a

490
0:22:46.399,000 --> 0:22:52,000
second gravity back to back so we become

491
0:22:51.259,000 --> 0:22:56,000
one of the hot young jazz recording

492
0:22:53.33,000 --> 0:22:59,000
studios in the nine states of america in

493
0:22:57.08,000 --> 0:23:04,000
the middle the inner city was a high

494
0:22:59.869,000 --> 0:23:14,000
crime rate that's the place all filled

495
0:23:04.789,000 --> 0:23:15,000
up with Republicans if you drop the bomb

496
0:23:14.899,000 --> 0:23:17,000
in that room either white got all the

497
0:23:16.399,000 --> 0:23:2,000
money in Pennsylvania cuz it was all

498
0:23:17.899,000 --> 0:23:22,000
said there including my mother and

499
0:23:21.049,000 --> 0:23:25,000
father who live long enough

500
0:23:22.9,000 --> 0:23:27,000
and see their kid though that building

501
0:23:25.23,000 --> 0:23:31,000
and there's desi just like I told you he

502
0:23:28.57,000 --> 0:23:35,000
was there and he was there Tito Puente

503
0:23:31.71,000 --> 0:23:38,000
and a Bellini Jim Hall were there they

504
0:23:36.04,000 --> 0:23:41,000
recorded with us and that was our first

505
0:23:39.55,000 --> 0:23:43,000
recording studio which was the broom

506
0:23:41.89,000 --> 0:23:44,000
closet and we put the mops in the

507
0:23:44.08,000 --> 0:23:46,000
hallway and re-engineered the thing and

508
0:23:45.79,000 --> 0:23:49,000
that's where we recorded the first

509
0:23:46.93,000 --> 0:23:52,000
Grammy and this is our new facility

510
0:23:50.47,000 --> 0:23:55,000
which is all video technology and that

511
0:23:53.62,000 --> 0:23:59,000
is a room that was built for a woman

512
0:23:55.6,000 --> 0:24:03,000
named Nancy Wilson who recorded that

513
0:23:59.86,000 --> 0:24:04,000
album at our school last Christmas and

514
0:24:04.09,000 --> 0:24:08,000
any of you happen to be a March and

515
0:24:05.59,000 --> 0:24:1,000
Oprah Winfrey on Christmas Day he was

516
0:24:08.35,000 --> 0:24:13,000
there and Nancy was there singing

517
0:24:11.11,000 --> 0:24:16,000
excerpts from this album the rights to

518
0:24:14.02,000 --> 0:24:18,000
which she donated to our school and I

519
0:24:16.72,000 --> 0:24:2,000
can now tell you with absolute certainty

520
0:24:18.78,000 --> 0:24:26,000
that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will

521
0:24:21.49,000 --> 0:24:28,000
sell 10,000 CDs we are currently number

522
0:24:27.37,000 --> 0:24:31,000
four on the Billboard charts right

523
0:24:28.9,000 --> 0:24:33,000
behind Tony Bennett and I think we're

524
0:24:31.6,000 --> 0:24:36,000
gonna be fine this was burned out during

525
0:24:34.57,000 --> 0:24:38,000
the riots this is next to my building

526
0:24:36.6,000 --> 0:24:4,000
and so I had another cardboard box

527
0:24:39.309,000 --> 0:24:43,000
filled and I walked back out the streets

528
0:24:41.02,000 --> 0:24:46,000
again and that's the building and that's

529
0:24:44.05,000 --> 0:24:47,000
the model you know on the rights of

530
0:24:46.03,000 --> 0:24:49,000
hi-tech greenhouse and in the Middle's

531
0:24:47.71,000 --> 0:24:51,000
of medical technology building and I'm

532
0:24:49.78,000 --> 0:24:53,000
very pleased to tell you that the

533
0:24:51.94,000 --> 0:24:56,000
building is done it's also full of

534
0:24:54.309,000 --> 0:25:,000
anchor tenants at $20 a foot triple net

535
0:24:57.7,000 --> 0:25:02,000
and though the inner city and there's

536
0:25:01.03,000 --> 0:25:06,000
the phone

537
0:25:02.93,000 --> 0:25:06,000
every building has a fountain and the

538
0:25:06.15,000 --> 0:25:09,000
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

539
0:25:07.8,000 --> 0:25:11,000
or anchor taste they took after building

540
0:25:09.63,000 --> 0:25:13,000
and we now train medical technicians for

541
0:25:12,000 --> 0:25:16,000
all their system and Mellon banks a

542
0:25:14.61,000 --> 0:25:19,000
tenant and I love them because they pay

543
0:25:16.95,000 --> 0:25:2,000
the rent on time and as the result of

544
0:25:19.92,000 --> 0:25:23,000
the association I'm now a director of

545
0:25:21.84,000 --> 0:25:27,000
the Mellon Financial Corporation that

546
0:25:24.53,000 --> 0:25:27,000
bought trayvis

547
0:25:28.74,000 --> 0:25:32,000
and this is in the process of being

548
0:25:32.2,000 --> 0:25:36,000
built as we speak

549
0:25:33.52,000 --> 0:25:38,000
multiplying that picture times four and

550
0:25:36.34,000 --> 0:25:39,000
you will see the green house that's

551
0:25:38.68,000 --> 0:25:42,000
going to open in October this year

552
0:25:40.12,000 --> 0:25:45,000
because we're going to grow those

553
0:25:43.15,000 --> 0:25:49,000
flowers in the middle of the inner city

554
0:25:45.52,000 --> 0:25:51,000
and we're going to have high school kids

555
0:25:49.29,000 --> 0:25:54,000
growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the

556
0:25:51.79,000 --> 0:25:55,000
middle the inner city and we have a

557
0:25:54.58,000 --> 0:25:59,000
handshake with one of the large retail

558
0:25:56.71,000 --> 0:26:03,000
grocers to sell our orchids in all 240

559
0:26:00.37,000 --> 0:26:05,000
stores and six states and our partners

560
0:26:04.12,000 --> 0:26:07,000
at Zuma Canyon orchids of Malibu

561
0:26:05.8,000 --> 0:26:09,000
California who are Hispanic

562
0:26:07.809,000 --> 0:26:11,000
so the Hispanics and the black folks

563
0:26:10.21,000 --> 0:26:14,000
have formed a partnership to grow

564
0:26:12.55,000 --> 0:26:17,000
high-technology orchids in the middlee

565
0:26:14.559,000 --> 0:26:18,000
in a city and I told my United States in

566
0:26:18.04,000 --> 0:26:22,000
there that there was a very high

567
0:26:19.39,000 --> 0:26:23,000
probability and if he could find some

568
0:26:22.059,000 --> 0:26:25,000
funding for this we would become a

569
0:26:24.16,000 --> 0:26:28,000
left-hand column in the Wall Street

570
0:26:25.48,000 --> 0:26:29,000
Journal to which he readily agreed and

571
0:26:28.33,000 --> 0:26:31,000
we got the funding we opened in the fall

572
0:26:30.07,000 --> 0:26:33,000
and you gotta come see it has been

573
0:26:32.23,000 --> 0:26:37,000
announced

574
0:26:34.01,000 --> 0:26:41,000
and this is what I want to do when I

575
0:26:37.549,000 --> 0:26:43,000
grow up the brown building is the one

576
0:26:41.87,000 --> 0:26:45,000
you guys have been looking at and I'll

577
0:26:44.24,000 --> 0:26:49,000
tell you where I've made my big mistake

578
0:26:45.95,000 --> 0:26:5,000
I had a chance to buy this whole

579
0:26:49.46,000 --> 0:26:53,000
industrial park which is less than a

580
0:26:51.169,000 --> 0:26:55,000
thousand feet from the riverfront for

581
0:26:53.66,000 --> 0:26:58,000
four million dollars and I didn't do it

582
0:26:56.02,000 --> 0:26:59,000
and I built the first building and guess

583
0:26:59,000 --> 0:27:02,000
what happened

584
0:26:59.87,000 --> 0:27:04,000
I appreciated the real estate values

585
0:27:02.57,000 --> 0:27:07,000
beyond everybody's expectations and the

586
0:27:05.72,000 --> 0:27:09,000
owners of the park turned me down for

587
0:27:07.79,000 --> 0:27:12,000
eight million dollars last year instead

588
0:27:10.429,000 --> 0:27:14,000
mr. Strickland you ought to get the

589
0:27:13.16,000 --> 0:27:16,000
civic leader of the Year award because

590
0:27:14.929,000 --> 0:27:18,000
you've appreciated our property values

591
0:27:16.76,000 --> 0:27:22,000
beyond our wildest expectations thank

592
0:27:19.52,000 --> 0:27:24,000
you very much for that the moral of the

593
0:27:22.97,000 --> 0:27:27,000
story is you must be prepared to act on

594
0:27:25.34,000 --> 0:27:34,000
your dreams just in case they do come

595
0:27:28.49,000 --> 0:27:37,000
true and finally there's this picture

596
0:27:35.03,000 --> 0:27:41,000
this is in a place called San Francisco

597
0:27:38.22,000 --> 0:27:43,000
and the reason this pictures in here is

598
0:27:41.13,000 --> 0:27:46,000
I did this slide show a couple years ago

599
0:27:43.98,000 --> 0:27:46,000
at a big economic summit and there was a

600
0:27:46.26,000 --> 0:27:49,000
fella in the audience who came up to me

601
0:27:47.91,000 --> 0:27:52,000
he said man that's a great story I want

602
0:27:50.22,000 --> 0:27:54,000
one of those I said well I'm very

603
0:27:53.07,000 --> 0:27:56,000
flattered what do you do for a living he

604
0:27:54.6,000 --> 0:27:59,000
says I run the city of San Francisco my

605
0:27:56.88,000 --> 0:27:58,000
name is Willie Brown

606
0:28:00.57,000 --> 0:28:05,000
and so I kind of accepted the flattery

607
0:28:03.389,000 --> 0:28:08,000
and the praise and put it out of my mind

608
0:28:06.209,000 --> 0:28:11,000
and that weekend I was going back home

609
0:28:08.779,000 --> 0:28:14,000
and Herbie Hancock was playing our

610
0:28:11.549,000 --> 0:28:18,000
center that I first of all I met him and

611
0:28:15.089,000 --> 0:28:21,000
he walked in and he says what is this

612
0:28:18.859,000 --> 0:28:24,000
and I said Herbie this is my concept of

613
0:28:21.899,000 --> 0:28:27,000
a training center for poor people and he

614
0:28:24.959,000 --> 0:28:29,000
said as God is my witness I've had a

615
0:28:28.259,000 --> 0:28:32,000
Senate like this in my mind for 25 years

616
0:28:30.779,000 --> 0:28:33,000
and you built it now I really won't

617
0:28:32.339,000 --> 0:28:37,000
build one I said well where would you

618
0:28:34.589,000 --> 0:28:42,000
build this thing he said San Francisco

619
0:28:37.549,000 --> 0:28:44,000
has a chance you know Willie Brown as a

620
0:28:43.44,000 --> 0:28:47,000
matter of fact he did know Willie Brown

621
0:28:45.389,000 --> 0:28:48,000
and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had

622
0:28:47.729,000 --> 0:28:49,000
dinner four years ago we started

623
0:28:49.349,000 --> 0:28:53,000
throwing out that Center on the

624
0:28:50.549,000 --> 0:28:56,000
tablecloth Willie Brown said as sure as

625
0:28:53.94,000 --> 0:28:58,000
I'm mayor of San Francisco I want to

626
0:28:57.059,000 --> 0:29:03,000
build this thing as a legacy to the poor

627
0:28:59.069,000 --> 0:29:05,000
people of this city and he got me five

628
0:29:03.179,000 --> 0:29:08,000
acres of land on San Francisco Bay and

629
0:29:05.729,000 --> 0:29:1,000
we got an architect and we got a general

630
0:29:08.399,000 --> 0:29:13,000
contractor and we got her be on the

631
0:29:11.489,000 --> 0:29:15,000
board and our friends from HP and our

632
0:29:14.159,000 --> 0:29:17,000
friends at Steelcase and our friends

633
0:29:15.899,000 --> 0:29:2,000
from Cisco and her friends from Wells

634
0:29:17.699,000 --> 0:29:24,000
Fargo and then Genentech and and along

635
0:29:21.269,000 --> 0:29:28,000
the way I met this real short guy at a

636
0:29:25.649,000 --> 0:29:3,000
slide show in the Silicon Valley he came

637
0:29:29.039,000 --> 0:29:35,000
up to me afterwards he said man that's a

638
0:29:31.139,000 --> 0:29:36,000
fabulous story I want to help you and I

639
0:29:35.039,000 --> 0:29:39,000
said well that's thank you very much for

640
0:29:37.079,000 --> 0:29:42,000

641
0:29:39.869,000 --> 0:29:44,000

642

645
0:29:49.799,000 --> 0:29:54,000
from that jar of water sitting on that

646
0:29:52.229,000 --> 0:29:56,000
piano but I had the presence of mind to

647
0:29:55.259,000 --> 0:29:59,000
go back and talk to one of the techy

648
0:29:56.879,000 --> 0:30:01,000
kids at the center that said hey man

649
0:29:59.489,000 --> 0:30:03,000
what is eBay he said that's the

650
0:30:01.949,000 --> 0:30:06,000
electronic commerce Network I said well

651
0:30:04.019,000 --> 0:30:09,000
I met the guy who built the thing and he

652
0:30:07.199,000 --> 0:30:11,000
left me his card so I called him up on

653
0:30:09.809,000 --> 0:30:12,000
the phone and I said mr. skull

654
0:30:11.64,000 --> 0:30:16,000
I've come to have a much deeper

655
0:30:13.65,000 --> 0:30:16,000
appreciation of who you are

656
0:30:21,000 --> 0:30:25,000
and I'd like to become your friend

657
0:30:26.65,000 --> 0:30:33,000
and Jeff and I did become friends and

658
0:30:29.85,000 --> 0:30:37,000
he's organized a team of people and

659
0:30:34.6,000 --> 0:30:39,000
we're going to build this Center and I

660
0:30:38.23,000 --> 0:30:43,000
went down into the neighborhood

661
0:30:40.09,000 --> 0:30:45,000
I called Bayview Hunters Point and I

662
0:30:43.3,000 --> 0:30:47,000
said the mayor sent me down here to work

663
0:30:46.03,000 --> 0:30:5,000
with you

664
0:30:47.92,000 --> 0:30:5,000
and I want to build a Center with you

665
0:30:50.14,000 --> 0:30:53,000
but I'm not gonna build you anything if

666
0:30:51.7,000 --> 0:30:57,000
you don't want it

667
0:30:53.32,000 --> 0:31:,000
and all I gots a box of slides and so I

668
0:30:57.89,000 --> 0:31:01,000
stood up in front of 200 very angry very

669
0:31:00.7,000 --> 0:31:05,000
disappointed people on a summer night

670
0:31:02.63,000 --> 0:31:09,000
and the air conditioner had broken and

671
0:31:06.289,000 --> 0:31:11,000
it was a hundred degrees outside and I

672
0:31:10.22,000 --> 0:31:13,000
started chilling these pictures and

673
0:31:11.9,000 --> 0:31:17,000
after about ten pictures they all

674
0:31:14.059,000 --> 0:31:21,000
settled down and I ran a story and I

675
0:31:18.799,000 --> 0:31:22,000
said what do you think and on the back

676
0:31:21.32,000 --> 0:31:24,000
of the room a woman stood up and she

677
0:31:22.97,000 --> 0:31:27,000
said in 35 years and living in this

678
0:31:25.039,000 --> 0:31:29,000
godforsaken place you're the only person

679
0:31:28.309,000 --> 0:31:34,000
has come down here and treated us with

680
0:31:29.87,000 --> 0:31:35,000
dignity I'm going with you man and she

681
0:31:34.34,000 --> 0:31:39,000
turned that audience around on the pin

682
0:31:36.26,000 --> 0:31:41,000
and I promised these people that I was

683
0:31:39.74,000 --> 0:31:43,000
going to build this thing and we're

684
0:31:41.27,000 --> 0:31:46,000
gonna build it already and I think we

685
0:31:44,000 --> 0:31:48,000
can get in the ground this year as the

686
0:31:46.909,000 --> 0:31:53,000
first replication of the center in

687
0:31:48.679,000 --> 0:31:57,000
Pittsburgh but I met a guy named Quincy

688
0:31:54.38,000 --> 0:32:,000
Jones along the way and I showed him the

689
0:31:58.25,000 --> 0:32:07,000
box of slides and when she said I want

690
0:32:01.22,000 --> 0:32:09,000
to help you man let's do one in LA and

691
0:32:07.76,000 --> 0:32:11,000
so he's assembled a group of people and

692
0:32:09.86,000 --> 0:32:14,000
I've fallen in love with him as I have

693
0:32:12.62,000 --> 0:32:18,000
with Herbie and with this music and

694
0:32:15.46,000 --> 0:32:22,000
Quincy said where did the idea for

695
0:32:19.61,000 --> 0:32:25,000
centers like this come from I said it

696
0:32:22.549,000 --> 0:32:27,000
came from your music man because mr.

697
0:32:25.7,000 --> 0:32:29,000
Ross used to bring in your albums when I

698
0:32:27.59,000 --> 0:32:33,000
was 16 years old in the priory class

699
0:32:30.57,000 --> 0:32:37,000
when the world was all dark and your

700
0:32:34.51,000 --> 0:32:39,000
music got me to the Sun and I said if I

701
0:32:38.17,000 --> 0:32:41,000
can follow that music I'll get out into

702
0:32:40.12,000 --> 0:32:46,000
the sunlight

703
0:32:41.74,000 --> 0:32:5,000
and I'll be okay that's not true

704
0:32:46.289,000 --> 0:32:54,000
how did I get here I want you all to

705
0:32:51.549,000 --> 0:33:,000
know that I think the world is a place

706
0:32:55.179,000 --> 0:33:05,000
that's worth living I believe in you I

707
0:33:01.08,000 --> 0:33:07,000
believe in your hopes and your dreams I

708
0:33:05.279,000 --> 0:33:11,000
believe in your intelligence and I

709
0:33:07.899,000 --> 0:33:13,000
believe in your enthusiasm and I'm tired

710
0:33:11.62,000 --> 0:33:16,000
of living like this going into town

711
0:33:14.59,000 --> 0:33:19,000
after town with people standing around

712
0:33:16.63,000 --> 0:33:25,000
on the corners with holes where eyes

713
0:33:20.049,000 --> 0:33:27,000
used to be their spirits damaged we

714
0:33:25.659,000 --> 0:33:3,000
won't make it as a country unless we can

715
0:33:27.52,000 --> 0:33:33,000
turn this thing around and Pennsylvania

716
0:33:31.12,000 --> 0:33:35,000
it cost $60,000 to keep people in jail

717
0:33:33.789,000 --> 0:33:38,000
most of you look like me

718
0:33:35.789,000 --> 0:33:4,000
it's $40,000 to go to the University of

719
0:33:38.919,000 --> 0:33:42,000
Pittsburgh Medical School it's $20,000

720
0:33:41.71,000 --> 0:33:44,000
here we'll go to medical school to keep

721
0:33:43.12,000 --> 0:33:47,000
people in jail

722
0:33:44.789,000 --> 0:33:54,000
do the math

723
0:33:47.41,000 --> 0:33:54,000
it'll never work I am banking on you

724
0:33:55.02,000 --> 0:34:02,000
and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and

725
0:33:56.88,000 --> 0:34:05,000
Quincey and Hackett and Richard and very

726
0:34:02.34,000 --> 0:34:07,000
decent people who still believe in

727
0:34:05.97,000 --> 0:34:1,000
something

728
0:34:07.58,000 --> 0:34:16,000
and I want to do this in my lifetime in

729
0:34:11.84,000 --> 0:34:17,000
every city in every town and I don't

730
0:34:16.73,000 --> 0:34:2,000
think I'm crazy I think we can get home

731
0:34:18.77,000 --> 0:34:23,000
on this thing and I think we can build

732
0:34:21.44,000 --> 0:34:26,000
these all over the country for less

733
0:34:24.02,000 --> 0:34:29,000
money than we're spending on prisons and

734
0:34:27.38,000 --> 0:34:32,000
I believe we can turn this whole story

735
0:34:29.21,000 --> 0:34:36,000
around to one of celebration and one of

736
0:34:32.48,000 --> 0:34:37,000
hope in my business it's very difficult

737
0:34:36.26,000 --> 0:34:41,000
work you're always fighting upstream

738
0:34:38.36,000 --> 0:34:44,000
like the salmon never enough money too

739
0:34:41.84,000 --> 0:34:46,000
much need and so there is a tendency to

740
0:34:45.29,000 --> 0:34:49,000
have an Occupational depression of the

741
0:34:47.12,000 --> 0:34:53,000
companies might work and so I figured

742
0:34:50.18,000 --> 0:34:58,000
out over time the solution to the

743
0:34:53.63,000 --> 0:35:02,000
depression you make a friend in every

744
0:34:58.73,000 --> 0:35:04,000
town and you'll never be lonely I hope

745
0:35:03.44,000 --> 0:35:06,000
is that I've made a few here tonight and

746
0:35:05.6,000 --> 0:35:08,000
thanks for listening to what I had to

747
0:35:06.89,000 --> 0:35:08,000
say

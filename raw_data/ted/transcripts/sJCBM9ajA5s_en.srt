1
0:00:12.816,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We all go to doctors.

2
0:00:16.944,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And we do so with trust and blind faith

3
0:00:21.306,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that the test they are ordering and the medications they're prescribing

4
0:00:25.188,000 --> 0:00:28,000
are based upon evidence --

5
0:00:28.387,000 --> 0:00:3,000
evidence that's designed to help us.

6
0:00:32.338,000 --> 0:00:37,000
However, the reality is that that hasn't always been the case for everyone.

7
0:00:39.086,000 --> 0:00:4,000
What if I told you

8
0:00:40.405,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that the medical science discovered over the past century

9
0:00:44.375,000 --> 0:00:47,000
has been based on only half the population?

10
0:00:48.066,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm an emergency medicine doctor.

11
0:00:50.749,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was trained to be prepared in a medical emergency.

12
0:00:54.94,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's about saving lives. How cool is that?

13
0:01:00.492,000 --> 0:01:03,000
OK, there's a lot of runny noses and stubbed toes,

14
0:01:03.676,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but no matter who walks through the door to the ER,

15
0:01:07.365,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we order the same tests,

16
0:01:09.841,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we prescribe the same medication,

17
0:01:11.999,000 --> 0:01:15,000
without ever thinking about the sex or gender of our patients.

18
0:01:17.37,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Why would we?

19
0:01:19.053,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We were never taught that there were any differences between men and women.

20
0:01:22.818,000 --> 0:01:26,000
A recent Government Accountability study revealed that 80 percent of the drugs

21
0:01:27.401,000 --> 0:01:29,000
withdrawn from the market

22
0:01:29.576,000 --> 0:01:31,000
are due to side effects on women.

23
0:01:33.08,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So let's think about that for a minute.

24
0:01:35.415,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Why are we discovering side effects on women

25
0:01:39.313,000 --> 0:01:42,000
only after a drug has been released to the market?

26
0:01:43.496,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Do you know that it takes years for a drug to go from an idea

27
0:01:49.18,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to being tested on cells in a laboratory,

28
0:01:52.361,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to animal studies,

29
0:01:54.353,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to then clinical trials on humans,

30
0:01:56.504,000 --> 0:01:59,000
finally to go through a regulatory approval process,

31
0:02:00.399,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to be available for your doctor to prescribe to you?

32
0:02:06.17,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Not to mention the millions and billions of dollars of funding

33
0:02:09.564,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it takes to go through that process.

34
0:02:13.597,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So why are we discovering unacceptable side effects

35
0:02:16.573,000 --> 0:02:2,000
on half the population after that has gone through?

36
0:02:23.163,000 --> 0:02:24,000
What's happening?

37
0:02:24.777,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Well, it turns out that those cells used in that laboratory,

38
0:02:28.905,000 --> 0:02:29,000
they're male cells,

39
0:02:30.859,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and the animals used in the animal studies were male animals,

40
0:02:34.285,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and the clinical trials have been performed almost exclusively on men.

41
0:02:41.176,000 --> 0:02:46,000
How is it that the male model became our framework for medical research?

42
0:02:46.554,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Let's look at an example that has been popularized in the media,

43
0:02:50.649,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and it has to do with the sleep aid Ambien.

44
0:02:53.879,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Ambien was released on the market over 20 years ago,

45
0:02:58.667,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and since then, hundreds of millions of prescriptions have been written,

46
0:03:03.504,000 --> 0:03:07,000
primarily to women, because women suffer more sleep disorders than men.

47
0:03:09.047,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But just this past year,

48
0:03:11.247,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the Food and Drug Administration recommended cutting the dose in half

49
0:03:14.695,000 --> 0:03:16,000
for women only,

50
0:03:17.606,000 --> 0:03:19,000
because they just realized that women metabolize the drug

51
0:03:20.467,000 --> 0:03:22,000
at a slower rate than men,

52
0:03:23.404,000 --> 0:03:25,000
causing them to wake up in the morning

53
0:03:25.467,000 --> 0:03:28,000
with more of the active drug in their system.

54
0:03:28.685,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And then they're drowsy and they're getting behind the wheel of the car,

55
0:03:32.639,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and they're at risk for motor vehicle accidents.

56
0:03:36.955,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I can't help but think, as an emergency physician,

57
0:03:40.923,000 --> 0:03:44,000
how many of my patients that I've cared for over the years

58
0:03:45.74,000 --> 0:03:47,000
were involved in a motor vehicle accident

59
0:03:48.57,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that possibly could have been prevented

60
0:03:52.046,000 --> 0:03:57,000
if this type of analysis was performed and acted upon 20 years ago

61
0:03:57.185,000 --> 0:03:59,000
when this drug was first released.

62
0:04:01.089,000 --> 0:04:04,000
How many other things need to be analyzed by gender?

63
0:04:05.197,000 --> 0:04:06,000
What else are we missing?

64
0:04:09.555,000 --> 0:04:12,000
World War II changed a lot of things,

65
0:04:13.255,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and one of them was this need to protect people

66
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
from becoming victims of medical research without informed consent.

67
0:04:21.467,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So some much-needed guidelines or rules were set into place,

68
0:04:25.167,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and part of that was this desire to protect women of childbearing age

69
0:04:30.213,000 --> 0:04:32,000
from entering into any medical research studies.

70
0:04:34.016,000 --> 0:04:38,000
There was fear: what if something happened to the fetus during the study?

71
0:04:39.366,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Who would be responsible?

72
0:04:41.999,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And so the scientists at this time actually thought

73
0:04:44.512,000 --> 0:04:46,000
this was a blessing in disguise,

74
0:04:47.152,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because let's face it -- men's bodies are pretty homogeneous.

75
0:04:52.867,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They don't have the constantly fluctuating levels of hormones

76
0:04:56.337,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that could disrupt clean data they could get if they had only men.

77
0:05:01.21,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It was easier. It was cheaper.

78
0:05:05.651,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Not to mention, at this time, there was a general assumption

79
0:05:08.508,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that men and women were alike in every way,

80
0:05:12.757,000 --> 0:05:15,000
apart from their reproductive organs and sex hormones.

81
0:05:17.211,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So it was decided:

82
0:05:21.117,000 --> 0:05:24,000
medical research was performed on men,

83
0:05:24.657,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and the results were later applied to women.

84
0:05:29.203,000 --> 0:05:32,000
What did this do to the notion of women's health?

85
0:05:32.768,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Women's health became synonymous with reproduction:

86
0:05:37.048,000 --> 0:05:41,000
breasts, ovaries, uterus, pregnancy.

87
0:05:42.355,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's this term we now refer to as "bikini medicine."

88
0:05:46.461,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And this stayed this way until about the 1980s,

89
0:05:49.129,000 --> 0:05:52,000
when this concept was challenged by the medical community

90
0:05:52.638,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and by the public health policymakers when they realized that

91
0:05:56.803,000 --> 0:06:,000
by excluding women from all medical research studies

92
0:06:01.13,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we actually did them a disservice,

93
0:06:04.643,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in that apart from reproductive issues,

94
0:06:06.999,000 --> 0:06:08,000
virtually nothing was known about the unique needs

95
0:06:09.587,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of the female patient.

96
0:06:12.999,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Since that time, an overwhelming amount of evidence has come to light

97
0:06:18.537,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that shows us just how different men and women are in every way.

98
0:06:29.297,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You know, we have this saying in medicine:

99
0:06:32.074,000 --> 0:06:34,000
children are not just little adults.

100
0:06:36.81,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we say that to remind ourselves

101
0:06:38.771,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that children actually have a different physiology than normal adults.

102
0:06:44.678,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And it's because of this that the medical specialty of pediatrics came to light.

103
0:06:49.659,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And we now conduct research on children in order to improve their lives.

104
0:06:57.039,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And I know the same thing can be said about women.

105
0:06:59.96,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Women are not just men with boobs and tubes.

106
0:07:06.561,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But they have their own anatomy and physiology

107
0:07:10.141,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that deserves to be studied with the same intensity.

108
0:07:15.381,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Let's take the cardiovascular system, for example.

109
0:07:18.999,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This area in medicine has done the most to try to figure out

110
0:07:22.73,000 --> 0:07:26,000
why it seems men and women have completely different heart attacks.

111
0:07:27.999,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Heart disease is the number one killer for both men and women,

112
0:07:33.113,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but more women die within the first year of having a heart attack than men.

113
0:07:39.049,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Men will complain of crushing chest pain --

114
0:07:43.087,000 --> 0:07:45,000
an elephant is sitting on their chest.

115
0:07:46.455,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And we call this typical.

116
0:07:49.622,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Women have chest pain, too.

117
0:07:52.736,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But more women than men will complain of "just not feeling right,"

118
0:08:00.898,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"can't seem to get enough air in,"

119
0:08:03.791,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"just so tired lately."

120
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And for some reason we call this atypical,

121
0:08:09.927,000 --> 0:08:12,000
even though, as I mentioned, women do make up half the population.

122
0:08:15.537,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And so what is some of the evidence to help explain some of these differences?

123
0:08:21.999,000 --> 0:08:23,000
If we look at the anatomy,

124
0:08:24.554,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the blood vessels that surround the heart are smaller in women compared to men,

125
0:08:30.593,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the way that those blood vessels develop disease is different

126
0:08:35.097,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in women compared to men.

127
0:08:37.875,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And the test that we use to determine if someone is at risk for a heart attack,

128
0:08:43.051,000 --> 0:08:47,000
well, they were initially designed and tested and perfected in men,

129
0:08:47.647,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and so aren't as good at determining that in women.

130
0:08:52.305,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And then if we think about the medications --

131
0:08:55.266,000 --> 0:08:58,000
common medications that we use, like aspirin.

132
0:08:59.767,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We give aspirin to healthy men to help prevent them from having a heart attack,

133
0:09:04.318,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but do you know that if you give aspirin to a healthy woman,

134
0:09:08.576,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it's actually harmful?

135
0:09:12.376,000 --> 0:09:14,000
What this is doing is merely telling us

136
0:09:14.782,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that we are scratching the surface.

137
0:09:19.145,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Emergency medicine is a fast-paced business.

138
0:09:23.563,000 --> 0:09:26,000
In how many life-saving areas of medicine,

139
0:09:26.94,000 --> 0:09:29,000
like cancer and stroke,

140
0:09:30.94,000 --> 0:09:34,000
are there important differences between men and women that we could be utilizing?

141
0:09:36.252,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Or even, why is it that some people get those runny noses

142
0:09:41.08,000 --> 0:09:43,000
more than others,

143
0:09:43.289,000 --> 0:09:46,000
or why the pain medication that we give to those stubbed toes

144
0:09:46.64,000 --> 0:09:49,000
work in some and not in others?

145
0:09:53.288,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The Institute of Medicine has said every cell has a sex.

146
0:09:59.82,000 --> 0:10:,000
What does this mean?

147
0:10:02.532,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Sex is DNA.

148
0:10:04.954,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Gender is how someone presents themselves in society.

149
0:10:09.883,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And these two may not always match up,

150
0:10:12.447,000 --> 0:10:15,000
as we can see with our transgendered population.

151
0:10:16.74,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But it's important to realize that from the moment of conception,

152
0:10:21.679,000 --> 0:10:23,000
every cell in our bodies --

153
0:10:23.825,000 --> 0:10:26,000
skin, hair, heart and lungs --

154
0:10:27.15,000 --> 0:10:3,000
contains our own unique DNA,

155
0:10:30.461,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and that DNA contains the chromosomes that determine

156
0:10:34.236,000 --> 0:10:39,000
whether we become male or female, man or woman.

157
0:10:40.4,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It used to be thought

158
0:10:42.012,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that those sex-determining chromosomes pictured here --

159
0:10:46.364,000 --> 0:10:49,000
XY if you're male, XX if you're female --

160
0:10:49.761,000 --> 0:10:54,000
merely determined whether you would be born with ovaries or testes,

161
0:10:54.999,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and it was the sex hormones that those organs produced

162
0:10:58.764,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that were responsible for the differences we see in the opposite sex.

163
0:11:04.757,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But we now know that that theory was wrong --

164
0:11:09.615,000 --> 0:11:11,000
or it's at least a little incomplete.

165
0:11:12.084,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And thankfully, scientists like Dr. Page from the Whitehead Institute,

166
0:11:16.886,000 --> 0:11:17,000
who works on the Y chromosome,

167
0:11:18.884,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and Doctor Yang from UCLA,

168
0:11:21.075,000 --> 0:11:26,000
they have found evidence that tells us that those sex-determining chromosomes

169
0:11:26.758,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that are in every cell in our bodies

170
0:11:29.379,000 --> 0:11:34,000
continue to remain active for our entire lives

171
0:11:36.517,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and could be what's responsible for the differences we see

172
0:11:40.116,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in the dosing of drugs,

173
0:11:42.355,000 --> 0:11:44,000
or why there are differences between men and women

174
0:11:45.345,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in the susceptibility and severity of diseases.

175
0:11:51.032,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This new knowledge is the game-changer,

176
0:11:57.425,000 --> 0:12:,000
and it's up to those scientists that continue to find that evidence,

177
0:12:00.823,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but it's up to the clinicians to start translating this data

178
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
at the bedside, today.

179
0:12:09.168,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Right now.

180
0:12:13.45,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And to help do this, I'm a co-founder of a national organization

181
0:12:16.498,000 --> 0:12:18,000
called Sex and Gender Women's Health Collaborative,

182
0:12:19.505,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and we collect all of this data so that it's available for teaching

183
0:12:24.149,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and for patient care.

184
0:12:26.38,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And we're working to bring together the medical educators to the table.

185
0:12:31.756,000 --> 0:12:32,000
That's a big job.

186
0:12:34.162,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It's changing the way medical training has been done since its inception.

187
0:12:41.039,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But I believe in them.

188
0:12:43.882,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I know they're going to see the value of incorporating the gender lens

189
0:12:49.503,000 --> 0:12:5,000
into the current curriculum.

190
0:12:52.598,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's about training the future health care providers correctly.

191
0:13:00.437,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And regionally,

192
0:13:01.612,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I'm a co-creator of a division within the Department of Emergency Medicine

193
0:13:05.497,000 --> 0:13:06,000
here at Brown University,

194
0:13:07.241,000 --> 0:13:09,000
called Sex and Gender in Emergency Medicine,

195
0:13:09.875,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and we conduct the research to determine the differences between men and women

196
0:13:14.525,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in emergent conditions,

197
0:13:16.707,000 --> 0:13:21,000
like heart disease and stroke and sepsis and substance abuse,

198
0:13:21.999,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but we also believe that education is paramount.

199
0:13:27.304,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We've created a 360-degree model of education.

200
0:13:31.329,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We have programs for the doctors, for the nurses, for the students

201
0:13:37.311,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and for the patients.

202
0:13:39.511,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Because this cannot just be left up to the health care leaders.

203
0:13:44.315,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We all have a role in making a difference.

204
0:13:48.65,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But I must warn you: this is not easy.

205
0:13:53.84,000 --> 0:13:54,000
In fact, it's hard.

206
0:13:57.146,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It's essentially changing the way we think about medicine

207
0:14:01.562,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and health and research.

208
0:14:05.711,000 --> 0:14:08,000
It's changing our relationship to the health care system.

209
0:14:09.76,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But there's no going back.

210
0:14:13.339,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We now know just enough

211
0:14:17.062,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to know that we weren't doing it right.

212
0:14:21.672,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Martin Luther King, Jr. has said,

213
0:14:24.014,000 --> 0:14:28,000
"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability,

214
0:14:28.687,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but comes through continuous struggle."

215
0:14:32.314,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And the first step towards change is awareness.

216
0:14:36.116,000 --> 0:14:4,000
This is not just about improving medical care for women.

217
0:14:40.702,000 --> 0:14:44,000
This is about personalized, individualized health care for everyone.

218
0:14:47.09,000 --> 0:14:53,000
This awareness has the power to transform medical care for men and women.

219
0:14:54.827,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And from now on, I want you to ask your doctors

220
0:15:00.539,000 --> 0:15:04,000
whether the treatments you are receiving are specific to your sex and gender.

221
0:15:06.246,000 --> 0:15:08,000
They may not know the answer --

222
0:15:08.959,000 --> 0:15:09,000
yet.

223
0:15:11.101,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But the conversation has begun, and together we can all learn.

224
0:15:15.797,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Remember, for me and my colleagues in this field,

225
0:15:20.198,000 --> 0:15:22,000
your sex and gender matter.

226
0:15:23.379,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Thank you.

227
0:15:24.555,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Applause)

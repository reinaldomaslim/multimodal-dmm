1
0:00:12.46,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Twenty years ago,

2
0:00:13.94,000 --> 0:00:15,000
when I was a barrister and human rights lawyer

3
0:00:16.9,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in full-time legal practice in London,

4
0:00:19.9,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and the highest court in the land

5
0:00:22.1,000 --> 0:00:26,000
still convened, some would say by an accident of history,

6
0:00:26.54,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in this building here,

7
0:00:28.66,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I met a young man who had just quit his job

8
0:00:31.74,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in the British Foreign Office.

9
0:00:33.74,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When I asked him, "Why did you leave,"

10
0:00:36.06,000 --> 0:00:37,000
he told me this story.

11
0:00:38.34,000 --> 0:00:4,000
He had gone to his boss one morning and said,

12
0:00:41.06,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Let's do something about human rights abuses in China."

13
0:00:46.02,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And his boss had replied,

14
0:00:48.02,000 --> 0:00:5,000
"We can't do anything about human rights abuses in China

15
0:00:50.74,000 --> 0:00:52,000
because we have trade relations with China."

16
0:00:54.5,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So my friend went away with his tail between his legs,

17
0:00:57.1,000 --> 0:01:,000
and six months later, he returned again to his boss,

18
0:01:01.06,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and he said this time,

19
0:01:02.7,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"Let's do something about human rights in Burma,"

20
0:01:06.22,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as it was then called.

21
0:01:08.22,000 --> 0:01:1,000
His boss once again paused

22
0:01:10.38,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and said, "Oh, but we can't do anything about human rights in Burma

23
0:01:14.42,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because we don't have any trade relations with Burma."

24
0:01:18.1,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:19.78,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This was the moment he knew he had to leave.

26
0:01:21.9,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It wasn't just the hypocrisy that got to him.

27
0:01:24.98,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It was the unwillingness of his government

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to engage in conflict with other governments,

29
0:01:30.9,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in tense discussions,

30
0:01:32.7,000 --> 0:01:35,000
all the while, innocent people were being harmed.

31
0:01:37.42,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We are constantly told

32
0:01:39.98,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that conflict is bad

33
0:01:42.74,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that compromise is good;

34
0:01:45.46,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that conflict is bad

35
0:01:47.14,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but consensus is good;

36
0:01:49.94,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that conflict is bad

37
0:01:52.18,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and collaboration is good.

38
0:01:55.86,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But in my view,

39
0:01:57.18,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that's far too simple a vision of the world.

40
0:01:59.58,000 --> 0:02:,000
We cannot know

41
0:02:01.5,000 --> 0:02:03,000
whether conflict is bad

42
0:02:03.58,000 --> 0:02:05,000
unless we know who is fighting,

43
0:02:06.42,000 --> 0:02:08,000
why they are fighting

44
0:02:08.58,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and how they are fighting.

45
0:02:10.46,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And compromises can be thoroughly rotten

46
0:02:13.94,000 --> 0:02:15,000
if they harm people who are not at the table,

47
0:02:17.42,000 --> 0:02:19,000
people who are vulnerable, disempowered,

48
0:02:19.859,000 --> 0:02:22,000
people whom we have an obligation to protect.

49
0:02:24.3,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now, you might be somewhat skeptical of a lawyer

50
0:02:27.38,000 --> 0:02:3,000
arguing about the benefits of conflict

51
0:02:30.58,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and creating problems for compromise,

52
0:02:33.22,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but I did also qualify as a mediator,

53
0:02:35.06,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and these days, I spend my time giving talks about ethics for free.

54
0:02:38.98,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So as my bank manager likes to remind me, I'm downwardly mobile.

55
0:02:44.1,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But if you accept my argument,

56
0:02:47.14,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it should change not just the way we lead our personal lives,

57
0:02:50.34,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which I wish to put to one side for the moment,

58
0:02:53.42,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but it will change the way we think about major problems

59
0:02:57.22,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of public health and the environment.

60
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Let me explain.

61
0:03:04.18,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Every middle schooler in the United States,

62
0:03:06.58,000 --> 0:03:08,000
my 12-year-old daughter included,

63
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
learns that there are three branches of government,

64
0:03:13.14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the legislative, the executive and the judicial branch.

65
0:03:17.66,000 --> 0:03:18,000
James Madison wrote,

66
0:03:19.1,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"If there is any principle more sacred in our Constitution,

67
0:03:24.14,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and indeed in any free constitution,

68
0:03:26.9,000 --> 0:03:27,000
than any other,

69
0:03:28.42,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it is that which separates

70
0:03:30.94,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the legislative, the executive and the judicial powers."

71
0:03:35.9,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, the framers were not just concerned

72
0:03:39.18,000 --> 0:03:43,000
about the concentration and exercise of power.

73
0:03:43.3,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They also understood the perils of influence.

74
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Judges cannot determine the constitutionality of laws

75
0:03:53.38,000 --> 0:03:56,000
if they participate in making those laws,

76
0:03:57.18,000 --> 0:04:,000
nor can they hold the other branches of government accountable

77
0:04:01.14,000 --> 0:04:02,000
if they collaborate with them

78
0:04:03.1,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or enter into close relationships with them.

79
0:04:07.3,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The Constitution is, as one famous scholar put it,

80
0:04:11.22,000 --> 0:04:13,000
"an invitation to struggle."

81
0:04:14.06,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And we the people are served

82
0:04:16.86,000 --> 0:04:2,000
when those branches do, indeed, struggle with each other.

83
0:04:23.1,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, we recognize the importance of struggle

84
0:04:26.7,000 --> 0:04:28,000
not just in the public sector

85
0:04:29.62,000 --> 0:04:31,000
between our branches of government.

86
0:04:32.02,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We also know it too in the private sector,

87
0:04:35.38,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in relationships among corporations.

88
0:04:39.18,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Let's imagine that two American airlines get together and agree

89
0:04:44.22,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that they will not drop the price

90
0:04:46.42,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of their economy class airfares below 250 dollars a ticket.

91
0:04:51.42,000 --> 0:04:54,000
That is collaboration, some would say collusion,

92
0:04:55.3,000 --> 0:04:56,000
not competition,

93
0:04:56.66,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and we the people are harmed

94
0:04:59.5,000 --> 0:05:,000
because we pay more for our tickets.

95
0:05:02.66,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Imagine similarly two airlines were to say,

96
0:05:04.94,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"Look, Airline A, we'll take the route from LA to Chicago,"

97
0:05:09.98,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and Airline B says, "We'll take the route from Chicago to DC,

98
0:05:13.18,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and we won't compete."

99
0:05:14.66,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Once again, that's collaboration or collusion instead of competition,

100
0:05:19.3,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we the people are harmed.

101
0:05:23.7,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So we understand the importance of struggle

102
0:05:29.18,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when it comes to relationships between branches of government,

103
0:05:34.9,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the public sector.

104
0:05:36.62,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We also understand the importance of conflict

105
0:05:40.06,000 --> 0:05:44,000
when it comes to relationships among corporations,

106
0:05:44.42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the private sector.

107
0:05:46.1,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But where we have forgotten it

108
0:05:48.7,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is in the relationships between the public and the private.

109
0:05:53.14,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And governments all over the world are collaborating with industry

110
0:05:56.86,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to solve problems of public health and the environment,

111
0:06:00.66,000 --> 0:06:02,000
often collaborating with the very corporations

112
0:06:03.66,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that are creating or exacerbating the problems they are trying to solve.

113
0:06:10.9,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We are told that these relationships

114
0:06:14.5,000 --> 0:06:15,000
are a win-win.

115
0:06:17.18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But what if someone is losing out?

116
0:06:22.1,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Let me give you some examples.

117
0:06:25.66,000 --> 0:06:28,000
A United Nations agency decided to address a serious problem:

118
0:06:29.18,000 --> 0:06:32,000
poor sanitation in schools in rural India.

119
0:06:34.02,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They did so not just in collaboration with national and local governments

120
0:06:38.1,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but also with a television company

121
0:06:40.62,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and with a major multinational soda company.

122
0:06:45.46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In exchange for less than one million dollars,

123
0:06:48.62,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that corporation received the benefits of a months-long promotional campaign

124
0:06:53.02,000 --> 0:06:55,000
including a 12-hour telethon

125
0:06:55.22,000 --> 0:06:58,000
all using the company's logo and color scheme.

126
0:06:59.86,000 --> 0:07:,000
This was an arrangement

127
0:07:01.98,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which was totally understandable

128
0:07:04.86,000 --> 0:07:05,000
from the corporation's point of view.

129
0:07:06.82,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It enhances the reputation of the company

130
0:07:09.38,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and it creates brand loyalty for its products.

131
0:07:13.18,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But in my view,

132
0:07:14.82,000 --> 0:07:17,000
this is profoundly problematic for the intergovernmental agency,

133
0:07:18.54,000 --> 0:07:22,000
an agency that has a mission to promote sustainable living.

134
0:07:23.7,000 --> 0:07:26,000
By increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages

135
0:07:26.86,000 --> 0:07:3,000
made from scarce local water supplies and drunk out of plastic bottles

136
0:07:31.18,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in a country that is already grappling with obesity,

137
0:07:34.22,000 --> 0:07:37,000
this is neither sustainable from a public health

138
0:07:37.66,000 --> 0:07:39,000
nor an environmental point of view.

139
0:07:40.58,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And in order to solve one public health problem,

140
0:07:43.94,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the agency is sowing the seeds

141
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of another.

142
0:07:49.3,000 --> 0:07:53,000
This is just one example of dozens I discovered

143
0:07:53.62,000 --> 0:07:58,000
in researching a book on the relationships between government and industry.

144
0:07:58.74,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I could also have told you about the initiatives in parks

145
0:08:02.54,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in London and throughout Britain,

146
0:08:04.18,000 --> 0:08:06,000
involving the same company, promoting exercise,

147
0:08:07.38,000 --> 0:08:11,000
or indeed of the British government creating voluntary pledges

148
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in partnership with industry

149
0:08:14.46,000 --> 0:08:16,000
instead of regulating industry.

150
0:08:17.22,000 --> 0:08:22,000
These collaborations or partnerships have become the paradigm in public health,

151
0:08:22.9,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and once again, they make sense from the point of view of industry.

152
0:08:26.98,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It allows them to frame public health problems and their solutions

153
0:08:30.62,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in ways that are least threatening to,

154
0:08:32.78,000 --> 0:08:34,000
most consonant with their commercial interests.

155
0:08:35.66,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So obesity becomes a problem

156
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of individual decision-making,

157
0:08:42.54,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of personal behavior,

158
0:08:44.619,000 --> 0:08:47,000
personal responsibility and lack of physical activity.

159
0:08:47.82,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It is not a problem,

160
0:08:49.94,000 --> 0:08:5,000
when framed this way,

161
0:08:51.379,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of a multinational food system involving major corporations.

162
0:08:55.02,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And again, I don't blame industry.

163
0:08:56.7,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Industry naturally engages in strategies of influence

164
0:09:00.14,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to promote its commercial interests.

165
0:09:03.38,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But governments have a responsibility

166
0:09:06.66,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to develop counterstrategies

167
0:09:08.74,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to protect us

168
0:09:10.58,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and the common good.

169
0:09:13.98,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The mistake that governments are making

170
0:09:18.3,000 --> 0:09:2,000
when they collaborate in this way

171
0:09:20.9,000 --> 0:09:21,000
with industry

172
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is that they conflate

173
0:09:24.86,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the common good

174
0:09:26.7,000 --> 0:09:27,000
with common ground.

175
0:09:28.9,000 --> 0:09:3,000
When you collaborate with industry,

176
0:09:31.7,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you necessarily put off the table

177
0:09:34.54,000 --> 0:09:37,000
things that might promote the common good to which industry will not agree.

178
0:09:38.14,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Industry will not agree to increased regulation

179
0:09:40.94,000 --> 0:09:44,000
unless it believes this will stave off even more regulation

180
0:09:45.14,000 --> 0:09:48,000
or perhaps knock some competitors out of the market.

181
0:09:49.78,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Nor can companies agree to do certain things,

182
0:09:52.1,000 --> 0:09:54,000
for example raise the prices of their unhealthy products,

183
0:09:55.1,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because that would violate competition law,

184
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
as we've established.

185
0:10:00.38,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So our governments should not confound

186
0:10:03.62,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the common good and common ground,

187
0:10:06.1,000 --> 0:10:11,000
especially when common ground means reaching agreement with industry.

188
0:10:12.34,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I want to give you another example,

189
0:10:14.06,000 --> 0:10:16,000
moving from high-profile collaboration

190
0:10:16.22,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to something that is below ground

191
0:10:18.74,000 --> 0:10:21,000
both literally and figuratively:

192
0:10:22.02,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.

193
0:10:25.14,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Imagine that you purchase a plot of land

194
0:10:28.86,000 --> 0:10:3,000
not knowing the mineral rights have been sold.

195
0:10:31.1,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This is before the fracking boom.

196
0:10:34.18,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You build your dream home on that plot,

197
0:10:37.22,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and shortly afterwards,

198
0:10:38.86,000 --> 0:10:43,000
you discover that a gas company is building a well pad on your land.

199
0:10:44.86,000 --> 0:10:47,000
That was the plight of the Hallowich family.

200
0:10:49.02,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Within a very short period of time,

201
0:10:51.86,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they began to complain of headaches,

202
0:10:55.1,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of sore throats, of itchy eyes,

203
0:10:58.34,000 --> 0:11:,000
in addition to the interference of the noise, vibration

204
0:11:01.18,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and the bright lights from the flaring of natural gas.

205
0:11:04.34,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They were very vocal in their criticisms,

206
0:11:07.78,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and then they fell silent.

207
0:11:10.22,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, where this image appeared,

208
0:11:13.5,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and one other newspaper, we discovered why they fell silent.

209
0:11:16.38,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The newspapers went to the court and said, "What happened to the Hallowiches?"

210
0:11:20.1,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And it turned out the Hallowiches had made a secret settlement

211
0:11:23.5,000 --> 0:11:26,000
with the gas operators, and it was a take-it-or-leave-it settlement.

212
0:11:27.42,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The gas company said,

213
0:11:28.7,000 --> 0:11:3,000
you can have a six-figure sum

214
0:11:31.14,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to move elsewhere and start your lives again,

215
0:11:33.3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but in return

216
0:11:34.54,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you must promise not to speak of your experience with our company,

217
0:11:38.42,000 --> 0:11:4,000
not to speak of your experience with fracking,

218
0:11:41.02,000 --> 0:11:44,000
not to speak about the health consequences

219
0:11:45.5,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that might have been revealed by a medical examination.

220
0:11:49.54,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Now, I do not blame the Hallowiches for accepting

221
0:11:52.38,000 --> 0:11:54,000
a take-it-or-leave-it settlement

222
0:11:55.22,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and starting their lives elsewhere.

223
0:11:57.46,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And one can understand

224
0:11:58.7,000 --> 0:12:,000
why the company would wish to silence a squeaky wheel.

225
0:12:01.7,000 --> 0:12:04,000
What I want to point the finger at is the legal and regulatory system,

226
0:12:05.5,000 --> 0:12:07,000
a system in which there are networks of agreements

227
0:12:07.98,000 --> 0:12:08,000
just like this one

228
0:12:09.9,000 --> 0:12:12,000
which serve to silence people and seal off data points

229
0:12:14.38,000 --> 0:12:16,000
from public health experts and epidemiologists,

230
0:12:17.06,000 --> 0:12:18,000
a system in which regulators

231
0:12:18.7,000 --> 0:12:21,000
will even refrain from issuing a violation notice

232
0:12:21.86,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in the event of pollution

233
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
if the landowner and the gas company

234
0:12:25.42,000 --> 0:12:26,000
agree to settle.

235
0:12:27.02,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This is a system which isn't just bad from a public health point of view;

236
0:12:30.98,000 --> 0:12:33,000
it exposes hazards to local families

237
0:12:34.3,000 --> 0:12:36,000
who remain in the dark.

238
0:12:39.02,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Now, I have given you two examples not because they are isolated examples.

239
0:12:43.54,000 --> 0:12:45,000
They are examples of a systemic problem.

240
0:12:46.06,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I could share some counterexamples,

241
0:12:48.46,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the case for example of the public official

242
0:12:51.46,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who sues the pharmaceutical company

243
0:12:54.58,000 --> 0:12:55,000
for concealing the fact

244
0:12:56.22,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that its antidepressant increases suicidal thoughts in adolescents.

245
0:13:02.82,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I can tell you about the regulator who went after the food company

246
0:13:06.74,000 --> 0:13:09,000
for exaggerating the purported health benefits of its yogurt.

247
0:13:10.5,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And I can tell you about the legislator

248
0:13:13.98,000 --> 0:13:17,000
who despite heavy lobbying directed at both sides of the aisle

249
0:13:18.3,000 --> 0:13:21,000
pushes for environmental protections.

250
0:13:22.98,000 --> 0:13:23,000
These are isolated examples,

251
0:13:24.74,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but they are beacons of light in the darkness,

252
0:13:28.94,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and they can show us the way.

253
0:13:33.82,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I began by suggesting that sometimes we need to engage in conflict.

254
0:13:39.3,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Governments should tussle with,

255
0:13:42.86,000 --> 0:13:47,000
struggle with, at times engage in direct conflict with corporations.

256
0:13:49.78,000 --> 0:13:53,000
This is not because governments are inherently good

257
0:13:54.06,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and corporations are inherently evil.

258
0:13:56.34,000 --> 0:14:,000
Each is capable of good or ill.

259
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But corporations understandably act to promote their commercial interests,

260
0:14:06.9,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and they do so either sometimes undermining or promoting the common good.

261
0:14:12.98,000 --> 0:14:15,000
But it is the responsibility of governments

262
0:14:16.98,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to protect and promote the common good.

263
0:14:20.22,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And we should insist

264
0:14:22.94,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that they fight to do so.

265
0:14:26.62,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This is because governments

266
0:14:29.14,000 --> 0:14:3,000
are the guardians

267
0:14:31.42,000 --> 0:14:32,000
of public health;

268
0:14:33.74,000 --> 0:14:35,000
governments are the guardians

269
0:14:36.5,000 --> 0:14:37,000
of the environment;

270
0:14:38.38,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and it is governments

271
0:14:40.22,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that are guardians

272
0:14:41.54,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of these essential parts of our common good.

273
0:14:47.5,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Thank you.

274
0:14:48.74,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Applause)

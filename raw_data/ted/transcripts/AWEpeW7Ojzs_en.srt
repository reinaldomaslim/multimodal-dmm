Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:15.816,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's a great time to be a molecular biologist. (Laughter)

3
0:00:19.254,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier

4
0:00:22.136,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and cheaper.

5
0:00:23.668,000 --> 0:00:25,000
By the end of this year, we'll be able to sequence

6
0:00:25.838,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the three million bits of information

7
0:00:27.542,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in your genome in less than a day

8
0:00:30.512,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and for less than 1,000 euros.

9
0:00:32.922,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Biotech is probably the most powerful

10
0:00:35.752,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the fastest-growing technology sector.

11
0:00:38.776,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It has the power, potentially,

12
0:00:42.078,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to replace our fossil fuels,

13
0:00:44.295,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to revolutionize medicine,

14
0:00:46.512,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and to touch every aspect of our daily lives.

15
0:00:50.723,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So who gets to do it?

16
0:00:54.555,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I think we'd all be pretty comfortable with

17
0:00:57.05,000 --> 0:01:,000
this guy doing it.

18
0:01:00.322,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But what about

19
0:01:02.237,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that guy? (Laughter)

20
0:01:05.109,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:06.979,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In 2009, I first heard about DIYbio.

22
0:01:12.453,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology

23
0:01:16.566,000 --> 0:01:18,000
accessible to everyone,

24
0:01:18.647,000 --> 0:01:21,000
not just scientists and people in government labs.

25
0:01:22.286,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The idea is that if you open up the science

26
0:01:25.826,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and you allow diverse groups to participate,

27
0:01:28.629,000 --> 0:01:29,000
it could really stimulate innovation.

28
0:01:30.322,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Putting technology in the hands of the end user

29
0:01:33.128,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is usually a good idea because they've got the best idea

30
0:01:36.317,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of what their needs are.

31
0:01:38.42,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And here's this really sophisticated technology

32
0:01:41.557,000 --> 0:01:43,000
coming down the road, all these associated

33
0:01:44.301,000 --> 0:01:46,000
social, moral, ethical questions,

34
0:01:46.998,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public

35
0:01:50.389,000 --> 0:01:53,000
just exactly what it is we're doing in those labs.

36
0:01:54.271,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So wouldn't it be nice

37
0:01:56.999,000 --> 0:01:58,000
if there was a place in your local neighborhood

38
0:01:59.435,000 --> 0:02:01,000
where you could go and learn about this stuff,

39
0:02:02.015,000 --> 0:02:04,000
do it hands-on?

40
0:02:04.338,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I thought so.

41
0:02:05.853,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So, three years ago, I got together

42
0:02:07.733,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations

43
0:02:11.27,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and we founded Genspace.

44
0:02:13.405,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's a nonprofit, a community biotech lab

45
0:02:16.861,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in Brooklyn, New York,

46
0:02:18.215,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and the idea was people could come,

47
0:02:19.984,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they could take classes and putter around in the lab

48
0:02:23.957,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in a very open, friendly atmosphere.

49
0:02:28.069,000 --> 0:02:3,000
None of my previous experience prepared me

50
0:02:30.71,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for what came next. Can you guess?

51
0:02:34.055,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The press started calling us.

52
0:02:36.783,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase

53
0:02:39.901,000 --> 0:02:41,000
science literacy, the more they wanted to talk

54
0:02:42.573,000 --> 0:02:45,000
about us creating the next Frankenstein,

55
0:02:45.701,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and as a result, for the next six months,

56
0:02:48.706,000 --> 0:02:49,000
when you Googled my name,

57
0:02:50.483,000 --> 0:02:54,000
instead of getting my scientific papers, you got this.

58
0:02:54.536,000 --> 0:02:55,000
["Am I a biohazard?"]

59
0:02:56.114,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:58.247,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It was pretty depressing.

61
0:03:00.038,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The only thing that got us through that period

62
0:03:02.998,000 --> 0:03:03,000
was that we knew that all over the world,

63
0:03:04.859,000 --> 0:03:05,000
there were other people that were trying to do

64
0:03:06.445,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the same thing that we were.

65
0:03:08.381,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They were opening biohacker spaces, and some of them

66
0:03:10.885,000 --> 0:03:12,000
were facing much greater challenges than we did,

67
0:03:13.526,000 --> 0:03:17,000
more regulations, less resources.

68
0:03:17.643,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But now, three years later, here's where we stand.

69
0:03:21.842,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's a vibrant, global community of hackerspaces,

70
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and this is just the beginning.

71
0:03:28.162,000 --> 0:03:3,000
These are some of the biggest ones,

72
0:03:30.223,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and there are others opening every day.

73
0:03:32.287,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There's one probably going to open up in Moscow,

74
0:03:35.158,000 --> 0:03:36,000
one in South Korea,

75
0:03:36.457,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the cool thing is they each have their own

76
0:03:38.783,000 --> 0:03:39,000
individual flavor

77
0:03:40.566,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that grew out of the community they came out of.

78
0:03:42.89,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Let me take you on a little tour.

79
0:03:46.029,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Biohackers work alone.

80
0:03:48.477,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We work in groups,

81
0:03:51.037,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in big cities — (Laughter) —

82
0:03:55.422,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and in small villages.

83
0:03:58.092,000 --> 0:04:,000
We reverse engineer lab equipment.

84
0:04:00.86,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We genetically engineer bacteria.

85
0:04:03.396,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We hack hardware,

86
0:04:05.623,000 --> 0:04:07,000
software,

87
0:04:07.868,000 --> 0:04:09,000
wetware,

88
0:04:10.292,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and, of course, the code of life.

89
0:04:13.228,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We like to build things.

90
0:04:16.163,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Then we like to take things apart.

91
0:04:22.55,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We make things grow.

92
0:04:24.666,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We make things glow.

93
0:04:26.468,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And we make cells dance.

94
0:04:30.435,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The spirit of these labs, it's open, it's positive,

95
0:04:34.226,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but, you know, sometimes when people think of us,

96
0:04:36.667,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety,

97
0:04:40.694,000 --> 0:04:43,000
bio-security, all the dark side stuff.

98
0:04:43.771,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I'm not going to minimize those concerns.

99
0:04:46.379,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use,

100
0:04:50.176,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and, you know, you get something like

101
0:04:51.393,000 --> 0:04:54,000
synthetic biology, nanobiotechnology,

102
0:04:55.243,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it really compels you, you have to look at both

103
0:04:57.867,000 --> 0:05:,000
the amateur groups but also the professional groups,

104
0:05:01.28,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because they have better infrastructure,

105
0:05:03.731,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they have better facilities,

106
0:05:05.279,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and they have access to pathogens.

107
0:05:07.778,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So the United Nations did just that, and they recently

108
0:05:11.058,000 --> 0:05:13,000
issued a report on this whole area,

109
0:05:13.666,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and what they concluded was the power of this technology

110
0:05:16.738,000 --> 0:05:19,000
for positive was much greater than the risk for negative,

111
0:05:20.59,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community,

112
0:05:24.119,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and they noted, not surprisingly, that the press

113
0:05:27.664,000 --> 0:05:31,000
had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities

114
0:05:31.688,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and underestimate our ethics.

115
0:05:34.223,000 --> 0:05:37,000
As a matter of fact, DIY people from all over the world,

116
0:05:37.752,000 --> 0:05:39,000
America, Europe, got together last year,

117
0:05:40.482,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and we hammered out a common code of ethics.

118
0:05:43.031,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That's a lot more than conventional science has done.

119
0:05:46.391,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, we follow state and local regulations.

120
0:05:50.039,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We dispose of our waste properly, we follow

121
0:05:52.035,000 --> 0:05:55,000
safety procedures, we don't work with pathogens.

122
0:05:55.376,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You know, if you're working with a pathogen,

123
0:05:58.079,000 --> 0:06:,000
you're not part of the biohacker community,

124
0:06:00.623,000 --> 0:06:03,000
you're part of the bioterrorist community, I'm sorry.

125
0:06:03.776,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And sometimes people ask me,

126
0:06:05.699,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"Well, what about an accident?"

127
0:06:07.586,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Well, working with the safe organisms that we normally

128
0:06:11.144,000 --> 0:06:14,000
work with, the chance of an accident happening

129
0:06:14.503,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with somebody accidentally creating, like,

130
0:06:16.831,000 --> 0:06:17,000
some sort of superbug,

131
0:06:18.477,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that's literally about as probable as a snowstorm

132
0:06:22.727,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in the middle of the Sahara Desert.

133
0:06:24.799,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now, it could happen,

134
0:06:26.153,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but I'm not going to plan my life around it.

135
0:06:30.309,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I've actually chosen to take a different kind of risk.

136
0:06:33.239,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project.

137
0:06:36.351,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's a study at Harvard where, at the end of the study,

138
0:06:38.823,000 --> 0:06:4,000
they're going to take my entire genomic sequence,

139
0:06:41.591,000 --> 0:06:44,000
all of my medical information, and my identity,

140
0:06:45.263,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and they're going to post it online for everyone to see.

141
0:06:49.405,000 --> 0:06:51,000
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about

142
0:06:52.335,000 --> 0:06:53,000
during the informed consent portion.

143
0:06:54.111,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The one I liked the best is,

144
0:06:55.994,000 --> 0:06:58,000
someone could download my sequence, go back to the lab,

145
0:06:59.839,000 --> 0:07:01,000
synthesize some fake Ellen DNA,

146
0:07:02.133,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and plant it at a crime scene. (Laughter)

147
0:07:06.207,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But like DIYbio, the positive outcomes and

148
0:07:10.737,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the potential for good for a study like that

149
0:07:13.883,000 --> 0:07:15,000
far outweighs the risk.

150
0:07:15.935,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, you might be asking yourself,

151
0:07:18.336,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Well, you know, what would I do in a biolab?"

152
0:07:21.773,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Well, it wasn't that long ago we were asking, "Well,

153
0:07:25.102,000 --> 0:07:28,000
what would anyone do with a personal computer?"

154
0:07:28.167,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So this stuff is just beginning.

155
0:07:30.131,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We're only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg.

156
0:07:34.007,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Let me show you what you could do right now.

157
0:07:37.092,000 --> 0:07:4,000
A biohacker in Germany, a journalist, wanted to know

158
0:07:40.927,000 --> 0:07:43,000
whose dog was leaving little presents on his street?

159
0:07:44.161,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

160
0:07:47.071,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Yep, you guessed it. He threw tennis balls

161
0:07:49.777,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to all the neighborhood dogs, analyzed the saliva,

162
0:07:53.039,000 --> 0:07:56,000
identified the dog, and confronted the dog owner.

163
0:07:56.933,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

164
0:08:03.209,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard.

165
0:08:06.513,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Looked like a ladybug, right?

166
0:08:08.453,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It actually is a Japanese beetle.

167
0:08:10.501,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And the same kind of technology --

168
0:08:12.412,000 --> 0:08:14,000
it's called DNA barcoding, it's really cool --

169
0:08:14.496,000 --> 0:08:18,000
You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga,

170
0:08:19.362,000 --> 0:08:22,000
if that sushi is really tuna, or if that goat cheese

171
0:08:22.595,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that you paid so much for is really goat's.

172
0:08:26.009,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In a biohacker space, you can analyze your genome

173
0:08:29.91,000 --> 0:08:3,000
for mutations.

174
0:08:31.202,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO's,

175
0:08:34.426,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and you can explore your ancestry.

176
0:08:37.344,000 --> 0:08:39,000
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere,

177
0:08:39.701,000 --> 0:08:42,000
collect microbes, see what's up there.

178
0:08:43.323,000 --> 0:08:45,000
You can make a biocensor out of yeast

179
0:08:45.754,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to detect pollutants in water.

180
0:08:47.941,000 --> 0:08:5,000
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell.

181
0:08:51.573,000 --> 0:08:53,000
You can do a lot of things.

182
0:08:53.866,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You can also do an art science project. Some of these

183
0:08:57.256,000 --> 0:09:,000
are really spectacular, and they look at social,

184
0:09:00.897,000 --> 0:09:02,000
ecological problems from a completely different perspective.

185
0:09:03.583,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's really cool.

186
0:09:05.145,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Some people ask me, well, why am I involved?

187
0:09:08.163,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science.

188
0:09:12.258,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The thing is, there's something in these labs

189
0:09:14.786,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that they have to offer society that you can't find

190
0:09:17.445,000 --> 0:09:18,000
anywhere else.

191
0:09:19.412,000 --> 0:09:21,000
There's something sacred about a space where

192
0:09:22.09,000 --> 0:09:24,000
you can work on a project, and you don't have to justify

193
0:09:24.602,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to anyone that it's going to make a lot of money,

194
0:09:27.476,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that it's going to save mankind, or even that it's feasible.

195
0:09:30.731,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It just has to follow safety guidelines.

196
0:09:33.658,000 --> 0:09:35,000
If you had spaces like this all over the world,

197
0:09:36.514,000 --> 0:09:38,000
it could really change the perception

198
0:09:38.746,000 --> 0:09:4,000
of who's allowed to do biotech.

199
0:09:41.278,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It's spaces like these that spawned personal computing.

200
0:09:44.97,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Why not personal biotech?

201
0:09:47.386,000 --> 0:09:49,000
If everyone in this room got involved,

202
0:09:49.763,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who knows what we could do?

203
0:09:51.511,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is such a new area, and as we say back in Brooklyn,

204
0:09:55.271,000 --> 0:09:58,000
you ain't seen nothin' yet. (Laughter)

205
0:09:58.551,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

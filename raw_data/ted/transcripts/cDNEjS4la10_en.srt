1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
which are the two primary factors --

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
not the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors --

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely --

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
bordering on the inevitable at this point,

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
whether one is in favor of that or not --

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that politics and religion are, in fact, themselves

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
better conceptualized as kinds of technology,

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and subject to kinds of questions that we regularly consider

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in the space of conceptual design.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Here's what I mean. Politics and --

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
let's focus on the political system in particular question here,

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
which is the system of democracy.

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology

15
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the control and deployment of power.

16
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The famous ones -- despotism is a good one;

18
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to do it in a radically diffused fashion;

20
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and democracy is a set of technologies,

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which have the effect of, in principle,

22
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
diffusing the power source to a large number of people

23
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,

24
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern

25
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
by virtue of what the broader public has done.

26
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, consider religion -- in this case Islam,

27
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which is the religion that, in some direct sense,

28
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.

29
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,

30
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because I think it's a potentially controversial statement.

31
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.

32
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
At the beginning of the Bush administration,

33
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
when President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,

34
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
In fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.

36
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
That's why we heard about the backing away from the Kyoto protocol, for example.

37
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
After 9/11, the tables were turned.

38
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the president decided, with his advisors,

39
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.

40
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
That began with Afghanistan,

41
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,

42
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a decision was made through the technology of democracy --

43
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
again, notice, not a perfect technology --

44
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but through the technology of democracy

45
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war --

46
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
this time, a war in Iraq.

47
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, the reason I begin by saying "no 9/11, no war"

48
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is that we have to acknowledge that Islam,

49
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,

50
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --

51
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --

52
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and as a consequence, at one degree of remove,

53
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.

54
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And I would add that bin Laden and his followers

55
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,

56
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,

57
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the world of Islam as they see and define it.

58
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, how is Islam a technology in this conceptual apparatus?

59
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.

60
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's meant to be a mechanism for construing the universe

61
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in a way that will bring about the salvation of the individual believer,

62
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but it's also meant by the Islamists --

63
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam --

64
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,

65
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
whether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.

66
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Within the sphere of people who have that view,

67
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world

68
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
who disagree with bin Laden in his application,

69
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but agree that Islam is the answer.

70
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Islam represents a way of engaging the world

71
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
through which one can achieve certain desirable goals.

72
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,

73
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
peace, justice and equality,

74
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.

75
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, I don't want to leave a misimpression

76
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
by identifying either of these propositions --

77
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.

78
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.

79
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And I think a good way to prove this

80
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was

81
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.

82
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:

83
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you can't show a picture of democracy.

84
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.

85
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You can show the Capitol --

86
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I had the same problem when I was designing the cover

87
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of my forthcoming book, in fact --

88
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
what do you put on the cover to show democracy?

89
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And the same problem with respect to Islam.

90
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,

91
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.

92
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
That's because these are the kinds of concepts

93
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that are not susceptible to easy representation.

94
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, it follows from that, that they're deeply contestable.

95
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It follows from that that all of the people in the world

96
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
who say that they are Muslims can, in principle,

97
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations

98
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.

99
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
In other words, unlike the word hope,

100
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,

101
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,

102
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
these are essentially contested concepts.

103
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.

104
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And as a consequence of this disagreement,

105
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it's very, very difficult for anyone to say,

106
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"I have the right version of Islam."

107
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon

108
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."

109
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Well, so says George W. Bush.

110
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Other people would say it means something else.

111
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Some people would say that Islam means submission.

112
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Other people would say it means an acknowledgement

113
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or recognition of God's sovereignty.

114
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.

115
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.

116
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections.

117
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Other people say no, that's not enough,

118
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
there have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.

119
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
These are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,

120
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"Ah ha, I looked in the right place, and I found out what these concepts mean."

121
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now, if Islam and democracy are at present

122
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in a moment of great confrontation,

123
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
what does that mean?

124
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Well, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.

125
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,

126
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which was fear.

127
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner

128
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die

129
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
as a consequence of this confrontation --

130
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a confrontation which many, many people

131
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in the Muslim world do not want,

132
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
many, many people in the American democracy do not want,

133
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
many people elsewhere in the world do not want,

134
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people --

135
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
at least in the relevant space, which is the United States --

136
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.

137
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.

138
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
What I want to suggest to you, though, in the next couple of minutes

139
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is that there's also a hopeful response to this.

140
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing

141
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that Islam and democracy are technologies.

142
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.

143
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And they're manipulable in ways

144
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that can produce some extremely positive outcomes.

145
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What do I have in mind?

146
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people

147
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,

148
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,

149
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or just a source of powerful personal identity,

150
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy

151
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.

152
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And these Muslims -- and it's the vast majority of Muslims --

153
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.

154
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And they furthermore think overwhelmingly --

155
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
again one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,

156
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and one can find this by reading any of the sources

157
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that they have produced, and they're all over the Internet

158
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they're saying

159
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves

160
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to have choice in the spheres of personal life,

161
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,

162
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and, yes, in the sphere of religion,

163
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.

164
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And many of these Muslims further say

165
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that their disagreement with the United States

166
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is that it, in the past and still in the present,

167
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world

168
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in order to promote America's short-term interests.

169
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, during the Cold War, that may have been

170
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
a defensible position for the United States to take.

171
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That's an academic question.

172
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,

173
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.

174
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,

175
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.

176
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But now that the Cold War is over,

177
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world --

178
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and pretty close to the same here in the United States,

179
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if you talk to people and ask them --

180
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.

181
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And we see this among activist, practical Muslims,

182
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
like the Muslims who are presently the elected,

183
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
parliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,

184
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
who are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,

185
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who are promoting their own religious values,

186
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
who are elected by their own people

187
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because they were perceived as honest and sincere

188
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because of their religious values,

189
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance

190
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
are fundamentally incompatible.

191
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now, you may say, but surely, what we've seen on television about Saudi Islam

192
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible

193
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
with what we consider the core of democracy --

194
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.

195
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But I'm here to tell you that technologies

196
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
are more malleable than that.

197
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe --

198
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say

199
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,

200
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty

201
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and basic human equality before God,

202
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.

203
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.

204
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.

205
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.

206
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.

207
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So, for example, a group of young activists in Egypt

208
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
try to form a party known as the Center Party,

209
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.

210
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They weren't even allowed to form a party.

211
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
They were actually blocked from even forming a party

212
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
under the political system there. Why?

213
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Because they would have done extraordinarily well.

214
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In the most recent elections in the Muslim world --

215
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
which are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco

216
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and those in Turkey -- in each case,

217
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats

218
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
were far and away the most successful vote-getters

219
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
every place they were allowed to run freely.

220
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race

221
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but they were only allowed to contest half the seats.

222
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So had they contested a larger number of the seats,

223
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
they would have done even better.

224
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case

225
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.

226
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims --

227
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
who care very, very deeply about their traditions,

228
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
who do not want to compromise those values --

229
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy

230
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,

231
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that these two ideas can work together.

232
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now what would that look like?

233
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?

234
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical

235
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to democracy as we know it in the United States.

236
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
That may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today --

237
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
for example, in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces.

238
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,

239
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
or Muslims out in the rest of the world --

240
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are --

241
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
conceptualize Islam.

242
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It will be transformative of Islam as well.

243
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And as a result of this convergence,

244
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,

245
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash

246
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
of Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing --

247
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing --

248
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we'll in fact have close compatibility.

249
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now, I began with the war because it's the elephant in the room,

250
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war

251
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
if you're talking about these issues.

252
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing

253
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,

254
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
many Muslims will conclude that the United States

255
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is not the kind of place that they want to emulate

256
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
with respect to its forms of political government.

257
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
On the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,

258
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
swept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think

259
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that Islam is the enemy somehow --

260
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.

261
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And even though, for political tactical reasons,

262
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
the president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,

263
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
nonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war

264
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to think of the other side as an enemy.

265
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,

266
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in defining who that enemy is.

267
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So the risks are very great.

268
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
On the other hand, the capacities for positive results in the aftermath of a war

269
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
are also not to be underestimated,

270
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
even by, and I would say especially by, people

271
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.

272
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,

273
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
it cannot be the right strategy,

274
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,

275
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,

276
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
because we opposed the war in the first place."

277
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
That's not the way human circumstances operate.

278
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
You face the circumstances you have in front of you

279
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and you go forward.

280
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Well, what I'm here to say then is,

281
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
for people who are skeptical about the war,

282
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war

283
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
there is a possibility for the government of the United States

284
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts

285
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to create real forms of government that are truly democratic

286
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and also truly Islamic.

287
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical, activist way --

288
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
for people who care about these issues to make sure

289
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that within the technology of democracy, in this system,

290
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
they exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices

291
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to encourage that outcome.

292
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
That's a hopeful message,

293
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it

294
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
as incurring serious obligation for all of us.

295
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,

296
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
but only if we put what we can into it.

297
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.

298
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Thanks.

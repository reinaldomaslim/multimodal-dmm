1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Is there life beyond Earth in our solar system?

2
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Wow, what a powerful question.

3
0:00:20.96,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You know, as a scientist --

4
0:00:22.68,000 --> 0:00:23,000
planetary scientist --

5
0:00:23.92,000 --> 0:00:26,000
we really didn't take that very seriously until recently.

6
0:00:28.4,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Carl Sagan always said,

7
0:00:30.52,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"It takes extraordinary evidence for extraordinary claims."

8
0:00:36.96,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And the claims of having life beyond Earth

9
0:00:41.24,000 --> 0:00:43,000
need to be definitive,

10
0:00:43.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
they need to be loud

11
0:00:45.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they need to be everywhere for us to be able to believe it.

12
0:00:50.76,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So how do we make this journey?

13
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
What we decided to do

14
0:00:55.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is first look for those ingredients for life.

15
0:01:00.68,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The ingredients of life are:

16
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:03,000
liquid water --

17
0:01:04.2,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we have to have a solvent,

18
0:01:05.92,000 --> 0:01:07,000
can't be ice, has to be liquid.

19
0:01:08.8,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We also have to have energy.

20
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We also have to have organic material --

21
0:01:13.8,000 --> 0:01:15,000
things that make us up,

22
0:01:16.12,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but also things that we need to consume.

23
0:01:19.6,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So we have to have these elements

24
0:01:22.44,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in environments for long periods of time

25
0:01:25.28,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for us to be able to be confident that life,

26
0:01:28.84,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in that moment when it starts,

27
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
can spark and then grow and evolve.

28
0:01:35.08,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Well, I have to tell you that early in my career,

29
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:41,000
when we looked at those three elements,

30
0:01:41.8,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I didn't believe that they were beyond Earth

31
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in any length of time and for any real quantity.

32
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Why? We look at the inner planets.

33
0:01:50.48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Venus is way too hot -- it's got no water.

34
0:01:53.48,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Mars -- dry and arid.

35
0:01:55.52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It's got no water.

36
0:01:57.08,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And beyond Mars,

37
0:01:58.88,000 --> 0:02:,000
the water in the solar system is all frozen.

38
0:02:03.12,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But recent observations have changed all that.

39
0:02:07.28,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's now turning our attention to the right places

40
0:02:11.2,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for us to take a deeper look

41
0:02:13.76,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and really start to answer our life question.

42
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So when we look out into the solar system,

43
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:22,000
where are the possibilities?

44
0:02:23.2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We're concentrating our attention on four locations.

45
0:02:27.32,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The planet Mars

46
0:02:29.44,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and then three moons of the outer planets:

47
0:02:33.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Titan, Europa and small Enceladus.

48
0:02:38.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So what about Mars?

49
0:02:40.64,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Let's go through the evidence.

50
0:02:43.88,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Well, Mars we thought was initially moon-like:

51
0:02:47.48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
full of craters, arid and a dead world.

52
0:02:52.88,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And so about 15 years ago,

53
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we started a series of missions to go to Mars

54
0:02:58.76,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and see if water existed on Mars in its past

55
0:03:03.4,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that changed its geology.

56
0:03:05.68,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We ought to be able to notice that.

57
0:03:08.04,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And indeed we started to be surprised right away.

58
0:03:11.52,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Our higher resolution images show deltas and river valleys and gulleys

59
0:03:16.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that were there in the past.

60
0:03:19.32,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And in fact,

61
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Curiosity --

62
0:03:21.8,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which has been roving on the surface now for about three years --

63
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
has really shown us that it's sitting in an ancient river bed,

64
0:03:31.32,000 --> 0:03:33,000
where water flowed rapidly.

65
0:03:34.28,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And not for a little while,

66
0:03:35.76,000 --> 0:03:37,000
perhaps hundreds of millions of years.

67
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And if everything was there,

68
0:03:40.44,000 --> 0:03:41,000
including organics,

69
0:03:41.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
perhaps life had started.

70
0:03:43.68,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Curiosity has also drilled in that red soil

71
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and brought up other material.

72
0:03:48.6,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And we were really excited when we saw that.

73
0:03:51.28,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Because it wasn't red Mars,

74
0:03:53.32,000 --> 0:03:54,000
it was gray material,

75
0:03:54.96,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it's gray Mars.

76
0:03:56.28,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We brought it into the rover,

77
0:03:57.76,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we tasted it,

78
0:03:59.4,000 --> 0:04:,000
and guess what?

79
0:04:00.88,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We tasted organics --

80
0:04:02.92,000 --> 0:04:04,000
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,

81
0:04:05.32,000 --> 0:04:07,000
nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur --

82
0:04:07.84,000 --> 0:04:08,000
they were all there.

83
0:04:09.24,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So Mars in its past,

84
0:04:11.76,000 --> 0:04:12,000
with a lot of water,

85
0:04:13.12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
perhaps plenty of time,

86
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
could have had life,

87
0:04:16.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
could have had that spark,

88
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
could have grown.

89
0:04:20.32,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And is that life still there?

90
0:04:22.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We don't know that.

91
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But a few years ago

92
0:04:26.08,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we started to look at a number of craters.

93
0:04:29.44,000 --> 0:04:3,000
During the summer,

94
0:04:30.68,000 --> 0:04:34,000
dark lines would appear down the sides of these craters.

95
0:04:34.72,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The more we looked,

96
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the more craters we saw,

97
0:04:37.48,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the more of these features.

98
0:04:38.84,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We now know more than a dozen of them.

99
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
A few months ago the fairy tale came true.

100
0:04:46.56,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We announced to the world that we know what these streaks are.

101
0:04:50.68,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's liquid water.

102
0:04:53.04,000 --> 0:04:56,000
These craters are weeping during the summer.

103
0:04:56.6,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Liquid water is flowing down these craters.

104
0:05:00.56,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So what are we going to do now --

105
0:05:02.32,000 --> 0:05:03,000
now that we see the water?

106
0:05:04.4,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Well, it tells us that Mars has all the ingredients necessary for life.

107
0:05:09.76,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In its past it had perhaps two-thirds of its northern hemisphere --

108
0:05:14.36,000 --> 0:05:15,000
there was an ocean.

109
0:05:15.88,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It has weeping water right now.

110
0:05:17.8,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Liquid water on its surface.

111
0:05:19.6,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It has organics.

112
0:05:21.24,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It has all the right conditions.

113
0:05:24.103,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So what are we going to do next?

114
0:05:26.04,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We're going to launch a series of missions

115
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to begin that search for life on Mars.

116
0:05:32.28,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And now it's more appealing than ever before.

117
0:05:35.68,000 --> 0:05:37,000
As we move out into the solar system,

118
0:05:38.32,000 --> 0:05:4,000
here's the tiny moon Enceladus.

119
0:05:41.32,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is not in what we call the traditional habitable zone,

120
0:05:44.72,000 --> 0:05:46,000
this area around the sun.

121
0:05:46.96,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is much further out.

122
0:05:48.84,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This object should be ice over a silicate core.

123
0:05:54.2,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But what did we find?

124
0:05:55.84,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Cassini was there since 2006,

125
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and after a couple years looked back after it flew by Enceladus

126
0:06:03.2,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and surprised us all.

127
0:06:04.92,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Enceladus is blasting sheets of water out into the solar system

128
0:06:10.72,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and sloshing back down onto the moon.

129
0:06:13.68,000 --> 0:06:15,000
What a fabulous environment.

130
0:06:15.96,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Cassini just a few months ago also flew through the plume,

131
0:06:20.8,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and it measured silicate particles.

132
0:06:23.72,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Where does the silica come from?

133
0:06:25.68,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It must come from the ocean floor.

134
0:06:28.8,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The tidal energy is generated by Saturn,

135
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:33,000
pulling and squeezing this moon --

136
0:06:34.12,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is melting that ice,

137
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
creating an ocean.

138
0:06:37.28,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But it's also doing that to the core.

139
0:06:40.28,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Now, the only thing that we can think of

140
0:06:42.48,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that does that here on Earth as an analogy ...

141
0:06:46.04,000 --> 0:06:48,000
are hydrothermal vents.

142
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Hydrothermal vents deep in our ocean were discovered in 1977.

143
0:06:55.08,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Oceanographers were completely surprised.

144
0:06:58.56,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And now there are thousands of these below the ocean.

145
0:07:03.2,000 --> 0:07:04,000
What do we find?

146
0:07:04.48,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The oceanographers, when they go and look at these hydrothermal vents,

147
0:07:07.84,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they're teeming with life,

148
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
regardless of whether the water is acidic or alkaline --

149
0:07:13.72,000 --> 0:07:14,000
doesn't matter.

150
0:07:15.28,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So hydrothermal vents are a fabulous abode for life here on Earth.

151
0:07:20.76,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So what about Enceladus?

152
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Well, we believe because it has water

153
0:07:26.08,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and has had it for a significant period of time,

154
0:07:29.56,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and we believe it has hydrothermal vents

155
0:07:33.4,000 --> 0:07:35,000
with perhaps the right organic material,

156
0:07:36.48,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it is a place where life could exist.

157
0:07:40.64,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And not just microbial --

158
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:46,000
maybe more complex because it's had time to evolve.

159
0:07:47.92,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Another moon, very similar,

160
0:07:50.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is Europa.

161
0:07:52.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Galileo visited Jupiter's system in 1996

162
0:07:58.04,000 --> 0:08:,000
and made fabulous observations of Europa.

163
0:08:01.6,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Europa, we also know, has an under-the-ice crust ocean.

164
0:08:06.88,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Galileo mission told us that, but we never saw any plumes.

165
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But we didn't look for them.

166
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Hubble,

167
0:08:14.96,000 --> 0:08:15,000
just a couple years ago,

168
0:08:16.8,000 --> 0:08:18,000
observing Europa,

169
0:08:19.8,000 --> 0:08:2,000
saw plumes of water

170
0:08:21.36,000 --> 0:08:23,000
spraying from the cracks in the southern hemisphere,

171
0:08:24.36,000 --> 0:08:27,000
just exactly like Enceladus.

172
0:08:29.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
These moons,

173
0:08:31.48,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which are not in what we call a traditional habitable zone,

174
0:08:35.28,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that are out in the solar system,

175
0:08:37.28,000 --> 0:08:38,000
have liquid water.

176
0:08:39.08,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And if there are organics there,

177
0:08:41.08,000 --> 0:08:42,000
there may be life.

178
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This is a fabulous set of discoveries

179
0:08:45.799,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because these moons have been in this environment like that

180
0:08:50.039,000 --> 0:08:52,000
for billions of years.

181
0:08:53.12,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Life started here on Earth, we believe, after about the first 500 million,

182
0:08:58.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and look where we are.

183
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:03,000
These moons are fabulous moons.

184
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Another moon that we're looking at is Titan.

185
0:09:08.64,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Titan is a huge moon of Saturn.

186
0:09:10.76,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It perhaps is much larger than the planet Mercury.

187
0:09:14.92,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It has an extensive atmosphere.

188
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It's so extensive --

189
0:09:18.64,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and it's mostly nitrogen with a little methane and ethane --

190
0:09:23.24,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that you have to peer through it with radar.

191
0:09:25.68,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And on the surface, Cassini has found liquid.

192
0:09:29.88,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We see lakes ...

193
0:09:32.2,000 --> 0:09:36,000
actually almost the size of our Black Sea in some places.

194
0:09:36.32,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And this area is not liquid water;

195
0:09:39.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it's methane.

196
0:09:41.92,000 --> 0:09:46,000
If there's any place in the solar system where life is not like us,

197
0:09:47.76,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where the substitute of water is another solvent --

198
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and it could be methane --

199
0:09:52.04,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it could be Titan.

200
0:09:54.56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Well, is there life beyond Earth in the solar system?

201
0:09:58.92,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We don't know yet,

202
0:10:00.2,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but we're hot on the pursuit.

203
0:10:02.28,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The data that we're receiving is really exciting

204
0:10:04.92,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and telling us --

205
0:10:06.32,000 --> 0:10:09,000
forcing us to think about this in new and exciting ways.

206
0:10:10.8,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I believe we're on the right track.

207
0:10:13.28,000 --> 0:10:16,000
That in the next 10 years, we will answer that question.

208
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And if we answer it,

209
0:10:19.12,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and it's positive,

210
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:24,000
then life is everywhere in the solar system.

211
0:10:25.72,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Just think about that.

212
0:10:27.6,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We may not be alone.

213
0:10:30.24,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Thank you.

214
0:10:31.48,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Applause)

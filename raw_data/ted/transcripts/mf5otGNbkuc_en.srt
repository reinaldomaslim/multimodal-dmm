1
0:00:13.525,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to start with a game. Okay?

2
0:00:16.175,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And to win this game,

3
0:00:18.594,000 --> 0:00:2,000
all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you

4
0:00:21.507,000 --> 0:00:22,000
as it really is, all right?

5
0:00:23.523,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So we have two panels here, of colored dots.

6
0:00:27.006,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And one of those dots is the same in the two panels.

7
0:00:33.53,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And you have to tell me which one.

8
0:00:35.602,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now, I narrowed it down

9
0:00:37.074,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to the gray one, the green one, and, say, the orange one.

10
0:00:41.769,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So by a show of hands, we'll start with the easiest one.

11
0:00:44.856,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Show of hands: how many people think it's the gray one?

12
0:00:48.594,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Really? Okay.

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
How many people think it's the green one?

14
0:00:54.737,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And how many people think it's the orange one?

15
0:00:59.035,000 --> 0:01:,000
Pretty even split.

16
0:01:02.483,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Let's find out what the reality is.

17
0:01:04.774,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Here is the orange one.

18
0:01:07.873,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Here is the green one.

20
0:01:13.372,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And here is the gray one.

21
0:01:16.872,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So for all of you who saw that, you're complete realists.

23
0:01:23.428,000 --> 0:01:24,000
All right?

24
0:01:24.625,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So this is pretty amazing, isn't it?

26
0:01:27.955,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Because nearly every living system

27
0:01:29.781,000 --> 0:01:32,000
has evolved the ability to detect light in one way or another.

28
0:01:33.713,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So for us, seeing color

29
0:01:35.578,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is one of the simplest things the brain does.

30
0:01:37.912,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And yet, even at this most fundamental level,

31
0:01:40.737,000 --> 0:01:42,000
context is everything.

32
0:01:43.38,000 --> 0:01:46,000
What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything,

33
0:01:46.585,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but why context is everything.

34
0:01:48.634,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Because it's answering that question

35
0:01:50.874,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that tells us not only why we see what we do,

36
0:01:54.442,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but who we are as individuals,

37
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and who we are as a society.

38
0:01:59.649,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But first, we have to ask another question,

39
0:02:01.736,000 --> 0:02:02,000
which is, "What is color for?"

40
0:02:03.268,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And instead of telling you, I'll just show you.

41
0:02:05.507,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What you see here is a jungle scene,

42
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and you see the surfaces according to the amount of light

43
0:02:10.968,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that those surfaces reflect.

44
0:02:12.657,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you?

45
0:02:17.064,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And if you haven't seen it yet, you're dead, right?

46
0:02:20.112,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:21.137,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Can anyone see it? Anyone? No?

48
0:02:23.499,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now let's see the surfaces

49
0:02:24.992,000 --> 0:02:26,000
according to the quality of light that they reflect.

50
0:02:27.87,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And now you see it.

51
0:02:30.489,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So, color enables us to see

52
0:02:32.778,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the similarities and differences between surfaces,

53
0:02:35.228,000 --> 0:02:38,000
according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect.

54
0:02:38.298,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But what you've just done

55
0:02:39.783,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is in many respects mathematically impossible.

56
0:02:42.847,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Why?

57
0:02:44.118,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Because, as Berkeley tells us,

58
0:02:45.572,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we have no direct access to our physical world,

59
0:02:48.159,000 --> 0:02:49,000
other than through our senses.

60
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And the light that falls onto our eyes

61
0:02:51.999,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is determined by multiple things in the world,

62
0:02:54.285,000 --> 0:02:55,000
not only the color of objects,

63
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but also the color of their illumination,

64
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
and the color of the space between us and those objects.

65
0:03:00.993,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You vary any one of those parameters,

66
0:03:03.27,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and you'll change the color of the light that falls onto your eye.

67
0:03:08.308,000 --> 0:03:09,000
This is a huge problem,

68
0:03:09.516,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because it means that the same image

69
0:03:12.509,000 --> 0:03:15,000
could have an infinite number of possible real-world sources.

70
0:03:16.054,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Let me show you what I mean.

71
0:03:17.419,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Imagine that this is the back of your eye, okay?

72
0:03:20.276,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And these are two projections from the world.

73
0:03:22.8,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They're identical in every single way.

74
0:03:25.287,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Identical in shape, size, spectral content.

75
0:03:29.343,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They are the same, as far as your eye is concerned.

76
0:03:33.158,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And yet they come from completely different sources.

77
0:03:38.38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The one on the right comes from a yellow surface,

78
0:03:42.905,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in shadow, oriented facing the left,

79
0:03:45.334,000 --> 0:03:47,000
viewed through a pinkish medium.

80
0:03:48.23,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The one on the left comes from an orange surface,

81
0:03:51.498,000 --> 0:03:53,000
under direct light, facing to the right,

82
0:03:53.705,000 --> 0:03:54,000
viewed through sort of a bluish medium.

83
0:03:55.713,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Completely different meanings,

84
0:03:57.912,000 --> 0:04:,000
giving rise to the exact same retinal information.

85
0:04:01.213,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And yet it's only the retinal information that we get.

86
0:04:05.24,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So how on Earth do we even see?

87
0:04:08.546,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes,

88
0:04:11.777,000 --> 0:04:12,000
remember this:

89
0:04:13.047,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that the light that falls onto your eye,

90
0:04:15.013,000 --> 0:04:17,000
sensory information, is meaningless,

91
0:04:17.46,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because it could mean literally anything.

92
0:04:20.158,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And what's true for sensory information is true for information generally.

93
0:04:23.727,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There's no inherent meaning in information.

94
0:04:25.784,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's what we do with that information that matters.

95
0:04:28.895,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, how do we see? Well, we see by learning to see.

96
0:04:32.642,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns,

97
0:04:36.205,000 --> 0:04:38,000
finding relationships in information,

98
0:04:38.269,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and associating those relationships with a behavioral meaning,

99
0:04:42.491,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a significance, by interacting with the world.

100
0:04:45.38,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We're very aware of this

101
0:04:47.159,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in the form of more cognitive attributes, like language.

102
0:04:50.012,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'm going to give you some letter strings,

103
0:04:52.069,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I want you to read them out for me, if you can.

104
0:04:54.586,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Audience: "Can you read this?"

105
0:04:57.092,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"You are not reading this."

106
0:04:59.59,000 --> 0:05:,000
"What are you reading?"

107
0:05:01.06,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Beau Lotto: "What are you reading?" Half the letters are missing, right?

108
0:05:04.468,000 --> 0:05:05,000
There's no a priori reason

109
0:05:05.801,000 --> 0:05:07,000
why an "H" has to go between that "W" and "A."

110
0:05:08.317,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But you put one there. Why?

111
0:05:09.896,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Because in the statistics of your past experience,

112
0:05:12.276,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it would have been useful to do so.

113
0:05:13.994,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So you do so again.

114
0:05:15.459,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And yet you don't put a letter after that first "T."

115
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Why? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past.

116
0:05:21.048,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So you don't do it again.

117
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So, let me show you how quickly our brains can redefine normality,

118
0:05:27.053,000 --> 0:05:29,000
even at the simplest thing the brain does, which is color.

119
0:05:29.807,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So if I could have the lights down up here.

120
0:05:32.465,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I want you to first notice that those two desert scenes are physically the same.

121
0:05:36.288,000 --> 0:05:38,000
One is simply the flipping of the other.

122
0:05:40.244,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now I want you to look at that dot

123
0:05:42.578,000 --> 0:05:44,000
between the green and the red.

124
0:05:45.159,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else.

125
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We're going to look at it for about 30 seconds,

126
0:05:50.39,000 --> 0:05:52,000
which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk.

127
0:05:52.856,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:54.173,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But I really want you to learn.

129
0:05:55.791,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I'll tell you -- don't look anywhere else --

130
0:05:58.116,000 --> 0:06:,000
I'll tell you what's happening in your head.

131
0:06:00.195,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Your brain is learning,

132
0:06:01.486,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and it's learning that the right side of its visual field

133
0:06:04.238,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is under red illumination;

134
0:06:05.555,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the left side of its visual field is under green illumination.

135
0:06:08.506,000 --> 0:06:1,000
That's what it's learning. Okay?

136
0:06:11.416,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.

137
0:06:16.119,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So why don't you do that now?

138
0:06:18.158,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:21.542,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Can I have the lights up again?

140
0:06:23.469,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I take it from your response they don't look the same anymore, right?

141
0:06:26.959,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Applause)

142
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Why? Because your brain is seeing that same information

143
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
as if the right one is still under red light,

144
0:06:33.871,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the left one is still under green light.

145
0:06:36.053,000 --> 0:06:37,000
That's your new normal.

146
0:06:37.442,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Okay? So, what does this mean for context?

147
0:06:39.472,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It means I can take two identical squares,

148
0:06:41.83,000 --> 0:06:42,000
put them in light and dark surrounds,

149
0:06:43.674,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and the one on the dark surround looks lighter than on the light surround.

150
0:06:47.183,000 --> 0:06:5,000
What's significant is not simply the light and dark surrounds that matter.

151
0:06:50.791,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's what those light and dark surrounds meant for your behavior in the past.

152
0:06:54.46,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So I'll show you what I mean.

153
0:06:55.881,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Here we have that exact same illusion.

154
0:06:57.888,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We have two identical tiles on the left,

155
0:07:00.038,000 --> 0:07:02,000
one in a dark surround, one in a light surround.

156
0:07:02.348,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And the same thing over on the right.

157
0:07:04.451,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, I'll reveal those two scenes,

158
0:07:07.326,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but I'm not going to change anything within those boxes,

159
0:07:10.018,000 --> 0:07:11,000
except their meaning.

160
0:07:11.193,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And see what happens to your perception.

161
0:07:13.53,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Notice that on the left

162
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the two tiles look nearly completely opposite:

163
0:07:17.949,000 --> 0:07:2,000
one very white and one very dark, right?

164
0:07:21.064,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Whereas on the right, the two tiles look nearly the same.

165
0:07:24.363,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And yet there is still one on a dark surround,

166
0:07:26.625,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and one on a light surround.

167
0:07:28.014,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Why?

168
0:07:29.189,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow,

169
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye

170
0:07:35.613,000 --> 0:07:36,000
as the one outside the shadow,

171
0:07:37.405,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics.

172
0:07:40.826,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So you see it that way.

173
0:07:42.368,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Whereas on the right, the information is consistent

174
0:07:45.05,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with those two tiles being under the same light.

175
0:07:47.757,000 --> 0:07:5,000
If they're under the same light reflecting the same amount of light to your eye,

176
0:07:51.614,000 --> 0:07:52,000
then they must be equally reflective.

177
0:07:53.423,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So you see it that way.

178
0:07:54.71,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Which means we can bring all this information together

179
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to create some incredibly strong illusions.

180
0:07:59.332,000 --> 0:08:,000
This is one I made a few years ago.

181
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top,

182
0:08:04.497,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and a bright orange tile at the side.

183
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:08,000
That is your perceptual reality.

184
0:08:08.754,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The physical reality is that those two tiles are the same.

185
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Here you see four gray tiles on your left,

186
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
seven gray tiles on the right.

187
0:08:19.696,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I'm not going to change those tiles at all,

188
0:08:21.777,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but I'm going to reveal the rest of the scene.

189
0:08:23.968,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And see what happens to your perception.

190
0:08:26.521,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The four blue tiles on the left are gray.

191
0:08:30.054,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The seven yellow tiles on the right are also gray.

192
0:08:33.731,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They are the same. Okay?

193
0:08:35.636,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.

194
0:08:39.558,000 --> 0:08:43,000
What's true for color is also true for complex perceptions of motion.

195
0:08:43.836,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So, here we have --

196
0:08:46.669,000 --> 0:08:49,000
let's turn this around -- a diamond.

197
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And what I'm going to do is, I'm going to hold it here,

198
0:08:53.804,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and I'm going to spin it.

199
0:08:56.991,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.

200
0:09:00.159,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now I want you to keep looking at it.

201
0:09:02.795,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.

202
0:09:05.319,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.

203
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?

204
0:09:12.356,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Keep blinking.

205
0:09:13.587,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Every time you blink, it will switch.

206
0:09:16.196,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So I can ask you, which direction is it rotating?

207
0:09:20.317,000 --> 0:09:21,000
How do you know?

208
0:09:22.3,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Your brain doesn't know, because both are equally likely.

209
0:09:25.434,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So depending on where it looks,

210
0:09:26.996,000 --> 0:09:29,000
it flips between the two possibilities.

211
0:09:30.349,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Are we the only ones that see illusions?

212
0:09:32.297,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The answer to this question is no.

213
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Even the beautiful bumblebee,

214
0:09:35.903,000 --> 0:09:37,000
with its mere one million brain cells,

215
0:09:38.801,000 --> 0:09:41,000
which is 250 times fewer cells than you have in one retina,

216
0:09:41.84,000 --> 0:09:43,000
sees illusions, does the most complicated things

217
0:09:44.692,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that even our most sophisticated computers can't do.

218
0:09:47.501,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So in my lab we work on bumblebees,

219
0:09:49.381,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because we can completely control their experience,

220
0:09:51.894,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and see how it alters the architecture of their brain.

221
0:09:54.451,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.

222
0:09:56.576,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Here you have the hive.

223
0:09:57.874,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You can see the queen bee, the large bee in the middle.

224
0:10:00.493,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Those are her daughters, the eggs.

225
0:10:02.143,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They go back and forth between this hive and the arena, via this tube.

226
0:10:09.002,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You'll see one of the bees come out here.

227
0:10:11.613,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You see how she has a little number on her?

228
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There's another one coming out, she also has a number on her.

229
0:10:17.585,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, they're not born that way, right?

230
0:10:19.88,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We pull them out, put them in the fridge, and they fall asleep.

231
0:10:22.919,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Then you can superglue little numbers on them.

232
0:10:25.236,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Laughter)

233
0:10:26.443,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And now, in this experiment they get a reward if they go to the blue flowers.

234
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They land on the flower,

235
0:10:31.377,000 --> 0:10:34,000
stick their tongue in there, called a proboscis, and drink sugar water.

236
0:10:34.91,000 --> 0:10:37,000
She's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I,

237
0:10:38.092,000 --> 0:10:41,000
will do that about three times, then fly.

238
0:10:44.066,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue,

239
0:10:46.368,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but to go where the other bees go.

240
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So they copy each other.

241
0:10:49.398,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They can count to five. They can recognize faces.

242
0:10:51.708,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And here she comes down the ladder.

243
0:10:53.693,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot,

244
0:10:56.298,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and throw up, and that's honey.

245
0:10:58.379,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Laughter)

246
0:10:59.554,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now remember, she's supposed to be going to the blue flowers,

247
0:11:04.388,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner?

248
0:11:07.039,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It looks like they're going to green flowers.

249
0:11:09.552,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Now, are they getting it wrong?

250
0:11:12.382,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And the answer to the question is no. Those are actually blue flowers.

251
0:11:15.898,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But those are blue flowers under green light.

252
0:11:19.485,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle,

253
0:11:23.241,000 --> 0:11:25,000
which is exactly what we do.

254
0:11:25.336,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So, illusions are often used,

255
0:11:27.691,000 --> 0:11:3,000
especially in art, in the words of a more contemporary artist,

256
0:11:31.326,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"to demonstrate the fragility of our senses."

257
0:11:33.81,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Okay, this is complete rubbish.

258
0:11:36.158,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The senses aren't fragile. And if they were, we wouldn't be here.

259
0:11:40.132,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Instead, color tells us something completely different,

260
0:11:43.055,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.

261
0:11:46.447,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We can't.

262
0:11:47.682,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Instead, the brain evolved to see the world

263
0:11:50.118,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the way it was useful to see in the past.

264
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And how we see is by continually redefining normality.

265
0:11:59.65,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So, how can we take this incredible capacity of plasticity of the brain

266
0:12:06.546,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and get people to experience their world differently?

267
0:12:09.094,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Well, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio

268
0:12:11.815,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is we translate the light into sound,

269
0:12:15.077,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and we enable people to hear their visual world.

270
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And they can navigate the world using their ears.

271
0:12:22.425,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Here's David on the right, and he's holding a camera.

272
0:12:25.805,000 --> 0:12:26,000
On the left is what his camera sees.

273
0:12:27.559,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And you'll see there's a faint line going across that image.

274
0:12:30.591,000 --> 0:12:32,000
That line is broken up into 32 squares.

275
0:12:33.024,000 --> 0:12:35,000
In each square, we calculate the average color.

276
0:12:35.375,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And then we just simply translate that into sound.

277
0:12:37.78,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And now he's going to turn around,

278
0:12:41.037,000 --> 0:12:43,000
close his eyes,

279
0:12:43.921,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.

280
0:12:47.207,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Continuous sound)

281
0:12:50.164,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Sound changes momentarily)

282
0:12:52.302,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Sound changes momentarily)

283
0:12:55.143,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Sound changes momentarily)

284
0:12:59.58,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Sound changes momentarily)

285
0:13:03.286,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Sound changes momentarily)

286
0:13:05.773,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?

287
0:13:07.738,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So not only can we create a prosthetic for the visually impaired,

288
0:13:10.825,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but we can also investigate

289
0:13:13.332,000 --> 0:13:15,000
how people literally make sense of the world.

290
0:13:16.052,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But we can also do something else.

291
0:13:17.711,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We can also make music with color.

292
0:13:20.823,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So, working with kids,

293
0:13:22.523,000 --> 0:13:23,000
they created images,

294
0:13:24.34,000 --> 0:13:26,000
thinking about what might the images you see

295
0:13:26.48,000 --> 0:13:27,000
sound like if we could listen to them.

296
0:13:28.328,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And then we translated these images.

297
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And this is one of those images.

298
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music

299
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
for a 32-piece orchestra.

300
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And this is what it sounds like.

301
0:13:40.185,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Electronic representation of orchestral music)

302
0:14:06.749,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So, a six-year-old child. Okay?

303
0:14:09.04,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now, what does all this mean?

304
0:14:12.753,000 --> 0:14:16,000
What this suggests is that no one is an outside observer of nature, okay?

305
0:14:17.117,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We're not defined by our central properties,

306
0:14:19.206,000 --> 0:14:2,000
by the bits that make us up.

307
0:14:20.894,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment,

308
0:14:24.592,000 --> 0:14:25,000
by our ecology.

309
0:14:26.268,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And that ecology is necessarily relative, historical and empirical.

310
0:14:34.205,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So, what I'd like to finish with is this over here.

311
0:14:38.49,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Because what I've been trying to do is really celebrate uncertainty.

312
0:14:41.775,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Because I think only through uncertainty is there potential for understanding.

313
0:14:45.56,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So, if some of you are still feeling a bit too certain,

314
0:14:48.452,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I'd like to do this one.

315
0:14:50.018,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So, if we have the lights down.

316
0:14:52.456,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And what we have here --

317
0:14:58.546,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Can everyone see 25 purple surfaces on your left,

318
0:15:03.34,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right?

319
0:15:07.556,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So now, what I want to do,

320
0:15:08.894,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I'm going to put the middle nine surfaces here

321
0:15:11.935,000 --> 0:15:12,000
under yellow illumination,

322
0:15:13.586,000 --> 0:15:15,000
by simply putting a filter behind them.

323
0:15:18.054,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Now you can see that changes the light that's coming through there, right?

324
0:15:22.049,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Because now the light is going through a yellowish filter

325
0:15:25.154,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and then a purplish filter.

326
0:15:26.725,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I'm going to do the opposite on the left here.

327
0:15:31.06,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I'm going to put the middle nine under a purplish light.

328
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Now, some of you will have noticed that the consequence

329
0:15:42.721,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right,

330
0:15:45.808,000 --> 0:15:47,000
or your left, is exactly the same as the light

331
0:15:48.64,000 --> 0:15:5,000
coming through the middle nine on your right.

332
0:15:51.356,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Agreed? Yes?

333
0:15:53.965,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Okay. So they are physically the same.

334
0:15:56.538,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Let's pull the covers off.

335
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now remember --

336
0:16:05.864,000 --> 0:16:08,000
you know that the middle nine are exactly the same.

337
0:16:09.607,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Do they look the same?

338
0:16:12.462,000 --> 0:16:13,000
No.

339
0:16:13.641,000 --> 0:16:14,000
The question is, "Is that an illusion?"

340
0:16:15.62,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And I'll leave you with that.

341
0:16:17.051,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So, thank you very much.

342
0:16:18.28,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Laughter)

343
0:16:19.469,000 --> 0:16:21,000
(Applause)

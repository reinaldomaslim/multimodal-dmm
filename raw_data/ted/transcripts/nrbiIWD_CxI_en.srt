1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My search is always to find ways to chronicle,

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.

3
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,

4
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but that are never sentimental,

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that never look away from the darkest things about us.

6
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
than when we're most ugly.

8
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.

9
0:00:55,000 --> 0:01:,000
As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria

10
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with a whole generation -- in the '80s --

11
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.

12
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.

13
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But what I've come to learn

14
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,

15
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,

16
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
everyday acts of compassion.

17
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.

18
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,

19
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect

20
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
my humanity back at me.

21
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.

22
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it

23
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.

24
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.

25
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic

26
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee

27
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and send emails and make notes.

28
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So what Ubuntu really says

29
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is that there is no way for us to be human without other people.

30
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's really very simple, but really very complicated.

31
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, I thought I should start with some stories.

32
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I should tell you some stories about remarkable people,

33
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
so I thought I'd start with my mother.

34
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And she was dark, too.

36
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
My mother was English.

37
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
My parents met in Oxford in the '50s,

38
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.

39
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
She was five foot two, very feisty and very English.

40
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This is how English my mother is -- or was, she just passed.

41
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,

42
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.

43
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And then we went to a fish restaurant,

45
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,

46
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and he came up and my mother said,

47
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Do you have any specials, young man?"

48
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,

49
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.

50
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's totally rad."

51
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And my mother turned to me and said,

52
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"What language is he speaking?"

53
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I said, "English, mum."

55
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And she shook her head and said,

56
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,

57
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
why don't they use it?"

58
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So, this woman, who converted from the Church of England

60
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to Catholicism when she married my father --

61
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --

62
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,

63
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
particularly among Igbo women,

64
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the Billings ovulation method,

65
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.

66
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But her Igbo wasn't too good.

67
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So she took me along to translate.

68
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I was seven.

69
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So, here are these women,

71
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
who never discuss their period with their husbands,

72
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?"

73
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And, "Do you notice any discharges?"

75
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:07,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And, "How swollen is your vulva?"

77
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
She never would have thought of herself as a feminist,

79
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
my mother, but she always used to say,

80
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"Anything a man can do, I can fix."

81
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Applause)

82
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And when my father complained about this situation,

83
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where she's taking a seven-year-old boy

84
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to teach this birth control, you know,

85
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into --

86
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you're teaching him how to be a woman."

87
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
My mother said, "Someone has to."

88
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This woman -- during the Biafran war,

90
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we were caught in the war.

91
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It was my mother with five little children.

92
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,

93
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.

94
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:06,000
At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers

95
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,

96
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and make him a boy soldier.

97
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman,

98
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
standing up to men with guns who want to kill us?

99
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
All through that one year,

100
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
my mother never cried one time, not once.

101
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,

102
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
about to fly to England,

103
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
this woman saw my mother wearing this dress,

104
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which had been washed so many times it was basically see through,

105
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with five really hungry-looking kids,

106
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
came over and asked her what had happened.

107
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And she told this woman.

108
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And so this woman emptied out her suitcase

109
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,

110
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --

111
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter) --

112
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that was the only time she cried.

113
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,

114
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I asked her, "Why did you cry then?"

115
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And she said, "You know, you can steel your heart

116
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.

117
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger

118
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
will unstitch you."

119
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The old women in my father's village, after this war had happened,

120
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
memorized the names of every dead person,

121
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.

122
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.

123
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And they would sing them only when they planted the rice,

124
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead

125
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
into the rice.

126
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But when it came for harvest time,

127
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
they would sing these joyful songs,

128
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that were made up of the names of every child

129
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
who had been born that year.

130
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,

131
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
they would remove as many names of the dead

132
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that equaled as many people that were born.

133
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,

134
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
beautiful transformation.

135
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Did you know, that before the genocide in Rwanda,

136
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the word for rape and the word for marriage

137
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
was the same one?

138
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.

139
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Did you also know that after apartheid,

140
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
when the new government went into the parliament houses,

141
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
there were no female toilets in the building?

142
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Which would seem to suggest that apartheid

143
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was entirely the business of men.

144
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,

145
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
women are never really counted.

146
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.

147
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:44,000
When I was growing up in Nigeria --

148
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,

149
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --

150
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
there were always rites of passage for young men.

151
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,

152
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that's essentially what it is.

153
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,

154
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
progressing along, so when I turned 13 --

155
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,

156
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
somebody had to kill the animals,

157
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --

158
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:17,000
so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.

159
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,

160
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but I had to do it.

161
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And I was supposed to do this alone.

162
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,

163
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who was significantly older than me,

164
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,

165
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
decided to come with me.

166
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Which sort of made me feel good,

167
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
because he'd seen a lot of things.

168
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me

169
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
stories about how he used to bayonet people,

170
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.

171
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So, this guy comes with me.

172
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --

173
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
they sound like human beings,

174
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that's why we call tragedies "a song of a goat."

175
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:02,000
My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human

176
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
until we started keeping goats.

177
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.

178
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,

179
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,

180
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,

181
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
while I kill the goat.

182
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,

183
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed

184
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
such a quotidian experience,

185
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
still found it in himself to try to protect me.

186
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I was a wimp.

187
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I cried for a very long time.

188
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And afterwards, he didn't say a word.

189
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour.

190
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And then afterwards he said to me,

191
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,

192
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you will die of heartbreak.

193
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Just know that it is enough sometimes

194
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to know that it is difficult."

195
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,

196
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and not in good ways.

197
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So, I was born two days after Christmas.

199
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,

200
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.

201
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,

202
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and we had the Catholic priest over,

203
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
my mother was entertaining him with tea.

204
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And my uncle suddenly says, "Where are Chris' presents?"

205
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And my mother said, "Don't talk about that in front of guests."

206
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,

207
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
so he summoned me up, and he said,

208
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.

209
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Take anything you want out of the suitcase.

210
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's your birthday present."

211
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,

212
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but I found an inflatable sheep.

213
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
So, I blew it up and ran into the living room,

215
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:02,000
my finger where it shouldn't have been,

216
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I was waving this buzzing sheep around,

217
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.

218
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

219
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,

220
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,

221
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish."

222
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

223
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

224
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:41,000
My last days in prison, the last 18 months,

225
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:45,000
my cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --

226
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
my cellmate was 14 years old.

227
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The name was John James,

228
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and in those days, if a family member committed a crime,

229
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the military would hold you as ransom

230
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
till your family turned themselves in.

231
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.

232
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.

233
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
There were some really bad people there.

234
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --

235
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:13,000
"Spiderman" and "X-Men."

236
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:14,000
He was obsessed.

237
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And when he got tired of reading them,

238
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
he started to teach the men in death row how to read,

239
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
with these comic books.

240
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And so, I remember night after night,

241
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,

242
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:33,000
huddled around John James, reciting, "Take that, Spidey!"

243
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Laughter)

244
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's incredible.

245
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I was really worried.

246
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
He didn't know what death row meant.

247
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I'd been there twice,

248
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.

249
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And he would always laugh, and say,

250
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
"Come on, man, we'll make it out."

251
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Then I'd say, "How do you know?"

252
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."

253
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
They killed him.

254
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They handcuffed him to a chair,

255
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,

256
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
then left him there to bleed to death.

257
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:18,000
That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.

258
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:24,000
All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.

259
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:3,000
The Igbo used to say that they built their own gods.

260
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
They would come together as a community,

261
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and they would express a wish.

262
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And their wish would then be brought to a priest,

263
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
who would find a ritual object,

264
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and the appropriate sacrifices would be made,

265
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and the shrine would be built for the god.

266
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,

267
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
the Igbos would destroy the god.

268
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
They would knock down the shrine,

269
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and they would stop saying the god's name.

270
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:02,000
This is how they came to reclaim their humanity.

271
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Every day, all of us here,

272
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we're building gods that have gone rampant,

273
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and it's time we started knocking them down

274
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and forgetting their names.

275
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It doesn't require a tremendous thing.

276
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
All it requires is to recognize among us, every day --

277
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people

278
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
like the ones I've told you.

279
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
There are some of you in this room, amazing people,

280
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:34,000
who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.

281
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.

282
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusi

283
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:47,000
who is in the audience here somewhere.

284
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
"Libation,

285
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
North Carolina, 1999.

286
0:14:54,000 --> 0:15:,000
I offer to this ground, this gin.

287
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I imagine an old man crying here,

288
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:08,000
out of the sight of the overseer.

289
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
He pushes his tongue through a hole

290
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:15,000
where his tooth would be, if he were whole.

291
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
It aches in that space where his tooth would be,

292
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
where his land would be,

293
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:29,000
his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.

294
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:34,000
He wipes sorrow from his face,

295
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,

296
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and tastes the salt.

297
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I call a name that could be his.

298
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
This is for you, old man.

299
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:55,000
This gin, this salty earth."

300
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Thank you.

301
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Applause)

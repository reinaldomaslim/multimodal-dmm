1
0:00:12.769,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I remember one morning when I was in the third grade,

2
0:00:16.239,000 --> 0:00:2,000
my mom sent me to school with a Ghanaian staple dish called "fufu."

3
0:00:20.894,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:22.475,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Fufu is this white ball of starch made of cassava,

5
0:00:26.714,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and it's served with light soup, which is a dark orange color,

6
0:00:31.103,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and contains chicken and/or beef.

7
0:00:33.859,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's a savory, flavorful dish

8
0:00:35.932,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that my mom thought would keep me warm on a cold day.

9
0:00:39.509,000 --> 0:00:41,000
When I got to lunch and I opened my thermos,

10
0:00:42.243,000 --> 0:00:45,000
releasing these new smells into the air,

11
0:00:45.344,000 --> 0:00:47,000
my friends did not react favorably.

12
0:00:47.787,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"What's that?" one of them asked.

14
0:00:52.122,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"It's fufu," I responded.

15
0:00:54.416,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:55.455,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"Ew, that smells funny. What's a fufu?" they asked.

17
0:00:59.642,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Their reaction made me lose my appetite.

18
0:01:02.489,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I begged my mother to never send me to school with fufu again.

19
0:01:06.58,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I asked her to make me sandwiches or chicken noodle soup

20
0:01:10.11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or any of the other foods that my friends were eating.

21
0:01:12.892,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And this is one of the first times

22
0:01:14.63,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I began to notice the distinction between what was unique to my family

23
0:01:20.097,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and what was common for everyone else,

24
0:01:22.73,000 --> 0:01:25,000
what was Ghanaian and what was African

25
0:01:26.584,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and what was American.

26
0:01:28.645,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'm a first-generation American.

27
0:01:30.784,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Both of my parents are immigrants.

28
0:01:32.933,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In fact, my father, Gabriel, came to the US almost 50 years ago.

29
0:01:37.761,000 --> 0:01:38,000
He arrived in New York

30
0:01:39.009,000 --> 0:01:42,000
from a city called Kumasi in a northern region of Ghana,

31
0:01:42.603,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in West Africa.

32
0:01:44.328,000 --> 0:01:47,000
He came for school, earning his bachelor's degree in accounting

33
0:01:47.737,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and eventually became an accountant.

34
0:01:50.246,000 --> 0:01:53,000
My mother, Georgina, joined him years later.

35
0:01:53.762,000 --> 0:01:55,000
She had a love of fashion

36
0:01:55.845,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and worked in a sewing factory in lower Manhattan,

37
0:01:58.896,000 --> 0:02:01,000
until she saved up enough to open her own women's clothing store.

38
0:02:03.527,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I consider myself an American

39
0:02:06.3,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and an African

40
0:02:07.87,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and a Ghanaian.

41
0:02:09.548,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And there's millions of people around the world

42
0:02:11.97,000 --> 0:02:13,000
who are juggling these different classifications.

43
0:02:15.416,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They might be Jamaican-Canadians or Korean-Americans or Nigerian-Brits.

44
0:02:22.146,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But what makes our stories and experiences different

45
0:02:25.212,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is that we were born and raised in a country different than our parents,

46
0:02:30.509,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and this can cause us to be misunderstood

47
0:02:33.682,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when being viewed through a narrow lens.

48
0:02:37.672,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I grew up in New York, which is home to the largest number of immigrants

49
0:02:41.572,000 --> 0:02:42,000
anywhere in the United States.

50
0:02:43.681,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And you would think growing up in a place like New York,

51
0:02:46.648,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it would be easy for a first-generation person to find their place.

52
0:02:50.947,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But all throughout my childhood,

53
0:02:53.153,000 --> 0:02:56,000
there were these moments that formed my understanding

54
0:02:56.607,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of the different worlds I belonged to.

55
0:02:59.522,000 --> 0:03:01,000
When I was in the fifth grade, a student asked me

56
0:03:02.365,000 --> 0:03:04,000
if my family was refugees.

57
0:03:05.386,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I didn't know what that word meant.

58
0:03:07.68,000 --> 0:03:09,000
He explained to me that his parents told him

59
0:03:09.966,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that refugees are people from Africa who come to the US

60
0:03:14.01,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to escape death, starvation and disease.

61
0:03:17.452,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So I asked my parents, and they laughed a bit,

62
0:03:20.892,000 --> 0:03:23,000
not because it was funny but because it was a generalization.

63
0:03:24.382,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And they assured me that they had enough to eat in Ghana

64
0:03:27.323,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and came to the US willingly.

65
0:03:29.787,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:31.34,000 --> 0:03:34,000
These questions became more complex as I got older.

67
0:03:34.719,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Junior high school was the first time

68
0:03:36.57,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I went to school with a large number of black American students,

69
0:03:40.845,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and many of them couldn't understand why I sounded differently than they did

70
0:03:44.573,000 --> 0:03:47,000
or why my parents seemed different than theirs.

71
0:03:48.336,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Are you even black?" a student asked.

72
0:03:51.788,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I mean, I thought I was black.

73
0:03:53.298,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:54.972,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I thought my skin complexion settled that.

75
0:03:57.498,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:58.729,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I asked my father about it, and he shared his own confusion

77
0:04:01.869,000 --> 0:04:04,000
over the significance of that when he first came to the US.

78
0:04:06.806,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He explained to me that, when he was in Ghana, everyone was black,

79
0:04:10.027,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so he never thought about it.

80
0:04:12.768,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But in the US, it's a thing.

81
0:04:14.476,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:16.642,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But he would say, "But you're African.

83
0:04:19.729,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Remember that."

84
0:04:21.086,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And he would emphasize this,

85
0:04:22.622,000 --> 0:04:26,000
even though many Africans in the continent would only consider me to be

86
0:04:27.241,000 --> 0:04:28,000
just an American.

87
0:04:29.584,000 --> 0:04:32,000
These misconceptions and complex cultural issues

88
0:04:32.969,000 --> 0:04:34,000
are not just the inquiries of children.

89
0:04:35.141,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Adults don't know who immigrants are.

90
0:04:38.016,000 --> 0:04:4,000
If we look at current trends,

91
0:04:40.144,000 --> 0:04:42,000
if I asked you: What's the fastest-growing

92
0:04:42.811,000 --> 0:04:44,000
immigrant demographic in the United States,

93
0:04:45.415,000 --> 0:04:46,000
who would you think it was?

94
0:04:47.249,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Nine out of 10 people tell me it's Latinos,

95
0:04:49.661,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but it's actually African immigrants.

96
0:04:52.341,000 --> 0:04:53,000
How about in academics?

97
0:04:54.329,000 --> 0:04:56,000
What's the most educated immigrant demographic?

98
0:04:57.754,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A lot of people presume it to be Asians, but it's actually African immigrants.

99
0:05:02.017,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Even in matters of policy,

100
0:05:04.176,000 --> 0:05:06,000
did you know that three out of the eight countries

101
0:05:06.62,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in the so-called "travel ban"

102
0:05:08.043,000 --> 0:05:09,000
are African countries?

103
0:05:09.859,000 --> 0:05:13,000
A lot of people assume those targeted Muslims only live in the Middle East,

104
0:05:14.074,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but a lot of those banned people are Africans.

105
0:05:17.334,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So on these issues of education and policy and religion,

106
0:05:22.14,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a lot of things we presume about immigrants are incorrect.

107
0:05:26.634,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Even if we look at something like workplace diversity and inclusion,

108
0:05:31.788,000 --> 0:05:34,000
if I asked you what gender-ethnicity combination

109
0:05:34.846,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is least likely to be promoted to senior managerial positions,

110
0:05:38.878,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who would you think it was?

111
0:05:40.831,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The answer is not Africans this time.

112
0:05:42.65,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:43.8,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And it's not black women or men,

114
0:05:46.1,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it's not Latin women or men.

115
0:05:48.54,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's Asian women who are least likely to be promoted.

116
0:05:53.068,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Capturing these stories and issues is part of my work

117
0:05:56.272,000 --> 0:05:57,000
as a digital storyteller

118
0:05:58.129,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that uses tech to make it easier for people to find these stories.

119
0:06:02.079,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This year, I launched an online gallery of portraits and firsthand accounts

120
0:06:07.86,000 --> 0:06:08,000
for a project called Enodi.

121
0:06:10.534,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The goal of Enodi is to highlight first-generation immigrants just like me

122
0:06:16.277,000 --> 0:06:19,000
who carry this kinship for the countries we grew up in,

123
0:06:21.081,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for the countries of origin

124
0:06:24.136,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and for this concept called "blackness."

125
0:06:27.581,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I created this space to be a cyberhome for many of us who are misunderstood

126
0:06:32.485,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in our different home countries.

127
0:06:35.521,000 --> 0:06:36,000
There are millions of Enodis

128
0:06:37.362,000 --> 0:06:39,000
who use hyphens to connect their countries of origin

129
0:06:40.105,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with their various homes in the US

130
0:06:43.29,000 --> 0:06:46,000
or Canada or Britain or Germany.

131
0:06:47.195,000 --> 0:06:49,000
In fact, many people you might know are Enodi.

132
0:06:50.738,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Actors Issa Rae and Idris Elba are Enodi.

133
0:06:53.995,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Colin Powell,

134
0:06:55.338,000 --> 0:06:57,000
former Attorney General Eric Holder,

135
0:06:57.941,000 --> 0:06:59,000
former President of the United States, Barack Obama,

136
0:07:00.461,000 --> 0:07:02,000
are all the children of African or Caribbean immigrants.

137
0:07:03.842,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But how much do you know about us?

138
0:07:06.694,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This complicated navigation

139
0:07:10.437,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is not just the experience of first-generation folks.

140
0:07:15.701,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We're so intertwined

141
0:07:17.723,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in the lives and culture of people in North America and Europe,

142
0:07:22.7,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that you might be surprised how critical we are

143
0:07:25.434,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to your histories and future.

144
0:07:28.153,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So, engage us in conversation;

145
0:07:31.026,000 --> 0:07:33,000
discover who immigrants actually are,

146
0:07:33.152,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and see us apart from characterizations

147
0:07:36.322,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or limited media narratives

148
0:07:38.228,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or even who we might appear to be.

149
0:07:41.336,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We're walking melting pots of culture,

150
0:07:44.395,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and if something in that pot smells new or different to you --

151
0:07:47.669,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:49.788,000 --> 0:07:5,000
don't turn up your nose.

153
0:07:52.043,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Ask us to share.

154
0:07:53.865,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Thank you.

155
0:07:55.082,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Applause)

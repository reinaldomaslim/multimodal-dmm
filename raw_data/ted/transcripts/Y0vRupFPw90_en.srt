Greg Gage: If I asked you to think of a ferocious killer animal,

3
0:00:15.28,000 --> 0:00:16,000
you'd probably think of a lion,

4
0:00:16.8,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and for all the wonderful predatory skills that a lion has,

5
0:00:19.64,000 --> 0:00:22,000
it still only has about a 20 percent success rate at catching a meal.

6
0:00:23.36,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, one of the most successful hunters

7
0:00:25.4,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in the entire animal kingdom is surprising:

8
0:00:27.48,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the dragonfly.

9
0:00:28.76,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now, dragonflies are killer flies,

10
0:00:30.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and when they see a smaller fly,

11
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
they have about a 97 percent chance of catching it for a meal.

12
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And this is in mid-flight.

13
0:00:36.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But how can such a small insect be so precise?

14
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In this episode, we're going to see

15
0:00:41.52,000 --> 0:00:44,000
how the dragonfly's brain is highly specialized to be a deadly killer.

[DIY Neuroscience]

17
0:00:48.48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So what makes the dragonfly one of the most successful predators

18
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in the animal kingdom?

19
0:00:52.76,000 --> 0:00:53,000
One, it's the eyes.

20
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It has near 360-degree vision.

21
0:00:55.92,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Two, the wings.

22
0:00:57.36,000 --> 0:00:58,000
With individual control of its wings,

23
0:00:59.2,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the dragonfly can move precisely in any direction.

24
0:01:01.6,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But the real secret to the dragonfly's success

25
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is how its brain coordinates this complex information

26
0:01:07.12,000 --> 0:01:08,000
between the eyes and the wings

27
0:01:08.68,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and turns hunting into a simple reflex.

28
0:01:11.28,000 --> 0:01:13,000
To study this, Jaimie's been spending a lot of time

29
0:01:13.685,000 --> 0:01:14,000
socializing with dragonflies.

30
0:01:15.36,000 --> 0:01:16,000
What do you need to do your experiments?

31
0:01:17.319,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Jaimie Spahr: First of all, you need dragonflies.

32
0:01:19.68,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Oliver: I have a mesh cage to catch the dragonflies.

33
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
JS: The more I worked with them, the more terrified I got of them.

34
0:01:25.32,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They're actually very scary, especially under a microscope.

35
0:01:28.12,000 --> 0:01:31,000
They have really sharp mandibles, are generally pretty aggressive,

36
0:01:31.28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which I guess also helps them to be really good predators.

37
0:01:34.04,000 --> 0:01:37,000
GG: In order to learn what's going on inside the dragonfly's brain

38
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:38,000
when it sees a prey,

39
0:01:38.44,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we're going to eavesdrop in on a conversation

40
0:01:40.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
between the eyes and the wings,

41
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and to do that, we need to anesthetize the dragonfly on ice

42
0:01:44.946,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and make sure we protect its wings so that we can release it afterwards.

43
0:01:48.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, the dragonfly's brain is made up of specialized cells called neurons

44
0:01:52.04,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and these neurons are what allow the dragonfly

45
0:01:54.24,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to see and move so quickly.

46
0:01:55.92,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The individual neurons form circuits by connecting to each other

47
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
via long, tiny threads called axons

48
0:02:01.64,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the neurons communicate over these axons using electricity.

49
0:02:04.92,000 --> 0:02:07,000
In the dragonfly, we're going to place little metal wires, or electrodes,

50
0:02:08.4,000 --> 0:02:09,000
along the axon tracks,

51
0:02:09.68,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and this is what's really cool.

52
0:02:11.2,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In the dragonfly, there's only 16 neurons;

53
0:02:13.24,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that's eight per eye

54
0:02:14.52,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that tell the wings exactly where the target is.

55
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We've placed the electrodes so that we can record from these neurons

56
0:02:20.24,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that connect the eyes to the wings.

57
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Whenever a message is being passed from the eye to the wing,

58
0:02:24.84,000 --> 0:02:27,000
our electrode intercepts that conversation in the form of an electrical current,

59
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and it amplifies it.

60
0:02:29.84,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, we can both hear it and see it in the form of a spike,

61
0:02:32.92,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which we also call an action potential.

62
0:02:35.2,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now let's listen in.

63
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Right now, we have the dragonfly flipped upside down,

64
0:02:39.96,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so he's looking down towards the ground.

65
0:02:42.6,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We're going to take a prey, or what we sometimes call a target.

66
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In this case, the target's going to be a fake fly.

67
0:02:48.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We're going to move it into the dragonfly's sights.

68
0:02:52.64,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Buzzing)

69
0:02:54.32,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Oh!

70
0:02:56.72,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Oh, look at that.

71
0:03:02.04,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Look at that, but it's only in one direction.

72
0:03:04.84,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Oh, yes!

73
0:03:06.64,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You don't see any spikes when I go forward,

74
0:03:08.72,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but they're all when I come back.

75
0:03:10.64,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In our experiments,

76
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we were able to see that the neurons of the dragonfly

77
0:03:14.64,000 --> 0:03:17,000
fired when we moved the target in one direction but not the other.

78
0:03:17.92,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, why is that?

79
0:03:19.2,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Remember when I said that the dragonfly

80
0:03:21.082,000 --> 0:03:23,000
had near 360-degree vision.

81
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Well, there's a section of the eye called the fovea

82
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and this is the part that has the sharpest visual acuity,

83
0:03:28.6,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and you can think of it as its crosshairs.

84
0:03:31.32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Remember when I told you the dragonfly had individual precise control of its wings?

85
0:03:35.52,000 --> 0:03:39,000
When a dragonfly sees its prey, it trains its crosshairs on it

86
0:03:39.6,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and along its axons it sends messages only to the neurons

87
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that control the parts of the wings

88
0:03:44.72,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that are needed to keep that dragonfly on target.

89
0:03:47.08,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So if the prey is on the left of the dragonfly,

90
0:03:50.08,000 --> 0:03:53,000
only the neurons that are tugging the wings to the left are fired.

91
0:03:53.88,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And if the prey moves to the right of the dragonfly,

92
0:03:56.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
those same neurons are not needed, so they're going to remain quiet.

93
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:,000
And the dragonfly speeds toward the prey

94
0:04:01.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
at a fixed angle that's communicated by this crosshairs to the wings,

95
0:04:04.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and then boom, dinner.

96
0:04:06.88,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Now, all this happens in a split second, and it's effortless for the dragonfly.

97
0:04:10.6,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's almost like a reflex.

98
0:04:12.2,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And this whole incredibly efficient process is called fixation.

99
0:04:16.32,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But there's one more story to this process.

100
0:04:18.96,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We saw how the neurons respond to movements,

101
0:04:21.08,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but how does the dragonfly know that something really is prey?

102
0:04:24.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This is where size matters.

103
0:04:26.24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Let's show the dragonfly a series of dots.

104
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Oh, yeah!

105
0:04:42.24,000 --> 0:04:44,000
JS: Yeah, it prefers that one.

106
0:04:44.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
GG: Out of all the sizes,

107
0:04:45.76,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we found that the dragonfly responded to smaller targets over larger ones.

108
0:04:49.68,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In other words, the dragonfly was programmed to go after smaller flies

109
0:04:53.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
versus something much larger, like a bird.

110
0:04:56.12,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And as soon as it recognizes something as prey,

111
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:05:,000
that poor little fly only has seconds to live.

112
0:05:01.56,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Today we got to see how the dragonfly's brain works

113
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to make it a very efficient killer.

114
0:05:06.44,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And let's be thankful that we didn't live 300 million years ago

115
0:05:10.2,000 --> 0:05:12,000
when dragonflies were the size of cats.

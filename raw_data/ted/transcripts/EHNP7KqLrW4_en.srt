1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The greatest irony in global health

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is that the poorest countries

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
carry the largest disease burden.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
If we resize the countries of the globe

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in proportion to the subject of interest,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
we see that Sub-Saharan Africa

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We also see that this region

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
There are very few doctors

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that are needed to cope

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with such epidemics.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So what the Western countries,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
developed countries, have generously done

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is they have proposed to provide free drugs

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to all people in Third World countries

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
who actually can't afford these medications.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And this has already saved millions of lives,

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and it has prevented entire economies

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But there is a fundamental problem

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that is killing the efforts

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in fighting this disease,

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because if you keep throwing

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
drugs out at people

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
who don't have diagnostic services,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The problem is that,

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
what begins as a tragedy in the Third World

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
could easily become a global problem.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And the last thing we want to see

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is drug-resistant strains of HIV

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
popping up all over the world,

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
because it will make treatment more expensive

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and it could also restore

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I experienced this firsthand

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as a high school student in Uganda.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This was in the 90s

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
during the peak of the HIV epidemic,

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives,

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
as well as the teachers who taught me,

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to HIV/AIDS.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So this became one of the driving passions of my life,

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to help find real solutions

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that could address these kinds of problems.

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room,

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and people actually used to work inside the computers.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But what electronic miniaturization has done

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is that it has allowed people to shrink

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
technology into a cell phone.

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world,

59
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in the Third World countries.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The good news is that the same technology

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that allowed miniaturization of electronics

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
is now allowing us to miniaturize

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
biological laboratories.

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
biological and chemistry laboratories

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
onto microfluidic chips.

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I was very lucky to come

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
to the US right after high school,

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and was able to work on this technology

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and develop some devices.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
A close look at how the technology works:

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
These are channels that are about the size of a human hair --

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors --

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
onto a microfluidic system.

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So what I plan to do with this technology

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is to actually take the current state

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of the technology

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and build an HIV kit

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in a microfluidic system.

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So, with one microfluidic chip,

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which is the size of an iPhone,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you can actually diagnose

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
100 patients at the same time.

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
For each patient, we will be able to do

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
up to 100 different viral loads per patient.

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And this is only done in four hours,

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
50 times faster than the current state of the art,

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
than the current options.

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So this will allow us to create

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
personalized medicines in the Third World

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
at a cost that is actually achievable

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and make the world a safer place.

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I invite your interest

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
as well as your involvement

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in driving this vision

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to a point of practical reality.

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Thank you very much.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

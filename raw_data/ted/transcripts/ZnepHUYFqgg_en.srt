1
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact,

2
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
TED Global -- for putting this conference together.

3
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This conference is going to rank as the most important

4
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in the beginning of the 21st century.

5
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Think African governments will put together a conference like this?

6
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?

7
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.

8
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows

9
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:18,000
June Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows.

10
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I call them the Cheetah Generation.

11
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans

12
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:28,000
who brook no nonsense about corruption.

13
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They understand what accountability and democracy is.

14
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They're not going to wait for government to do things for them.

15
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
That's the Cheetah Generation,

16
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.

17
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
In contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.

18
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.

20
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They are stuck in their intellectual patch.

21
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Complaining about colonialism and imperialism,

22
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
they wouldn't move one foot.

23
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
If you ask them to reform the economies,

24
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
they're not going to reform it

25
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because they benefit from the rotten status quo.

26
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,

27
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:17,000
angry at the condition of Africa.

28
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.

29
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.

30
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized

31
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to lift its people out of poverty.

32
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.

33
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.

34
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that

35
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
there are so many people, so many governments,

36
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:55,000
so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.

37
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:57,000
They don't understand.

38
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now, we're not saying don't help Africa.

39
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Helping Africa is noble.

40
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.

41
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's like the blind leading the clueless.

42
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

43
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
There are certain things that we need to recognize.

44
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Africa's begging-bowl leaks.

45
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa

46
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is not invested here in Africa?

47
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's taken out of Africa.

48
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That's what the World Bank says.

49
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Look at Africa's begging-bowl.

50
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It leaks horribly.

51
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:45,000
There are people who think that we should pour more money,

52
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:49,000
more aid into this bowl which leaks.

53
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
What are the leakages?

54
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.

55
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Yes, put that aside.

56
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.

57
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Put that aside.

58
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Let's take food imports.

59
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.

60
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Just add that up, all these leakages.

61
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.

62
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,

63
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it also exported food.

64
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Not anymore.

65
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.

66
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time

67
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:48,000
talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.

68
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Let's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,

69
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter.

70
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves

71
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
this fundamental question,

72
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
"Whom do we want to help in Africa?"

73
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:15,000
There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.

74
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now, the previous speaker before me,

75
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Idris Mohammed, indicated that

76
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we've had abysmal leadership in Africa.

77
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.

78
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

79
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I belong to an Internet discussion forum,

80
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:48,000
an African Internet discussion forum,

81
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly

82
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
204 African heads of state, since 1960."

83
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,

84
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
just 20 good leaders --

85
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.

86
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I asked them to name me just 20.

87
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.

88
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin.

89
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

90
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I let that pass.

91
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

92
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:36,000
My point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.

93
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Even if they had been able to name me 20,

94
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
what does that tell you?

95
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:5,000
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority

96
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
of the African leaders failed their people.

97
0:06:55,000 --> 0:07:,000
And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders --

98
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
an assortment of military fufu heads,

99
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,

100
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:11,000
quack revolutionaries.

101
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Applause)

102
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders

103
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that Africans have known for centuries.

104
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The second false premise that we make

105
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:26,000
when we're trying to help Africa

106
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is that sometimes we think that there is something called

107
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:37,000
a government in Africa that cares about its people,

108
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
serves the interests of the people, and represents the people.

109
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:49,000
There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said

110
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that "Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:

111
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
rats and the government."

112
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

113
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
What you and I understand as a government

114
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
doesn't exist in many African countries.

115
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.

116
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Vampires because they suck

117
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the economic vitality out of their people.

118
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Government is the problem in Africa.

119
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
A vampire state is the government --

120
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Applause)

121
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
-- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks

122
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,

123
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
their cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.

124
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,

125
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.

126
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Where do they get their money?

127
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
By creating wealth?

128
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:5,000
No.

129
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.

130
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:58,000
That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.

131
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize

132
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is that if we want to help the African people,

133
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we must know where the African people are.

134
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Take any African economy.

135
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.

136
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:24,000
There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector

137
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and the traditional sector.

138
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The modern sector is the abode of the elites.

139
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It's the seat of government.

140
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:39,000
In many African countries the modern sector is lost.

141
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's dysfunctional.

142
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,

143
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which the elites themselves don't understand.

144
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:53,000
That is the source of many of Africa's problems

145
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:57,000
where the struggles for political power emanate

146
0:09:57,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,

147
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
claiming innocent lives.

148
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now the modern sector, of course,

149
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.

150
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development

151
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
went into the modern sector.

152
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,

153
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
are where you find the majority of the African people,

154
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the real people in Africa. That's where you find them.

155
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now, obviously it makes common sense

156
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.

157
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But that's not what we did.

158
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
As a matter of fact,

159
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.

160
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Now, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,

161
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,

162
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and that's why it must import food.

163
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:03,000
All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring

164
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the informal and the traditional sectors.

165
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors

166
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:17,000
without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.

167
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:21,000
These two sectors, let me describe to you,

168
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
have their own indigenous institutions.

169
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
First one is the political system.

170
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.

171
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
If you look into their traditional systems,

172
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Africans organize their states in two types.

173
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The first one belongs to those ethnic societies

174
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:48,000
who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,

175
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
so they didn't want to have anything to do

176
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
with any centralized authority.

177
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,

178
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
for example. They have no chiefs.

179
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:06,000
The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,

180
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
made sure that they surrounded the chiefs

181
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
with councils upon councils upon councils

182
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to prevent them from abusing their power.

183
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
In Ashanti tradition, for example,

184
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the chief cannot make any decision

185
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
without the concurrence of the council of elders.

186
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Without the council the chief can't pass any law,

187
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people

188
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
he will be removed.

189
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
If not, the people will abandon the chief,

190
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.

191
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And even if you look in ancient African empires,

192
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:49,000
they were all organized around one particular principle --

193
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the confederacy principle,

194
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:55,000
which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,

195
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
decentralization of power.

196
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
Now, this is what I have described to you.

197
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.

198
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now, compare that to the modern systems

199
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:1,000
the ruling elites established on Africa.

200
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
It is a total far cry.

201
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:18,000
In the economic system in traditional Africa,

202
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the means of production is privately owned.

203
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It's owned by extended families.

204
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit

205
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is the individual.

206
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:32,000
The American will say, "I am because I am,

207
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."

208
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
The accent is on the "I."

209
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
In Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are."

210
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The "we" connotes community -- the extended family system.

211
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The extended family system pools its resources together.

212
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
They own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.

213
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:55,000
They don't take any orders from their chiefs.

214
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
They decide what to do.

215
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus

216
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
on marketplaces.

217
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
When they make a profit it is theirs to keep,

218
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:08,000
not for the chief to sequester it from them.

219
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa

220
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
was a free-market system.

221
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
There were markets in Africa

222
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.

223
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Timbuktu was one great big market town.

224
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Kano, Salaga -- they were all there.

225
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Even if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity

226
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in West Africa has always been dominated by women.

227
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So, it's quite appropriate that this section is called

228
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:33,000
a marketplace.

229
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The market is not alien to Africa.

230
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:4,000
What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,

231
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
but then after independence, all of a sudden,

232
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
markets, capitalism became a western institution,

233
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.

234
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Nonsense.

235
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?

236
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:,000
The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of

237
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Swiss-bank socialism,

238
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
which allowed the heads of states and the ministers

239
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to rape and plunder Africa's

240
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
treasuries for deposit in Switzerland.

241
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:14,000
That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.

242
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:15,000
What do we do now?

243
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions,

244
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,

245
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the traditional sectors.

246
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
That's where you find the African people.

247
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And I'd like to show you a quick little video

248
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
about the informal sector, about the boat-building

249
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora

250
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to invest in.

251
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Could you please show that?

252
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
The men are going fishing in these small boats.

253
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Yes, it's an enterprise.

254
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:18,000
This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.

255
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
He's getting no assistance from the government,

256
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and he's building a second, bigger boat.

257
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:27,000
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.

258
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:31,000
It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.

259
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.

260
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And then it will have what economists call

261
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
external effects on a local economy.

262
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
All that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,

263
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
is to move this operation into something that is enclosed

264
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:5,000
so that the operation can be made more efficient.

265
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Now, it is not just this informal sector.

266
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
There is also traditional medicine.

267
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:01,000
80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.

268
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:05,000
The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.

269
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth

270
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
in the traditional medicine area.

271
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:17,000
This is where we need to mobilize Africans,

272
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:2,000
in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.

273
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:23,000
We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,

274
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:26,000
not only to go into the traditional sectors,

275
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.

276
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:36,000
We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora

277
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.

278
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back

279
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:48,000
one village at a time.

280
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Thank you very much.

281
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:57,000
(Applause)

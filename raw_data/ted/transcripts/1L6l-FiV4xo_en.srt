2
0:00:15.871,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, last month, the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced

3
0:00:19.257,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that it is going out of print

4
0:00:21.006,000 --> 0:00:24,000
after 244 years, which made me nostalgic,

5
0:00:24.831,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library

6
0:00:30.478,000 --> 0:00:31,000
back when I was a kid,

7
0:00:31.727,000 --> 0:00:32,000
maybe 12 years old.

8
0:00:33.07,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I wondered if I could update that game,

9
0:00:35.71,000 --> 0:00:37,000
not just for modern methods,

10
0:00:37.726,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but for the modern me.

11
0:00:39.43,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So I tried.

12
0:00:40.566,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I went to an online encyclopedia,

13
0:00:41.873,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Wikipedia, and I entered the term "Earth."

14
0:00:44.631,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You can start anywhere, this time I chose Earth.

15
0:00:47.297,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple.

16
0:00:49.775,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You just have to read the article

17
0:00:51.266,000 --> 0:00:53,000
until you find something you don't know,

18
0:00:53.854,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and preferably something your dad doesn't even know.

19
0:00:56.959,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And in this case, I quickly found this:

20
0:00:59.838,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The furthest point from the center of the Earth

21
0:01:02.134,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is not the tip of Mount Everest, like I might have thought,

22
0:01:04.607,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it's the tip of this mountain: Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador.

23
0:01:07.903,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The Earth spins, of course, as it travels around the sun,

24
0:01:11.423,000 --> 0:01:12,000
so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle,

25
0:01:13.407,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like some Earthlings.

26
0:01:14.534,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And even though Mount Chimborazo isn't the tallest mountain in the Andes,

27
0:01:19.424,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it's one degree away from the equator,

28
0:01:21.095,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it's riding that bulge, and so the summit of Chimborazo

29
0:01:24.095,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth.

30
0:01:27.495,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And it is really fun to say.

31
0:01:30.447,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So I immediately decided,

32
0:01:31.39,000 --> 0:01:32,000
this is going to be the name of the game,

33
0:01:33.287,000 --> 0:01:34,000
or my new exclamation.

34
0:01:34.774,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You can use it at TED.

35
0:01:35.744,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Chimborazo, right?

36
0:01:37.073,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's like "eureka" and "bingo" had a baby.

37
0:01:38.775,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I didn't know that;

38
0:01:40.504,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that's pretty cool.

39
0:01:42.134,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Chimborazo!

40
0:01:43.799,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple.

41
0:01:47.424,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You just have to find another term and look that up.

42
0:01:50.311,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now in the old days, that meant getting out a volume

43
0:01:52.476,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and browsing through it alphabetically,

44
0:01:54.111,000 --> 0:01:55,000
maybe getting sidetracked,

45
0:01:55.15,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that was fun.

46
0:01:55.855,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from.

47
0:01:58.486,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I can go literally anywhere in the world,

48
0:02:00.438,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I think since I was already in Ecuador,

49
0:02:02.167,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I just decided to click on the word "tropical."

50
0:02:04.878,000 --> 0:02:09,000
That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics

51
0:02:10.119,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that encircles the Earth.

52
0:02:11.304,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now that's the Tropic of Cancer in the north

53
0:02:13.765,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south,

54
0:02:15.278,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that much I knew,

55
0:02:16.086,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but I was surprised to learn this little fact:

56
0:02:18.287,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Those are not cartographers' lines,

57
0:02:20.553,000 --> 0:02:23,000
like latitude or the borders between nations,

58
0:02:24.158,000 --> 0:02:26,000
they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth's tilt,

59
0:02:26.889,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and they change.

60
0:02:28.494,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They move; they go up, they go down.

61
0:02:31.144,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In fact, for years, the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn

62
0:02:34.343,000 --> 0:02:36,000
have been steadily drifting towards the equator

63
0:02:36.983,000 --> 0:02:38,000
at the rate of about 15 meters per year,

64
0:02:39.48,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and nobody told me that.

65
0:02:40.646,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I didn't know it.

66
0:02:41.47,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Chimborazo!

67
0:02:42.888,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So to keep the game going, I just have to find another term and look that one up.

68
0:02:48.664,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Since I'm already in the tropics, I chose "Tropical rainforest."

69
0:02:52.463,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Famous for its diversity, human diversity.

70
0:02:54.746,000 --> 0:02:59,000
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet.

71
0:03:00.272,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They're all over the globe, but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests.

72
0:03:04.75,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get "friended."

73
0:03:09.727,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end.

74
0:03:18.592,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then

75
0:03:25.352,000 --> 0:03:26,000
coleoptera,

76
0:03:27.287,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which turn out to be beetles.

77
0:03:30.526,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now I clicked on this on purpose,

78
0:03:32.75,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but if I'd somehow gotten here by mistake,

79
0:03:34.304,000 --> 0:03:36,000
it does remind me, for the band, see "The Beatles,"

80
0:03:36.401,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for the car see "Volkswagon Beetle,"

81
0:03:38.007,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but I am here for beetle beetles.

82
0:03:40.744,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is the most successful order on the planet by far.

83
0:03:44.614,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet,

84
0:03:48.864,000 --> 0:03:49,000
including plants, are beetles.

85
0:03:50.67,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That means the next time you are in the grocery store,

86
0:03:52.853,000 --> 0:03:54,000
take a look at the four people ahead of you in line.

87
0:03:55.055,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Statistically, one of you is a beetle.

88
0:03:58.072,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And if it is you, you are astonishingly well adapted.

89
0:04:03.67,000 --> 0:04:08,000
There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums.

90
0:04:08.703,000 --> 0:04:11,000
There are predator beetles, that attack other insects

91
0:04:11.784,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and still look pretty cute to us.

92
0:04:13.567,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There are beetles that roll little balls of dung

93
0:04:17.071,000 --> 0:04:2,000
great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings.

94
0:04:20.366,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri,

95
0:04:24.15,000 --> 0:04:27,000
who renews the ball of the sun every morning,

96
0:04:27.464,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which is how that dung-rolling scarab

97
0:04:29.487,000 --> 0:04:34,000
became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun.

98
0:04:34.855,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Beetles, I was reminded, have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom.

99
0:04:40.783,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Fireflies are not flies, fireflies are beetles.

100
0:04:43.366,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Fireflies are coleoptera, and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well.

101
0:04:48.678,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Like my next link:

102
0:04:50.054,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The chemical language of pheromones.

103
0:04:52.993,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex.

104
0:04:59.046,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Yeah.

105
0:05:02.726,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:05.814,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And the link to aphrodisiac.

107
0:05:07.886,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now that's something that increases sexual desire,

108
0:05:09.55,000 --> 0:05:11,000
possibly chocolate.

109
0:05:11.751,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine

110
0:05:15.254,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that might be an aphrodisiac.

111
0:05:16.624,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But as the article mentions,

112
0:05:18.879,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because of enzyme breakdown,

113
0:05:20.094,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it's unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally.

114
0:05:24.264,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So those of you who only eat your chocolate, you might have to experiment.

115
0:05:27.374,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The link I clicked on here,

116
0:05:31.184,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"sympathetic magic," mostly because I understand what both of those words mean.

117
0:05:36.383,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But not when they're together like that.

118
0:05:38.535,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I do like sympathy. I do like magic.

119
0:05:41.526,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So when I click on "sympathetic magic,"

120
0:05:42.871,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls.

121
0:05:47.676,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This is the boy in me getting lucky again.

122
0:05:49.824,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Sympathetic magic is imitation.

123
0:05:52.343,000 --> 0:05:54,000
If you imitate something, maybe you can have an effect on it.

124
0:05:54.75,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's the idea behind voodoo dolls, and possibly also cave paintings.

125
0:05:59.184,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind.

126
0:06:04.264,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves.

127
0:06:06.271,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We've got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork.

128
0:06:09.767,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands,

129
0:06:14.766,000 --> 0:06:16,000
usually the left hand.

130
0:06:17.087,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia,

131
0:06:21.55,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so even though I don't know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand

132
0:06:26.886,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or blow pigment on it from a tube,

133
0:06:28.872,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I can easily picture how he did it.

134
0:06:31.464,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I really don't think it's that different form our own little dominant hand avatar

135
0:06:35.966,000 --> 0:06:38,000
right there that I'm going to use now to click on the term for "hand,"

136
0:06:39.298,000 --> 0:06:45,000
go to the page for "hand," where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia

137
0:06:45.59,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I've found in a long time. It's simply this:

138
0:06:47.624,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar.

139
0:06:51.806,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now that's embarrassing, because up until now,

140
0:06:55.479,000 --> 0:06:58,000
every time I've said, "I know it like the back of my hand,"

141
0:06:58.679,000 --> 0:07:,000
I've really been saying, "I'm totally familiar with that,

142
0:07:01.038,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I just don't know it's freaking name, right?"

143
0:07:03.624,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And the link I clicked on here,

144
0:07:07.278,000 --> 0:07:11,000
well, lemurs, monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar.

145
0:07:11.43,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I click on chimpanzee, and I get our closest genetic relative.

146
0:07:15.68,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Pan troglodytes, the name we give him, means "cave dweller."

147
0:07:19.671,000 --> 0:07:2,000
He doesn't.

148
0:07:21.175,000 --> 0:07:22,000
He lives in rainforests and savannas.

149
0:07:22.999,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's just that we're always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us,

150
0:07:26.206,000 --> 0:07:29,000
evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us,

151
0:07:29.27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and in some cases, he gets places before us.

152
0:07:32.944,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Like my next link, the almost irresistible link, Ham the Astrochimp.

153
0:07:38.166,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I click on him, and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice, in fact.

154
0:07:42.344,000 --> 0:07:43,000
He's born in Cameroon,

155
0:07:43.544,000 --> 0:07:46,000
which is smack in the middle of my tropics map,

156
0:07:47.304,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles.

157
0:07:53.526,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In between those two landmarks in Ham's life,

158
0:07:56.479,000 --> 0:07:58,000
he flew into space.

159
0:07:59.015,000 --> 0:08:02,000
He experienced weightlessness and re-entry

160
0:08:02.252,000 --> 0:08:04,000
months before the first human being to do it,

161
0:08:04.823,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.

162
0:08:07.687,000 --> 0:08:09,000
When I click on Yuri Gagarin's page,

163
0:08:09.839,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature,

164
0:08:12.758,000 --> 0:08:13,000
huge in heroism.

165
0:08:14.295,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Top estimates, Soviet estimates, put this guy at 1.65 meters,

166
0:08:18.638,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that is less than five and a half feet tall max,

167
0:08:21.639,000 --> 0:08:23,000
possibly because he was malnourished as a child.

168
0:08:24.445,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Germans occupied Russia.

169
0:08:26.99,000 --> 0:08:29,000
A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household,

170
0:08:30.087,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut.

171
0:08:32.891,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Years later, the boy from that cramped mud hut

172
0:08:36.438,000 --> 0:08:39,000
would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule

173
0:08:39.944,000 --> 0:08:4,000
on the tip of a rocket

174
0:08:41.558,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who volunteered to be launched into outer space,

175
0:08:45.046,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet.

176
0:08:49.398,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And he didn't just leave it,

177
0:08:50.746,000 --> 0:08:52,000
he circled it once.

178
0:08:53.271,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Fifty years later, as a tribute,

179
0:08:55.497,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the International Space Station, which is still up there tonight,

180
0:08:59.424,000 --> 0:09:03,000
synced its orbit with Gagarin's orbit,

181
0:09:03.504,000 --> 0:09:04,000
at the exact same time of day,

182
0:09:04.67,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and filmed it,

183
0:09:06.23,000 --> 0:09:09,000
so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes

184
0:09:09.814,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride,

185
0:09:13.323,000 --> 0:09:14,000
possibly a lonely one,

186
0:09:14.464,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the first person to ever see such a thing.

187
0:09:16.744,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And then when you've had your fill of that,

188
0:09:18.167,000 --> 0:09:2,000
you can click on one more link.

189
0:09:20.784,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You can come back to Earth.

190
0:09:22.126,000 --> 0:09:24,000
You return to where you started.

191
0:09:24.287,000 --> 0:09:26,000
You can finish your game.

192
0:09:26.504,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You just need to find one more fact that you didn't know.

193
0:09:30.094,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And for me, I quickly landed on this one:

194
0:09:32.574,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid,

195
0:09:37.59,000 --> 0:09:4,000
which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls.

196
0:09:41.559,000 --> 0:09:43,000
This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy.

197
0:09:43.991,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I found it myself.

198
0:09:45.238,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It's got some math that I can do.

199
0:09:47.513,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I'm pretty sure my dad doesn't know it.

200
0:09:49.638,000 --> 0:09:54,000
What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball,

201
0:09:55.127,000 --> 0:10:01,000
if you could take planet Earth, with all its mountain tops and caves

202
0:10:01.144,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and rainforests, astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees, voodoo dolls,

203
0:10:05.82,000 --> 0:10:1,000
fireflies, chocolate, sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea,

204
0:10:11.344,000 --> 0:10:14,000
you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball,

205
0:10:14.545,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it would be as smooth as a billiard ball,

206
0:10:18.438,000 --> 0:10:22,000
presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle.

207
0:10:23.055,000 --> 0:10:25,000
That's pretty cool.

208
0:10:25.846,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I didn't know that.

209
0:10:27.79,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Chimborazo!

210
0:10:30.015,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Thank you.

211
0:10:30.904,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Applause)

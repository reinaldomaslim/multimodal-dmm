1
0:00:13.099,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I study ants

2
0:00:14.718,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in the desert, in the tropical forest

3
0:00:18.015,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and in my kitchen,

4
0:00:19.543,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and in the hills around Silicon Valley where I live.

5
0:00:23.563,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I've recently realized that ants

6
0:00:25.239,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are using interactions differently

7
0:00:27.517,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in different environments,

8
0:00:29.345,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and that got me thinking that we could learn from this

9
0:00:31.345,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about other systems,

10
0:00:32.9,000 --> 0:00:37,000
like brains and data networks that we engineer,

11
0:00:38.488,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and even cancer.

12
0:00:41.334,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So what all these systems have in common

13
0:00:43.086,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is that there's no central control.

14
0:00:45.943,000 --> 0:00:48,000
An ant colony consists of sterile female workers --

15
0:00:49.763,000 --> 0:00:51,000
those are the ants you see walking around —

16
0:00:52.149,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and then one or more reproductive females

17
0:00:54.305,000 --> 0:00:56,000
who just lay the eggs.

18
0:00:56.408,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They don't give any instructions.

19
0:00:58.417,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Even though they're called queens,

20
0:01:00.401,000 --> 0:01:02,000
they don't tell anybody what to do.

21
0:01:02.566,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So in an ant colony, there's no one in charge,

22
0:01:05.842,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and all systems like this without central control

23
0:01:08.62,000 --> 0:01:11,000
are regulated using very simple interactions.

24
0:01:12.549,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Ants interact using smell.

25
0:01:15.276,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They smell with their antennae,

26
0:01:17.463,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and they interact with their antennae,

27
0:01:20.224,000 --> 0:01:23,000
so when one ant touches another with its antennae,

28
0:01:23.233,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it can tell, for example, if the other ant

29
0:01:24.84,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is a nestmate

30
0:01:26.474,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and what task that other ant has been doing.

31
0:01:30.71,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So here you see a lot of ants moving around

32
0:01:33.91,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and interacting in a lab arena

33
0:01:35.843,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that's connected by tubes to two other arenas.

34
0:01:39.281,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So when one ant meets another,

35
0:01:41.785,000 --> 0:01:43,000
it doesn't matter which ant it meets,

36
0:01:43.874,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and they're actually not transmitting

37
0:01:45.759,000 --> 0:01:48,000
any kind of complicated signal or message.

38
0:01:49.224,000 --> 0:01:51,000
All that matters to the ant is the rate

39
0:01:51.335,000 --> 0:01:53,000
at which it meets other ants.

40
0:01:54.156,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And all of these interactions, taken together,

41
0:01:56.913,000 --> 0:01:58,000
produce a network.

42
0:01:59.418,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So this is the network of the ants

43
0:02:01.628,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that you just saw moving around in the arena,

44
0:02:04.272,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it's this constantly shifting network

45
0:02:07.559,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that produces the behavior of the colony,

46
0:02:10.079,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest,

47
0:02:12.96,000 --> 0:02:14,000
or how many are going out to forage.

48
0:02:15.654,000 --> 0:02:16,000
A brain actually works in the same way,

49
0:02:17.413,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but what's great about ants is

50
0:02:18.913,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that you can see the whole network as it happens.

51
0:02:23.78,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There are more than 12,000 species of ants,

52
0:02:26.88,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in every conceivable environment,

53
0:02:29.005,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and they're using interactions differently

54
0:02:31.654,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to meet different environmental challenges.

55
0:02:34.422,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So one important environmental challenge

56
0:02:36.727,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that every system has to deal with

57
0:02:38.597,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is operating costs, just what it takes

58
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to run the system.

59
0:02:42.945,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And another environmental challenge is resources,

60
0:02:45.493,000 --> 0:02:47,000
finding them and collecting them.

61
0:02:47.829,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In the desert, operating costs are high

62
0:02:50.612,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because water is scarce,

63
0:02:52.385,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and the seed-eating ants that I study in the desert

64
0:02:54.884,000 --> 0:02:56,000
have to spend water to get water.

65
0:02:57.784,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So an ant outside foraging,

66
0:02:59.923,000 --> 0:03:01,000
searching for seeds in the hot sun,

67
0:03:01.96,000 --> 0:03:03,000
just loses water into the air.

68
0:03:03.967,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But the colony gets its water

69
0:03:05.631,000 --> 0:03:06,000
by metabolizing the fats out of the seeds

70
0:03:07.397,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that they eat.

71
0:03:09.331,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So in this environment, interactions are used

72
0:03:12.49,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to activate foraging.

73
0:03:14.039,000 --> 0:03:16,000
An outgoing forager doesn't go out unless

74
0:03:16.303,000 --> 0:03:18,000
it gets enough interactions with returning foragers,

75
0:03:18.876,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and what you see are the returning foragers

76
0:03:20.866,000 --> 0:03:21,000
going into the tunnel, into the nest,

77
0:03:22.69,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and meeting outgoing foragers on their way out.

78
0:03:25.326,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This makes sense for the ant colony,

79
0:03:26.949,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because the more food there is out there,

80
0:03:29.272,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the more quickly the foragers find it,

81
0:03:31.123,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the faster they come back,

82
0:03:32.359,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and the more foragers they send out.

83
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The system works to stay stopped,

84
0:03:37.667,000 --> 0:03:39,000
unless something positive happens.

85
0:03:39.682,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So interactions function to activate foragers.

86
0:03:43.563,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And we've been studying the evolution of this system.

87
0:03:46.47,000 --> 0:03:47,000
First of all, there's variation.

88
0:03:47.561,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It turns out that colonies are different.

89
0:03:50.04,000 --> 0:03:52,000
On dry days, some colonies forage less,

90
0:03:52.736,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so colonies are different in how

91
0:03:54.241,000 --> 0:03:55,000
they manage this trade-off

92
0:03:55.595,000 --> 0:03:58,000
between spending water to search for seeds

93
0:03:58.763,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and getting water back in the form of seeds.

94
0:04:02.083,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And we're trying to understand why

95
0:04:03.802,000 --> 0:04:05,000
some colonies forage less than others

96
0:04:05.942,000 --> 0:04:07,000
by thinking about ants as neurons,

97
0:04:08.267,000 --> 0:04:1,000
using models from neuroscience.

98
0:04:10.605,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So just as a neuron adds up its stimulation

99
0:04:13.279,000 --> 0:04:15,000
from other neurons to decide whether to fire,

100
0:04:15.285,000 --> 0:04:17,000
an ant adds up its stimulation from other ants

101
0:04:18.17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to decide whether to forage.

102
0:04:20.193,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And what we're looking for is whether there might be

103
0:04:21.83,000 --> 0:04:22,000
small differences among colonies

104
0:04:23.822,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in how many interactions each ant needs

105
0:04:27.136,000 --> 0:04:28,000
before it's willing to go out and forage,

106
0:04:29.062,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because a colony like that would forage less.

107
0:04:32.829,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And this raises an analogous question about brains.

108
0:04:35.968,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We talk about the brain,

109
0:04:37.38,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but of course every brain is slightly different,

110
0:04:40.27,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and maybe there are some individuals

111
0:04:41.649,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or some conditions

112
0:04:42.968,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in which the electrical properties of neurons are such

113
0:04:46.19,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that they require more stimulus to fire,

114
0:04:50.06,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and that would lead to differences in brain function.

115
0:04:53.786,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So in order to ask evolutionary questions,

116
0:04:56.12,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we need to know about reproductive success.

117
0:04:58.799,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is a map of the study site

118
0:05:01.124,000 --> 0:05:03,000
where I have been tracking this population

119
0:05:03.677,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of harvester ant colonies for 28 years,

120
0:05:06.97,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which is about as long as a colony lives.

121
0:05:09.232,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Each symbol is a colony,

122
0:05:11.331,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and the size of the symbol is how many offspring it had,

123
0:05:14.597,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because we were able to use genetic variation

124
0:05:16.51,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to match up parent and offspring colonies,

125
0:05:19.221,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that is, to figure out which colonies

126
0:05:22.518,000 --> 0:05:23,000
were founded by a daughter queen

127
0:05:24.443,000 --> 0:05:26,000
produced by which parent colony.

128
0:05:26.511,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And this was amazing for me, after all these years,

129
0:05:28.513,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to find out, for example, that colony 154,

130
0:05:31.641,000 --> 0:05:33,000
whom I've known well for many years,

131
0:05:33.817,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is a great-grandmother.

132
0:05:35.636,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Here's her daughter colony,

133
0:05:37.376,000 --> 0:05:39,000
here's her granddaughter colony,

134
0:05:40.06,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and these are her great-granddaughter colonies.

135
0:05:42.452,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And by doing this, I was able to learn

136
0:05:44.477,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that offspring colonies resemble parent colonies

137
0:05:47.76,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in their decisions about which days are so hot

138
0:05:49.977,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that they don't forage,

139
0:05:51.755,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and the offspring of parent colonies

140
0:05:53.219,000 --> 0:05:55,000
live so far from each other that the ants never meet,

141
0:05:56.125,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so the ants of the offspring colony

142
0:05:58.414,000 --> 0:06:,000
can't be learning this from the parent colony.

143
0:06:00.658,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And so our next step is to look

144
0:06:02.039,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for the genetic variation underlying this resemblance.

145
0:06:07.315,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So then I was able to ask, okay, who's doing better?

146
0:06:11.44,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Over the time of the study,

147
0:06:12.9,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and especially in the past 10 years,

148
0:06:14.365,000 --> 0:06:17,000
there's been a very severe and deepening drought

149
0:06:17.673,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in the Southwestern U.S.,

150
0:06:19.8,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and it turns out that the colonies that conserve water,

151
0:06:22.853,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that stay in when it's really hot outside,

152
0:06:27.282,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and thus sacrifice getting as much food as possible,

153
0:06:29.914,000 --> 0:06:31,000
are the ones more likely to have offspring colonies.

154
0:06:32.859,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So all this time, I thought that colony 154

155
0:06:35.128,000 --> 0:06:37,000
was a loser, because on really dry days,

156
0:06:37.798,000 --> 0:06:38,000
there'd be just this trickle of foraging,

157
0:06:39.666,000 --> 0:06:4,000
while the other colonies were out

158
0:06:41.257,000 --> 0:06:43,000
foraging, getting lots of food,

159
0:06:43.374,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but in fact, colony 154 is a huge success.

160
0:06:46.394,000 --> 0:06:47,000
She's a matriarch.

161
0:06:47.726,000 --> 0:06:5,000
She's one of the rare great-grandmothers on the site.

162
0:06:50.778,000 --> 0:06:52,000
To my knowledge, this is the first time

163
0:06:53.563,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that we've been able to track

164
0:06:55.202,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the ongoing evolution of collective behavior

165
0:06:58.203,000 --> 0:07:,000
in a natural population of animals

166
0:07:00.32,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and find out what's actually working best.

167
0:07:04.977,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now, the Internet uses an algorithm

168
0:07:07.398,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to regulate the flow of data

169
0:07:10.251,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that's very similar to the one

170
0:07:12.478,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that the harvester ants are using to regulate

171
0:07:14.854,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the flow of foragers.

172
0:07:16.395,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And guess what we call this analogy?

173
0:07:19.761,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The anternet is coming.

174
0:07:21.279,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

175
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So data doesn't leave the source computer

176
0:07:26.454,000 --> 0:07:28,000
unless it gets a signal that there's enough bandwidth

177
0:07:29.315,000 --> 0:07:31,000
for it to travel on.

178
0:07:32.044,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In the early days of the Internet,

179
0:07:33.485,000 --> 0:07:35,000
when operating costs were really high

180
0:07:35.759,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and it was really important not to lose any data,

181
0:07:38.986,000 --> 0:07:4,000
then the system was set up for interactions

182
0:07:41.143,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to activate the flow of data.

183
0:07:44.205,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's interesting that the ants are using an algorithm

184
0:07:46.59,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that's so similar to the one that we recently invented,

185
0:07:50.486,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but this is only one of a handful of ant algorithms

186
0:07:53.439,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that we know about,

187
0:07:54.858,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and ants have had 130 million years

188
0:07:58.051,000 --> 0:08:,000
to evolve a lot of good ones,

189
0:08:00.077,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and I think it's very likely

190
0:08:01.583,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that some of the other 12,000 species

191
0:08:04.14,000 --> 0:08:06,000
are going to have interesting algorithms

192
0:08:06.837,000 --> 0:08:07,000
for data networks

193
0:08:07.861,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that we haven't even thought of yet.

194
0:08:10.558,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So what happens when operating costs are low?

195
0:08:13.643,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Operating costs are low in the tropics,

196
0:08:15.43,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because it's very humid, and it's easy for the ants

197
0:08:17.526,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to be outside walking around.

198
0:08:20.35,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But the ants are so abundant

199
0:08:22.003,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and diverse in the tropics

200
0:08:23.821,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that there's a lot of competition.

201
0:08:26.419,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Whatever resource one species is using,

202
0:08:28.371,000 --> 0:08:31,000
another species is likely to be using that

203
0:08:31.543,000 --> 0:08:33,000
at the same time.

204
0:08:33.922,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So in this environment, interactions are used

205
0:08:36.53,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in the opposite way.

206
0:08:38.475,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The system keeps going

207
0:08:39.87,000 --> 0:08:4,000
unless something negative happens,

208
0:08:41.424,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and one species that I study makes circuits

209
0:08:43.591,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in the trees of foraging ants

210
0:08:45.75,000 --> 0:08:47,000
going from the nest to a food source and back,

211
0:08:48.731,000 --> 0:08:49,000
just round and round,

212
0:08:50.06,000 --> 0:08:51,000
unless something negative happens,

213
0:08:51.502,000 --> 0:08:52,000
like an interaction

214
0:08:53.111,000 --> 0:08:55,000
with ants of another species.

215
0:08:55.85,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So here's an example of ant security.

216
0:08:58.787,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In the middle, there's an ant

217
0:09:00.645,000 --> 0:09:02,000
plugging the nest entrance with its head

218
0:09:03.108,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in response to interactions with another species.

219
0:09:06.101,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Those are the little ones running around

220
0:09:07.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
with their abdomens up in the air.

221
0:09:10.511,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But as soon as the threat is passed,

222
0:09:12.557,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the entrance is open again,

223
0:09:15.312,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and maybe there are situations

224
0:09:17.102,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in computer security

225
0:09:18.191,000 --> 0:09:2,000
where operating costs are low enough

226
0:09:20.397,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that we could just block access temporarily

227
0:09:23.772,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in response to an immediate threat,

228
0:09:25.965,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and then open it again,

229
0:09:27.991,000 --> 0:09:28,000
instead of trying to build

230
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
a permanent firewall or fortress.

231
0:09:33.24,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So another environmental challenge

232
0:09:35.18,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that all systems have to deal with

233
0:09:36.875,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is resources, finding and collecting them.

234
0:09:42.327,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And to do this, ants solve the problem

235
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of collective search,

236
0:09:45.258,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and this is a problem that's of great interest

237
0:09:46.834,000 --> 0:09:47,000
right now in robotics,

238
0:09:48.318,000 --> 0:09:49,000
because we've understood that,

239
0:09:50.05,000 --> 0:09:51,000
rather than sending a single,

240
0:09:51.664,000 --> 0:09:54,000
sophisticated, expensive robot out

241
0:09:55.159,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to explore another planet

242
0:09:56.576,000 --> 0:09:58,000
or to search a burning building,

243
0:09:59.143,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that instead, it may be more effective

244
0:10:01.743,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to get a group of cheaper robots

245
0:10:06.12,000 --> 0:10:08,000
exchanging only minimal information,

246
0:10:08.665,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that's the way that ants do it.

247
0:10:11.464,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So the invasive Argentine ant

248
0:10:13.229,000 --> 0:10:15,000
makes expandable search networks.

249
0:10:15.559,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They're good at dealing with the main problem

250
0:10:17.832,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of collective search,

251
0:10:19.163,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which is the trade-off between

252
0:10:21.729,000 --> 0:10:22,000
searching very thoroughly

253
0:10:23.065,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and covering a lot of ground.

254
0:10:25.062,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And what they do is,

255
0:10:25.957,000 --> 0:10:27,000
when there are many ants in a small space,

256
0:10:28.344,000 --> 0:10:3,000
then each one can search very thoroughly

257
0:10:30.557,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because there will be another ant nearby

258
0:10:32.181,000 --> 0:10:33,000
searching over there,

259
0:10:33.538,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but when there are a few ants

260
0:10:35.185,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in a large space,

261
0:10:37.24,000 --> 0:10:39,000
then they need to stretch out their paths

262
0:10:39.654,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to cover more ground.

263
0:10:41.457,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I think they use interactions to assess density,

264
0:10:44.411,000 --> 0:10:45,000
so when they're really crowded,

265
0:10:45.64,000 --> 0:10:46,000
they meet more often,

266
0:10:46.742,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and they search more thoroughly.

267
0:10:49.207,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Different ant species must use different algorithms,

268
0:10:52.607,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because they've evolved to deal with

269
0:10:55.129,000 --> 0:10:56,000
different resources,

270
0:10:56.8,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and it could be really useful to know about this,

271
0:10:59.359,000 --> 0:11:,000
and so we recently asked ants

272
0:11:01.001,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to solve the collective search problem

273
0:11:03.451,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in the extreme environment

274
0:11:04.819,000 --> 0:11:05,000
of microgravity

275
0:11:06.377,000 --> 0:11:07,000
in the International Space Station.

276
0:11:08.353,000 --> 0:11:09,000
When I first saw this picture, I thought,

277
0:11:09.898,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Oh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically,

278
0:11:12.755,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter.

279
0:11:15.373,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So the idea here is that the ants

280
0:11:18.01,000 --> 0:11:19,000
are working so hard to hang on

281
0:11:19.98,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it

282
0:11:23.037,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that they're less likely to interact,

283
0:11:26.046,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and so the relationship between

284
0:11:27.29,000 --> 0:11:29,000
how crowded they are and how often they meet

285
0:11:29.41,000 --> 0:11:3,000
would be messed up.

286
0:11:31.135,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We're still analyzing the data.

287
0:11:32.53,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I don't have the results yet.

288
0:11:34.494,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But it would be interesting to know

289
0:11:36.188,000 --> 0:11:38,000
how other species solve this problem

290
0:11:38.647,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in different environments on Earth,

291
0:11:41.211,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and so we're setting up a program

292
0:11:42.477,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to encourage kids around the world

293
0:11:44.637,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to try this experiment with different species.

294
0:11:47.173,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It's very simple.

295
0:11:48.94,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It can be done with cheap materials.

296
0:11:51.03,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And that way, we could make a global map

297
0:11:53.863,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of ant collective search algorithms.

298
0:11:57.21,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species,

299
0:11:59.693,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the ones that come into our buildings,

300
0:12:01.842,000 --> 0:12:02,000
are going to be really good at this,

301
0:12:03.584,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because they're in your kitchen

302
0:12:05.432,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because they're really good at finding food and water.

303
0:12:09.339,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So the most familiar resource for ants

304
0:12:12.604,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is a picnic,

305
0:12:13.919,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and this is a clustered resource.

306
0:12:16.064,000 --> 0:12:16,000
When there's one piece of fruit,

307
0:12:17.063,000 --> 0:12:19,000
there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby,

308
0:12:19.578,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and the ants that specialize on clustered resources

309
0:12:23.01,000 --> 0:12:24,000
use interactions for recruitment.

310
0:12:24.952,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So when one ant meets another,

311
0:12:26.229,000 --> 0:12:27,000
or when it meets a chemical deposited

312
0:12:27.854,000 --> 0:12:28,000
on the ground by another,

313
0:12:29.59,000 --> 0:12:3,000
then it changes direction to follow

314
0:12:31.423,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in the direction of the interaction,

315
0:12:32.996,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and that's how you get the trail of ants

316
0:12:34.973,000 --> 0:12:35,000
sharing your picnic.

317
0:12:36.386,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Now this is a place where I think we might be able

318
0:12:38.081,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to learn something from ants about cancer.

319
0:12:41.822,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I mean, first, it's obvious that we could do a lot

320
0:12:43.803,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to prevent cancer

321
0:12:45.413,000 --> 0:12:47,000
by not allowing people to spread around

322
0:12:47.99,000 --> 0:12:48,000
or sell the toxins that promote

323
0:12:49.934,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the evolution of cancer in our bodies,

324
0:12:52.714,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but I don't think the ants can help us much with this

325
0:12:55.06,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because ants never poison their own colonies.

326
0:12:58.418,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But we might be able to learn something from ants

327
0:12:59.75,000 --> 0:13:,000
about treating cancer.

328
0:13:01.513,000 --> 0:13:03,000
There are many different kinds of cancer.

329
0:13:03.738,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Each one originates in a particular part of the body,

330
0:13:06.716,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and then some kinds of cancer will spread

331
0:13:09.682,000 --> 0:13:11,000
or metastasize to particular other tissues

332
0:13:12.512,000 --> 0:13:14,000
where they must be getting resources that they need.

333
0:13:15.392,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So if you think from the perspective

334
0:13:17.2,000 --> 0:13:18,000
of early metastatic cancer cells

335
0:13:19.15,000 --> 0:13:2,000
as they're out searching around

336
0:13:20.773,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for the resources that they need,

337
0:13:23.09,000 --> 0:13:24,000
if those resources are clustered,

338
0:13:25.073,000 --> 0:13:28,000
they're likely to use interactions for recruitment,

339
0:13:28.086,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and if we can figure out how cancer cells are recruiting,

340
0:13:31.179,000 --> 0:13:33,000
then maybe we could set traps

341
0:13:33.526,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to catch them before they become established.

342
0:13:37.575,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So ants are using interactions in different ways

343
0:13:40.81,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in a huge variety of environments,

344
0:13:43.412,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and we could learn from this

345
0:13:45.233,000 --> 0:13:46,000
about other systems that operate

346
0:13:47.01,000 --> 0:13:49,000
without central control.

347
0:13:49.347,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Using only simple interactions,

348
0:13:51.326,000 --> 0:13:52,000
ant colonies have been performing

349
0:13:53.121,000 --> 0:13:56,000
amazing feats for more than 130 million years.

350
0:13:56.754,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We have a lot to learn from them.

351
0:13:58.894,000 --> 0:14:,000
Thank you.

352
0:14:01.632,000 --> 0:14:03,000

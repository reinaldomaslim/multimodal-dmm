1
0:00:12.804,000 --> 0:00:15,000
All right, let's get up our picture of the earth.

2
0:00:16.38,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The earth is pretty awesome.

3
0:00:17.82,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm a geologist, so I get pretty psyched about this,

4
0:00:20.273,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but the earth is great.

5
0:00:21.66,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's powerful, it's dynamic, it's constantly changing.

6
0:00:25.14,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a pretty exciting place to live.

7
0:00:28.1,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But I want to share with you guys today my perspective as a geologist

8
0:00:31.82,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in how understanding earth's past

9
0:00:34.06,000 --> 0:00:37,000
can help inform and guide decisions that we make today

10
0:00:37.58,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about how to sustainably live on earth's surface.

11
0:00:41.34,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So there's a lot of exciting things that go on on the surface of the earth.

12
0:00:45.1,000 --> 0:00:46,000
If we zoom in here a little bit,

13
0:00:47.18,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I want to talk to you guys a little bit about one of the things that happens.

14
0:00:50.86,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Material get shuffled around earth's surface all the time,

15
0:00:53.62,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and one of the big thing that happens is material from high mountains

16
0:00:56.88,000 --> 0:00:58,000
gets eroded and transported and deposited in the sea.

17
0:00:59.38,000 --> 0:01:,000
And this process is ongoing all the time,

18
0:01:01.37,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and it has huge effects on how the landscape works.

19
0:01:03.78,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So this example here in south India --

20
0:01:05.7,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we have some of the biggest mountains in the world,

21
0:01:08.22,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and you can see in this satellite photo

22
0:01:10.22,000 --> 0:01:14,000
rivers transporting material from those mountains out to the sea.

23
0:01:14.42,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You can think of these rivers like bulldozers.

24
0:01:16.62,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They're basically taking these mountains and pushing them down towards the sea.

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We'll give you guys an example here.

26
0:01:23.1,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So we zoom in a little bit.

27
0:01:24.46,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I want to talk to you guys specifically about a river.

28
0:01:27.02,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We can see these beautiful patterns that the rivers make

29
0:01:29.7,000 --> 0:01:31,000
as they're pushing material down to the sea,

30
0:01:31.82,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but these patterns aren't static.

31
0:01:33.46,000 --> 0:01:35,000
These rivers are wiggling and jumping around quite a bit,

32
0:01:36.17,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and it can have big impacts on our lives.

33
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So an example of this is this is the Kosi River.

34
0:01:40.58,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So the Kosi River has this nice c-shaped pathway,

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and it exits the big mountains of Nepal

36
0:01:45.74,000 --> 0:01:47,000
carrying with it a ton of material,

37
0:01:47.9,000 --> 0:01:49,000
a lot of sediments that's being eroded from the high mountains,

38
0:01:50.89,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and it spreads out across India

39
0:01:52.77,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and moves this material.

40
0:01:54.38,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So we're going to zoom in to this area

41
0:01:56.7,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I'm going to tell you a little bit about what happened with the Kosi.

42
0:02:00.153,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It's an example of how dynamic these systems can be.

43
0:02:02.74,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So this is a satellite image from August of 2008,

44
0:02:06.34,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and this satellite image is colored

45
0:02:08.06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
so that vegetations or plants show up as green

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and water shows up as blue.

47
0:02:11.94,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So here again you can see that c-shaped pathway

48
0:02:15.5,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that this river takes as it exits Nepal.

49
0:02:17.94,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And now this is monsoon season.

50
0:02:19.98,000 --> 0:02:21,000
August is monsoon season in this region of the world,

51
0:02:22.5,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and anyone that lives near a river is no stranger to flooding

52
0:02:25.42,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and the hazards and inconveniences at minimum that are associated with that.

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But something interesting happened in 2008,

54
0:02:31.54,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and this river moved in a way that's very different.

55
0:02:34.46,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It flooded in a way that's very different than it normally does.

56
0:02:37.484,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So the Kosi River is flowing down here,

57
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but sometimes as these rivers are bulldozing sediment,

58
0:02:42.86,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they kind of get clogged,

59
0:02:44.14,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and these clogs can actually cause the rivers

60
0:02:46.3,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to shift their course dramatically.

61
0:02:48.02,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So this satellite image is from just two weeks later.

62
0:02:50.9,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Here's the previous pathway,

63
0:02:52.86,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that c-shaped pathway,

64
0:02:54.5,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and you notice it's not blue anymore.

65
0:02:56.62,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But now what we have is this blue pathway

66
0:02:58.62,000 --> 0:03:,000
that cuts down the middle of the field of view here.

67
0:03:01.1,000 --> 0:03:03,000
What happened is the Kosi River jumped its banks,

68
0:03:03.46,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and for reference, the scale bar here is 40 miles.

69
0:03:06.18,000 --> 0:03:09,000
This river moved over 30 miles very abruptly.

70
0:03:10.38,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So this river got clogged and it jumped its banks.

71
0:03:13.58,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Here's an image from about a week later,

72
0:03:15.7,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and you can see these are the previous pathways,

73
0:03:17.98,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and you can see this process of river-jumping continues

74
0:03:20.66,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as this river moves farther away from its major course.

75
0:03:23.74,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So you can imagine in landscapes like this,

76
0:03:25.82,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where rivers move around frequently,

77
0:03:28.46,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it's really important to understand when, where and how they're going to jump.

78
0:03:32.98,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But these kinds of processes also happen a lot closer to home as well.

79
0:03:37.46,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So in the United States,

80
0:03:39.3,000 --> 0:03:43,000
we have the Mississippi River that drains most of the continental US.

81
0:03:43.38,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It pushes material from the Rocky Mountains

82
0:03:45.78,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and from the Great Plains.

83
0:03:47.34,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It drains it and moves it all the way across America

84
0:03:50.58,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and dumps it out in the Gulf of Mexico.

85
0:03:53.14,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So this is the course of the Mississippi that we're familiar with today,

86
0:03:56.62,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but it didn't always flow in this direction.

87
0:03:58.74,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If we use the geologic record,

88
0:04:00.42,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we can reconstruct where it went in the past.

89
0:04:03.94,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So for example, this red area here

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is where we know the Mississippi River flowed and deposited material

91
0:04:09.82,000 --> 0:04:1,000
about 4,600 years ago.

92
0:04:12.06,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Then about 3,500 years ago it moved

93
0:04:14.18,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to follow the course outlined here in orange.

94
0:04:16.58,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And it kept moving and it keeps moving.

95
0:04:18.62,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So here's about 2,000 years ago,

96
0:04:20.54,000 --> 0:04:21,000
a thousand years ago,

97
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
700 years ago.

98
0:04:23.5,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And it was only as recently as 500 years ago

99
0:04:25.94,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that it occupied the pathway that we're familiar with today.

100
0:04:29.899,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So these processes are really important,

101
0:04:31.86,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and especially here, this delta area,

102
0:04:34.74,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where these river-jumping events in the Mississippi

103
0:04:38.58,000 --> 0:04:4,000
are building land at the interface of the land and the sea.

104
0:04:41.42,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is really valuable real estate,

105
0:04:43.18,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and deltas like this are some of the most densely populated areas on our planet.

106
0:04:48.46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So understanding the dynamics of these landscapes,

107
0:04:50.94,000 --> 0:04:53,000
how they formed and how they will continue to change in the future

108
0:04:54.1,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is really important for the people that live there.

109
0:04:57.3,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So rivers also wiggle.

110
0:04:58.86,000 --> 0:05:,000
These are sort of bigger jumps that we've been talking about.

111
0:05:01.78,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I want to show you guys some river wiggles here.

112
0:05:04.06,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So we're going to fly down to the Amazon River basin,

113
0:05:06.62,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and here again we have a big river system

114
0:05:08.66,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that is draining and moving and plowing material from the Andean Mountains,

115
0:05:13.06,000 --> 0:05:14,000
transporting it across South America

116
0:05:14.9,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and dumping it out into the Atlantic Ocean.

117
0:05:18.38,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So if we zoom in here, you guys can see these nice, curvy river pathways.

118
0:05:23.1,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Again, they're really beautiful, but again, they're not static.

119
0:05:26.1,000 --> 0:05:27,000
These rivers wiggle around.

120
0:05:27.86,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We can use satellite imagery over the last 30 or so years

121
0:05:31.5,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to actually monitor how these change.

122
0:05:33.66,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So take a minute and just watch any bend or curve in this river,

123
0:05:37.86,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and you'll see it doesn't stay in the same place for very long.

124
0:05:40.86,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It changes and evolves and warps its pattern.

125
0:05:44.66,000 --> 0:05:46,000
If you look in this area in particular,

126
0:05:47.06,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I want you guys to notice there's a sort of a loop in the river

127
0:05:50.06,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that gets completely cut off.

128
0:05:51.5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's almost like a whip cracking

129
0:05:53.1,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and snaps off the pathway of the river at a certain spot.

130
0:05:56.18,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So just for reference, again,

131
0:05:57.82,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in this location, that river changed its course over four miles

132
0:06:02.78,000 --> 0:06:03,000
over the course of a season or two.

133
0:06:04.9,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So the landscapes that we live in on earth,

134
0:06:07.82,000 --> 0:06:09,000
as this material is being eroded from the mountains

135
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and transported to the sea,

136
0:06:11.62,000 --> 0:06:12,000
are wiggling around all the time.

137
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They're changing all the time,

138
0:06:14.74,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and we need to be able to understand these processes

139
0:06:17.22,000 --> 0:06:19,000
so we can manage and live sustainably on these landscapes.

140
0:06:19.98,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But it's hard to do if the only information we have

141
0:06:23.06,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is what's going on today at earth's surface.

142
0:06:25.42,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Right? We don't have a lot of observations.

143
0:06:27.5,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We only have 30 years' worth of satellite photos, for example.

144
0:06:32.34,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We need more observations to understand these processes more.

145
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And additionally, we need to know

146
0:06:36.9,000 --> 0:06:39,000
how these landscapes are going to respond to changing climate

147
0:06:40.14,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and to changing land use

148
0:06:41.42,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as we continue to occupy and modify earth's surface.

149
0:06:44.98,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So this is where the rocks come in.

150
0:06:47.54,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So as rivers flow,

151
0:06:50.06,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as they're bulldozing material from the mountains to the sea,

152
0:06:52.98,000 --> 0:06:55,000
sometimes bits of sand and clay and rock get stuck in the ground.

153
0:06:56.46,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And that stuff that gets stuck in the ground gets buried,

154
0:06:59.18,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and through time, we get big, thick accumulations of sediments

155
0:07:02.94,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that eventually turn into rocks.

156
0:07:04.98,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What this means is that we can go to places like this,

157
0:07:07.58,000 --> 0:07:09,000
where we see big, thick stacks of sedimentary rocks,

158
0:07:10.3,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and go back in time

159
0:07:11.82,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and see what the landscapes looked like in the past.

160
0:07:14.58,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We can do this to help reconstruct

161
0:07:16.74,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and understand how earth landscapes evolve.

162
0:07:21.98,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This is pretty convenient, too,

163
0:07:23.62,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because the earth has had sort of an epic history. Right?

164
0:07:26.62,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So this video here is a reconstruction of paleogeography

165
0:07:31.46,000 --> 0:07:34,000
for just the first 600 million years of earth's history.

166
0:07:35.1,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So just a little bit of time here.

167
0:07:37.1,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So as the plates move around,

168
0:07:39.86,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we know climate has changed, sea level has changed,

169
0:07:43.02,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we have a lot of different types of landscapes

170
0:07:46.7,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and different types of environments that we can go back --

171
0:07:49.46,000 --> 0:07:5,000
if we have a time machine --

172
0:07:50.86,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we can go back and look at,

173
0:07:52.22,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and we do indeed have a time machine

174
0:07:53.98,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because we can look at the rocks that were deposited at these times.

175
0:07:57.34,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So I'm going to give you an example of this

176
0:07:59.38,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and take you to a special time in earth's past.

177
0:08:01.62,000 --> 0:08:04,000
About 55 million years ago, there was a really abrupt warming event,

178
0:08:04.86,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and what happened was a whole bunch of carbon dioxide

179
0:08:07.38,000 --> 0:08:08,000
was released into earth's atmosphere,

180
0:08:09.22,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and it caused a rapid and pretty extreme global warming event.

181
0:08:13.1,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And when I say warm, I mean pretty warm,

182
0:08:15.78,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that there were things like crocodiles and palm trees

183
0:08:18.78,000 --> 0:08:21,000
as far north as Canada and as far south as Patagonia.

184
0:08:21.82,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So this was a pretty warm time and it happened really abruptly.

185
0:08:25.02,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So what we can do

186
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is we can go back and find rocks that were deposited at this time

187
0:08:29.34,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and reconstruct how the landscape changed in response to this warming event.

188
0:08:33.38,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So here, yay, rocks.

189
0:08:35.3,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:37.66,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Here's a pile of rocks.

191
0:08:39.42,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This yellow blob here,

192
0:08:41.06,000 --> 0:08:42,000
this is actually a fossil river,

193
0:08:42.82,000 --> 0:08:43,000
so just like this cartoon I showed,

194
0:08:44.511,000 --> 0:08:47,000
these are deposits that were laid down 55 million years ago.

195
0:08:47.82,000 --> 0:08:5,000
As geologists, we can go and look at these up close

196
0:08:50.94,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and reconstruct the landscape.

197
0:08:53.06,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So here's another example.

198
0:08:54.58,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The yellow blob here is a fossil river.

199
0:08:57.06,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Here's another one above it.

200
0:08:58.62,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We can go and look in detail and make measurements and observations,

201
0:09:01.94,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and we can measure features.

202
0:09:03.34,000 --> 0:09:05,000
For example, the features I just highlighted there

203
0:09:05.74,000 --> 0:09:08,000
tell us that this particular river was probably about three feet deep.

204
0:09:09.22,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You could wade across this cute little stream

205
0:09:11.34,000 --> 0:09:13,000
if you were walking around 55 million years ago.

206
0:09:14.3,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The reddish stuff that's above and below those channels,

207
0:09:17.22,000 --> 0:09:18,000
those are ancient soil deposits.

208
0:09:19.02,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So we can look at those to tell us what lived and grew on the landscape

209
0:09:22.9,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and to understand how these rivers were interacting with their floodplains.

210
0:09:27.5,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So we can look in detail and reconstruct with some specificity

211
0:09:31.9,000 --> 0:09:33,000
how these rivers flowed and what the landscapes looked like.

212
0:09:34.78,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So when we do this for this particular place

213
0:09:37.98,000 --> 0:09:38,000
at this time,

214
0:09:39.22,000 --> 0:09:41,000
if we look what happened before this abrupt warming event,

215
0:09:41.98,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the rivers kind of carved their way down from the mountains to the sea,

216
0:09:45.62,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and they looked maybe similar to what I showed you in the Amazon River basin.

217
0:09:50.78,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But right at the onset of this climate change event,

218
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the rivers change dramatically.

219
0:09:55.3,000 --> 0:09:56,000
All of a sudden they got much broader,

220
0:09:57.18,000 --> 0:10:,000
and they started to slide back and forth across the landscape more readily.

221
0:10:01.7,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Eventually, the rivers reverted back to a state that was more similar

222
0:10:05.62,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to what they would have looked like before this climate event,

223
0:10:09.46,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but it took a long, long time.

224
0:10:12.06,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So we can go back in earth's time and do these kinds of reconstructions

225
0:10:15.94,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and understand how earth's landscape has changed

226
0:10:18.58,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in response to a climate event like this or a land use event.

227
0:10:22.38,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So some of the ways that rivers change

228
0:10:24.5,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or the reasons that rivers change their pattern and their movements

229
0:10:29.3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is because of things like with extra water falling on the land's surface

230
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
when climate is hotter,

231
0:10:35.22,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we can move more sediment and erode more sediment,

232
0:10:37.78,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and that changes how rivers behave.

233
0:10:40.5,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So ultimately,

234
0:10:42.62,000 --> 0:10:44,000
as long as earth's surface is our home,

235
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we need to carefully manage the resources and risks

236
0:10:48.66,000 --> 0:10:5,000
associated with living in dynamic environments.

237
0:10:51.66,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And I think the only way we can really do that sustainably

238
0:10:55.62,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is if we include information

239
0:10:57.86,000 --> 0:11:01,000
about how landscapes evolved and behaved in earth's past.

240
0:11:01.98,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Thank you.

241
0:11:03.22,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Applause)

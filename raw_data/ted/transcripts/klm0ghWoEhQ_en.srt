0:00:13.12,000 --> 0:00:16,000
[This talk contains graphic images]

2
0:00:17.68,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My parents always wanted me to be a doctor.

3
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But a doctor that studies how vultures eat dead things

4
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is probably not the type of doctor my parents had in mind.

5
0:00:29.2,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:30.96,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I study vulture scavenging behavior and how vultures affect crime scenes.

7
0:00:35.24,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm here to talk to you about how we take vultures for granted

8
0:00:38.6,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in forensic science.

9
0:00:40.8,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Before we do that, I want to tell you a story.

10
0:00:43.04,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So we're going to take a trip, all 1,000 of us.

11
0:00:45.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's May 2014 and we're standing in a park in Nashville, Tennessee,

12
0:00:49.92,000 --> 0:00:5,000
because we've been at a horse race.

13
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:53,000
As we wait for the porta potty,

14
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:56,000
we see two ladies in their Sunday best:

15
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:01,000
heels, pearls and lovely, floppy derby hats.

16
0:01:01.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
At any moment, we expect them to start talking

17
0:01:03.56,000 --> 0:01:05,000
about their grandma's fine china.

18
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But they don't.

19
0:01:07.68,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Instead, we hear them say,

20
0:01:10.56,000 --> 0:01:11,000
"Oh, look.

21
0:01:11.96,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Something must be dead."

22
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We look up and to the left and see vultures circling round and round.

23
0:01:20.76,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It occurred to me at this very moment

24
0:01:22.6,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that if these ladies at the derby

25
0:01:24.6,000 --> 0:01:26,000
are aware of vulture's connection to death,

26
0:01:26.88,000 --> 0:01:29,000
then why aren't we talking more about these birds at crime scenes?

27
0:01:31.12,000 --> 0:01:34,000
People know that vultures are connected to death.

28
0:01:34.92,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But they don't really understand how.

29
0:01:38.4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
For example, here's an email I received from a detective in Louisiana:

30
0:01:44.04,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"Lauren, there's been a kidnapping.

31
0:01:47.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What buzzards or vultures do we have in Louisiana?"

32
0:01:52.36,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Before we address the kidnapping,

33
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'll first address this buzzard/vulture question I get all the time.

34
0:01:57.76,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Buzzards don't live in the United States.

35
0:02:00.2,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They are hawks that live in Europe.

36
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The big black birds you see circling in the sky within the US are vultures.

37
0:02:08.2,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The two types of vultures that live in Louisiana

38
0:02:10.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
are the turkey vulture and black vulture.

39
0:02:13.92,000 --> 0:02:16,000
To fully understand the role of vultures in forensic science,

40
0:02:17.4,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I'll walk you through this forensic case.

41
0:02:20.12,000 --> 0:02:23,000
From the email, certain things become apparent.

42
0:02:24.32,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We can assume the detective thinks the individual is dead.

43
0:02:28.4,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And he wants to use the birds to try to find the body.

44
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Like the ladies in Nashville,

45
0:02:34.56,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the detective thinks that vultures circling in the sky

46
0:02:38.2,000 --> 0:02:39,000
will lead him to the body.

47
0:02:40.52,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It's not that simple.

48
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I don't know if you've ever seen a vulture up close

49
0:02:46.44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
or spent much time with them,

50
0:02:47.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but they're huge, huge.

51
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Six-foot wingspan.

52
0:02:51.04,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Vultures circle in the air

53
0:02:53.12,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because they are too big to flap their wings and fly,

54
0:02:55.96,000 --> 0:02:56,000
so they soar.

55
0:02:57.48,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They soar in thermals, which are vortexes or little tornadoes

56
0:03:01.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
caused by pressure differences in the air

57
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that form throughout the day as the sun heats up the ground.

58
0:03:07.44,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Therefore, when you see a circling vulture,

59
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the bird is usually traveling from point A to B,

60
0:03:14.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
rather than circling above something dead.

61
0:03:17.44,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Actually, if you want to use a vulture to try to find a body,

62
0:03:22.04,000 --> 0:03:26,000
look for a vulture in a tree or on a fence post.

63
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Vultures are too big and slow to hunt.

64
0:03:28.92,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So they have to scavenge.

65
0:03:31.08,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In fact, vultures are the only animals in the world

66
0:03:33.96,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that depend upon death as a food source.

67
0:03:36.44,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The turkey vulture that you see here is super cool,

68
0:03:39.72,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because it's one of the few bird species that can actually smell.

69
0:03:42.8,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It hones in on the deceased by sensing a chemical

70
0:03:45.6,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that's coming off the body during decay.

71
0:03:48.84,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The evolutionary role of the vulture

72
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is to rid the earth of harmful toxins produced following death.

73
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Once death has been detected,

74
0:03:58.6,000 --> 0:04:,000
the turkey vulture lands and quickly scavenges.

75
0:04:02.36,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Vultures usually remove the eyes first,

76
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
then tear the skin,

77
0:04:06.76,000 --> 0:04:09,000
start pulling the tissues, and leave you with a skeleton.

78
0:04:11.04,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Therefore, the importance of vultures is not in the air,

79
0:04:14.24,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but on the ground.

80
0:04:16.32,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Vulture scavenging is somewhat gruesome.

81
0:04:18.96,000 --> 0:04:21,000
If you're ever on a bad first date,

82
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:23,000
just reference this talk,

83
0:04:23.6,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and I don't think you'll have to worry

84
0:04:25.48,000 --> 0:04:27,000
about your potential suitor giving you another call.

85
0:04:28.04,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:30.44,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Although gruesome, vultures are key forensic players,

87
0:04:34.52,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and here's why.

88
0:04:36.28,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Vultures will consume a dead human

89
0:04:39.92,000 --> 0:04:41,000
just like they will consume roadkill.

90
0:04:42.28,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But you don't ever hear about that,

91
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and it's because vultures are so good at what they do.

92
0:04:47.24,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If vultures depend on death for survival and if they scavenge humans,

93
0:04:52.12,000 --> 0:04:55,000
then how can vultures be absent from forensic textbooks and training manuals?

94
0:04:56.52,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The answer:

95
0:04:58.12,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the tradition has been for researchers to exclude animal scavengers

96
0:05:02.24,000 --> 0:05:03,000
from decomposition studies

97
0:05:03.52,000 --> 0:05:07,000
by placing a cage over the decaying subject matter.

98
0:05:08.24,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Why?

99
0:05:09.68,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Because researchers were afraid an animal would run away with their subject matter

100
0:05:13.6,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and they wouldn't have any data to report --

101
0:05:15.77,000 --> 0:05:2,000
consequently excluding animals' results in a lengthy skeletonization process,

102
0:05:21.44,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and this information is currently what detectives use during investigations.

103
0:05:26.96,000 --> 0:05:29,000
A lot of times at a crime scene when people see a skeletonized body,

104
0:05:30.24,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they think, "Wow, this has been here for a really long time undiscovered."

105
0:05:35.56,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

106
0:05:38.2,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Vultures accelerate decay.

107
0:05:40.64,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And the skeletonized body could have been there

108
0:05:42.88,000 --> 0:05:46,000
for as little as five days if scavenged by vultures.

109
0:05:47.12,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The failure to account for vulture scavenging

110
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
can result in forensic scientists inaccurately estimating

111
0:05:52.76,000 --> 0:05:54,000
how long someone has been dead

112
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and then searching through the wrong missing person's files.

113
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Therefore, the goal is to get forensic scientists to focus on vulture evidence

114
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and to get law enforcement to consider vulture scavenging

115
0:06:05.8,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and a possible recent death when skeletal remains are found.

116
0:06:10.64,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Let's get back to the importance of the kidnapping case.

117
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I responded to the detectives

118
0:06:14.96,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and told them that vultures like areas with water.

119
0:06:17.36,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They like areas with white-tailed deer,

120
0:06:19.28,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they typically arrive within the first five days following death,

121
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:25,000
they're going to leave an intact spinal column and feathers.

122
0:06:27.24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The detectives write back and say,

123
0:06:28.96,000 --> 0:06:3,000
"We found the body buried in a shallow grave.

124
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We also found the feathers you mentioned."

125
0:06:35.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But there appeared to be a problem

126
0:06:37.36,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because the feathers were located 40 yards from where the body was found.

127
0:06:41.88,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The feathers were next to a bloody pine cone.

128
0:06:44.4,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Vultures aren't attracted to blood, and they typically don't wander.

129
0:06:47.63,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They might wander 40 feet, but they're not going to wander 40 yards.

130
0:06:51.8,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That would be a waste of energy

131
0:06:53.52,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for a bird that doesn't know when it will get its next meal.

132
0:06:58.04,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So my first job here was to determine if vultures were at the scene.

133
0:07:02.08,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Indeed, the feather by the pine cone was consistent with the turkey vulture.

134
0:07:06.84,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So why in the world would a vulture wander 40 yards?

135
0:07:11.68,000 --> 0:07:12,000
One of the reasons I love vultures

136
0:07:13.4,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is because they tend to operate in a manner

137
0:07:15.44,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that can be explained by biology and physics.

138
0:07:17.6,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I started mentally going through the numerous bating experiments

139
0:07:20.68,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I had conducted at a body farm in Texas.

140
0:07:23.4,000 --> 0:07:26,000
A body farm is a place where you can donate your body to science.

141
0:07:26.8,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I also went through my experiences with trapping

142
0:07:31.12,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and GPS tagging vultures.

143
0:07:33.72,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And then the year-long process of monitoring vultures

144
0:07:36.24,000 --> 0:07:37,000
via remote GPS technology.

145
0:07:38.52,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Next, I brought up my field notes and had an "Aha!" moment.

146
0:07:42.64,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I knew of two things that would lure a vulture 40 yards from a body.

147
0:07:47.68,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Guts and brain matter.

148
0:07:51.28,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I presented this information to the detectives

149
0:07:53.96,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and learned that they suspected the victim had been incapacitated

150
0:07:57.08,000 --> 0:07:59,000
by blunt force trauma to the head.

151
0:07:59.12,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The blow to the head was thought to have occurred

152
0:08:01.48,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in the area where the pine cone was found,

153
0:08:03.52,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and then the victim was drug 40 yards and buried in a shallow grave.

154
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This suggested that brain matter was the lure for the vulture

155
0:08:13.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and illustrates how studying vulture behavior

156
0:08:17.04,000 --> 0:08:19,000
can help piece together some of the evidence.

157
0:08:20.88,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The detectives also sent me this photo.

158
0:08:23.76,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The victim's arm is sticking up out of the grave.

159
0:08:28.28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
As a forensic scientist, you have to think about the whole picture.

160
0:08:31.96,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The feather by the pine cone indicated that vultures were at the scene.

161
0:08:37.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This crime scene photo also depicts

162
0:08:39.8,000 --> 0:08:42,000
characteristic vulture scavenging behavior.

163
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We zoom in, we see a white down feather,

164
0:08:46.52,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which is characteristic of the turkey vulture.

165
0:08:49.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Also note that the skin has a cut-like tear near the wrist.

166
0:08:54.76,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The turkey vulture smells the decay, lands.

167
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It can get through the pine needles,

168
0:09:00.04,000 --> 0:09:01,000
pull out the hand,

169
0:09:01.32,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it's going to tear the skin with its beak

170
0:09:03.84,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and then start pulling the soft tissues away from the bone.

171
0:09:06.72,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Just tear and pull, tear and pull, tear and pull.

172
0:09:12.52,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This photo illustrates the scavenging efficiency of vultures.

173
0:09:16.4,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This is important because it helps support the time line

174
0:09:19.44,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the detectives are putting together for the murder.

175
0:09:22.6,000 --> 0:09:23,000
There's not a whole lot of evidence.

176
0:09:24.36,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You're not likely going to see the vultures at the crime scene.

177
0:09:27.8,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Instead, vultures just leave these very subtle clues.

178
0:09:31.08,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Rather than looking for the vulture,

179
0:09:33.36,000 --> 0:09:36,000
look for the feathers and pristine bones.

180
0:09:37.24,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Vultures are important

181
0:09:38.52,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because they are so good and fast at what they do.

182
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
They're like tornadoes.

183
0:09:43.84,000 --> 0:09:45,000
If you blink, you will miss them.

184
0:09:47.52,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I provided my opinion about the vulture evidence to the detective.

185
0:09:51.2,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And he presented the vulture evidence in court.

186
0:09:54.28,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The kidnapping case was a death penalty case.

187
0:09:58,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And the defendant was found guilty.

188
0:10:00.84,000 --> 0:10:04,000
This case illustrates how studying vulture behavior

189
0:10:05.24,000 --> 0:10:07,000
helps innovate forensic science.

190
0:10:08.76,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Someone who has been murdered

191
0:10:11.48,000 --> 0:10:14,000
deserves the most thorough investigation possible.

192
0:10:15.44,000 --> 0:10:17,000
When we include vultures in forensic studies,

193
0:10:17.6,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we paint a more thorough picture of what happened, when it happened

194
0:10:21.28,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and who it happened to.

195
0:10:23.6,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So, the next time you're at a crime scene with a dead body --

196
0:10:28.04,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

197
0:10:29.8,000 --> 0:10:31,000
look to the ground to find the clues vultures have left.

198
0:10:32.8,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And if anyone ever brings up vultures on a date,

199
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
you'll know they're a keeper.

200
0:10:39.36,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Thank you.

201
0:10:40.6,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Applause)

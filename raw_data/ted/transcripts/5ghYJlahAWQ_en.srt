0:00:13.041,000 --> 0:00:15,000
If you told me five years ago

3
0:00:15.584,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that today I'd be delivering a talk

4
0:00:18.171,000 --> 0:00:22,000
about our individual power to make a difference,

5
0:00:22.198,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I would have cringed.

6
0:00:24.645,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It was my job to study huge global systems.

7
0:00:29.336,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was a researcher at NASA using satellite data to study the big picture.

8
0:00:36.053,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You can see a lot of things from space,

9
0:00:38.899,000 --> 0:00:41,000
like every ecosystem on Earth

10
0:00:42.157,000 --> 0:00:45,000
being threatened from pretty much every angle

11
0:00:45.766,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and global inequality in air and water safety.

12
0:00:50.751,000 --> 0:00:52,000
These kinds of things would keep me up at night.

13
0:00:53.494,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And then outside of work, I'd use this bird's-eye view

14
0:00:56.92,000 --> 0:00:58,000
while thinking about our huge social structures

15
0:00:59.272,000 --> 0:01:02,000
like education and media and health care,

16
0:01:03.133,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it looked to me like they were all really struggling, too.

17
0:01:06.25,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So I felt like the world was just trapped in this huge self-amplifying system

18
0:01:12.34,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that was just spiraling towards destruction.

19
0:01:15.237,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And of course I wanted to do something about this,

20
0:01:18.756,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I felt so small and utterly powerless.

21
0:01:23.06,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But I started to feel a little differently as my perspective shifted

22
0:01:27.189,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from the macro towards the micro.

23
0:01:30.974,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It began with bumblebees.

24
0:01:33.463,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I was using satellite imagery and field research

25
0:01:36.533,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to study these amazing, cute pollinators

26
0:01:40.25,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to see how they were doing in the midst of their own environmental crisis

27
0:01:43.834,000 --> 0:01:44,000
in Southern California.

28
0:01:45.39,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And from the macro view, I saw 22-lane freeways,

29
0:01:49.964,000 --> 0:01:5,000
endless suburban sprawl

30
0:01:51.835,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and water being diverted from parched rivers

31
0:01:55.349,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to grow lawns in the desert.

32
0:01:59.204,000 --> 0:02:,000
It was pretty grim.

33
0:02:01.652,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But on the ground,

34
0:02:03.489,000 --> 0:02:06,000
there were actually some small opportunities for optimism,

35
0:02:06.714,000 --> 0:02:07,000
these tiny patches of resources

36
0:02:08.535,000 --> 0:02:1,000
known as "habitat fragments."

37
0:02:11.355,000 --> 0:02:15,000
If the right kinds of plants were growing along the edges of a Costco parking lot,

38
0:02:15.877,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and if in the neighborhoods nearby

39
0:02:17.755,000 --> 0:02:19,000
there were native plants in people's gardens,

40
0:02:20.074,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and in the canyons that were too steep for people to put their suburbs in,

41
0:02:24.218,000 --> 0:02:26,000
there were native plants instead of grasses

42
0:02:26.771,000 --> 0:02:28,000
then all of these in-between spaces

43
0:02:29.141,000 --> 0:02:33,000
would actually add up to create a network of habitat fragments.

44
0:02:33.847,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And this network meant that the bees could traverse through the concrete desert

45
0:02:38.596,000 --> 0:02:4,000
feeding from and pollinating the native plants.

46
0:02:42.059,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And these plants that the bees depend on and that the bees sustain are essential.

47
0:02:47.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They stabilize our steep hillsides.

48
0:02:50.446,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They provide food and homes to thousands of amazing species of animals,

49
0:02:55.507,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and, critically, they are helping to curb our devastating cycle of wildfires

50
0:03:02.119,000 --> 0:03:06,000
by preventing the growth of those invasive grasses

51
0:03:06.238,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that fuel the vicious flames that we're all too familiar with.

52
0:03:11.266,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It's a really vital and interconnected system,

53
0:03:13.765,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and some people could see how they were a part of it,

54
0:03:17.067,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and so they acted as habitat fragment gardeners.

55
0:03:21.006,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They planted native plants in their yards,

56
0:03:23.41,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and they even were tending to the land in corporate parks

57
0:03:26.761,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and in public canyons.

58
0:03:28.247,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In my research, I could actually see the impact

59
0:03:31.157,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that even one passionate gardener could make.

60
0:03:33.871,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And then, repeated across the region,

61
0:03:36.198,000 --> 0:03:4,000
their habitat fragments were adding up to make a more resilient ecosystem --

62
0:03:41.058,000 --> 0:03:44,000
not a perfect system, not by a long shot,

63
0:03:44.287,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but at least a system that was less likely to totally collapse

64
0:03:48.007,000 --> 0:03:51,000
under impending pressures like further development and drought.

65
0:03:52.991,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So I was looking at the world through this lens

66
0:03:55.258,000 --> 0:03:58,000
when I found myself in the waiting room of a public hospital in Brooklyn

67
0:03:59.136,000 --> 0:04:,000
with my partner, Charles.

68
0:04:00.959,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We were sitting across from a group of teenagers

69
0:04:03.957,000 --> 0:04:04,000
who were slumped in their chairs

70
0:04:05.723,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and bored out of their minds

71
0:04:08.029,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and just refreshing their phones over and over again.

72
0:04:11.547,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And in a neighborhood

73
0:04:13.296,000 --> 0:04:16,000
with some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the city,

74
0:04:16.975,000 --> 0:04:19,000
this waiting room felt like a social habitat fragment

75
0:04:20.284,000 --> 0:04:21,000
just waiting to happen.

76
0:04:22.445,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So, we did some research to see what kinds of resources could we add

77
0:04:26.395,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to spaces like this one

78
0:04:27.855,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that would make an impact.

79
0:04:29.743,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And we settled on museums.

80
0:04:33.509,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Museums are the most trusted source of public information,

81
0:04:36.89,000 --> 0:04:38,000
more than the media and more than the government,

82
0:04:39.424,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but they also cluster in wealthier neighborhoods.

83
0:04:43.017,000 --> 0:04:46,000
New York has 85 museums in Manhattan,

84
0:04:46.848,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the Bronx has eight,

85
0:04:49.458,000 --> 0:04:52,000
even though these two boroughs have almost the same size population.

86
0:04:53.728,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And then expensive tickets mean that a lot of people can't go to museums

87
0:04:57.451,000 --> 0:04:58,000
even if they live nearby.

88
0:04:58.9,000 --> 0:05:,000
And these little injustices, they just go on and on

89
0:05:01.701,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and they add up to create sweeping inequalities

90
0:05:04.445,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in knowledge and empowerment.

91
0:05:07.346,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Across the US,

92
0:05:08.706,000 --> 0:05:12,000
almost 90 percent of visitors to art museums are white,

93
0:05:12.933,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and even at the Smithsonian's network of free museums,

94
0:05:16.462,000 --> 0:05:19,000
almost half of their adult visitors have graduate degrees,

95
0:05:19.884,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which, like, 10 percent of the broader population has.

96
0:05:23.539,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So it became clear to us

97
0:05:25.311,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that even though museums are these amazing educational and social resources,

98
0:05:31.277,000 --> 0:05:32,000
they're not reaching everyone.

99
0:05:33.267,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And a lot of museums are aware of this, and they're trying to change it,

100
0:05:36.955,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but there's all these structural hurdles that are slowing them down.

101
0:05:40.867,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So we set out to create a distributed network

102
0:05:43.392,000 --> 0:05:45,000
of museum habitat fragments.

103
0:05:46.295,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Working from a donated shipping container

104
0:05:48.769,000 --> 0:05:51,000
with the volunteer help of our friends

105
0:05:51.969,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and dozens of very generous scientists

106
0:05:53.892,000 --> 0:05:54,000
from all across the globe,

107
0:05:55.73,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we built our first prototype:

108
0:05:58.488,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the Smallest Mollusk Museum.

109
0:06:00.464,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:02.207,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Mollusks are these tentacled, slimy shape-shifters

111
0:06:06.231,000 --> 0:06:09,000
like oysters and octopuses and the giant squid,

112
0:06:09.451,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and if you've ever seen an alien in a movie,

113
0:06:12.817,000 --> 0:06:14,000
then I'll bet you it was inspired by a mollusk.

114
0:06:15.975,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Their slimy sci-fi vibes

115
0:06:18.176,000 --> 0:06:21,000
make them really fun tour guides for a biology museum,

116
0:06:21.565,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and they can teach us about the systems that we all share,

117
0:06:24.424,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with a wake-up call.

118
0:06:26.467,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Of all the animal extinctions documented since the 1500s,

119
0:06:30.62,000 --> 0:06:34,000
more than 40 percent have been our friends, the mollusks.

120
0:06:36.302,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So we tested this museum across the city

121
0:06:38.982,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to see if it resonated with all kinds of visitors,

122
0:06:41.585,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and it did.

123
0:06:43.199,000 --> 0:06:45,000
People really liked learning from it.

124
0:06:45.982,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So we built a fleet of tiny science museums,

125
0:06:49.812,000 --> 0:06:52,000
each one small enough to fit into preexisting locations

126
0:06:53.825,000 --> 0:06:56,000
with information dense enough that they could still pack a punch.

127
0:06:56.993,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And they're modular, so they can be distributed

128
0:06:59.315,000 --> 0:07:01,000
at a scale that can reach everyone.

129
0:07:01.803,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And then we partnered with libraries

130
0:07:04.252,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and community centers and transit hubs

131
0:07:06.532,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and the public hospitals

132
0:07:08.34,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so that we could transform their in-between spaces

133
0:07:11.203,000 --> 0:07:13,000
into habitat fragments for social learning.

134
0:07:14.553,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And, fittingly, we named our fleet of museums "MICRO."

135
0:07:19.689,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Even though each habitat fragment is small,

136
0:07:22.56,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it provides the essentials.

137
0:07:23.902,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It draws people in so that they can explore

138
0:07:27.25,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and learn together in a social way.

139
0:07:29.726,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And then, distributed across the landscape,

140
0:07:31.996,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we're able to invite people everywhere

141
0:07:33.846,000 --> 0:07:35,000
into conversations around science.

142
0:07:36.77,000 --> 0:07:39,000
When we partnered with a public hospital in the South Bronx,

143
0:07:40.318,000 --> 0:07:44,000
we became the Bronx's first and only science museum.

144
0:07:46.329,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Yeah, that's really weird. (Laughs)

145
0:07:49.231,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:50.348,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And really quickly,

147
0:07:52.167,000 --> 0:07:54,000
families started coming by with their kids

148
0:07:54.948,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and schools started arranging field trips,

149
0:07:57.772,000 --> 0:08:01,000
all to this tiny museum in the front lobby of the public hospital.

150
0:08:02.304,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

151
0:08:03.875,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And the museum became so popular

152
0:08:05.789,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that we started hiring local students to be museum docents,

153
0:08:09.818,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so they could lead tours and activities for all the talented kids.

154
0:08:14.293,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And every spark of curiosity that we're able to fuel

155
0:08:19.832,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and each new fact learned

156
0:08:22.145,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and every new friend made at the museum

157
0:08:24.86,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and every kid who can have a meaningful and important after-school job,

158
0:08:29.481,000 --> 0:08:31,000
it all contributes to a stronger system.

159
0:08:32.746,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So today, I try to keep the MICRO view in mind.

160
0:08:36.336,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I'm always examining how small actions can add up

161
0:08:40.119,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to create shifts

162
0:08:42.271,000 --> 0:08:44,000
at the macro scale of systems.

163
0:08:45.668,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And honestly, I'm seeing a lot of really good things.

164
0:08:48.969,000 --> 0:08:53,000
There are habitat fragments everywhere, nurtured by talented, passionate,

165
0:08:54.05,000 --> 0:08:56,000
strategic individuals in groups of all sizes,

166
0:08:56.617,000 --> 0:09:,000
who are building towards systems with more equal access to food

167
0:09:00.788,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and employment, health care, housing,

168
0:09:04.005,000 --> 0:09:08,000
political empowerment, education and healthy environments.

169
0:09:08.92,000 --> 0:09:09,000
One by one, together,

170
0:09:10.82,000 --> 0:09:11,000
we're filling gaps,

171
0:09:12.582,000 --> 0:09:15,000
strengthening the systems that we're all a part of.

172
0:09:16.182,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We have to work on the big institutions too, of course.

173
0:09:19.451,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's just that they're so slow,

174
0:09:21.049,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and we're living in the midst of rapid change.

175
0:09:23.86,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's a defining feature of our time.

176
0:09:26.834,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So maybe in some cases our small actions

177
0:09:29.736,000 --> 0:09:31,000
can be Band-Aids until the big guys catch up.

178
0:09:32.518,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But without us, what are they going to be catching up to?

179
0:09:37.342,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Am I still scared about the world?

180
0:09:40.225,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Yes. (Laughs)

181
0:09:42.509,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That's why I'm talking to you.

182
0:09:44.799,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The world needs so many more habitat fragments.

183
0:09:48.302,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So, if you've been feeling overwhelmed or powerless lately,

184
0:09:52.957,000 --> 0:09:56,000
then I'm asking you to please try this very small strategy on for size,

185
0:09:57.662,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and let's see how it goes.

186
0:09:59.973,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Step one: zoom in.

187
0:10:02.578,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's not one huge system

188
0:10:04.439,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that's just barreling unstoppably towards destruction.

189
0:10:07.383,000 --> 0:10:1,000
What we have are many overlapping systems,

190
0:10:10.579,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and the ways that they interact determine everything.

191
0:10:14.225,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Step two: look for the resource gaps,

192
0:10:16.99,000 --> 0:10:18,000
because that's where you can make the biggest difference.

193
0:10:20.437,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And do some research to understand how your ideas are going to interact

194
0:10:25.419,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with the systems that are already on the ground.

195
0:10:28.327,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Step three: find the other habitat fragments.

196
0:10:31.788,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Find out how they can support you and how you can support them,

197
0:10:35.296,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because we're building a network together.

198
0:10:38.387,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And step four: transform your fragment.

199
0:10:43.255,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You might not have the leverage to change multiple systems at once,

200
0:10:49.473,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but there are so many small, meaningful and strategic things

201
0:10:54.056,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that each of us can do.

202
0:10:56.27,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And there are a lot of us,

203
0:10:58.918,000 --> 0:11:,000
so it will add up.

204
0:11:01.71,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Thank you.

205
0:11:02.929,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

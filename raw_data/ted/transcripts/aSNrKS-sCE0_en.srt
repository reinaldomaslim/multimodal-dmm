1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was trying to think, how is sync connected to happiness,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and it occurred to me that for some reason we take pleasure in synchronizing.

3
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We like to dance together, we like singing together.

4
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help

5
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
with a first experiment today. The experiment is --

6
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,

7
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that you did it in a typical North American way,

8
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that is, you were raucous and incoherent.

9
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.

10
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Do you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would --

11
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
no, you haven't practiced, as far as I know --

12
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
can you get it together to clap in sync?

13
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Clapping)

14
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Whoa! Now, that's what we call emergent behavior.

15
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I didn't expect that, but -- I mean, I expected you could synchronize.

17
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.

18
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It's interesting.

19
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So what do we make of that? First of all, we know that you're all brilliant.

21
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.

22
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Some trained musicians out there.

23
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Is that what enabled you to synchronize?

24
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So to put the question a little more seriously,

25
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,

26
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for spontaneous synchronization.

27
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Do you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?

28
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?

29
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?

30
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.

31
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,

32
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.

33
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.

34
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's a deep tendency toward order in nature

35
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.

36
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not.

37
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But there is a countervailing force in the universe --

38
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme.

39
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now, to get into that, let me begin with what might have occurred to you immediately

40
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,

41
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which is the glorious example of birds that flock together,

42
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or fish swimming in organized schools.

43
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So these are not particularly intelligent creatures,

44
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.

45
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This is from a BBC show called "Predators,"

46
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.

47
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,

48
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.

49
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.

50
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,

51
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
wondering how it could be possible.

52
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.

53
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
These creatures are not choreographed.

54
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They're choreographing themselves.

55
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And only today is science starting to figure out how it works.

56
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,

57
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that shows how swarms work.

58
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There are just three simple rules.

59
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.

60
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.

61
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And third, they're all attracted to each other,

62
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but they try to keep a small distance apart.

63
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And when you build those three rules in,

64
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
automatically you start to see swarms

65
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.

66
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.

67
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.

68
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.

69
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, all this changes when a predator enters the scene.

70
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.

71
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Here on the model you see the predator attacking.

72
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The prey move out in random directions,

73
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,

74
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
so there's this constant splitting and reforming.

75
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And you see that in nature.

76
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Keep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,

77
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.

78
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.

79
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That is, out of the desire to save itself,

80
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
each creature is following these rules,

81
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and that leads to something that's safe for all of them.

82
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.

83
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,

84
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
so you can think of several.

85
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
As I say, if you're in a swarm, your odds of being the unlucky one

86
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
are reduced as compared to a small group.

87
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There are many eyes to spot danger.

88
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,

89
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,

90
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
that actually waves of panic can propagate,

91
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
sending messages over great distances.

92
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You'll see -- let's see, it's coming up possibly at the very end -- maybe not.

93
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Information can be sent over half a kilometer away

94
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in a very short time through this mechanism.

95
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Yes, it's happening here.

96
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.

97
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,

98
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
from that computer model, what's going on.

99
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
As I say, it's just those three simple rules,

100
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
plus the one about watch out for predators.

101
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There doesn't seem to be anything mystical about this.

102
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.

103
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.

104
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding.

105
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
A computer is, in a way, just another experiment.

106
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works

107
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
and to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.

108
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
How do the rules give rise to the patterns?

109
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There is one case that we have begun to understand better,

110
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and it's the case of fireflies.

111
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
If you see fireflies in North America,

112
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
like so many North American sorts of things,

113
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.

114
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They each do their own thing, flashing on and off,

115
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
paying no attention to their neighbors.

116
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But in Southeast Asia -- places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo --

117
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.

118
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You can see it every night along the river banks.

119
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.

120
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Specifically, it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,

121
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.

122
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me."

123
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Music)

124
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In a second I'm going to show you a slow motion of a single firefly

125
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.

126
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Then on, and then off -- a 30th of a second, there.

127
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.

128
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
On, more on and then off.

129
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles --

130
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them

131
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.

132
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
For a long time it was not believed

133
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake,

134
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.

135
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
No one believed them.

136
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.

137
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And for a long time, even after it was documented,

138
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.

139
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids

140
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency

141
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to see patterns where there are none.

142
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video,

143
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that they really were very well synchronized.

144
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Okay, well, the issue then is, do we need to be alive

145
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to see this kind of spontaneous order,

146
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and I've already hinted that the answer is no.

147
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Well, you don't have to be a whole creature.

148
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You can even be just a single cell.

149
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Like, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.

150
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They're keeping you alive.

151
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,

152
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,

153
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
have an electrical rhythm -- a voltage up and down --

154
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to send a signal to the ventricles to pump.

155
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell.

156
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison

157
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
for the pacemaker to work correctly.

158
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I don't want to give you the idea that synchrony is always a good idea.

159
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,

160
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
discharging in pathological concert.

161
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.

162
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.

163
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
If you look, for instance, at how lasers work,

164
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that would be a case of atomic synchrony.

165
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
In a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here

166
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
is that this light is incoherent --

167
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
many different colors and different frequencies,

168
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
sort of like the way you clapped initially --

169
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.

170
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It would be all atoms pulsating in unison,

171
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
emitting light of one color, one frequency.

172
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now comes the very risky part of my talk,

173
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize.

174
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Hold your breath for me.

175
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
What I have here are two empty water bottles.

176
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.

177
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.

178
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I have some metronomes here.

179
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Can you hear that?

180
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
All right, so, I've got a metronome,

181
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise.

182
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.

183
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take

184
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
another one set to the same setting.

185
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together,

186
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
there's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't.

187
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Maybe you'd better listen to them. I'll stand here.

188
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart

189
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same.

190
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Right? They did.

191
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.

192
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And the reason is that they're not able to communicate.

193
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Now, you might think that's a bizarre idea.

194
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
How can metronomes communicate?

195
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Well, they can communicate through mechanical forces.

196
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So I'm going to give them a chance to do that.

197
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?

198
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I'm going to put them on a movable platform,

199
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
which is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is.

200
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Let's see if we can get this to work.

201
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time

202
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
because otherwise the whole thing will tip over.

203
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat --

204
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
let me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that.

205
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

206
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
All right. So before any one goes out of sync, I'll just put those right there.

207
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
(Laughter)

208
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Now, that might seem a bit whimsical,

209
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order

210
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
sometimes has unexpected consequences.

211
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And a clear case of that,

212
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
was something that happened in London in the year 2000.

213
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London --

214
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,

215
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
first river crossing in over 100 years in London.

216
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
There was a big competition for the design of this bridge,

217
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team --

218
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in the TED spirit, actually -- of an architect --

219
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster --

220
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,

221
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and an engineering firm, Ove Arup.

222
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,

223
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
which was -- he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,

224
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,

225
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.

226
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
He would shoot his light saber across the abyss, making a blade of light,

227
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and then scamper across on this blade of light.

228
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
He said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.

229
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I want a blade of light across the Thames."

230
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So they built the blade of light,

231
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's --

232
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,

233
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
with cables that are out on the side.

234
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.

235
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
These cables were on the side of the bridge,

236
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames --

237
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
that's what's holding up this bridge.

238
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.

239
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.

240
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.

241
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So I want to first show you some interviews with people

242
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.

243
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Man: It really started moving sideways and slightly up and down,

244
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
rather like being on the boat.

245
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Woman: Yeah, it felt unstable, and it was very windy,

246
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely --

247
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe.

248
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Interviewer: Not up and down? Boy: No.

249
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Interviewer: And not forwards and backwards? Boy: No.

250
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Interviewer: Just sideways. About how much was it moving, do you think?

251
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Boy: It was about --

252
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Interviewer: I mean, that much, or this much?

253
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Boy: About the second one.

254
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Interviewer: This much? Boy: Yeah.

255
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Man: It was at least six, six to eight inches, I would have thought.

256
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Interviewer: Right, so, at least this much? Man: Oh, yes.

257
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
Woman: I remember wanting to get off.

258
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Interviewer: Oh, did you? Woman: Yeah. It felt odd.

259
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Interviewer: So it was enough to be scary? Woman: Yeah, but I thought that was just me.

260
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Interviewer: Ah! Now, tell me why you had to do this?

261
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Boy: We had to do this because, to keep in balance

262
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
because if you didn't keep your balance,

263
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
then you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.

264
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.

265
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.

266
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and --

267
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
oh, and short steps?

268
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Man: That's right. And it seemed obvious to me

269
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that it was probably the number of people on it.

270
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Interviewer: Were they deliberately walking in step, or anything like that?

271
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Man: No, they just had to conform to the movement of the bridge.

272
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Steven Strogatz: All right, so that already gives you a hint of what happened.

273
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Think of the bridge as being like this platform.

274
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Think of the people as being like metronomes.

275
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,

276
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.

277
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?

278
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
They all showed this strange sort of skating gait

279
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
that they adopted once the bridge started to move.

280
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.

281
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip

282
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,

283
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
who figured out what happened on the bridge,

284
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.

285
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop

286
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:44,000
between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,

287
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
that engineers knew nothing about.

288
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Actually, I think the first person you'll see

289
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay.

290
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:55,000
(Video) Interviewer: Did anyone get hurt? Engineer: No.

291
0:18:55.33,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Interviewer: Right. So it was quite small -- Engineer: Yes. Interviewer: -- but real?

292
0:18:58.33,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Engineer: Absolutely. Interviewer: You thought, "Oh, bother."

293
0:19:01.33,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Engineer: I felt I was disappointed about it.

294
0:19:04.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
We'd spent a lot of time designing this bridge, and we'd analyzed it,

295
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:11,000
we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes --

296
0:19:11.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and here it was doing something that we didn't know about.

297
0:19:14.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
Interviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.

298
0:19:16.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
Narrator: The most dramatic and shocking footage

299
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people --

300
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
apparently rocking from side to side in unison,

301
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:27,000
not only with each other, but with the bridge.

302
0:19:27.33,000 --> 0:19:31,000
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.

303
0:19:31.33,000 --> 0:19:34,000
But how could the crowd become synchronized?

304
0:19:34.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?

305
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:42,000
This was to be the focus of the investigation.

306
0:19:42.33,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Interviewer: Well, at last the simulated bridge is finished, and I can make it wobble.

307
0:19:49.33,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.

308
0:19:53.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
Interviewer: You designed this, yes, this simulated bridge,

309
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:58,000
and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?

310
0:19:58.33,000 --> 0:20:,000
AM: It captures a lot of the physics, yes.

311
0:20:00.33,000 --> 0:20:03,000
Interviewer: Right. So if we get on it, we should be able to wobble it, yes?

312
0:20:06.33,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Allan McRobie is a bridge engineer from Cambridge who wrote to me,

313
0:20:09.33,000 --> 0:20:12,000
suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble

314
0:20:12.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
in the same way as the real bridge --

315
0:20:14.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length.

316
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:19,000
AM: This one's only a couple of tons, so it's fairly easy to get going.

317
0:20:19.33,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Just by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now.

318
0:20:22.33,000 --> 0:20:25,000
AM: It doesn't have to be a real dangle. Just walk. It starts to go.

319
0:20:25.33,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Interviewer: It's actually quite difficult to walk.

320
0:20:28.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
You have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,

321
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:34,000
because if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet.

322
0:20:34.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
AM: It certainly affects the way you walk, yes. You can't walk normally on it.

323
0:20:39.33,000 --> 0:20:41,000
Interviewer: No. If you try and put one foot in front of another,

324
0:20:41.33,000 --> 0:20:44,000
it's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.

325
0:20:44.33,000 --> 0:20:46,000
Interviewer: So you've got to put your feet out sideways.

326
0:20:47.33,000 --> 0:20:5,000
So already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way

327
0:20:50.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
as our witnesses walked on the real bridge.

328
0:20:52.33,000 --> 0:20:55,000
AM: ... ice-skating gait. There isn't all this sort of snake way of walking.

329
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Interviewer: For a more convincing experiment,

330
0:20:57.33,000 --> 0:21:,000
I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.

331
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:03,000
Their instructions: just walk normally.

332
0:21:12.33,000 --> 0:21:16,000
It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.

333
0:21:16.33,000 --> 0:21:18,000
They're all having some difficulty walking.

334
0:21:19.33,000 --> 0:21:22,000
And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.

335
0:21:22.33,000 --> 0:21:25,000
But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.

336
0:21:27.33,000 --> 0:21:32,000
You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,

337
0:21:32.33,000 --> 0:21:34,000
and therefore to drive it to move further.

338
0:21:38.33,000 --> 0:21:42,000
SS: All right, well, with that from the Ministry of Silly Walks,

339
0:21:42.33,000 --> 0:21:45,000
maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over.

340
0:21:45.33,000 --> 0:21:48,000
But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way,

341
0:21:48.33,000 --> 0:21:51,000
to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you.

342
0:21:51.33,000 --> 0:21:53,000
(Applause)

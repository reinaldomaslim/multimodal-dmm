Liu Bolin: By making myself invisible,

3
0:00:18.278,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I try to question the inter-canceling relationship

4
0:00:21.223,000 --> 0:00:24,000
between our civilization and its development.

5
0:00:25.102,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Interpreter: By making myself invisible, I try to explore and question

6
0:00:27.278,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the contradictory and often inter-canceling relationship

7
0:00:31.27,000 --> 0:00:36,000
between our civilization and its development.

8
0:00:36.622,000 --> 0:00:41,000
LB: This is my first work, created in November 2005.

9
0:00:41.828,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked

10
0:00:44.965,000 --> 0:00:47,000
before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection.

11
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I also want to use this work to let more people

12
0:00:53.689,000 --> 0:00:55,000
pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom.

13
0:00:56.029,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In the meantime, from the beginning, this series has a

14
0:00:58.717,000 --> 0:01:02,000
protesting, reflective

15
0:01:03.341,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and uncompromising spirit.

16
0:01:05.161,000 --> 0:01:09,000
When applying makeup, I borrow a sniper's method

17
0:01:09.809,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to better protect myself

18
0:01:12.165,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and to detect the enemy, as he did. (Laughter)

19
0:01:16.089,000 --> 0:01:2,000
After finishing this series of protests,

20
0:01:20.557,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I started questioning why my fate was like this,

21
0:01:24.637,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I realized that it's not just me --

22
0:01:27.371,000 --> 0:01:3,000
all Chinese are as confused as I am.

23
0:01:31.199,000 --> 0:01:33,000
As you can see, these works

24
0:01:33.925,000 --> 0:01:39,000
are about family planning, election in accordance with the law

25
0:01:40.29,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress.

26
0:01:44.573,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This work is called Xia Gang ("leaving post").

27
0:01:46.821,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"Xia Gang" is a Chinese euphemism for "laid off".

28
0:01:50.246,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy.

29
0:01:57.813,000 --> 0:01:58,000
From 1998 to 2000,

30
0:01:59.685,000 --> 0:02:02,000
21.37 million people

31
0:02:02.941,000 --> 0:02:04,000
lost their jobs in China.

32
0:02:05.718,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The six people in the photo

33
0:02:08.642,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are Xia Gang workers.

34
0:02:10.565,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives.

35
0:02:15.423,000 --> 0:02:17,000
On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution:

36
0:02:17.589,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party."

37
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:22,000
For half a month

38
0:02:23.413,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I looked for these 6 people to participate in my work.

39
0:02:25.725,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We can only see six men in this picture,but in fact, those who are hidden here

40
0:02:30.637,000 --> 0:02:35,000
are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible.

41
0:02:35.998,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This piece is called The Studio.

42
0:02:38.142,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This spring,

43
0:02:39.397,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris

44
0:02:41.822,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to shoot a work in the news studio of France 3 --

45
0:02:47.084,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I picked the news photos of the day.

46
0:02:49.917,000 --> 0:02:51,000
One is about the war in the Middle East,

47
0:02:52.229,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and another one is about a public demonstration in France.

48
0:02:56.317,000 --> 0:03:,000
I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions.

49
0:03:01.061,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.

50
0:03:04.056,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Interpreter: This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR.

51
0:03:09.185,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

52
0:03:13.038,000 --> 0:03:15,000
LB: I tried to disappear into JR's eye,

53
0:03:16.029,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes.

54
0:03:20.079,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers.

55
0:03:23.71,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But still they are not big enough for JR, unfortunately.

56
0:03:25.144,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Interpreter: So I tried to disappear into JR's eye,

57
0:03:28.713,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes.

58
0:03:31.837,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture.

59
0:03:34.79,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But it doesn't work, my eyes are still small.

60
0:03:39.601,000 --> 0:03:42,000
LB: This one is about 9/11 memories.

61
0:03:47.275,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River.

62
0:03:52.613,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Kenny Scharf's graffiti.

63
0:03:56.685,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

64
0:04:00.717,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This is Venice, Italy.

65
0:04:04.944,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Because global temperatures rise,

66
0:04:06.945,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the sea level rises, and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades.

67
0:04:15.989,000 --> 0:04:17,000
This is the ancient city of Pompeii.

68
0:04:18.568,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Interpreter: This is the ancient city of Pompeii.

69
0:04:29.645,000 --> 0:04:3,000
LB: This is the Borghese Gallery

70
0:04:31.383,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in Rome.

71
0:04:34.784,000 --> 0:04:38,000
When I work on a new piece, I pay more attention to the expression of ideas.

72
0:04:39.069,000 --> 0:04:41,000
For instance, why would I make myself invisible?

73
0:04:41.805,000 --> 0:04:48,000
What will making myself invisible here cause people to think?

74
0:05:03.645,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This one is called Instant Noodles.

75
0:05:05.941,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Interpreter: This one is called Instant Noodles. (Laughter)

76
0:05:10.491,000 --> 0:05:14,000
LB: Since August 2012,

77
0:05:14.533,000 --> 0:05:18,000
harmful phosphors have been found

78
0:05:19.344,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets.

79
0:05:21.603,000 --> 0:05:23,000
These phosphors can even cause cancer.

80
0:05:24.155,000 --> 0:05:25,000
To create this artwork,

81
0:05:26.012,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups

82
0:05:28.1,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and put them in my studio, making it look like a supermarket.

83
0:05:31.033,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And my task is to stand there, trying to be still,

84
0:05:33.981,000 --> 0:05:37,000
setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant

85
0:05:38.437,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body

86
0:05:41.645,000 --> 0:05:45,000
on the front of my body. If the background is simple,

87
0:05:45.79,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I usually have to stand for three to four hours.

88
0:05:48.294,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The background of this piece is more complex,

89
0:05:50.911,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so I need three to four days in advance for preparation.

90
0:05:55.489,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot.

91
0:05:58.629,000 --> 0:06:,000
There is no Photoshop involved.

92
0:06:00.907,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Interpreter: This is the suit I [was] wearing when I did the supermarket shoot.

93
0:06:06.134,000 --> 0:06:12,000
There is no Photoshop involved. (Laughter)

94
0:06:12.141,000 --> 0:06:24,000
LB: These works are on China's cultural memories.

95
0:06:24.989,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And this one,

96
0:06:26.327,000 --> 0:06:28,000
this is about food safety in China.

97
0:06:28.989,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Unsafe food can harm people's health,

98
0:06:34.845,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds. (Laughter)

99
0:06:38.853,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages,

100
0:06:41.589,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in different countries and at different times.

101
0:06:46.374,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I think that in art, an artist's attitude is the most important element.

102
0:06:51.243,000 --> 0:06:55,000
If an artwork is to touch someone,

103
0:06:55.365,000 --> 0:06:58,000
it must be the result of not only technique, but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life.

104
0:06:59.029,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the repeated struggles in life create artwork,

105
0:07:03.405,000 --> 0:07:08,000
no matter in what form.

106
0:07:09.029,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Music)

107
0:07:30.509,000 --> 0:07:31,000
That's all I want to say.

108
0:07:31.757,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Thank you. (Applause)

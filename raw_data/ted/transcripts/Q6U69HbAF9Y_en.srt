0:00:13.312,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Michael Browning: engineer,

2
0:00:15.978,000 --> 0:00:16,000
innovator --

3
0:00:17.562,000 --> 0:00:18,000
inventor, really --

4
0:00:18.775,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and inspiring father.

5
0:00:20.594,000 --> 0:00:22,000
He had a passion for flight, as you can kind of sense

6
0:00:23.166,000 --> 0:00:27,000
from that rather dubious 1970s office-leaving present.

7
0:00:27.691,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And some 40 years after that was created,

8
0:00:30.526,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a small group of us got together

9
0:00:33.14,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to have a go,

10
0:00:34.321,000 --> 0:00:38,000
a run at the whole challenge of flight that inspired people for years,

11
0:00:38.702,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and do it in a very different kind of way.

12
0:00:40.783,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And that's the journey I'd like to share with you now.

13
0:00:43.492,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The starting hypothesis was one of the human mind and body,

14
0:00:46.734,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which, as you've seen for the last few days here,

15
0:00:49.152,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is an amazing construct.

16
0:00:50.995,000 --> 0:00:53,000
What if you augmented that wonderful machine

17
0:00:54.685,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with just the right technology?

18
0:00:56.187,000 --> 0:00:58,000
If you approach flight in that kind of real way,

19
0:00:58.546,000 --> 0:00:59,000
where could you get to?

20
0:00:59.822,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So my training partner here back in London, Denton,

21
0:01:03.213,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is doing a much better job of that kind of stuff than me.

22
0:01:06.241,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Guess what? It's London.

23
0:01:07.925,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The idea was that you augment that.

24
0:01:10.613,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And so, how do you augment that?

25
0:01:12.191,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Well, we bought one of these.

26
0:01:15.216,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is a micro gas turbine.

27
0:01:17.67,000 --> 0:01:19,000
This was ground zero,

28
0:01:19.792,000 --> 0:01:22,000
so that little piece of kit proved really quite impressive,

29
0:01:22.965,000 --> 0:01:23,000
so we got two in a field.

30
0:01:26.75,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The real hero here, by the way, is, right in the background,

31
0:01:29.875,000 --> 0:01:3,000
there's a lady tending some vegetables,

32
0:01:31.808,000 --> 0:01:34,000
who does a brilliant job of trying to ignore us for a while --

33
0:01:34.849,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:37.829,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I think the only thing less happy is the grass,

35
0:01:40.258,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that we did probably damage quite badly.

36
0:01:42.734,000 --> 0:01:43,000
You get an idea of the thrust here,

37
0:01:44.444,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when I try to hold them horizontally and somewhat fail.

38
0:01:47.094,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.

39
0:01:49.402,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We were quite impressed with that.

40
0:01:51.095,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We thought we were getting somewhere.

41
0:01:52.961,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So there's only one sensible way to go from there:

42
0:01:56.393,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you get four.

43
0:01:57.587,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:02.798,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I have to say, I still like watching these back.

45
0:02:05.078,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So then we thought well, let's try and spread the load a bit.

46
0:02:08.107,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The legs are designed to take the load,

47
0:02:10.023,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so why don't we spread it out a bit?

48
0:02:12.975,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That bit was good.

49
0:02:15.014,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The harness --

50
0:02:16.421,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a nice idea but it didn't really work,

51
0:02:18.346,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as you'll see now.

52
0:02:20.112,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This whole journey was very much about trying things --

53
0:02:22.898,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:23.996,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Yeah, it really didn't work, did it?

55
0:02:25.819,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Trying things and learning by failing at them most of the time.

56
0:02:29.595,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And that included failing by falling over.

57
0:02:34.742,000 --> 0:02:36,000
If you notice, we've got five engines here --

58
0:02:37.051,000 --> 0:02:39,000
not to be put off by the fact one was in maintenance,

59
0:02:39.638,000 --> 0:02:4,000
still had a go.

60
0:02:40.817,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:41.848,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And then I pinched a fuel line.

62
0:02:44.535,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So again, good learning. We learned not to do that again.

63
0:02:47.285,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This was a blind alley.

64
0:02:48.509,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:49.56,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This was three on each arm --

66
0:02:51.145,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that was ridiculous.

67
0:02:52.335,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That was 70 kilos on each arm.

68
0:02:54.32,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Again, struck that one off.

69
0:02:55.937,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

70
0:02:57.608,000 --> 0:03:,000
But we were starting to make some really quite convincing progress,

71
0:03:01.094,000 --> 0:03:03,000
just enough to make you believe that maybe --

72
0:03:03.452,000 --> 0:03:04,000
maybe we could get there.

73
0:03:05.398,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You can see, look -- tantalizing.

74
0:03:07.587,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The model of one on each leg and two on each arm,

75
0:03:11.46,000 --> 0:03:12,000
on paper, that was enough thrust.

76
0:03:13.711,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And then we did what I'm about to show you now,

77
0:03:16.868,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and I still love watching this one.

78
0:03:21.612,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This was our first six-second, reasonably coherent flight.

79
0:03:27.3,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Applause)

80
0:03:31.983,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That was the point where this endeavor went from:

81
0:03:35.029,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"I'm really not sure this is going to work,"

82
0:03:37.139,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to: "Oh my god, it does work!"

83
0:03:38.664,000 --> 0:03:39,000
From there on we then refined it,

84
0:03:40.283,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but we carried on falling over a lot.

85
0:03:43.093,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Falling over, like I say, is definitely the best way to learn.

86
0:03:46.204,000 --> 0:03:49,000
After a while, we starting really refining the layout of all of this.

87
0:03:49.926,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And you'll see, that's stability and control --

88
0:03:52.283,000 --> 0:03:53,000
there's no wires there or anything --

89
0:03:54.137,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that's a combination of us refining the technology,

90
0:03:56.595,000 --> 0:03:59,000
including with a Tupperware box on the back for the electronics

91
0:03:59.822,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and actually learning the balance and control.

92
0:04:04.073,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm now going to save your ears for the next short piece

93
0:04:06.75,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and talk over it.

94
0:04:07.933,000 --> 0:04:09,000
After a while, the jet engine noise is a bit annoying.

95
0:04:10.54,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This is only a few weeks ago.

96
0:04:11.966,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You can see the stability and control is really quite nice,

97
0:04:14.915,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and I'd like to think this somewhat validates that starting hypothesis,

98
0:04:18.389,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that the human mind and body, if properly augmented in that way,

99
0:04:23.125,000 --> 0:04:24,000
can achieve some pretty cool stuff.

100
0:04:24.935,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I mean, like I said:

101
0:04:26.532,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I'm not thinking about where I'm moving my arms at that stage.

102
0:04:29.52,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I'm looking at the objective of where I want to get to,

103
0:04:32.578,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and a bit like riding a bike,

104
0:04:34.401,000 --> 0:04:35,000
my arms are just doing their thing.

105
0:04:36.227,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's a very strange experience.

106
0:04:37.816,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So where is all this headed?

107
0:04:39.516,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I'll talk over this landing --

108
0:04:41.276,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I think I land in this one.

109
0:04:43.662,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Well, I don't think anybody's going to go down to Walmart

110
0:04:46.61,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or take the kids to school in any of this stuff for a while,

111
0:04:49.519,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but the team at Gravity are building some awesome technology

112
0:04:52.409,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that's going to make this look like child's play.

113
0:04:54.749,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We're working on some things

114
0:04:56.122,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that will seek to bring this unusual experience of flight

115
0:04:58.88,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to a wider audience, beyond the events and displays we're doing.

116
0:05:01.946,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We're even starting to look for pilots two and three,

117
0:05:04.452,000 --> 0:05:05,000
if there's any volunteers.

118
0:05:05.721,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I've got this vision.

119
0:05:06.943,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It sounds audacious, but let's just stick it out there,

120
0:05:09.595,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that one day maybe we can rise up above a beach,

121
0:05:11.897,000 --> 0:05:13,000
fly up and down the coastline of it, rise up a bit higher,

122
0:05:14.643,000 --> 0:05:17,000
with some of the safety kit we're working on to make this achievable.

123
0:05:17.935,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Then over the horizon comes a Hercules with the ramp down.

124
0:05:20.685,000 --> 0:05:22,000
As it comes past, you start picking up speed

125
0:05:22.774,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and see if we can intercept --

126
0:05:24.253,000 --> 0:05:26,000
from the rear, not the front, that would be a mistake --

127
0:05:26.927,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and then try and land in the back.

128
0:05:28.585,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And as I say, that's a little way off at the moment.

129
0:05:31.594,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But this is also, if I take a big step back from this,

130
0:05:35.538,000 --> 0:05:37,000
this is also a very personal journey for me.

131
0:05:39.352,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Back to that lovely photo,

132
0:05:41.173,000 --> 0:05:43,000
or photo in a picture.

133
0:05:43.362,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Sadly, my father took his own life when I was 15,

134
0:05:46.279,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and left an awful lot of unfulfilled ambition.

135
0:05:49.271,000 --> 0:05:5,000
He was a wonderful inventor,

136
0:05:50.919,000 --> 0:05:51,000
a maverick creator.

137
0:05:52.324,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I'd just like to think, if it was possible,

138
0:05:55.29,000 --> 0:05:56,000
if he was looking down,

139
0:05:56.63,000 --> 0:05:57,000
he would be --

140
0:05:57.835,000 --> 0:06:,000
he'd certainly be smiling at some of the things we've done here,

141
0:06:00.876,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I think.

142
0:06:02.058,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So, it's a tribute to him.

143
0:06:03.363,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Thank you very much.

144
0:06:04.56,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Applause)

145
0:06:08.088,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Voice-over) Richard Browning: I'm probably more nervous

146
0:06:10.795,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about doing the demo after this.

147
0:06:12.357,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I've got a lot of things to get done today.

148
0:06:14.401,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Worst-case scenario, we don't get a clean start.

149
0:06:16.714,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Or we get an unplanned failure while I'm actually flying around.

150
0:06:19.958,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is why we keep it very low,

151
0:06:21.584,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so the worst is I just look like an idiot and fall on my rear, as I said.

152
0:06:25.095,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So you can all enjoy that if that happens.

153
0:06:27.13,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Music)

154
0:06:48.174,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Jet engine accelerates)

155
0:07:06.399,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Cheers)

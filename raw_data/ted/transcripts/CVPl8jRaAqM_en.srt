2
0:00:12.802,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The minute she said it,

3
0:00:15.19,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the temperature in my classroom dropped.

4
0:00:18.865,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My students are usually laser-focused on me,

5
0:00:22.72,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but they shifted in their seats and looked away.

6
0:00:27.347,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm a black woman

7
0:00:28.911,000 --> 0:00:32,000
who teaches the histories of race and US slavery.

8
0:00:33.831,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm aware that my social identity is always on display.

9
0:00:38.323,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And my students are vulnerable too,

10
0:00:40.053,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so I'm careful.

11
0:00:41.68,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I try to anticipate what part of my lesson might go wrong.

12
0:00:46.179,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But honestly,

13
0:00:47.388,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I didn't even see this one coming.

14
0:00:49.601,000 --> 0:00:51,000
None of my years of graduate school prepared me for what to do

15
0:00:52.561,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when the N-word entered my classroom.

16
0:00:56.025,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I was in my first year of teaching

17
0:00:57.803,000 --> 0:00:59,000
when the student said the N-word in my class.

18
0:01:01.541,000 --> 0:01:03,000
She was not calling anyone a name.

19
0:01:04.53,000 --> 0:01:06,000
She was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

20
0:01:07.704,000 --> 0:01:09,000
She came to class with her readings done,

21
0:01:10.061,000 --> 0:01:11,000
she sat in the front row

22
0:01:11.855,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and she was always on my team.

23
0:01:15.895,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When she said it,

24
0:01:17.125,000 --> 0:01:19,000
she was actually making a point about my lecture,

25
0:01:19.442,000 --> 0:01:23,000
by quoting a line from a 1970s movie, a comedy,

26
0:01:23.72,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that had two racist slurs.

27
0:01:26.016,000 --> 0:01:28,000
One for people of Chinese descent

28
0:01:28.429,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the other the N-word.

29
0:01:31.143,000 --> 0:01:34,000
As soon as she said it, I held up my hands, said, "Whoa, whoa."

30
0:01:35.159,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But she assured me,

31
0:01:36.434,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"It's a joke from 'Blazing Saddles,'"

32
0:01:39.18,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and then she repeated it.

33
0:01:42.434,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This all happened 10 years ago,

34
0:01:44.145,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and how I handled it haunted me for a long time.

35
0:01:48.18,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It wasn't the first time I thought about the word

36
0:01:50.53,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in an academic setting.

37
0:01:52.45,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I'm a professor of US history,

38
0:01:54.712,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it's in a lot of the documents that I teach.

39
0:01:57.633,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I had to make a choice.

40
0:02:00.561,000 --> 0:02:01,000
After consulting with someone I trusted,

41
0:02:02.49,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I decided to never say it.

42
0:02:04.411,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Not even to quote it.

43
0:02:06.22,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But instead to use the euphemistic phrase, "the N-word."

44
0:02:11.292,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Even this decision was complicated.

45
0:02:14.366,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I didn't have tenure yet,

46
0:02:15.871,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and I worried that senior colleagues

47
0:02:17.768,000 --> 0:02:21,000
would think that by using the phrase I wasn't a serious scholar.

48
0:02:22.776,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But saying the actual word still felt worse.

49
0:02:26.793,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The incident in my classroom forced me to publicly reckon with the word.

50
0:02:31.674,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The history, the violence,

51
0:02:34.579,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but also --

52
0:02:37.141,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The history, the violence, but also any time it was hurled at me,

53
0:02:41.712,000 --> 0:02:42,000
spoken casually in front of me,

54
0:02:43.665,000 --> 0:02:46,000
any time it rested on the tip of someone's tongue,

55
0:02:47.136,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it all came flooding up in that moment,

56
0:02:49.978,000 --> 0:02:51,000
right in front of my students.

57
0:02:52.247,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I had no idea what to do.

58
0:02:56.284,000 --> 0:03:,000
So I've come to call stories like mine points of encounter.

59
0:03:02.037,000 --> 0:03:07,000
A point of encounter describes the moment you came face-to-face with the N-word.

60
0:03:07.712,000 --> 0:03:1,000
If you've even been stumped or provoked by the word,

61
0:03:11.529,000 --> 0:03:14,000
whether as the result of an awkward social situation,

62
0:03:15.339,000 --> 0:03:18,000
an uncomfortable academic conversation,

63
0:03:18.49,000 --> 0:03:19,000
something you heard in pop culture,

64
0:03:20.458,000 --> 0:03:22,000
or if you've been called the slur,

65
0:03:22.761,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or witnessed someone getting called the slur,

66
0:03:25.194,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you have experienced a point of encounter.

67
0:03:28.189,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And depending on who you are and how that moment goes down,

68
0:03:30.983,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you might have a range of responses.

69
0:03:33.887,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Could throw you off a little bit,

70
0:03:35.561,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or it could be incredibly painful and humiliating.

71
0:03:40.49,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I've had lots of these points of encounter in my life,

72
0:03:43.68,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but one thing is true.

73
0:03:46.22,000 --> 0:03:48,000
There's not a lot of space to talk about them.

74
0:03:52.424,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That day in my classroom was pretty much like all of those times

75
0:03:55.957,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I had an uninvited run-in with the N-word.

76
0:03:58.598,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I froze.

77
0:04:00.547,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Because the N-word is hard to talk about.

78
0:04:04.809,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Part of the reason the N-word is so hard to talk about,

79
0:04:07.96,000 --> 0:04:1,000
it's usually only discussed in one way,

80
0:04:11.157,000 --> 0:04:13,000
as a figure of speech, we hear this all the time, right?

81
0:04:13.807,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's just a word.

82
0:04:15.728,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The burning question that cycles through social media

83
0:04:19.286,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is who can and cannot say it.

84
0:04:22.563,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Black intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates does a groundbreaking job

85
0:04:26.58,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of defending the African American use of the word.

86
0:04:29.403,000 --> 0:04:31,000
On the other hand, Wendy Kaminer,

87
0:04:31.617,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a white freedom of speech advocate,

88
0:04:33.577,000 --> 0:04:35,000
argues that if we don't all just come and say it,

89
0:04:36.181,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we give the word power.

90
0:04:37.826,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And a lot of people feel that way.

91
0:04:40.58,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The Pew Center recently entered the debate.

92
0:04:43.738,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In a survey called "Race in America 2019,"

93
0:04:48.537,000 --> 0:04:51,000
researchers asked US adults if they thought is was OK

94
0:04:52.036,000 --> 0:04:54,000
for a white person to say the N-word.

95
0:04:55.188,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Seventy percent of all adults surveyed said "never."

96
0:05:00.236,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And these debates are important.

97
0:05:02.712,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But they really obscure something else.

98
0:05:04.766,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They keep us from getting underneath to the real conversation.

99
0:05:09.601,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Which is that the N-word is not just a word.

100
0:05:13.133,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's not neatly contained in a racist past,

101
0:05:17.547,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a relic of slavery.

102
0:05:21.236,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Fundamentally, the N-word is an idea disguised as a word:

103
0:05:27.537,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that black people are intellectually,

104
0:05:30.775,000 --> 0:05:31,000
biologically

105
0:05:32.355,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and immutably inferior to white people.

106
0:05:36.86,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And -- and I think this is the most important part --

107
0:05:41.002,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that that inferiority means that the injustice we suffer

108
0:05:44.709,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and inequality we endure

109
0:05:46.133,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is essentially our own fault.

110
0:05:51.053,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So, yes, it is ...

111
0:06:00.71,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Speaking of the word only as racist spew

112
0:06:04.157,000 --> 0:06:07,000
or as an obscenity in hip hop music

113
0:06:07.609,000 --> 0:06:1,000
makes it sounds as if it's a disease

114
0:06:10.72,000 --> 0:06:12,000
located in the American vocal cords

115
0:06:12.753,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that can be snipped right out.

116
0:06:15.355,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's not, and it can't.

117
0:06:18.728,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I learned this from talking to my students.

118
0:06:21.56,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So next time class met,

119
0:06:24.576,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I apologized,

120
0:06:26.147,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I made an announcement.

121
0:06:28.964,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I would have a new policy.

122
0:06:31.8,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Students would see the word in my PowerPoints,

123
0:06:35.927,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in film, in essays they read,

124
0:06:38.958,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but we would never ever say the word out loud in class.

125
0:06:44.871,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Nobody ever said it again.

126
0:06:46.966,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But they didn't learn much either.

127
0:06:50.427,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Afterwards, what bothered me most

128
0:06:52.284,000 --> 0:06:54,000
was that I didn't even explain to students

129
0:06:54.482,000 --> 0:06:58,000
why, of all the vile, problematic words in American English,

130
0:06:59.165,000 --> 0:07:03,000
why this particular word had its own buffer,

131
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the surrogate phrase "the N-word."

132
0:07:06.149,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Most of my students,

133
0:07:08.286,000 --> 0:07:12,000
many of them born in the late 1990s and afterwards,

134
0:07:12.414,000 --> 0:07:14,000
didn't even know that the phrase "the N-word"

135
0:07:15.342,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is a relatively new invention in American English.

136
0:07:18.339,000 --> 0:07:2,000
When I was growing up, it didn't exist.

137
0:07:22.339,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But in the late 1980s,

138
0:07:26.196,000 --> 0:07:29,000
black college students, writers, intellectuals,

139
0:07:30.093,000 --> 0:07:35,000
more and more started to talk about racist attacks against them.

140
0:07:37.07,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But increasingly, when they told these stories,

141
0:07:40.236,000 --> 0:07:42,000
they stopped using the word.

142
0:07:43.784,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Instead, they reduced it to the initial N

143
0:07:46.006,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and called it "the N-word."

144
0:07:49.093,000 --> 0:07:51,000
They felt that every time the word was uttered

145
0:07:51.45,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it opened up old wounds, so they refused to say it.

146
0:07:55.101,000 --> 0:07:58,000
They knew their listeners would hear the actual word in their heads.

147
0:07:59.228,000 --> 0:08:,000
That wasn't the point.

148
0:08:01.394,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The point was they didn't want to put the word in their own mouths

149
0:08:04.529,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or into the air.

150
0:08:07.045,000 --> 0:08:08,000
By doing this,

151
0:08:08.886,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they made an entire nation start to second-guess themselves

152
0:08:12.043,000 --> 0:08:13,000
about saying it.

153
0:08:14.98,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This was such a radical move

154
0:08:18.848,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that people are still mad about it.

155
0:08:22.617,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Critics accuse those of us who use the phrase "the N-word,"

156
0:08:27.523,000 --> 0:08:29,000
or people who become outraged,

157
0:08:29.698,000 --> 0:08:31,000
you know, just because the word is said,

158
0:08:31.888,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of being overprincipled,

159
0:08:33.991,000 --> 0:08:34,000
politically correct

160
0:08:35.657,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or, as I just read a couple of weeks ago in The New York Times,

161
0:08:38.776,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"insufferably woke."

162
0:08:40.657,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Right?

163
0:08:42.037,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So I bought into this a little bit too,

164
0:08:44.752,000 --> 0:08:47,000
which is why the next time I taught the course

165
0:08:48.673,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I proposed a freedom of speech debate.

166
0:08:53.41,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The N-word in academic spaces, for or against?

167
0:08:59.473,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I was certain students would be eager

168
0:09:01.681,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to debate who gets to say it and who doesn't.

169
0:09:05.744,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But they weren't.

170
0:09:08.871,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Instead ...

171
0:09:12.038,000 --> 0:09:14,000
my students started confessing.

172
0:09:16.91,000 --> 0:09:2,000
A white student from New Jersey talked about standing by

173
0:09:21.061,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as a black kid at her school got bullied by this word.

174
0:09:23.752,000 --> 0:09:26,000
She did nothing and years later still carried the guilt.

175
0:09:28.665,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Another from Connecticut

176
0:09:31.807,000 --> 0:09:33,000
talked about the pain of severing

177
0:09:34.442,000 --> 0:09:36,000
a very close relationship with a family member,

178
0:09:37.199,000 --> 0:09:4,000
because that family member refused to stop saying the word.

179
0:09:43.075,000 --> 0:09:47,000
One of the most memorable stories came from a very quiet black student

180
0:09:47.538,000 --> 0:09:48,000
from South Carolina.

181
0:09:49.29,000 --> 0:09:51,000
She didn't understand all the fuss.

182
0:09:51.755,000 --> 0:09:54,000
She said everyone at her school said the word.

183
0:09:55.969,000 --> 0:09:59,000
She wasn't talking about kids calling each other names in the hall.

184
0:10:00.945,000 --> 0:10:03,000
She explained that at her school

185
0:10:04.911,000 --> 0:10:06,000
when teachers and administrators

186
0:10:07.141,000 --> 0:10:1,000
became frustrated with an African American student,

187
0:10:10.887,000 --> 0:10:13,000
they called that student the actual N-word.

188
0:10:15.344,000 --> 0:10:17,000
She said it didn't bother her at all.

189
0:10:18.264,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But then a couple of days later,

190
0:10:19.892,000 --> 0:10:23,000
she came to visit me in my office hours and wept.

191
0:10:25.667,000 --> 0:10:26,000
She thought she was immune.

192
0:10:28.238,000 --> 0:10:29,000
She realized that she wasn't.

193
0:10:31.508,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Over the last 10 years,

194
0:10:34.27,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I have literally heard hundreds of these stories

195
0:10:37.731,000 --> 0:10:4,000
from all kinds of people from all ages.

196
0:10:41.391,000 --> 0:10:44,000
People in their 50s remembering stories from the second grade

197
0:10:45.048,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and when they were six,

198
0:10:46.429,000 --> 0:10:49,000
either calling people the word or being called the word,

199
0:10:49.724,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but carrying that all these years around this word, you know.

200
0:10:54.843,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And as I listened to people talk about their points of encounter,

201
0:10:59.673,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the pattern that emerged for me as a teacher that I found most upsetting

202
0:11:04.347,000 --> 0:11:06,000
is the single most fraught site

203
0:11:07.022,000 --> 0:11:09,000
for these points of encounter

204
0:11:09.323,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is the classroom.

205
0:11:12.307,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Most US kids are going to meet the N-word in class.

206
0:11:17.927,000 --> 0:11:2,000
One of the most assigned books in US high schools

207
0:11:21.752,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is Mark Twain’s "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"

208
0:11:24.371,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in which the word appears over 200 times.

209
0:11:28.023,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And this isn't an indictment of "Huck Finn."

210
0:11:31.039,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The word is in lots of US literature and history.

211
0:11:34.665,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's all over African American literature.

212
0:11:38.498,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Yet I hear from students

213
0:11:40.617,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that when the word is said during a lesson

214
0:11:45.062,000 --> 0:11:48,000
without discussion and context,

215
0:11:48.435,000 --> 0:11:51,000
it poisons the entire classroom environment.

216
0:11:53.006,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The trust between student and teacher is broken.

217
0:11:58.927,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Even so, many teachers,

218
0:12:02.513,000 --> 0:12:04,000
often with the very best of intentions,

219
0:12:05.122,000 --> 0:12:07,000
still say the N-word in class.

220
0:12:09.244,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They want to show and emphasize the horrors of US racism,

221
0:12:14.403,000 --> 0:12:16,000
so they rely on it for shock value.

222
0:12:17.994,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Invoking it brings into stark relief

223
0:12:20.899,000 --> 0:12:22,000
the ugliness of our nation's past.

224
0:12:24.391,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But they forget

225
0:12:25.907,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the ideas are alive and well in our cultural fabric.

226
0:12:37.152,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The six-letter word is like a capsule of accumulated hurt.

227
0:12:44.712,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Every time it is said, every time,

228
0:12:47.398,000 --> 0:12:5,000
it releases into the atmosphere the hateful notion

229
0:12:50.958,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that black people are less.

230
0:12:55.942,000 --> 0:12:56,000
My black students tell me

231
0:12:57.172,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that when the word is quoted or spoken in class,

232
0:12:59.696,000 --> 0:13:02,000
they feel like a giant spotlight is shining on them.

233
0:13:05.037,000 --> 0:13:06,000
One of my students told me

234
0:13:06.359,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that his classmates were like bobbleheads,

235
0:13:08.902,000 --> 0:13:1,000
turning to gauge his reaction.

236
0:13:12.874,000 --> 0:13:15,000
A white student told me that in the eighth grade,

237
0:13:16.12,000 --> 0:13:19,000
when they were learning "To Kill a Mockingbird"

238
0:13:20.668,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and reading it out loud in class,

239
0:13:22.292,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the student was stressed out

240
0:13:24.72,000 --> 0:13:26,000
at the idea of having to read the word,

241
0:13:27.705,000 --> 0:13:3,000
which the teacher insisted all students do,

242
0:13:31.328,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that the student ended up spending most of the unit

243
0:13:35.139,000 --> 0:13:36,000
hiding out in the bathroom.

244
0:13:37.868,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This is serious.

245
0:13:39.479,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Students across the country

246
0:13:41.889,000 --> 0:13:44,000
talk about switching majors and dropping classes

247
0:13:45.22,000 --> 0:13:47,000
because of poor teaching around the N-word.

248
0:13:48.19,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The issue of faculty carelessly speaking the word

249
0:13:52.475,000 --> 0:13:54,000
has reached such a fevered pitch,

250
0:13:54.879,000 --> 0:13:57,000
it's led to protests at Princeton, Emory,

251
0:13:58.704,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The New School,

252
0:14:00.165,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Smith College, where I teach,

253
0:14:02.696,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and Williams College,

254
0:14:04.491,000 --> 0:14:09,000
where just recently students have boycotted the entire English Department

255
0:14:10.498,000 --> 0:14:12,000
over it and other issues.

256
0:14:13.52,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And these were just the cases that make the news.

257
0:14:16.948,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is a crisis.

258
0:14:19.298,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And while student reaction

259
0:14:21.21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
looks like an attack on freedom of speech,

260
0:14:23.649,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I promise this is an issue of teaching.

261
0:14:27.982,000 --> 0:14:31,000
My students are not afraid of materials that have the N-word in it.

262
0:14:33.284,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They want to learn about James Baldwin

263
0:14:35.514,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and William Faulkner

264
0:14:37.268,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and about the civil rights movement.

265
0:14:41.204,000 --> 0:14:45,000
In fact, their stories show

266
0:14:45.284,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that this word is a central feature of their lives as young people

267
0:14:50.053,000 --> 0:14:51,000
in the United States.

268
0:14:52.627,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It's in the music they love.

269
0:14:54.508,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And in the popular culture they emulate,

270
0:14:57.043,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the comedy they watch,

271
0:14:59.111,000 --> 0:15:01,000
it's in TV and movies

272
0:15:01.524,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and memorialized in museums.

273
0:15:04.516,000 --> 0:15:05,000
They hear it in locker rooms,

274
0:15:06.509,000 --> 0:15:07,000
on Instagram,

275
0:15:08.325,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in the hallways at school,

276
0:15:10.373,000 --> 0:15:12,000
in the chat rooms of the video games they play.

277
0:15:13.307,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It is all over the world they navigate.

278
0:15:16.3,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But they don't know how to think about it

279
0:15:18.292,000 --> 0:15:2,000
or even really what the word means.

280
0:15:22.351,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I didn't even really understand what the word meant

281
0:15:24.764,000 --> 0:15:25,000
until I did some research.

282
0:15:26.803,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I was astonished to learn

283
0:15:29.288,000 --> 0:15:32,000
that black people first incorporated the N-word into the vocabulary

284
0:15:33.187,000 --> 0:15:34,000
as political protest,

285
0:15:35.195,000 --> 0:15:38,000
not in the 1970s or 1980s

286
0:15:38.227,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but as far back as the 1770s.

287
0:15:41.591,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And I wish I had more time to talk

288
0:15:43.42,000 --> 0:15:47,000
about the long, subversive history of the black use of the N-word.

289
0:15:48.625,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But I will say this:

290
0:15:50.744,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Many times, my students will come up to me and say,

291
0:15:54.068,000 --> 0:15:57,000
"I understand the virulent roots of this word, it's slavery."

292
0:15:58.767,000 --> 0:15:59,000
They are only partially right.

293
0:16:02.101,000 --> 0:16:06,000
This word, which existed before it became a slur,

294
0:16:06.458,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but it becomes a slur at a very distinct moment in US history,

295
0:16:11.951,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and that's as large numbers of black people begin to become free,

296
0:16:17.142,000 --> 0:16:19,000
starting in the North in the 1820s.

297
0:16:20.246,000 --> 0:16:21,000
In other words,

298
0:16:22.006,000 --> 0:16:27,000
this word is fundamentally an assault on black freedom,

299
0:16:27.061,000 --> 0:16:28,000
black mobility,

300
0:16:28.577,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and black aspiration.

301
0:16:31.691,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Even now,

302
0:16:32.866,000 --> 0:16:36,000
nothing so swiftly unleashes an N-word tirade

303
0:16:37.167,000 --> 0:16:39,000
as a black person asserting their rights

304
0:16:39.881,000 --> 0:16:42,000
or going where they please or prospering.

305
0:16:43.299,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Think of the attacks on Colin Kaepernick when he kneeled.

306
0:16:46.784,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Or Barack Obama when he became president.

307
0:16:50.601,000 --> 0:16:52,000
My students want to know this history.

308
0:16:54.958,000 --> 0:16:57,000
But when they ask questions, they're shushed and shamed.

309
0:17:00.148,000 --> 0:17:03,000
By shying away from talking about the N-word,

310
0:17:03.522,000 --> 0:17:07,000
we have turned this word into the ultimate taboo,

311
0:17:08.355,000 --> 0:17:1,000
crafting it into something so tantalizing,

312
0:17:11.355,000 --> 0:17:13,000
that for all US kids,

313
0:17:13.458,000 --> 0:17:16,000
no matter their racial background,

314
0:17:16.53,000 --> 0:17:18,000
part of their coming of age is figuring out

315
0:17:18.577,000 --> 0:17:2,000
how to negotiate this word.

316
0:17:20.672,000 --> 0:17:23,000
We treat conversations about it like sex before sex education.

317
0:17:25.375,000 --> 0:17:27,000
We're squeamish, we silence them.

318
0:17:28.224,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So they learn about it from misinformed friends and in whispers.

319
0:17:33.664,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I wish I could go back to the classroom that day

320
0:17:36.292,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and push through my fear

321
0:17:38.144,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to talk about the fact that something actually happened.

322
0:17:41.593,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Not just to me or to my black students.

323
0:17:44.473,000 --> 0:17:45,000
But to all of us.

324
0:17:46.665,000 --> 0:17:48,000
You know, I think

325
0:17:49.395,000 --> 0:17:53,000
we're all connected by our inability to talk about this word.

326
0:17:54.276,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But what if we explored our points of encounter

327
0:17:57.213,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and did start to talk about it?

328
0:18:00.641,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Today, I try to create the conditions in my classroom

329
0:18:04.015,000 --> 0:18:06,000
to have open and honest conversations about it.

330
0:18:07.315,000 --> 0:18:1,000
One of those conditions -- not saying the word.

331
0:18:10.942,000 --> 0:18:11,000
We're able to talk about it

332
0:18:12.292,000 --> 0:18:14,000
because it doesn't come into the classroom.

333
0:18:14.855,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Another important condition

334
0:18:16.385,000 --> 0:18:18,000
is I don't make my black students responsible

335
0:18:18.911,000 --> 0:18:2,000
for teaching their classmates about this.

336
0:18:21.712,000 --> 0:18:22,000
That is my job.

337
0:18:23.323,000 --> 0:18:24,000
So I come prepared.

338
0:18:25.188,000 --> 0:18:28,000
I hold the conversation with a tight rein,

339
0:18:28.794,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and I'm armed with knowledge of the history.

340
0:18:32.022,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I always ask students the same question:

341
0:18:36.252,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Why is talking about the N-word hard?

342
0:18:40.165,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Their answers are amazing.

343
0:18:43.387,000 --> 0:18:44,000
They're amazing.

344
0:18:46.075,000 --> 0:18:48,000
More than anything though,

345
0:18:48.36,000 --> 0:18:53,000
I have become deeply acquainted with my own points of encounter,

346
0:18:53.813,000 --> 0:18:55,000
my personal history around this word.

347
0:18:57.419,000 --> 0:19:,000
Because when the N-word comes to school,

348
0:19:00.466,000 --> 0:19:02,000
or really anywhere,

349
0:19:02.546,000 --> 0:19:07,000
it brings with it all of the complicated history of US racism.

350
0:19:08.639,000 --> 0:19:1,000
The nation's history

351
0:19:10.877,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and my own,

352
0:19:12.393,000 --> 0:19:14,000
right here, right now.

353
0:19:15.73,000 --> 0:19:16,000
There's no avoiding it.

354
0:19:17.889,000 --> 0:19:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:14.023,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Me and the boy wear the same shoe size.

2
0:00:18.343,000 --> 0:00:2,000
He wants a pair of Air Jordan 4s for Christmas.

3
0:00:22.094,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I buy them,

4
0:00:23.908,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and then I steal them from his closet,

5
0:00:26.561,000 --> 0:00:29,000
like a twisted Grinch-themed episode of "Black-ish."

6
0:00:30.117,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:31.928,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The kicks are totems to my youth.

8
0:00:34.521,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I wear them like mercury on my Black man feet.

9
0:00:38.352,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I can't get those young freedom days back fast enough.

10
0:00:42.785,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Last time I was really fast I was 16,

11
0:00:44.661,000 --> 0:00:46,000
outrunning a doorman on the Upper East Side.

12
0:00:46.967,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He caught me vandalizing his building,

13
0:00:49.414,000 --> 0:00:5,000
not even on some artsy stuff,

14
0:00:50.949,000 --> 0:00:51,000
just ... stupid.

15
0:00:53.345,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Of all the genders, boys are the stupidest.

16
0:00:57.056,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Sixteen was a series of barely getting away

18
0:01:02.425,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and never telling my parents.

19
0:01:04.469,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I assume that my son is stewarding this tradition well.

20
0:01:08.042,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Sixteen was "The Low End Theory" and Marvin Gaye on repeat.

21
0:01:12.124,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Sixteen is younger than Trayvon and older than Emmett Till.

22
0:01:17.448,000 --> 0:01:22,000
At the DMV, my boy's in line to officially enter his prime suspect years:

23
0:01:23.05,000 --> 0:01:24,000
young, brown and behind the wheel,

24
0:01:24.845,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a moving semaphore, signaling the threat of communities from below.

25
0:01:28.926,000 --> 0:01:31,000
On top of the food chain, humans have no natural predator,

26
0:01:31.95,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but America plays out something genetically embedded and instinctual

27
0:01:36.119,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in its appetite for the Black body.

28
0:01:38.568,000 --> 0:01:41,000
America guns down Black bodies and then walks around them,

29
0:01:42.12,000 --> 0:01:43,000
bored,

30
0:01:43.325,000 --> 0:01:46,000
like laconic lions next to half-eaten gazelles,

31
0:01:46.889,000 --> 0:01:47,000
bloody lips ...

32
0:01:48.488,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"America and the Black Body" on some Nat Geo shit.

33
0:01:53.433,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Well, he passes his road test at the DMV.

34
0:01:56.399,000 --> 0:01:58,000
He does this strut C-Walk broken "Fortnite" thing

35
0:01:59.139,000 --> 0:02:,000
on the way in to finish his paperwork,

36
0:02:01.09,000 --> 0:02:04,000
true joy and calibrated cool under the eye of my filming iPhone,

37
0:02:04.48,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the victory dance of someone who has just salvaged a draw.

38
0:02:07.944,000 --> 0:02:09,000
He's earned this win, but he's so 16

39
0:02:10.408,000 --> 0:02:12,000
he can't quite let his body be fully free.

40
0:02:13.902,000 --> 0:02:14,000
When he's three,

41
0:02:15.475,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I'm in handcuffs in downtown Oakland.

42
0:02:18.53,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Five minutes ago, I was illegally parked.

43
0:02:20.999,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now I'm in the back of a squad car, considering the odds that I'm going to die

44
0:02:24.985,000 --> 0:02:27,000
here, 15 minutes away from my son who expects that in 18 minutes,

45
0:02:28.965,000 --> 0:02:29,000
daddy's gonna pick him up from preschool.

46
0:02:30.985,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There are no pocket-size cameras to capture this moment, so.

47
0:02:34.727,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I learned a lot of big words when I was 16 getting ready for the SAT,

48
0:02:38.056,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but none of them come to me now.

49
0:02:40.872,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In the police car, the only thing that really speaks is my skin.

50
0:02:45.212,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I know this:

51
0:02:46.4,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I was parked on a bus zone on 12th and Broadway,

52
0:02:50.706,000 --> 0:02:51,000
running to the ATM on the corner.

53
0:02:52.314,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I pull the cash out just as a police car pulls up behind me,

54
0:02:55.302,000 --> 0:02:57,000
give him the "Aw shucks, my bad," that earnest Black man face.

55
0:02:58.28,000 --> 0:03:01,000
He waits till I'm back in the car and then hits the siren,

56
0:03:01.583,000 --> 0:03:03,000
takes my license with his hand on the gun,

57
0:03:04.126,000 --> 0:03:08,000
comes back two minutes later, gun drawn, another patrol car now, four cops now,

58
0:03:09.135,000 --> 0:03:12,000
my face on the curb, hands behind my back, shackled.

59
0:03:12.232,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I'm angry and humiliated, only until I'm scared and then sad.

60
0:03:16.89,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I smell like the last gasp before my own death.

61
0:03:20.792,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I think how long the boy will wait before he realizes

62
0:03:23.491,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that daddy is not on his way.

63
0:03:25.571,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I think his last barely formed memory of me

64
0:03:29.247,000 --> 0:03:31,000
will be the story of how I never came for him.

65
0:03:32.25,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I try to telepathically say goodbye.

66
0:03:35.098,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The silence brings me no peace.

67
0:03:37.23,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The quiet makes it hard to rest.

68
0:03:39.352,000 --> 0:03:42,000
In the void there is anger mushrooming in the moss at the base of my thoughts,

69
0:03:43.356,000 --> 0:03:45,000
a fungus growing on the spine of my freedom attempts.

70
0:03:46.06,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'm free from all except contempt,

71
0:03:48.895,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the spirit of an unarmed civilian in the time of civil unrest,

72
0:03:53.11,000 --> 0:03:57,000
no peace, just Marvin Gaye falsettos arching like a broken-winged sparrow,

73
0:03:57.829,000 --> 0:03:59,000
competing against the empty sirens,

74
0:04:00.398,000 --> 0:04:01,000
singing the police.

75
0:04:03.343,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Apparently some cat from Richmond had a warrant out on him,

76
0:04:06.2,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and when the cop says my name to dispatch, dude doesn't hear "Marc Joseph,"

77
0:04:09.974,000 --> 0:04:1,000
he hears "Mike Johnson."

78
0:04:11.749,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I count seven cars and 18 cops on the corner now,

79
0:04:15.386,000 --> 0:04:18,000
a pride around a pound of flesh.

80
0:04:18.777,000 --> 0:04:2,000
By the grace of God, I'm not fed to the beast today.

81
0:04:22.412,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Magnanimously, the first cop makes sure to give me a ticket

82
0:04:25.433,000 --> 0:04:26,000
for parking in a bus zone,

83
0:04:26.785,000 --> 0:04:27,000
before he sets me free.

84
0:04:29.076,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The boy is 16.

85
0:04:31.573,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He has a license to drive in the hollow city,

86
0:04:34.505,000 --> 0:04:35,000
enough body to fill my shoes.

87
0:04:36.428,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I have grey in my beard,

88
0:04:38.559,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and it tells the truth.

89
0:04:40.446,000 --> 0:04:43,000
He can navigate traffic in the age of autonomous vehicles.

90
0:04:44.09,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You know, people say "the talk,"

91
0:04:46.594,000 --> 0:04:48,000
like the thing happens just once,

92
0:04:48.88,000 --> 0:04:5,000
like my memory's been erased and my internet is broken,

93
0:04:51.566,000 --> 0:04:53,000
like I can't read today's martyred name,

94
0:04:53.688,000 --> 0:04:55,000
like today's the day that I don't love my son enough

95
0:04:56.203,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to tell him, "Bro, I really don't care about your rights, yo.

96
0:04:59.089,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Your mission is to get home to me.

97
0:05:01.52,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Live to tell me the story, boy.

98
0:05:03.685,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Get home to me."

99
0:05:06.007,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Today's talk is mostly happening in my head

100
0:05:08.509,000 --> 0:05:12,000
as he pulls onto the freeway and Marvin Gaye comes on the radio.

101
0:05:12.629,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I'm wearing the boy's shoes,

102
0:05:14.626,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the tune in my head is the goodbye that I almost never said,

103
0:05:18.159,000 --> 0:05:2,000
a goodbye the length of a requiem,

104
0:05:20.364,000 --> 0:05:22,000
a kiss, a whiff of his neck,

105
0:05:22.646,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the length of a revelation

106
0:05:24.227,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and a request flying high in the friendly sky

107
0:05:27.421,000 --> 0:05:28,000
without ever leaving the ground.

108
0:05:29.186,000 --> 0:05:31,000
My pain is a walking bass line,

109
0:05:31.215,000 --> 0:05:34,000
a refrain, placated stress against the fading baseline.

110
0:05:34.635,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Listen, this is not to be romantic,

111
0:05:37.879,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but to assert a plausible scenario for the existential moment.

112
0:05:42.151,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Driving while Black is its own genre of experience.

113
0:05:46.384,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Ask Marvin.

114
0:05:47.948,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It may not be the reason why you sing like an angel,

115
0:05:50.893,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but it surely has something to do with why heaven bends to your voice.

116
0:05:55.988,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The boy driving, the cop in the rearview mirror

117
0:05:59.48,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is a ticket to ride or die.

118
0:06:01.948,000 --> 0:06:02,000
When you give a Black boy "the talk,"

119
0:06:03.75,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you pray he is of the faction of the fraction that survives.

120
0:06:07.006,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You pitch him the frequency of your telepathic goodbye,

121
0:06:10.416,000 --> 0:06:13,000
channel the love sustained in Marvin's upper register

122
0:06:13.874,000 --> 0:06:14,000
under his skullcap.

123
0:06:15.484,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Black music at its best

124
0:06:17.551,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is an exploded black hole

125
0:06:19.501,000 --> 0:06:22,000
responding to the call of America at its worst.

126
0:06:23.094,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Strike us down, the music lives,

127
0:06:25.896,000 --> 0:06:27,000
dark, like tar or tobacco

128
0:06:28.6,000 --> 0:06:3,000
or cotton in muddy water.

129
0:06:30.803,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Get home to me, son.

130
0:06:33.625,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Like a love supreme, a god as love,

131
0:06:37.153,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a love overrules,

132
0:06:39.177,000 --> 0:06:42,000
feathers for the angelic lift of the restless dead,

133
0:06:42.32,000 --> 0:06:43,000
like a theme for trouble man,

134
0:06:44.116,000 --> 0:06:49,000
or a 16-year-old boy, free to make mistakes and live through them,

135
0:06:49.465,000 --> 0:06:5,000
grow from them,

136
0:06:51.19,000 --> 0:06:55,000
holy, holy, mercy, mercy me,

137
0:06:56.028,000 --> 0:06:57,000
mercy,

138
0:06:57.31,000 --> 0:06:58,000
mercy.

139
0:07:02.656,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Thank you.

140
0:07:03.85,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.81,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder,

2
0:00:15.968,000 --> 0:00:17,000
but this is not how I started.

3
0:00:18.824,000 --> 0:00:21,000
When I was seven years old, I remember watching television

4
0:00:21.889,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and seeing people throwing rocks,

5
0:00:24.466,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and thinking, this must be a fun thing to do.

6
0:00:27.856,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So I got out to the street and threw rocks,

7
0:00:30.201,000 --> 0:00:34,000
not realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars.

8
0:00:34.682,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Instead, I ended up stoning my neighbors' cars. (Laughter)

9
0:00:38.908,000 --> 0:00:41,000
They were not enthusiastic about my patriotism.

10
0:00:42.81,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This is my picture with my brother.

11
0:00:44.904,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This is me, the little one, and I know what you're thinking:

12
0:00:47.739,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"You used to look cute, what the heck happened to you?"

13
0:00:50.68,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But my brother, who is older than me,

14
0:00:52.631,000 --> 0:00:54,000
was arrested when he was 18,

15
0:00:55.045,000 --> 0:00:57,000
taken to prison on charges of throwing stones.

16
0:00:57.994,000 --> 0:01:,000
He was beaten up when he refused to confess that he threw stones,

17
0:01:01.57,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and as a result, had internal injuries

18
0:01:04.171,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that caused his death soon after he was released from prison.

19
0:01:08.814,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I was angry, I was bitter,

20
0:01:12.46,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and all I wanted was revenge.

21
0:01:16.152,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But that changed when I was 18.

22
0:01:18.659,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job,

23
0:01:22.096,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and going to study Hebrew in that classroom

24
0:01:24.603,000 --> 0:01:29,000
was the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers.

25
0:01:30.037,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And we connected over really small things, like the fact that I love country music,

26
0:01:34.919,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which is really strange for Palestinians.

27
0:01:38.646,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But it was then that I realized also that we have a wall of anger,

28
0:01:43.306,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of hatred and of ignorance that separates us.

29
0:01:48.919,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me.

30
0:01:53.418,000 --> 0:01:55,000
What really matters is how I deal with it.

31
0:01:56.111,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And therefore, I decided to dedicate my life

32
0:01:59.455,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to bringing down the walls that separate people.

33
0:02:03.843,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I do so through many ways.

34
0:02:05.863,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Tourism is one of them, but also media and education,

35
0:02:08.963,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and you might be wondering, really, can tourism change things?

36
0:02:12.657,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Can it bring down walls? Yes.

37
0:02:14.367,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls

38
0:02:19.087,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and to create a sustainable way of connecting with each other

39
0:02:23.472,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and creating friendships.

40
0:02:26.026,000 --> 0:02:29,000
In 2009, I cofounded Mejdi Tours,

41
0:02:29.811,000 --> 0:02:32,000
a social enterprise that aims to connect people,

42
0:02:33.271,000 --> 0:02:35,000
with two Jewish friends, by the way,

43
0:02:35.732,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and what we'll do, the model we did,

44
0:02:38.031,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for example, in Jerusalem, we would have two tour guides,

45
0:02:41.537,000 --> 0:02:44,000
one Israeli and one Palestinian, guiding the trips together,

46
0:02:44.996,000 --> 0:02:47,000
telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict

47
0:02:48.201,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from totally different perspectives.

48
0:02:51.173,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I remember running a trip together with a friend named Kobi --

49
0:02:54.531,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Jewish congregation from Chicago, the trip was in Jerusalem --

50
0:02:57.555,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we took them to a refugee camp, a Palestinian refugee camp,

51
0:03:00.717,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and there we had this amazing food.

52
0:03:02.817,000 --> 0:03:04,000
By the way, this is my mother. She's cool.

53
0:03:05.7,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And that's the Palestinian food called maqluba.

54
0:03:08.254,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It means "upside-down."

55
0:03:09.571,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You cook it with rice and chicken, and you flip it upside-down.

56
0:03:12.795,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It's the best meal ever.

57
0:03:14.436,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And we'll eat together.

58
0:03:15.744,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Then we had a joint band, Israeli and Palestinian musicians,

59
0:03:18.548,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and we did some belly-dancing.

60
0:03:20.405,000 --> 0:03:23,000
If you don't know any, I'll teach you later.

61
0:03:23.795,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But when we left, both sides,

62
0:03:26.907,000 --> 0:03:28,000
they were crying because they did not want to leave.

63
0:03:29.484,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Three years later, those relationships still exist.

64
0:03:33.106,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Imagine with me if the one billion people

65
0:03:35.916,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who travel internationally every year travel like this,

66
0:03:39.724,000 --> 0:03:41,000
not being taken in the bus from one side to another,

67
0:03:42.696,000 --> 0:03:44,000
from one hotel to another,

68
0:03:45.017,000 --> 0:03:48,000
taking pictures from the windows of their buses of people and cultures,

69
0:03:48.988,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but actually connecting with people.

70
0:03:52.169,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You know, I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K.

71
0:03:56.093,000 --> 0:03:58,000
going to the house of an Orthodox Jewish family,

72
0:03:58.879,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and having their first Friday night dinners, that Sabbath dinner,

73
0:04:03.268,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and eating together hamin, which is a Jewish food, a stew,

74
0:04:06.843,000 --> 0:04:08,000
just having the connection of realizing, after a while,

75
0:04:09.722,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that a hundred years ago, their families came out

76
0:04:12.694,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of the same place in Northern Africa.

77
0:04:15.773,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This is not a photo profile for your Facebook.

78
0:04:18.848,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This is not disaster tourism.

79
0:04:20.682,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This is the future of travel,

80
0:04:23.05,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and I invite you to join me to do that, to change your travel.

81
0:04:26.114,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We're doing it all over the world now,

82
0:04:28.065,000 --> 0:04:3,000
from Ireland to Iran to Turkey,

83
0:04:30.503,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and we see ourselves going everywhere to change the world.

84
0:04:33.499,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Thank you.

85
0:04:34.729,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

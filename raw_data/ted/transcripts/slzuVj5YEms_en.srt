[How can we control the coronavirus pandemic?]

3
0:00:14.579,000 --> 0:00:16,000
[From infectious disease expert Adam Kucharski]

4
0:00:17.614,000 --> 0:00:2,000
[Question 1: What does containment mean when it comes to outbreaks?]

5
0:00:21.23,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Containment is this idea that you can focus your effort on control

6
0:00:24.867,000 --> 0:00:26,000
very much on the cases and their contacts.

7
0:00:27.188,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So you're not causing disruption to the wider population,

8
0:00:29.911,000 --> 0:00:31,000
you have a case that comes in, you isolate them,

9
0:00:32.62,000 --> 0:00:34,000
you work out who they've come into contact with,

10
0:00:34.947,000 --> 0:00:37,000
who's potentially these opportunities for exposure

11
0:00:38.008,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and then you can follow up those people,

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
maybe quarantine them, to make sure that no further transmission happens.

13
0:00:43.68,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So it's a very focused, targeted method,

14
0:00:46.167,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and for SARS, it worked remarkably well.

15
0:00:49.429,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But I think for this infection,

16
0:00:51.301,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because some cases are going to be missed, or undetected,

17
0:00:54.849,000 --> 0:00:57,000
you've really got to be capturing a large chunk of people at risk.

18
0:00:58.016,000 --> 0:00:59,000
If a few slip through the net,

19
0:00:59.532,000 --> 0:01:01,000
potentially, you're going to get an outbreak.

20
0:01:01.674,000 --> 0:01:04,000
[Question 2: If containment isn't enough, what comes next?]

21
0:01:05.285,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In that respect,

22
0:01:06.525,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it would be about massive changes in our social interactions.

23
0:01:10.267,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And so that would require,

24
0:01:12.013,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of the opportunities that could spread the virus

25
0:01:14.331,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so these kind of close contacts,

26
0:01:16.371,000 --> 0:01:18,000
everybody in the population, on average,

27
0:01:18.651,000 --> 0:01:2,000
will be needing to reduce those interactions

28
0:01:21.571,000 --> 0:01:23,000
potentially by two-thirds to bring it under control.

29
0:01:24.243,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That might be through working from home,

30
0:01:27.002,000 --> 0:01:28,000
from changing lifestyle

31
0:01:28.915,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and kind of where you go in crowded places and dinners.

32
0:01:32.897,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And of course, these measures, things like school closures,

33
0:01:35.7,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and other things that just attempt to reduce

34
0:01:37.834,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the social mixing of a population.

35
0:01:39.842,000 --> 0:01:43,000
[Question 3: What are the risks that we need people to think about?]

36
0:01:43.874,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's not just whose hand you shake,

37
0:01:45.603,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it's whose hand that person goes on to shake.

38
0:01:47.755,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I think we need to think about these second-degree steps,

39
0:01:50.707,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that you might think you have low risk

40
0:01:52.722,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and you're in a younger group,

41
0:01:54.509,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but you're often going to be a very short step away

42
0:01:57.658,000 --> 0:01:59,000
from someone who is going to get hit very hard by this.

43
0:02:00.343,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I think we really need to be socially minded

44
0:02:02.975,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and think this could be quite dramatic in terms of change of behavior,

45
0:02:06.307,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but it needs to be

46
0:02:07.966,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to reduce the impact that we're potentially facing.

47
0:02:10.387,000 --> 0:02:13,000
[Question 4: How far apart should people stay from each other?]

48
0:02:14.147,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I think it's hard to pin down exactly,

49
0:02:16.06,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but I think one thing to bear in mind is that there's not so much evidence

50
0:02:19.6,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that this is a kind of aerosol and it goes really far --

51
0:02:22.283,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it's reasonably short distances.

52
0:02:23.855,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I don't think it's the case

53
0:02:25.181,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that you're sitting a few meters away from someone

54
0:02:28.419,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and the virus is somehow going to get across.

55
0:02:31.224,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's in closer interactions,

56
0:02:32.602,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and it's why we're seeing so many transmission events

57
0:02:35.558,000 --> 0:02:38,000
occur in things like meals and really tight-knit groups.

58
0:02:39.436,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Because if you imagine

59
0:02:40.777,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that's where you can get a virus out and onto surfaces

60
0:02:43.805,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and onto hands and onto faces,

61
0:02:45.467,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and it's really situations like that we've got to think more about.

62
0:02:49.512,000 --> 0:02:51,000
[Question 5: What kind of protective measures

63
0:02:51.687,000 --> 0:02:53,000
should countries put in place?]

64
0:02:53.831,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I think that's what people are trying to piece together,

65
0:02:56.48,000 --> 0:02:57,000
first in terms of what works.

66
0:02:58.562,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's only really in the last sort of few weeks

67
0:03:01.717,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we've got a sense that this thing can be controllable

68
0:03:04.551,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with this extent of interventions,

69
0:03:06.249,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but of course, not all countries can do what China have done,

70
0:03:09.137,000 --> 0:03:1,000
some of these measures

71
0:03:10.36,000 --> 0:03:13,000
incur a huge social, economic, psychological burden

72
0:03:14.098,000 --> 0:03:15,000
on populations.

73
0:03:16.173,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And of course, there's the time limit.

74
0:03:18.046,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In China, they've had them in for six weeks,

75
0:03:20.201,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it's tough to maintain that,

76
0:03:21.601,000 --> 0:03:22,000
so we need to think of these tradeoffs

77
0:03:23.45,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of all the things we can ask people to do,

78
0:03:26.046,000 --> 0:03:29,000
what's going to have the most impact on actually reducing the burden.

79
0:03:30.088,000 --> 0:03:33,000

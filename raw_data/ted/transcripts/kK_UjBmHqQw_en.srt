1
0:00:12.695,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was nine years old,

2
0:00:14.599,000 --> 0:00:16,000
my mom asked me what I would want my house to look like,

3
0:00:18.037,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I drew this fairy mushroom.

4
0:00:20.52,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And then she actually built it.

5
0:00:23.794,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.791,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I don't think I realized this was so unusual at the time,

7
0:00:28.415,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and maybe I still haven't,

8
0:00:29.947,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because I'm still designing houses.

9
0:00:35.325,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This is a six-story bespoke home on the island of Bali.

10
0:00:38.698,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's built almost entirely from bamboo.

11
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor.

12
0:00:46.967,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You enter the house by a bridge.

13
0:00:50.548,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It can get hot in the tropics,

14
0:00:52.405,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so we make big curving roofs to catch the breezes.

15
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:01:,000
But some rooms have tall windows to keep the air conditioning in

16
0:01:01.498,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the bugs out.

17
0:01:05.515,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This room we left open.

18
0:01:07.233,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We made an air-conditioned, tented bed.

19
0:01:10.935,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And one client wanted a TV room in the corner of her living room.

20
0:01:14.569,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Boxing off an area with tall walls just didn't feel right,

21
0:01:18.332,000 --> 0:01:22,000
so instead, we made this giant woven pod.

22
0:01:24.477,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now, we do have all the necessary luxuries, like bathrooms.

23
0:01:28.63,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This one is a basket in the corner of the living room,

24
0:01:32.999,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I've got tell you, some people actually hesitate to use it.

25
0:01:36.513,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We have not quite figured out our acoustic insulation.

26
0:01:39.485,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:41.923,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So there are lots of things that we're still working on,

28
0:01:44.5,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but one thing I have learned

29
0:01:46.7,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is that bamboo will treat you well if you use it right.

30
0:01:50.907,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's actually a wild grass.

31
0:01:52.952,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It grows on otherwise unproductive land --

32
0:01:55.924,000 --> 0:01:58,000
deep ravines, mountainsides.

33
0:01:59.267,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It lives off of rainwater, spring water, sunlight,

34
0:02:03.493,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and of the 1,450 species of bamboo that grow across the world,

35
0:02:08.253,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we use just seven of them.

36
0:02:10.691,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That's my dad.

37
0:02:12.119,000 --> 0:02:14,000
He's the one who got me building with bamboo,

38
0:02:14.22,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and he is standing in a clump

39
0:02:16.31,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of Dendrocalamus asper niger that he planted just seven years ago.

40
0:02:20.327,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Each year, it sends up a new generation of shoots.

41
0:02:23.369,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That shoot, we watched it grow a meter in three days just last week,

42
0:02:28.143,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so we're talking about sustainable timber in three years.

43
0:02:35.225,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, we harvest from hundreds of family-owned clumps.

44
0:02:38.638,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Betung, as we call it, it's really long,

45
0:02:41.29,000 --> 0:02:42,000
up to 18 meters of usable length.

46
0:02:42.956,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Try getting that truck down the mountain.

47
0:02:45.487,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And it's strong: it has the tensile strength of steel,

48
0:02:49.133,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the compressive strength of concrete.

49
0:02:51.849,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Slam four tons straight down on a pole,

50
0:02:54.775,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and it can take it.

51
0:02:57.492,000 --> 0:03:,000
Because it's hollow, it's lightweight,

52
0:03:00.69,000 --> 0:03:02,000
light enough to be lifted by just a few men,

53
0:03:03.41,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or, apparently, one woman.

54
0:03:06.13,000 --> 0:03:11,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

55
0:03:14.279,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And when my father built Green School in Bali,

56
0:03:18.435,000 --> 0:03:21,000
he chose bamboo for all of the buildings on campus,

57
0:03:21.639,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because he saw it as a promise.

58
0:03:23.892,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's a promise to the kids.

59
0:03:25.796,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It's one sustainable material that they will not run out of.

60
0:03:30.547,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And when I first saw these structures under construction about six years ago,

61
0:03:34.694,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I just thought, this makes perfect sense.

62
0:03:38.78,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It is growing all around us.

63
0:03:40.893,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's strong. It's elegant.

64
0:03:43.283,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's earthquake-resistant.

65
0:03:45.514,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Why hasn't this happened sooner, and what can we do with it next?

66
0:03:49.61,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So along with some of the original builders of Green School,

67
0:03:54.637,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I founded Ibuku.

68
0:03:56.613,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Ibu means "mother," and ku means "mine," so it represents my Mother Earth,

69
0:04:02.271,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and at Ibuku, we are a team of artisans, architects and designers,

70
0:04:07.363,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and what we're doing together is creating a new way of building.

71
0:04:12.316,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Over the past five years together,

72
0:04:14.677,000 --> 0:04:18,000
we have built over 50 unique structures, most of them in Bali.

73
0:04:20.737,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Nine of them are at Green Village --

74
0:04:23.779,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you've just seen inside some of these homes --

75
0:04:26.612,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and we fill them with bespoke furniture,

76
0:04:30.776,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we surround them with veggie gardens,

77
0:04:32.834,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we would love to invite you all to come visit someday.

78
0:04:35.946,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And while you're there, you can also see Green School --

79
0:04:38.974,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we keep building classrooms there each year --

80
0:04:41.588,000 --> 0:04:44,000
as well as an updated fairy mushroom house.

81
0:04:46.548,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We're also working on a little house for export.

82
0:04:49.938,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This is a traditional Sumbanese home that we replicated,

83
0:04:53.119,000 --> 0:04:56,000
right down to the details and textiles.

84
0:04:57.056,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A restaurant with an open-air kitchen.

85
0:05:01.31,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It looks a lot like a kitchen, right?

86
0:05:04.32,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And a bridge that spans 22 meters across a river.

87
0:05:09.15,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, what we're doing, it's not entirely new.

88
0:05:13.691,000 --> 0:05:17,000
From little huts to elaborate bridges like this one in Java,

89
0:05:18.22,000 --> 0:05:21,000
bamboo has been in use across the tropical regions of the world

90
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for literally tens of thousands of years.

91
0:05:24.232,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There are islands and even continents that were first reached by bamboo rafts.

92
0:05:30.29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But until recently,

93
0:05:32.823,000 --> 0:05:36,000
it was almost impossible to reliably protect bamboo from insects,

94
0:05:37.444,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and so, just about everything that was ever built out of bamboo is gone.

95
0:05:42.613,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Unprotected bamboo weathers.

96
0:05:44.981,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Untreated bamboo gets eaten to dust.

97
0:05:48.371,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And so that's why most people, especially in Asia,

98
0:05:51.65,000 --> 0:05:54,000
think that you couldn't be poor enough or rural enough to actually want

99
0:05:55.546,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to live in a bamboo house.

100
0:05:58.146,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And so we thought,

101
0:05:59.981,000 --> 0:06:01,000
what will it take to change their minds,

102
0:06:02.326,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to convince people that bamboo is worth building with,

103
0:06:05.507,000 --> 0:06:07,000
much less worth aspiring to?

104
0:06:08.34,000 --> 0:06:11,000
First, we needed safe treatment solutions.

105
0:06:11.428,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Borax is a natural salt.

106
0:06:13.123,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It turns bamboo into a viable building material.

107
0:06:15.839,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Treat it properly, design it carefully,

108
0:06:18.602,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and a bamboo structure can last a lifetime.

109
0:06:22.39,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Second, build something extraordinary out of it.

110
0:06:26.148,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Inspire people.

111
0:06:28.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Fortunately,

112
0:06:29.294,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Balinese culture fosters craftsmanship.

113
0:06:31.168,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It values the artisan.

114
0:06:33.143,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So combine those with the adventurous outliers

115
0:06:35.97,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from new generations of locally trained architects

116
0:06:39.105,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and designers and engineers,

117
0:06:42.53,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and always remember that you are designing

118
0:06:45.683,000 --> 0:06:48,000
for curving, tapering, hollow poles.

119
0:06:49.451,000 --> 0:06:52,000
No two poles alike, no straight lines,

120
0:06:52.725,000 --> 0:06:54,000
no two-by-fours here.

121
0:06:55.128,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The tried-and-true, well-crafted formulas and vocabulary of architecture

122
0:07:00.109,000 --> 0:07:01,000
do not apply here.

123
0:07:01.427,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We have had to invent our own rules.

124
0:07:03.731,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We ask the bamboo what it's good at, what it wants to become,

125
0:07:08.198,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and what it says is: respect it, design for its strengths,

126
0:07:12.69,000 --> 0:07:15,000
protect it from water, and to make the most of its curves.

127
0:07:16.435,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we design in real 3D,

128
0:07:18.336,000 --> 0:07:19,000
making scale structural models

129
0:07:20.159,000 --> 0:07:23,000
out of the same material that we'll later use to build the house.

130
0:07:23.258,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And bamboo model-making, it's an art,

131
0:07:25.278,000 --> 0:07:28,000
as well as some hardcore engineering.

132
0:07:34.752,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So that's the blueprint of the house.

133
0:07:36.632,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Laughter)

134
0:07:39.042,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And we bring it to site,

135
0:07:40.951,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and with tiny rulers, we measure each pole,

136
0:07:43.691,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and consider each curve, and we choose a piece of bamboo from the pile

137
0:07:48.288,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to replicate that house on site.

138
0:07:52.064,000 --> 0:07:55,000
When it comes down to the details, we consider everything.

139
0:07:55.417,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Why are doors so often rectangular?

140
0:07:57.53,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Why not round?

141
0:07:58.876,000 --> 0:07:59,000
How could you make a door better?

142
0:08:00.523,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Well, its hinges battle with gravity,

143
0:08:02.498,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and gravity will always win in the end,

144
0:08:04.658,000 --> 0:08:06,000
so why not have it pivot on the center

145
0:08:07.398,000 --> 0:08:09,000
where it can stay balanced?

146
0:08:09.65,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And while you're at it, why not doors shaped like teardrops?

147
0:08:14.316,000 --> 0:08:17,000
To reap the selective benefits and work within the constraints

148
0:08:17.366,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of this material,

149
0:08:19.1,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we have really had to push ourselves,

150
0:08:21.329,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and within that constraint, we have found space for something new.

151
0:08:27.235,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It's a challenge: how do you make a ceiling

152
0:08:29.525,000 --> 0:08:32,000
if you don't have any flat boards to work with?

153
0:08:32.66,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Let me tell you, sometimes I dream of sheet rock and plywood.

154
0:08:37.21,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:39.71,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But if what you've got is skilled craftsmen

156
0:08:43.819,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and itsy bitsy little splits,

157
0:08:46.49,000 --> 0:08:48,000
weave that ceiling together,

158
0:08:48.672,000 --> 0:08:5,000
stretch a canvas over it, lacquer it.

159
0:08:51.635,000 --> 0:08:53,000
How do you design durable kitchen countertops

160
0:08:54.352,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that do justice to this curving structure you've just built?

161
0:08:57.904,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Slice up a boulder like a loaf of bread,

162
0:09:00.737,000 --> 0:09:02,000
hand-carve each to fit the other,

163
0:09:03.106,000 --> 0:09:05,000
leave the crusts on,

164
0:09:05.427,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and what we're doing, it is almost entirely handmade.

165
0:09:09.677,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The structural connections of our buildings

166
0:09:11.813,000 --> 0:09:15,000
are reinforced by steel joints, but we use a lot of hand-whittled bamboo pins.

167
0:09:16.695,000 --> 0:09:2,000
There are thousands of pins in each floor.

168
0:09:20.891,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin.

169
0:09:25.883,000 --> 0:09:28,000
You can feel the texture under bare feet.

170
0:09:28.995,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And the floor that you walk on,

171
0:09:31.61,000 --> 0:09:32,000
can it affect the way that you walk?

172
0:09:33.453,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Can it change the footprint that you'll ultimately leave on the world?

173
0:09:38.329,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I remember being nine years old

174
0:09:40.279,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and feeling wonder,

175
0:09:42.183,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and possibility,

176
0:09:44.2,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and a little bit of idealism.

177
0:09:46.474,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And we've got a really long way to go,

178
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
there's a lot left to learn,

179
0:09:51.732,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but one thing I know is that with creativity and commitment,

180
0:09:56.672,000 --> 0:10:,000
you can create beauty and comfort

181
0:10:01.223,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and safety and even luxury

182
0:10:04.45,000 --> 0:10:06,000
out of a material that will grow back.

183
0:10:07.408,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Thank you.

184
0:10:09.651,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

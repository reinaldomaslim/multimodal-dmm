1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I am a vicar in the Church of England.

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I've been a priest in the Church for 20 years.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
For most of that time, I've been struggling and grappling

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with questions about the nature of God. Who is God?

5
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And I'm very aware that when you say the word "God,"

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
many people will turn off immediately.

7
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And most people, both within and outside the organized church,

8
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:02,000
still have a picture of a celestial controller,

9
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:08,000
a rule maker, a policeman in the sky who orders everything,

10
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and causes everything to happen.

11
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
He will protect his own people,

12
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and answer the prayers of the faithful.

13
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And in the worship of my church,

14
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
the most frequently used adjective about God is "almighty."

15
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But I have a problem with that.

16
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I have become more and more uncomfortable

17
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with this perception of God over the years.

18
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Do we really believe that God is the kind of male boss that we've been presenting

19
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in our worship and in our liturgies over all these years?

20
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Of course, there have been thinkers

21
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:56,000
who have suggested different ways of looking at God.

22
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Exploring the feminine, nurturing side of divinity.

23
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Suggesting that God expresses Himself or Herself through powerlessness,

24
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
rather than power.

25
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Acknowledging that God is unknown and unknowable by definition.

26
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Finding deep resonances with other religions and philosophies

27
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and ways of looking at life as part of what is a universal and global search for meaning.

28
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
These ideas are well known in liberal academic circles,

29
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but clergy like myself have been reluctant to air them,

30
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
for fear of creating tension and division in our church communities,

31
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:56,000
for fear of upsetting the simple faith of more traditional believers.

32
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I have chosen not to rock the boat.

33
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Then, on December 26th last year, just two months ago,

34
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that underwater earthquake triggered the tsunami.

35
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And two weeks later, Sunday morning, 9th of January,

36
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I found myself standing in front of my congregation --

37
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:27,000
intelligent, well meaning, mostly thoughtful Christian people --

38
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I needed to express, on their behalf, our feelings and our questions.

39
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I had my own personal responses, but I also have a public role,

40
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and something needed to be said.

41
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And this is what I said.

42
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Shortly after the tsunami I read a newspaper article

43
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
written by the Archbishop of Canterbury -- fine title --

44
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
about the tragedy in Southern Asia.

45
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The essence of what he said was this:

46
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the people most affected by the devastation and loss of life

47
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:16,000
do not want intellectual theories about how God let this happen.

48
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He wrote, "If some religious genius did come up with an explanation

49
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of exactly why all these deaths made sense,

50
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:33,000
would we feel happier, or safer, or more confident in God?"

51
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If the man in the photograph that appeared in the newspapers,

52
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:44,000
holding the hand of his dead child was standing in front of us now,

53
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
there are no words that we could say to him.

54
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
A verbal response would not be appropriate.

55
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The only appropriate response would be a compassionate silence

56
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
and some kind of practical help.

57
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It isn't a time for explanation, or preaching, or theology;

58
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it's a time for tears.

59
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This is true. And yet here we are, my church in Oxford,

60
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
semi-detached from events that happened a long way away,

61
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but with our faith bruised.

62
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And we want an explanation from God.

63
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We demand an explanation from God.

64
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Some have concluded that we can only believe in a God who shares our pain.

65
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In some way, God must feel the anguish, and grief,

66
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and physical pain that we feel.

67
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In some way the eternal God must be able to enter into the souls of human beings

68
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and experience the torment within.

69
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And if this is true, it must also be that God knows the joy and exaltation

70
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of the human spirit, as well.

71
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We want a God who can weep with those who weep,

72
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and rejoice with those who rejoice.

73
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This seems to me both a deeply moving and a convincing re-statement

74
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of Christian belief about God.

75
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:31,000
For hundreds of years, the prevailing orthodoxy, the accepted truth,

76
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:35,000
was that God the Father, the Creator, is unchanging

77
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and therefore by definition cannot feel pain or sadness.

78
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now the unchanging God feels a bit cold and indifferent to me.

79
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And the devastating events of the 20th century

80
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
have forced people to question the cold, unfeeling God.

81
0:06:54,000 --> 0:07:,000
The slaughter of millions in the trenches and in the death camps

82
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
have caused people to ask, "Where is God in all this?

83
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Who is God in all this?"

84
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And the answer was, "God is in this with us,

85
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:18,000
or God doesn't deserve our allegiance anymore."

86
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:22,000
If God is a bystander, observing but not involved,

87
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
then God may well exist, but we don't want to know about Him.

88
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Many Jews and Christians now feel like this, I know.

89
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I am among them.

90
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So we have a suffering God --

91
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:43,000
a God who is intimately connected with this world and with every living soul.

92
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I very much relate to this idea of God.

93
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But it isn't enough. I need to ask some more questions,

94
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and I hope they are questions that you will want to ask, as well,

95
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
some of you.

96
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Over the last few weeks I have been struck by the number of times

97
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that words in our worship have felt a bit inappropriate, a bit dodgy.

98
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We have a pram service on Tuesday mornings for mums and their pre-school children.

99
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And last week we sang with the children one of their favorite songs,

100
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
"The Wise Man Built His House Upon the Rock."

101
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Perhaps some of you know it. Some of the words go like this:

102
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
"The foolish man built his house upon the sand /

103
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And the floods came up / And the house on the sand went crash."

104
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Then in the same week, at a funeral,

105
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we sang the familiar hymn "We Plow the Fields and Scatter,"

106
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
a very English hymn.

107
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In the second verse comes the line, "The wind and waves obey Him."

108
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Do they? I don't feel we can sing that song again in church,

109
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
after what's happened.

110
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So the first big question is about control.

111
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Does God have a plan for each of us? Is God in control?

112
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Does God order each moment? Does the wind and the waves obey Him?

113
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
From time to time,

114
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:2,000
one hears Christians telling the story of how God organized things for them,

115
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
so that everything worked out all right --

116
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:27,000
some difficulty overcome, some illness cured, some trouble averted,

117
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
a parking space found at a crucial time.

118
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I can remember someone saying this to me,

119
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:41,000
with her eyes shining with enthusiasm at this wonderful confirmation of her faith

120
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and the goodness of God.

121
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But if God can or will do these things --

122
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
intervene to change the flow of events --

123
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
then surely he could have stopped the tsunami.

124
0:09:55,000 --> 0:10:,000
Do we have a local God who can do little things like parking spaces,

125
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but not big things like 500 mile-per-hour waves?

126
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:09,000
That's just not acceptable to intelligent Christians,

127
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and we must acknowledge it.

128
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Either God is responsible for the tsunami,

129
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
or God is not in control.

130
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
After the tragedy, survival stories began to emerge.

131
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You probably heard some of them:

132
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the man who surfed the wave,

133
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the teenage girl who recognized the danger

134
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because she had just been learning about tsunamis at school.

135
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Then there was the congregation who had left their usual church building on the shore

136
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to hold a service in the hills.

137
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The preacher delivered an extra long sermon,

138
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:46,000
so that they were still out of harm's way when the wave struck.

139
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Afterwards someone said that God must have been looking after them.

140
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So the next question is about partiality.

141
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Can we earn God's favor by worshipping Him or believing in Him?

142
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Does God demand loyalty, like any medieval tyrant?

143
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:13,000
A God who looks after His own, so that Christians are OK,

144
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
while everyone else perishes?

145
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:25,000
A cosmic us and them, and a God who is guilty of the worst kind of favoritism?

146
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
That would be appalling,

147
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and that would be the point at which I would hand in my membership.

148
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Such a God would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity.

149
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So who is God, if not the great puppet-master or the tribal protector?

150
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Perhaps God allows or permits terrible things to happen,

151
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:55,000
so that heroism and compassion can be shown.

152
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Perhaps God is testing us: testing our charity, or our faith.

153
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Perhaps there is a great, cosmic plan that allows for horrible suffering

154
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
so that everything will work out OK in the end.

155
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Perhaps, but these ideas are all just variations on God controlling everything,

156
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the supreme commander toying with expendable units in a great campaign.

157
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We are still left with a God who can do the tsunami and allow Auschwitz.

158
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:38,000
In his great novel, "The Brothers Karamazov," Dostoevsky gives these words to Ivan,

159
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:44,000
addressed to his naive and devout younger brother, Alyosha:

160
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:47,000
"If the sufferings of children go to make up the sum of sufferings

161
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which is necessary for the purchase of truth,

162
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:58,000
then I say beforehand that the entire truth is not worth such a price.

163
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We cannot afford to pay so much for admission.

164
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:05,000
It is not God that I do not accept.

165
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I merely, most respectfully, return Him the ticket."

166
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Or perhaps God set the whole universe going at the beginning

167
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and then relinquished control forever,

168
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:25,000
so that natural processes could occur, and evolution run its course.

169
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
This seems more acceptable,

170
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but it still leaves God with the ultimate moral responsibility.

171
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Is God a cold, unfeeling spectator?

172
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Or a powerless lover, watching with infinite compassion

173
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
things God is unable to control or change?

174
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Is God intimately involved in our suffering,

175
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
so that He feels it in His own being?

176
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:04,000
If we believe something like this, we must let go of the puppet-master completely,

177
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:09,000
take our leave of the almighty controller, abandon traditional models.

178
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We must think again about God.

179
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Maybe God doesn't do things at all.

180
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Maybe God isn't an agent like all of us are agents.

181
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Early religious thought conceived God as a sort of superhuman person,

182
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
doing things all over the place.

183
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Beating up the Egyptians, drowning them in the Red Sea, wasting cities, getting angry.

184
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The people knew their God by His mighty acts.

185
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:48,000
But what if God doesn't act? What if God doesn't do things at all?

186
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:52,000
What if God is in things?

187
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
The loving soul of the universe.

188
0:14:55,000 --> 0:15:03,000
An in-dwelling compassionate presence, underpinning and sustaining all things.

189
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
What if God is in things?

190
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:13,000
In the infinitely complex network of relationships and connections that make up life.

191
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:17,000
In the natural cycle of life and death,

192
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:22,000
the creation and destruction that must happen continuously.

193
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
In the process of evolution.

194
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:31,000
In the incredible intricacy and magnificence of the natural world.

195
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:35,000
In the collective unconscious, the soul of the human race.

196
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:42,000
In you, in me, mind and body and spirit.

197
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:47,000
In the tsunami, in the victims. In the depth of things.

198
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:52,000
In presence and in absence. In simplicity and complexity.

199
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:56,000
In change and development and growth.

200
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:02,000
How does this in-ness, this innerness, this interiority of God work?

201
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It's hard to conceive, and begs more questions.

202
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Is God just another name for the universe,

203
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
with no independent existence at all?

204
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I don't know.

205
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:2,000
To what extent can we ascribe personality to God?

206
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I don't know.

207
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:26,000
In the end, we have to say, "I don't know."

208
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
If we knew, God would not be God.

209
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
To have faith in this God

210
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:36,000
would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe,

211
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements.

212
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Isn't it ironic that Christians who claim to believe

213
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:47,000
in an infinite, unknowable being

214
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:53,000
then tie God down in closed systems and rigid doctrines?

215
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:59,000
How could one practice such a faith?

216
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:06,000
By seeking the God within. By cultivating my own inwardness.

217
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:15,000
In silence, in meditation, in my inner space, in the me that remains

218
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:24,000
when I gently put aside my passing emotions and ideas and preoccupations.

219
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:26,000
In awareness of the inner conversation.

220
0:17:27,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And how would we live such a faith? How would I live such a faith?

221
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
By seeking intimate connection with your inwardness.

222
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:42,000
The kind of relationships when deep speaks to deep.

223
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:46,000
If God is in all people, then there is a meeting place

224
0:17:46,000 --> 0:17:51,000
where my relationship with you becomes a three-way encounter.

225
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:57,000
There is an Indian greeting, which I'm sure some of you know:

226
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:01,000
"Namaste," accompanied by a respectful bow,

227
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:05,000
which, roughly translated means,

228
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:1,000
"That which is of God in me greets that which of God is in you."

229
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Namaste.

230
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And how would one deepen such a faith?

231
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:21,000
By seeking the inwardness which is in all things.

232
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:26,000
In music and poetry, in the natural world of beauty

233
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and in the small ordinary things of life,

234
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:34,000
there is a deep, indwelling presence that makes them extraordinary.

235
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:41,000
It needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting,

236
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:46,000
a contemplative attitude and a generosity and openness

237
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:5,000
to those whose experience is different from my own.

238
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:54,000
When I stood up to speak to my people about God and the tsunami,

239
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:57,000
I had no answers to offer them.

240
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:02,000
No neat packages of faith, with Bible references to prove them.

241
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Only doubts and questioning and uncertainty.

242
0:19:08,000 --> 0:19:11,000
I had some suggestions to make --

243
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:14,000
possible new ways of thinking about God.

244
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Ways that might allow us to go on, down a new and uncharted road.

245
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:28,000
But in the end, the only thing I could say for sure was, "I don't know,"

246
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:33,000
and that just might be the most profoundly religious statement of all.

247
0:19:34,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Thank you.

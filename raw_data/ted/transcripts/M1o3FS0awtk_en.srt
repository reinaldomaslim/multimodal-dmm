1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Martin Luther King

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
did not say,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"I have a nightmare,"

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when he inspired the civil rights movements.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
He said, "I have a dream."

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I have a dream.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I have a dream that we can stop thinking

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that the future will be a nightmare,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and this is going to be a challenge,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because, if you think

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of every major blockbusting film of recent times,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
nearly all of its visions for humanity

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
are apocalyptic.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I think this film

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but everything is desolate,

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
everything is dead.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And just a father and son

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
trying to survive, walking along the road.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I think the environmental movement

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of which I am a part of

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
has been complicit

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in creating this vision of the future.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
For too long,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
we have peddled a nightmarish vision

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of what's going to happen.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We have focused on the problems.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And we have not thought enough

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
about the solutions.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We've used fear, if you like,

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to grab people's attention.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And any psychologist will tell you

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that fear in the organism

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is linked to flight mechanism.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism,

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that when an animal is frightened --

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
think of a deer.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
A deer freezes very, very still,

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
poised to run away.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I think that's what we're doing

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
when we're asking people to engage with our agenda

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
around environmental degradation and climate change.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
People are freezing and running away

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because we're using fear.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and start to think about

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what progress is.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And one of the problems that we face, I think,

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is that the only people that have cornered the market

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in terms of progress

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
is a financial definition of what progress is,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
an economic definition of what progress is --

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that somehow,

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
if we get the right numbers to go up,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we're going to be better off,

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
whether that's on the stock market,

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
whether that's with GDP

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and economic growth,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that somehow life is going to get better.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is somehow appealing to human greed

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
instead of fear --

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that more is better.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the welfare of nations.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system,

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s,

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
said that, "A nation's welfare

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
can scarcely be inferred from their national income."

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But we've created a national accounting system

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which is firmly based on production

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and producing stuff.

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And so our national accounting system

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
became fixated on what we can produce.

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But as early as 1968,

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
this visionary man, Robert Kennedy,

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign,

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
gave the most eloquent deconstruction

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of gross national product

88
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that ever has been.

89
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And he finished his talk with the phrase,

90
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that, "The gross national product

91
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
measures everything except that

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
which makes life worthwhile."

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress,

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
our dominant measure of progress in society,

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is measuring everything

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
except that which makes life worthwhile?

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today,

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
he would be asking statisticians such as myself

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to go out and find out

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
what makes life worthwhile.

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
He'd be asking us to redesign

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
our national accounting system

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to be based upon

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
such important things as social justice,

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
sustainability

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and people's well-being.

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And actually, social scientists have already gone out

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and asked these questions around the world.

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is from a global survey.

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It's asking people, what do they want.

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
say that what they want

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is happiness, for themselves,

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
for their families, their children,

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
their communities.

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Okay, they think money is slightly important.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it's not nearly as important as love.

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We all need to love and be loved in life.

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's not nearly as important as health.

121
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We want to be healthy and live a full life.

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
These seem to be natural human aspirations.

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Why are statisticians not measuring these?

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
instead of just how much stuff we have?

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life --

127
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is think about how do we measure happiness,

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
how do we measure well-being,

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
how can we do that within environmental limits.

130
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And we created, at the organization that I work for,

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the New Economics Foundation,

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
something we call the Happy Planet Index,

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?

135
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And what we do,

136
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation

137
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is how successful is it

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.

139
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That should be the goal

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of every nation on the planet.

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But we have to remember

142
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that there's a fundamental input to that,

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.

144
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It is the ultimate scarce resource,

146
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the one planet that we share.

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And economics is very interested in scarcity.

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
When it has a scarce resource

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that it wants to turn into

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
a desirable outcome,

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
it thinks in terms of efficiency.

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.

153
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And this is a measure of how much well-being

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we get for our planetary resource use.

155
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It is an efficiency measure.

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And probably the easiest way to show you that,

157
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
is to show you this graph.

158
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Running horizontally along the graph,

159
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is "ecological footprint,"

160
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which is a measure of how much resources we use

161
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and how much pressure we put on the planet.

162
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
More is bad.

163
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Running vertically upwards,

164
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is a measure called "happy life years."

165
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's about the well-being of nations.

166
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.

167
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.

169
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now, there's a huge array of nations

170
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
around that global average.

171
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
To the top right of the graph,

172
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,

173
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but they're using a lot of planet to get there.

174
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
They are the U.S.A.,

175
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
other Western countries going across in those triangles

176
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and a few Gulf states in there actually.

177
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph,

178
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
are countries that are not producing much well-being --

179
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
typically, sub-Saharan Africa.

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
In Hobbesian terms,

181
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
life is short and brutish there.

182
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The average life expectancy in many of these countries

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is only 40 years.

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Malaria, HIV/AIDS

185
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
are killing a lot of people

186
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in these regions of the world.

187
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But now for the good news!

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles,

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that are doing better than global average,

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is an aspirational graph.

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They're Latin American.

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The country on its own up at the top

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is a place I haven't been to.

196
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Maybe some of you have.

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Costa Rica.

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Costa Rica --

199
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.

200
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
That is longer than in the USA.

201
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the happiest nation on the planet --

203
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.

204
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
They are the happiest place.

205
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They are doing that

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
on a quarter of the resources

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that are used typically in [the] Western world --

208
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
a quarter of the resources.

209
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
What's going on there?

210
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What's happening in Costa Rica?

211
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We can look at some of the data.

212
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.

213
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Their government is one of the first to commit

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to be carbon neutral by 2021.

215
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They abolished the army

216
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in 1949 --

217
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
1949.

218
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And they invested in social programs --

219
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
health and education.

220
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America

221
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and in the world.

222
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.

223
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
They have the social connectedness.

224
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

225
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about --

226
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is that the future

227
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
might not be North American,

228
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
might not be Western European.

229
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It might be Latin American.

230
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And the challenge, really,

231
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is to pull the global average up here.

232
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That's what we need to do.

233
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And if we're going to do that,

234
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we need to pull countries from the bottom,

235
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.

236
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.

237
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
That's one way of looking at it.

238
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.

239
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world,

240
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.

241
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And this is the trend in well-being over that time,

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
a small increase,

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but this is the trend in ecological footprint.

244
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And so in strict happy-planet methodology,

245
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
we've become less efficient

246
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
at turning our ultimate scarce resource

247
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
into the outcome we want to.

248
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And the point really is, is that I think,

249
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
probably everybody in this room

250
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
would like society to get to 2050

251
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
without an apocalyptic

252
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
something happening.

253
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's actually not very long away.

254
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's half a human lifetime away.

255
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
A child entering school today

256
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
will be my age in 2050.

257
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is not the very distant future.

258
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This is what the U.K. government target

259
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.

260
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.

261
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That is changing our business.

262
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
That is changing the way we create our organizations,

263
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we do our government policy and we live our lives.

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And the point is,

265
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
we need to carry on increasing well-being.

266
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
No one can go to the polls

267
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and say that quality of life is going to reduce.

268
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
None of us, I think,

269
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
want human progress to stop.

270
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I think we want it to carry on.

271
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.

272
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.

273
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.

274
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
They want to hold on to what they've got.

275
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And if we're going to engage them,

276
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I think that's what we've got to do.

277
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.

278
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,

279
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but the point is we need to turn those curves.

280
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And this is where I think we can take a leaf

281
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
out of systems theory, systems engineers,

282
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
where they create feedback loops,

283
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
put the right information at the right point of time.

284
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."

285
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
You put a smart meter in your home,

286
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and you see how much electricity you're using right now,

287
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
how much it's costing you,

288
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.

289
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
What would that look like for society?

290
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Why is it, on the radio news every evening,

291
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio --

292
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.

293
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And why do I hear that?

294
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,

295
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or American used yesterday?

296
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Did we meet our three percent annual target

297
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
on reducing carbon emissions?

298
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That's how you create a collective goal.

299
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.

300
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And we need positive feedback loops

301
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
for increasing well-being

302
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.

303
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,

304
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
which we know is really linked to creativity,

305
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
which is linked to innovation,

306
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.

307
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.

308
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.

309
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message

310
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
on five fruit and vegetables a day

311
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.

312
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
What are these for happiness?

313
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What are the five things that you should do every day

314
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to be happier?

315
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago,

316
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
a big program called the Foresight program --

317
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts --

318
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
everything evidence based -- a huge tome.

319
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do

320
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to improve well-being in your life?

321
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And the point of these is

322
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,

323
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.

324
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And the first of these is to connect,

325
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is that your social relationships

326
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
are the most important cornerstones of your life.

327
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Do you invest the time with your loved ones

328
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that you could do, and energy?

329
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Keep building them.

330
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The second one is be active.

331
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The fastest way out of a bad mood:

332
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.

333
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Being active is great for our positive mood.

334
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The third one is take notice.

335
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
How aware are you of things going on around the world,

336
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
the seasons changing, people around you?

337
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?

338
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness,

339
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
cognitive behavioral therapy,

340
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
[very] strong for our well being.

341
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The fourth is keep learning

342
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and keep is important --

343
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
learning throughout the whole life course.

344
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Older people who keep learning and are curious,

345
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.

346
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.

347
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
It's more curiosity.

348
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It can be learning to cook a new dish,

349
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.

350
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Keep learning.

351
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And the final one

352
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
is that most anti-economic of activities,

353
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but give.

354
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Our generosity, our altruism,

355
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
our compassion,

356
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
are all hardwired

357
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
to the reward mechanism in our brain.

358
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We feel good if we give.

359
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
You can do an experiment where you give

360
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.

361
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves

362
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and one on other people.

363
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
You measure their happiness at the end of the day,

364
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier

365
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that those that spent it on themselves.

366
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And these five ways,

367
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
which we put onto these handy postcards,

368
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I would say, don't have to cost the earth.

369
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
They don't have any carbon content.

370
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.

371
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And so I think it's really quite feasible

372
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that happiness does not cost the earth.

373
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Now, Martin Luther King,

374
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
on the eve of his death,

375
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
gave an incredible speech.

376
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead,

377
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
there may be trouble ahead,

378
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but I fear no one. I don't care.

379
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I have been to the mountain top,

380
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and I have seen the Promised Land."

381
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Now, he was a preacher,

382
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
but I believe the environmental movement

383
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and, in fact, the business community, government,

384
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
needs to go to the top of the mountain top,

385
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and it needs to look out,

386
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and it needs to see the Promised Land,

387
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
or the land of promise,

388
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and it needs to have a vision

389
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
of a world that we all want.

390
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition

391
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to get there,

392
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and we need to pave that great transition with good things.

393
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Human beings want to be happy.

394
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Pave them with the five ways.

395
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And we need to have signposts

396
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
gathering people together and pointing them --

397
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
something like the Happy Planet Index.

398
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And then I believe

399
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that we can all create a world we all want,

400
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
where happiness does not cost the earth.

401
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Applause)

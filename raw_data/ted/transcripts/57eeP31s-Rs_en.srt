1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about my project, Tidying Up Art.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
First of all -- any questions so far?

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous

7
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because I'm speaking in a foreign language,

8
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.

9
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German

10
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like

11
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
if we Swiss try to speak American.

12
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.

13
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.

14
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,

16
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and you have to go on talking like this all the time.

17
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.

19
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,

20
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it's more or less a picture book.

21
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So the reading would be over very quickly.

22
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,

23
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.

24
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --

25
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.

27
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.

28
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You won't be familiar with it.

29
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,

30
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler

31
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day

32
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore

33
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
this guy was looking at all day long.

34
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.

35
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And it seemed to me even he felt really bad

36
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
facing these unorganized red squares day after day.

37
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So I decided to give him a little support,

38
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.

39
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.

41
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely

42
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art

43
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is particularly topsy-turvy.

44
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And I can show here a very good example.

45
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.

46
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's a picture by Paul Klee.

47
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.

48
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

49
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.

50
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --

51
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the whole thing is unstructured.

52
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --

53
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.

55
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We can see here he started out with orange,

56
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and then he already ran out of orange,

57
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.

58
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.

59
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:

61
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.

62
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Yeah, that's great.

63
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.

64
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.

65
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

66
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What can you say? What a mess.

67
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.

68
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
If my room back home had looked like this,

69
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
my mother would have grounded me for three days.

70
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.

71
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And that's really advanced tidying up.

72
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

73
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,

74
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but that's actually more in Switzerland.

75
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.

77
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We are only happy when things are in order.

78
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But to go on, here is a very good example to see.

79
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is a picture by Joan Miro.

80
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes

81
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.

82
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.

83
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

84
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And this is my --

85
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

86
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.

87
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's more economical and also more efficient.

88
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.

89
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.

90
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,

91
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,

92
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because I've had my working methods patented

93
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
at the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.

94
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I'll just quote from the specification.

96
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht --"

97
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's not finished yet.

98
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen

99
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst

100
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
durch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten

101
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
des allgemeinen Formenschatzes

102
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
neue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."

103
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.

104
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.

105
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,

106
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that's why these patents are sometimes necessary.

107
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I would like to do a short test with you.

108
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.

109
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.

110
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.

111
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.

112
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three

113
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?

114
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
One, two, three.

115
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way

117
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
can sometimes lead to complete chaos.

118
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.

119
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.

120
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see

121
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.

122
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.

123
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

124
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.

125
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's a picture by Keith Haring.

126
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

127
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I think it doesn't matter.

128
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.

129
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.

130
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.

131
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

132
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.

133
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
One can see here quite clearly,

134
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you can see we have 25 pale green elements,

135
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
of which one is in the form of a circle.

136
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.

137
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis

138
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to cover all Mr. Haring's various works,

139
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.

140
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure

141
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.

142
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

143
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
One can obviously also make combinations.

144
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.

145
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.

146
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.

147
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,

148
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.

149
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

150
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --

151
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

152
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.

153
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.

154
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

155
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.

156
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.

157
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

158
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And here, that's one of my favorites.

159
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.

160
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You know, there is a --

161
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

162
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.

163
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.

164
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.

165
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And you know, there you had this little sign --

166
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,

167
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.

168
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.

169
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So after a while I decided to have a little fun,

170
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.

171
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.

172
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.

173
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.

174
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

175
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.

176
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
And when I returned it looked like this.

177
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

178
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.

179
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Laughter)

180
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
OK, I mean, I can see there are always people

181
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that like reacting that one or another picture

182
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.

183
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
This is a picture by Rene Magritte,

184
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --

185
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.

186
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Laughter)

187
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.

188
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Some people would make apple pie out of it.

189
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But it's a very good example to see that the whole work

190
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job

191
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.

192
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,

193
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
otherwise it would look like this.

194
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Laughter)

195
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.

196
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.

197
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.

198
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way

199
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and put the paint back into the cans.

200
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
(Applause)

201
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.

202
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.

203
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Here I just brought it back to its original state.

204
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Laughter)

205
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --

206
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.

207
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings

208
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.

209
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.

210
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Laughter)

211
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,

212
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and I collected together all his dots.

213
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And now they're all in here.

214
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

215
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You can count them afterwards, if you like.

216
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:

217
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.

218
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.

219
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I mean, it's "the future we will create."

220
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Laughter)

221
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.

222
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.

223
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.

224
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

225
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves

226
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
where old Bruegel's people went?

227
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Of course, they're not gone. They're all here.

228
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Laughter)

229
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I just piled them up.

230
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Laughter)

231
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.

232
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.

233
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.

234
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

235
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
But before leaving I would like to show you,

236
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I'm working right now on another -- in a related field

237
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.

238
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And I started to bring some order into some flags.

239
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.

240
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Laughter)

241
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And then maybe before I leave you ...

242
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.

243
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Laughter)

244
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,

245
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.

246
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Laughter)

247
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Thank you very much.

248
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Applause)

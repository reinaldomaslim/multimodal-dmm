1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There are some chasms so deep and so wide,

2
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we find it hard to imagine how we'll ever make it to the other side.

3
0:00:22.52,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That space between who we are and who we want to be,

4
0:00:27.48,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the gaps between our high ideals

5
0:00:30.76,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and our base realities.

6
0:00:34.08,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The distance between what we say

7
0:00:37.92,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and what we really mean.

8
0:00:40.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The raging river that flows between what actually happened

9
0:00:44.68,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and our convenient memories.

10
0:00:47.48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The lies we tell ourselves are lakes,

11
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
overflowing their banks,

12
0:00:51.76,000 --> 0:00:54,000
flooding our speech with waters, caustic and rank.

13
0:00:56.4,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The only bridge is the truth,

14
0:00:59.44,000 --> 0:01:02,000
passing through me and you, as we look one another eye to eye.

15
0:01:04.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But so often, that look is filled with our hesitations,

16
0:01:07.68,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and we can't help but glance to the side.

17
0:01:12.4,000 --> 0:01:14,000
See, we've long ago let go of the language

18
0:01:14.92,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with which we describe our softer parts.

19
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We learn early that those with softer hearts suffer.

20
0:01:21.32,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So we allow lean emotion to reign,

21
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
never noticing that only strain has been the fruit of our restraints.

22
0:01:27.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We haven't escaped pain.

23
0:01:29.36,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And our battle scars are far from faint.

24
0:01:31.68,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Yet and still, despite our desire and willingness to heal,

25
0:01:36.2,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we often find ourselves fighting hard in the paint,

26
0:01:39.44,000 --> 0:01:42,000
holding onto false images of everything we ain't.

27
0:01:44.12,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So while our dream coincide, our fears collide.

28
0:01:48.84,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And we want to know one another, but think we can't.

29
0:01:53.68,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The gulf between empathy and equity

30
0:01:57.28,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is as unfathomable as the fissures that line our collective integrity.

31
0:02:02.96,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And we spend eternal eternities

32
0:02:06.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
trying to translate that into virtue.

33
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Perhaps you have met one or two of the virtuous on your path.

34
0:02:14.2,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They are only very few,

35
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I know that I have, from time to time,

36
0:02:17.96,000 --> 0:02:18,000
mistaken pretenders for real,

37
0:02:19.64,000 --> 0:02:23,000
yet still make room for the possibility that it's I who's been pretending.

38
0:02:25.4,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Please, bear with me, I'm still mending,

39
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but I'm no longer bending to the will of my injuries,

40
0:02:30.72,000 --> 0:02:32,000
nor my injurers.

41
0:02:32.84,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I much prefer to stretch my arms like Nüt until I become the sky.

42
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'd rather stretch my tongue with truth,

43
0:02:40.28,000 --> 0:02:43,000
our bridge to cross when we look one another in the eye.

44
0:02:44.72,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But the tongue, like the heart, gets tired.

45
0:02:48.48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The weak make it hard for the strong to stay inspired,

46
0:02:51.6,000 --> 0:02:54,000
like the lost prevent the found from escaping the mire,

47
0:02:55.12,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and the degraded stop the enlightened from taking us higher.

48
0:02:58.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But no matter what you hear from the mouths of these liars,

49
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we are one people

50
0:03:03.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
with one destiny and the common enemy,

51
0:03:06.44,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that's why it really stresses me to see our hearts so tattered,

52
0:03:10.48,000 --> 0:03:11,000
our minds so scattered,

53
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:13,000
our egos so easily flattered.

54
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We're enslaved, yet think of our shackles as gifts.

55
0:03:17.36,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Rather than resist our masters, we let them widen our rifts,

56
0:03:20.76,000 --> 0:03:22,000
like mindless, material junkies,

57
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we seek that which lowers, not lifts.

58
0:03:26.84,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But somewhere in our midst,

59
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:3,000
there's been a paradigm shift.

60
0:03:31.88,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Justice is getting restless in its chains.

61
0:03:35.24,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Our youth find it useless to separate their souls from their brains,

62
0:03:39.2,000 --> 0:03:42,000
their truth is ingrained, their integrity insustained.

63
0:03:42.6,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Let me call your attention to those who serve as examples.

64
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Those who daily give their all,

65
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but their reserves are still ample.

66
0:03:50.28,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Those who battle friend and foe,

67
0:03:52.28,000 --> 0:03:53,000
yet their hope is never trampled,

68
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they make music, never sample,

69
0:03:56.12,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and the world's ugly could never cancel

70
0:03:58.56,000 --> 0:04:,000
the fullness and the sweetness of their composition.

71
0:04:01.96,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Nor the unadulterated truth of their mission.

72
0:04:05.08,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's time we shut our mouths and listen.

73
0:04:08.6,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Close our eyes and pray

74
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
for the humility and the guidance

75
0:04:13.88,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to follow them to the way.

76
0:04:16.6,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Thank you.

77
0:04:17.84,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Applause)

78
0:04:19.44,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Cheers)

79
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Thank you.

80
0:04:22.4,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

81
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Cheers)

82
0:04:31.399,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Thank you.

83
0:04:32.72,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

84
0:04:36.68,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Thank you all so much,

85
0:04:37.96,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you have no idea how fulfilling and energizing that is.

86
0:04:42.68,000 --> 0:04:43,000
For the past three years,

87
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I've had the privilege of codesigning with my neighbors

88
0:04:48.52,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a space in New Orleans known as Under the Bridge.

89
0:04:52.4,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In 1966, Interstate 10 landed on the Tremé neighborhood,

90
0:04:57.92,000 --> 0:05:01,000
displacing 326 black-owned businesses,

91
0:05:02.2,000 --> 0:05:05,000
over 300 live oak trees,

92
0:05:05.72,000 --> 0:05:09,000
effectively destroying the region's most successful black commercial district,

93
0:05:10.48,000 --> 0:05:12,000
disrupting intergenerational wealth

94
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and truly unraveling the fabric

95
0:05:15.08,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of the nation's oldest African American neighborhood.

96
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Today, after 45 years of community advocacy,

97
0:05:24.8,000 --> 0:05:27,000
after 500 hours of community engagement

98
0:05:28.24,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and 80 hours of community design,

99
0:05:31.6,000 --> 0:05:34,000
we are so excited that in 2018,

100
0:05:35.28,000 --> 0:05:37,000
after capturing the voices of thousands of residents

101
0:05:37.88,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and the support of our local, federal and philanthropic partners,

102
0:05:42.32,000 --> 0:05:45,000
as the city celebrates 300 years of transforming the world,

103
0:05:46.32,000 --> 0:05:52,000
we will get to transform 19 blocks under the Interstate into community space,

104
0:05:52.84,000 --> 0:05:53,000
into black-owned businesses,

105
0:05:54.6,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in the form of the Claiborne Corridor Cultural Innovation District.

106
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Cheers)

107
0:06:00.52,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

108
0:06:05.96,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We will be bridging time, we will bridge memory,

109
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we will bridge disparity and injustice,

110
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and we can't wait to see you all on the other side.

111
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Thank you.

112
0:06:18.24,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Applause)

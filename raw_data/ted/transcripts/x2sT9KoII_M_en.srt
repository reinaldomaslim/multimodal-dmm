by just putting his head on one or the other side.

When you go out of an airplane, you are almost naked.

You take a position like that.

It is purely your body,

87
0:07:06.461,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and the wings become part of the body and vice versa?

Two parachutes.

132
0:09:16.701,000 --> 0:09:2,000
That means, if I have a problem with the first one I pull,

133
0:09:21.402,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I still have the possibility to open the second one.

That's the real important thing about safety.

136

I did use that during these last 15 years

Never with that type of wing, but at the beginning.

139
0:09:38.828,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I can release my wing

140
0:09:41.891,000 --> 0:09:44,000
when I am in a spin or unstable.

141
0:09:45.041,000 --> 0:09:47,000
BG: We saw the 2009 crossing of the Gibraltar Strait

142
0:09:47.758,000 --> 0:09:48,000
where you lost control

143
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and then you dived down into the clouds

144
0:09:52.069,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and in the ocean.

145
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So that was one of those cases where you let the wings go, right?

146
0:09:57.081,000 --> 0:09:59,000
YR: Yeah. I did try in the clouds,

147
0:09:59.53,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but you lose orientation completely.

148
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So I did try to take, again,

149
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:06,000
a climb altitude.

150
0:10:07.792,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I thought, okay, I will go out.

151
0:10:09.864,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But most probably, I did something like that.

152
0:10:12.679,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

153
0:10:13.773,000 --> 0:10:15,000
BG: Something that is not very safe, the image.

154

155
0:10:19.329,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

156
0:10:21.607,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But you have not the right altitude.

157
0:10:24.07,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So the next thing I saw was just blue.

158
0:10:26.792,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It was the sea.

159

I have also an audible altimeter.

160
0:10:31.27,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So I was at my minimum altitude

161
0:10:33.596,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in that vector -- fast --

162
0:10:36.928,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so I pulled that.

163
0:10:38.805,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And then I did open my chute.

164
0:10:40.227,000 --> 0:10:43,000
BG: So the wings have their own parachute, and you have your two parachutes.

165
0:10:43.823,000 --> 0:10:45,000
YR: Exactly. There is a rescue parachute for the wing

166
0:10:46.458,000 --> 0:10:47,000
for two reasons:

167
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
so I can repair it afterward

168
0:10:49.999,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and especially so nobody takes that, just on his head.

169
0:10:55.369,000 --> 0:10:57,000
BG: I see. Maybe come back here.

170
0:10:57.624,000 --> 0:10:59,000
This is risky stuff indeed.

171
0:11:00.077,000 --> 0:11:02,000
People have died trying to do this kind of thing.

172
0:11:03.026,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And you don't look like a crazy guy; you're a Swiss airline pilot,

173
0:11:06.146,000 --> 0:11:08,000
so you're rather a checklist kind of guy.

174
0:11:08.936,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I assume you have standards.

175
0:11:10.73,000 --> 0:11:12,000
YR: Yeah. I have no checklist for that.

176
0:11:13.461,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Laughter)

177
0:11:14.583,000 --> 0:11:15,000
BG: Let's not tell your employer.

178
0:11:16.258,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

179
0:11:17.374,000 --> 0:11:18,000
YR: No, that's really two worlds.

180
0:11:20.946,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Civil aviation is something that we know very well.

181
0:11:24.066,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We have a hundred years of experience.

182
0:11:26.986,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And you can adapt really precisely.

183
0:11:31.244,000 --> 0:11:33,000
With that, I have to adapt to something new.

184
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That means improvise.

185
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So it's really a play between these two approaches.

186
0:11:39.514,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Something that I know very well, these principles.

187
0:11:42.753,000 --> 0:11:45,000
For example, we have two engines on an Airbus;

188
0:11:46.038,000 --> 0:11:48,000
with only one engine, you can fly it.

189
0:11:48.417,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So plan B, always a plan B.

190
0:11:51.028,000 --> 0:11:52,000
In a fighter, you have an ejection seat.

191
0:11:52.958,000 --> 0:11:54,000
That's my ejection seat.

192
0:11:55.009,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So I have the approach of a professional pilot

193
0:11:58.009,000 --> 0:12:03,000
with the respect of a pioneer

194
0:12:03.278,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in front of Mother Nature.

195
0:12:05.761,000 --> 0:12:07,000
BG: It's well said.

196
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
What happens if one of the engines stops?

197
0:12:11.404,000 --> 0:12:14,000
YR: I do a roll.

198
0:12:15.057,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And then I stabilize,

199
0:12:18.365,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and according to my altitude, I continue on two or three engines.

200
0:12:22.361,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It's sometimes possible.

201
0:12:23.942,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It's quite complicated to explain,

202
0:12:27.143,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but according to which regime I was,

203
0:12:30.537,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I can continue on two

204
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and try to get a nice place to land, and then I open my parachute.

205
0:12:35.903,000 --> 0:12:36,000
BG: So the beginning of the flight

206
0:12:37.548,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter,

207
0:12:39.944,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines,

208
0:12:42.687,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and then you basically take off mid-air somewhere.

209
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And then the landing, as we have seen,

210
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
arriving on this side of the Channel,

211
0:12:50.126,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is through a parachute.

212
0:12:51.845,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So just as a curiosity,

213
0:12:53.734,000 --> 0:12:55,000
where did you land when you flew over the Grand Canyon?

214
0:12:57.156,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Did you land on the rim, down at the bottom?

215
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
YR: It was down on the bottom.

216
0:13:01.554,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back.

217
0:13:05.93,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But it was too stony and full of cactus on top.

218
0:13:10.363,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Laughter)

219
0:13:11.403,000 --> 0:13:13,000
BG: That's exactly why I asked the question.

220
0:13:13.569,000 --> 0:13:16,000
YR: And also, the currents are quite funny there.

221
0:13:17.418,000 --> 0:13:19,000
There is big thermal activity,

222
0:13:19.648,000 --> 0:13:21,000
big difference in altitude also.

223
0:13:21.704,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So it was much safer for me to land at the bottom.

224
0:13:26.201,000 --> 0:13:28,000
BG: I think that right now, many people are asking,

225
0:13:28.978,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"When are you developing a double-seater

226
0:13:30.97,000 --> 0:13:31,000
so they can fly with you?"

227
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
YR: I have a standard answer.

228
0:13:34.466,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Have you ever seen tandem birds?

229
0:13:38.464,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Laughter)

230
0:13:39.491,000 --> 0:13:4,000
BG: Perfect answer.

231
0:13:40.656,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Applause)

232
0:13:49.063,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Applause ends)

233
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
BG: Yves, one last question.

234
0:13:52.981,000 --> 0:13:54,000
What's next for you? What's next for Jetman?

235
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
YR: First, to instruct a younger guy.

236
0:13:59.595,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I want to share it, to do formation flights.

237
0:14:03.164,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And I plan to start from a cliff,

238
0:14:05.702,000 --> 0:14:06,000
like catapulted from a cliff.

239
0:14:07.607,000 --> 0:14:09,000
BG: So instead of jumping off a plane, yes?

240
0:14:09.632,000 --> 0:14:12,000
YR: Yes, with the final goal to take off, but with initial speed.

241
0:14:13.865,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Really, I go step by step.

242
0:14:15.896,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It seems a little bit crazy, but it's not.

243
0:14:19.004,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It's possible to start already now, it's just too dangerous.

244
0:14:22.583,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Laughter)

245
0:14:24.567,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Thanks to the increasing technology, better technology,

246
0:14:29.979,000 --> 0:14:3,000
it will be safe.

247
0:14:31.286,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And I hope it will be for everybody.

248
0:14:34.071,000 --> 0:14:36,000
BG: Yves, thank you very much. Yves Rossy.

249
0:14:36.097,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Applause)

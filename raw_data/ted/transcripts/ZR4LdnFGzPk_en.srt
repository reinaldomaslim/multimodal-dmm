1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to make an argument today

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that may seem a little bit crazy:

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
social media and the end of gender.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Let me connect the dots.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm going to argue today

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that the social media applications

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that we all know and love, or love to hate,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
are actually going to help free us

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
from some of the absurd assumptions

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that we have as a society about gender.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I think that social media

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is actually going to help us dismantle

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that we see in media and advertising

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
about gender.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
If you hadn't noticed,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
our media climate generally provides

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a very distorted mirror

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
of our lives and of our gender,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and I think that's going to change.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now most media companies --

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
television, radio, publishing, games, you name it --

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
they use very rigid segmentation methods

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in order to understand their audiences.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's old-school demographics.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now the crazy thing

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is that media companies believe

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that if you fall within a certain demographic category

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
then you are predictable in certain ways --

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you have certain taste,

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that you like certain things.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And so the bizarre result of this

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is that most of our popular culture

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is actually based on these presumptions

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
about our demographics.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Age demographics:

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the 18 to 49 demo

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
has had a huge impact

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
on all mass media programming in this country

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
since the 1960s,

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when the baby boomers were still young.

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now they've aged out of that demographic,

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but it's still the case

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that powerful ratings companies like Nielson

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
don't even take into account

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
viewers of television shows over age 54.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In our media environment,

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
it's as if they don't even exist.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do --

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it's a popular TV show in the States --

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
which first came about in the 1960s,

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
where you create these complex psychological profiles

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of consumers.

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's really just been basic demographics.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
on demographics

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and how they affect media and entertainment

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in this country and abroad.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And in the last three years,

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and we've discovered some very interesting things.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
All the people who participate in social media networks

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
belong to the same old demographic categories

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
that media companies and advertisers

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
have used in order to understand them.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But those categories mean even less now

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
than they did before,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because with online networking tools,

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's much easier for us

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to escape some of our demographic boxes.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We're able to connect with people quite freely

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and to redefine ourselves online.

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We can also connect with people

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
based on our very specific interests.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We don't need a media company

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to help do this for us.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So the traditional media companies, of course,

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are paying very close attention to these online communities.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They know this is the mass audience of the future;

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
they need to figure it out.

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But they're having a hard time doing it

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
because that's how ad rates are still determined.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
When they're monitoring your clickstream --

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and you know they are --

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they have a really hard time

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
figuring out your age, your gender and your income.

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
They can make some educated guesses.

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But they get a lot more information

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
about what you do online,

96
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
what you like, what interests you.

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That's easier for them to find out than who you are.

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And even though that's still sort of creepy,

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
there is an upside

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to having your taste monitored.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Suddenly our taste is being respected

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in a way that it hasn't been before.

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It had been presumed before.

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So when you look online at the way people aggregate,

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they don't aggregate

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
around age, gender and income.

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They aggregate around the things they love,

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the things that they like,

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and if you think about it, shared interests and values

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
than demographic categories.

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I'd much rather know

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
whether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
rather than how old you are.

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That would tell me something more substantial about you.

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that's actually quite surprising.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It turns out that women

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
are really driving the social media revolution.

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
If you look at the statistics --

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
these are worldwide statistics --

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in every single age category,

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
women actually outnumber men

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in their use of social networking technologies.

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And then if you look at the amount of time

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that they spend on these sites,

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
they truly dominate the social media space,

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which is a space that's having a huge impact

129
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
on old media.

130
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The question is: what sort of impact

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is this going to have on our culture,

132
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and what's it going to mean for women?

133
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If the case is that social media

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is dominating old media

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and women are dominating social media,

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
then does that mean that women

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
are going to take over global media?

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Are we suddenly going to see

139
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
a lot more female characters in cartoons

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and in games and on TV shows?

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
actually be chick flicks?

143
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Could this be possible,

144
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that suddenly our media landscape

145
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
will become a feminist landscape?

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.

147
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because they realize this is important for their business,

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I think that women

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
are also going to continue to dominate

151
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the social media sphere.

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
responsible for driving a stake through the heart

154
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of cheesy genre categories

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
like the "chick flick"

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and all these other genre categories

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that presume that certain demographic groups

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
like certain things --

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that Hispanics like certain things,

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that young people like certain things.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is far too simplistic.

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The future entertainment media that we're going to see

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is going to be very data-driven,

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and it's going to be based on the information

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that we ascertain from taste communities online,

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
where women are really driving the action.

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So you may be asking, well why is it important

168
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that I know what entertains people?

169
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Why should I know this?

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Of course, old media companies and advertisers

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
need to know this.

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But my argument is that,

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
if you want to understand the global village,

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
it's probably a good idea that you figure out

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
what they're passionate about, what amuses them,

176
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
what they choose to do in their free time.

177
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is a very important thing to know about people.

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I've spent most of my professional life

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
researching media and entertainment

180
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and its impact on people's lives.

181
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And I do it not just because it's fun --

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
though actually, it is really fun --

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but also because

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
our research has shown over and over again

185
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that entertainment and play

186
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
have a huge impact on people's lives --

187
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
for instance, on their political beliefs

188
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and on their health.

189
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
looking at how people amuse themselves

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is a really good way to start.

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So imagine a media atmosphere

193
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes

194
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
about gender

195
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and other demographic characteristics.

196
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Can you even imagine what that looks like?

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I can't wait to find out what it looks like.

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Thank you so much.

199
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Applause)

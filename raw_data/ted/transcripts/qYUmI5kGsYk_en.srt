1
0:00:12.793,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We humans are becoming an urban species,

2
0:00:18.36,000 --> 0:00:21,000
so cities, they are our natural habitat.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That is where we live.

4
0:00:24.72,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In 2014, over 54 percent

5
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of the world population

6
0:00:30.64,000 --> 0:00:32,000
was living in cities,

7
0:00:34.12,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I can bet you

8
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that so many of these people have thought

9
0:00:38.96,000 --> 0:00:4,000
of how they would do things differently,

10
0:00:41.56,000 --> 0:00:43,000
like if I only had the tools

11
0:00:44.24,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to change things in my city,

12
0:00:47.64,000 --> 0:00:48,000
what would I do?

13
0:00:48.92,000 --> 0:00:5,000
What would my dream city be like?

14
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And these tools,

15
0:00:53.92,000 --> 0:00:55,000
this is just what we gave them.

16
0:00:58.12,000 --> 0:01:,000
Two years ago, my team and I,

17
0:01:00.68,000 --> 0:01:01,000
we released a game,

18
0:01:02.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"Cities: Skylines."

19
0:01:03.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It is a game about building cities.

20
0:01:07.68,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So I have always been interested in cities as systems.

21
0:01:11.36,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's something that I find immensely interesting.

22
0:01:15.28,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But what I didn't understand

23
0:01:17.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
was that I am not alone in this.

24
0:01:20.8,000 --> 0:01:21,000
People love cities.

25
0:01:22.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They are interested. They have ideas.

26
0:01:24.88,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The game was an instant hit.

27
0:01:27.12,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So far, over three and a half million people have played it.

28
0:01:33.28,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And it's not just about playing.

29
0:01:36.08,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We also have really awesome sharing systems.

30
0:01:40.84,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So people play, they create cities

31
0:01:43.56,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and then they are sharing these creations,

32
0:01:46.4,000 --> 0:01:48,000
showing off what they have made.

33
0:01:49.4,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And what I will show you

34
0:01:52.56,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is some of these cities

35
0:01:54.8,000 --> 0:01:55,000
created by the players.

36
0:01:56.72,000 --> 0:02:,000
So the game is about self-expression,

37
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
creativity,

38
0:02:02.52,000 --> 0:02:06,000
not just overcoming the challenges posed by the simulation.

39
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It is about showing what your cities look like.

40
0:02:12.48,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So I have a couple of videos.

41
0:02:14.6,000 --> 0:02:15,000
These are from YouTube.

42
0:02:16.44,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And these are some of the most interesting city designs I have seen.

43
0:02:20.919,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So they are all different,

44
0:02:22.44,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and I hope you like all of these.

45
0:02:27.04,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This one is called The Netherlands.

46
0:02:29.4,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's by Silvarret.

47
0:02:31.36,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And when you start the game,

48
0:02:33.52,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you have an empty piece of land.

49
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This land, it can be based on the real world,

50
0:02:40.08,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,

51
0:02:43.04,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or you can, of course, download a city made by someone else

52
0:02:46.04,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and play in that.

53
0:02:47.6,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But what Silvarret has done here

54
0:02:50.04,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is that what he wanted to make

55
0:02:52.64,000 --> 0:02:54,000
was not a real city.

56
0:02:55.4,000 --> 0:02:56,000
This is a fantasy city,

57
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
even though it looks real.

58
0:02:58.8,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So what he wanted to do was a fantasy city that could be in the Netherlands.

59
0:03:04.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So he kind of investigated

60
0:03:06.68,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what are the characteristics of cities in the Netherlands

61
0:03:10.72,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and combined a couple of those,

62
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and this is what he created.

63
0:03:16.04,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So it is a city,

64
0:03:17.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but it is not a real city,

65
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but it could be.

66
0:03:21.28,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It looks just like the Netherlands.

67
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So the places are really densely populated.

68
0:03:26.96,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So what you need is highways, trains,

69
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:35,000
anything connecting these small town centers together.

70
0:03:36.24,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Lots of people, lots of moving,

71
0:03:38.48,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so transportation is the key here.

72
0:03:42.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But then let's go even more on the fantasy side.

73
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Let's go into the future.

74
0:03:50.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is one of my personal favorites.

75
0:03:52.64,000 --> 0:03:55,000
These city designs are what I love the most.

76
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,

77
0:04:00.32,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and the basic idea is that you have concentric circle routes.

78
0:04:06.24,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So the city is a big circle

79
0:04:08.56,000 --> 0:04:09,000
with tinier circles inside.

80
0:04:11.4,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And the thing is that you put all of the services in the center,

81
0:04:15.68,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and then people actually live on the outer ring,

82
0:04:19.12,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because there is less traffic, less noise, less pollution,

83
0:04:22.92,000 --> 0:04:23,000
so that is where you want to live.

84
0:04:24.88,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But the services are still really close by.

85
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They are in the center.

86
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And this is the soul of the game.

87
0:04:33.36,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The player has to understand

88
0:04:35.4,000 --> 0:04:37,000
what are the wishes, what are the needs

89
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of the tiny people living in the cities.

90
0:04:41.68,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So you need to know where you should put the things.

91
0:04:45.52,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.

92
0:04:48.08,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It needs to be accessible.

93
0:04:49.84,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Citizens need to reach the hospital.

94
0:04:52.96,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And this is one way to do it.

95
0:04:57.2,000 --> 0:05:,000
So maybe this is something that we might be seeing someday.

96
0:05:02.2,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And then even more into the future.

97
0:05:06.28,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Astergea by Yuttho.

98
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So Yuttho does YouTube videos and plays the game.

99
0:05:12.64,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What he did here was actually a 12-point series

100
0:05:17.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of creating this city.

101
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So what he does is he plays the game,

102
0:05:22.56,000 --> 0:05:23,000
he records it

103
0:05:23.84,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and he explains as he's going what he's doing and why.

104
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And as a part of this series,

105
0:05:30.32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
he actually did an interview with an actual urban planner

106
0:05:33.6,000 --> 0:05:34,000
called Jeff Speck.

107
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And Speck is an expert on the concept of walkability.

108
0:05:40.28,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk,

109
0:05:44.68,000 --> 0:05:45,000
which is kind of beneficial,

110
0:05:46.64,000 --> 0:05:51,000
you actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation.

111
0:05:52.4,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It should be a good way to reach places.

112
0:05:55.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept,

113
0:05:59.4,000 --> 0:06:01,000
he had Speck explain it, too,

114
0:06:01.44,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and then he applied it to the city that he was building.

115
0:06:05.2,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future:

116
0:06:10.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
lots of public transportation, walkways, plazas,

117
0:06:14.4,000 --> 0:06:15,000
connecting high-rise buildings.

118
0:06:16.8,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Maybe this is what the future might look like.

119
0:06:20.4,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And the game system works really well for this.

120
0:06:23.88,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We are seeing some real-world uses to this game.

121
0:06:28.72,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So we know that some urban planners are using it as a sketching tool,

122
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:37,000
so while the simulation is not completely realistic,

123
0:06:37.76,000 --> 0:06:4,000
it is realistic enough that if something works in the game,

124
0:06:41.72,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it is highly likely that it will also work in the real world,

125
0:06:46.64,000 --> 0:06:48,000
so that you can actually try out things,

126
0:06:48.76,000 --> 0:06:52,000
see if this intersection might fit this kind of a situation.

127
0:06:53.76,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If we build a new road, would it help?

128
0:06:57.32,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And this is what you can do with this game.

129
0:07:01.08,000 --> 0:07:04,000
There was one really interesting contest held

130
0:07:04.2,000 --> 0:07:06,000
by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.

131
0:07:07.44,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So what they did was that they had a new area

132
0:07:09.68,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that they wanted to develop in the city.

133
0:07:12.96,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They made a map with the existing city,

134
0:07:15.52,000 --> 0:07:18,000
they left empty the area that they would want to develop

135
0:07:18.72,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and shared this map.

136
0:07:21.08,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So anyone could download the map,

137
0:07:24.12,000 --> 0:07:25,000
play the game, build the area

138
0:07:25.76,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and submit their creations to the city council.

139
0:07:30.28,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So they have not yet built anything,

140
0:07:32.92,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but it might just be that they use one of these plans

141
0:07:36.72,000 --> 0:07:38,000
made with the game

142
0:07:39.08,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to actually build the real city.

143
0:07:44.08,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And these videos that I have shown you,

144
0:07:46.8,000 --> 0:07:5,000
these are the people who are coming up with new kinds of solutions.

145
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We know that cities are growing.

146
0:07:53.88,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They're getting bigger as we go,

147
0:07:56.36,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and the percentage of population living in cities is projected to rise.

148
0:08:02.6,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So we need the solutions

149
0:08:04.52,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and these people, playing the game,

150
0:08:07.24,000 --> 0:08:09,000
they are trying out different kinds of solutions.

151
0:08:09.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They might have something that is really important.

152
0:08:14.64,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So what we are seeing here is dream cities that might be real one day.

153
0:08:22.4,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So it might be

154
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that this is not just a game.

155
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It might be a way

156
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to decide our own fate.

157
0:08:33.92,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Thank you.

158
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Applause)

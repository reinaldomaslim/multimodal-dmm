1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I grew up

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in a very small village in Canada,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I'm an undiagnosed

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
dyslexic.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I had a really hard time in school.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
In fact, my mother told me eventually

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that I was the little kid in the village

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who cried all the way to school.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I ran away.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and together, over 20 years,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we built an amazing jewelry business.

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired.

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Then she took me to see a film

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that I really didn't want to see.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It ruined my life --

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore.

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I have four kids,

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and even if part of what he says is true,

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
they're not going to have the life that I had.

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I decided at that moment

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that I would spend the rest of my life

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
doing whatever I could

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to improve their possibilities.

27
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So here's the world,

28
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and here we are in Bali.

29
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's a tiny, little island --

30
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
60 miles by 90 miles.

31
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It has an intact Hindu culture.

32
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Cynthia and I were there.

33
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We had had a wonderful life there,

34
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and we decided to do something unusual.

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We decided to give back

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
locally.

37
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And here it is: it's called the Green School.

38
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I know it doesn't look like a school,

39
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but it is something we decided to do,

40
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and it is extremely,

41
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
extremely green.

42
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The classrooms have no walls.

43
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.

44
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The desks are not square.

45
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
At Green School, the children are smiling --

46
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
an unusual thing for school, especially for me.

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And we practice holism.

48
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And for me it's just the idea

49
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that, if this little girl

50
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
graduates as a whole person,

51
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
chances are

52
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
she'll demand a whole world --

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a whole world --

54
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to live on.

55
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Our children spend 181 days

56
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
going to school in a box.

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The people that built my school

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
also built the prison and the insane asylum

59
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
out of the same materials.

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So if this gentleman

61
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
had had a holistic education,

62
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
would he be sitting there?

63
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Would he have had more possibilities in his life?

64
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The classrooms have natural light.

65
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They're beautiful. They're bamboo.

66
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The breeze passes through them.

67
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And when the natural breeze isn't enough,

68
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the kids deploy bubbles,

69
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but not the kind of bubbles you know.

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
These bubbles are made from natural cotton

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and rubber from the rubber tree.

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So we basically turned the box

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
into a bubble.

74
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And these kids know

75
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that painless climate control

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
may not be

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
part of their future.

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We pay the bill at the end of the month,

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but the people that are really going to pay the bill

80
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
are our grandchildren.

81
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We have to teach the kids

82
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that the world is not indestructible.

83
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks,

84
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and then they signed up for two extra courses.

85
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The first one was called sanding

86
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the second one was called re-waxing.

87
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But since that happened,

88
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
they own those desks.

89
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
They know they can control their world.

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We're on the grid. We're not proud of it.

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris

92
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is taking us off the grid with solar.

93
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And this thing

94
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is the second vortex to be built in the world,

95
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.

96
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
When the turbine drops in,

97
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,

98
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
day and night.

99
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And you know what these are.

100
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There's nowhere to flush.

101
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And as long as we're taking our waste

102
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and mixing it with a huge amount of water --

103
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
you're all really smart, just do the math.

104
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
How many people times how much water.

105
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
There isn't enough water.

106
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
These are compost toilets,

107
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and nobody at the school wanted to know about them,

108
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
especially the principal.

109
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And they work. People use them. People are okay.

110
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's something you should think about doing.

111
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Not many things didn't work.

112
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights

113
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
got eaten by the sun in six months.

114
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic.

115
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards

116
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
into the classrooms.

117
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we had some good ideas:

118
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them

119
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and created the first alternative

120
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to the whiteboard.

121
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Green School sits in south-central Bali,

122
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and it's on 20 acres

123
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
of rolling garden.

124
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
There's an amazing river traveling through it,

125
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and you can see there

126
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
how we manage to get across the river.

127
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.

128
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I said, "Welcome to Green School."

129
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours."

130
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I asked him, "Why?"

131
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
He said, "I had a dream once about a green school,

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and I saw a picture of this green school,

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I got on an airplane.

134
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
In August I'm bringing my sons."

135
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This was a great thing.

136
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But more than that,

137
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
people are building green houses around Green School,

138
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so their kids can walk to school on the paths.

139
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And people are bringing their green industries,

140
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
hopefully their green restaurants,

141
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to the Green School.

142
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's becoming a community.

143
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's becoming a green model.

144
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We had to look at everything.

145
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
No petrochemicals in the pavement.

146
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
No pavement.

147
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
These are volcanic stones laid by hand.

148
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There are no sidewalks.

149
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,

150
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but they're green.

151
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is the school buffalo.

152
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
He's planning to eat that fence for dinner.

153
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
All the fences at Green School are green.

154
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And when the kindergarten kids

155
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
recently moved their gate,

156
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they found out the fence was made out of tapioca.

157
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,

158
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
sliced them thinly and made delicious chips.

159
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Landscaping.

160
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We manage to keep the garden that was there

161
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.

162
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We dropped them gently in.

163
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We made space for these guys

164
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
who are Bali's last black pigs.

165
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And the school cow

166
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is trying to figure out

167
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
how to replace the lawnmower

168
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
on the playing field.

169
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
These young ladies

170
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
are living in a rice culture,

171
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but they know something that few people know in a rice culture.

172
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They know how to plant organic rice,

173
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they know how to look after it,

174
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.

175
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They're part of the rice cycle

176
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and these skills will be valuable

177
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
for them in their future.

178
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This young man is picking organic vegetables.

179
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We feed 400 people lunch every day

180
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.

181
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Local Balinese women

182
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
cook the food on sawdust burners

183
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
using secrets that only their grandmothers know.

184
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The food is incredible.

185
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Green School is a place of pioneers,

186
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
local and global.

187
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And it's a kind of microcosm

188
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of the globalized world.

189
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The kids are from 25 countries.

190
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
When I see them together,

191
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I know that they're working out

192
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
how to live in the future.

193
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Green School is going into its third year

194
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
with 160 children.

195
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's a school where you do learn reading --

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
one of my favorites --

197
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
writing -- I was bad at it --

198
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
arithmetic.

199
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But you also learn other things.

200
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
You learn bamboo building.

201
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You practice

202
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
ancient Balinese arts.

203
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.

204
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The kids love it.

205
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The mothers aren't quite convinced.

206
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives,

208
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?

209
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Local means

210
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that 20 percent of the population of the school

211
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
has to be Balinese,

212
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and this was a really big commitment.

213
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And we were right.

214
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And people are coming forward

215
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
from all over the world

216
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,

217
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.

218
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The teachers are as diverse

219
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as the student body,

220
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and the amazing thing

221
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is that volunteers are popping up.

222
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
A man came from Java

223
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
with a new kind of organic agriculture.

224
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
A woman came from Africa with music.

225
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And together these volunteers and the teachers

226
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
are deeply committed

227
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to creating a new generation

228
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of global, green leaders.

229
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The Green School effect --

230
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we don't know what it is.

231
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We need someone to come and study it.

232
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But what's happening, our learning-different kids --

233
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
dyslexic --

234
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we've renamed them prolexic --

235
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.

236
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And all the kids are thriving.

237
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And how did we do all this?

238
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
On giant grass.

239
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's bamboo.

240
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It comes out of the ground like a train.

241
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months

242
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and three years later it can be harvested

243
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to build buildings like this.

244
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's as strong and dense as teak

245
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and it will hold up any roof.

246
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
When the architects came, they brought us these things,

247
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and you've probably seen things like this.

248
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The yellow box was called the administration complex.

249
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

250
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We squashed it, we rethought it,

251
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but mainly we renamed it

252
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
"the heart of school,"

253
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and that changed everything forever.

254
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's a double helix.

255
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It has administrators in it

256
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and many, many other things.

257
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And the problem of building it --

258
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
when the Balinese workers

259
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
saw long reams of plans,

260
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
they looked at them and said, "What's this?"

261
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So we built big models.

262
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We had them engineered by the engineers.

263
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And Balinese carpenters like this

264
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
measured them with their bamboo rulers,

265
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
selected the bamboo and built the buildings

266
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
using age-old techniques,

267
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
mostly by hand.

268
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It was chaos.

269
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,

270
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
so they use metal scaffolding

271
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to build the bamboo building

272
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and when the scaffolding came down,

273
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we realized that we had a cathedral,

274
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
a cathedral to green,

275
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and a cathedral to green education.

276
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The heart of school has seven kilometers

277
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of bamboo in it.

278
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
From the time the foundations were finished,

279
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in three months it had roofs and floors.

280
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,

281
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but many people believe

282
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that it's the most beautiful.

283
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Is this doable in your community?

284
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We believe it is.

285
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Green School is a model we built for the world.

286
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's a model we built for Bali.

287
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:

288
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
be local,

289
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
let the environment lead

290
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and think about

291
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
how your grandchildren might build.

292
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So, Mr. Gore, thank you.

293
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You ruined my life,

294
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but you gave me an incredible future.

295
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And if you're interested in being involved

296
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
in finishing Green School

297
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and building the next 50 around the world,

298
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
please come and see us.

299
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Thank you.

300
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Applause)

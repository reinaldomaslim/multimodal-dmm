1
0:00:16.014,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.

2
0:00:20.363,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And that might seem a bit surprising,

3
0:00:22.165,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because my full-time work at the foundation

4
0:00:25.338,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is mostly about vaccines and seeds,

5
0:00:27.397,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about the things that we need to invent and deliver

6
0:00:30.989,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to help the poorest two billion live better lives.

7
0:00:35.741,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people;

8
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.

9
0:00:45.053,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:

10
0:00:50.788,000 --> 0:00:53,000
there will be too much rain, not enough rain;

11
0:00:53.843,000 --> 0:00:58,000
things will change in ways their fragile environment simply can't support.

12
0:00:59.804,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.

13
0:01:04.132,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.

14
0:01:08.093,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Also, the price of energy is very important to them.

15
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In fact, if you could pick just one thing

16
0:01:13.562,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to lower the price of to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.

17
0:01:18.962,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, the price of energy has come down over time.

18
0:01:22.343,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.

19
0:01:29.038,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,

20
0:01:32.633,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and, even in the 1900s, we've seen a very rapid decline

21
0:01:36.718,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in the price of electricity,

22
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning;

23
0:01:41.666,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we can make modern materials and do so many things.

24
0:01:45.486,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.

25
0:01:52.544,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But as we make it cheaper -- and let's say,

26
0:01:55.447,000 --> 0:01:57,000
let's go for making it twice as cheap --

27
0:01:59.616,000 --> 0:02:,000
we need to meet a new constraint,

28
0:02:02.037,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and that constraint has to do with CO2.

29
0:02:06.003,000 --> 0:02:09,000
CO2 is warming the planet,

30
0:02:09.096,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.

31
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,

32
0:02:18.866,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that leads to a temperature increase,

33
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:

34
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,

35
0:02:29.197,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,

36
0:02:33.914,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and so you get ecosystem collapses.

37
0:02:36.66,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now, the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2

38
0:02:42.079,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to what temperature will be, and where the positive feedbacks are --

39
0:02:45.393,000 --> 0:02:47,000
there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.

40
0:02:48.526,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,

41
0:02:51.85,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but they will be extremely bad.

42
0:02:54.461,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I asked the top scientists on this several times:

43
0:02:56.787,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Do we really have to get down to near zero?

44
0:02:59.335,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?

45
0:03:02.392,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And the answer is, until we get near to zero,

46
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the temperature will continue to rise.

47
0:03:08.718,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so that's a big challenge.

48
0:03:10.512,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's very different than saying,

49
0:03:12.762,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,

50
0:03:16.122,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and we can just sort of squeeze under."

51
0:03:18.869,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is something that has to get to zero.

52
0:03:22.828,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year --

53
0:03:26.121,000 --> 0:03:28,000
over 26 billion tons.

54
0:03:28.842,000 --> 0:03:31,000
For each American, it's about 20 tons.

55
0:03:32.438,000 --> 0:03:34,000
For people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.

56
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.

57
0:03:39.402,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And somehow, we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero.

58
0:03:44.877,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's been constantly going up.

59
0:03:47.045,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,

60
0:03:51.674,000 --> 0:03:54,000
so we have to go from rapidly rising to falling,

61
0:03:55.155,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and falling all the way to zero.

62
0:03:57.261,000 --> 0:04:,000
This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication.

63
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,

64
0:04:05.048,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and that's going to be based on the number of people,

65
0:04:08.462,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the services each person is using on average,

66
0:04:11.876,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the energy, on average, for each service,

67
0:04:14.769,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.

68
0:04:18.992,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So let's look at each one of these,

69
0:04:20.969,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and see how we can get this down to zero.

70
0:04:24.498,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.

71
0:04:28.074,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:29.28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That's back from high school algebra.

73
0:04:31.278,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But let's take a look.

74
0:04:32.958,000 --> 0:04:33,000
First, we've got population.

75
0:04:35.454,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The world today has 6.8 billion people.

76
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That's headed up to about nine billion.

77
0:04:40.487,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,

78
0:04:44.572,000 --> 0:04:46,000
health care, reproductive health services,

79
0:04:47.053,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.

80
0:04:50.178,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.

81
0:04:54.685,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The second factor is the services we use.

82
0:04:57.715,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This encompasses everything:

83
0:04:59.504,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.

84
0:05:04.037,000 --> 0:05:05,000
These are very good things.

85
0:05:06.189,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Getting rid of poverty means providing these services

86
0:05:09.92,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to almost everyone on the planet.

87
0:05:11.949,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.

88
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,

89
0:05:17.523,000 --> 0:05:19,000
we probably could cut back and use less,

90
0:05:19.932,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,

91
0:05:24.072,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and so, overall, that will more than double

92
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the services delivered per person.

93
0:05:30.398,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Here we have a very basic service:

94
0:05:32.525,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?

95
0:05:35.961,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And, in fact, these kids don't,

96
0:05:37.504,000 --> 0:05:39,000
so they're going out and reading their schoolwork

97
0:05:39.846,000 --> 0:05:4,000
under the street lamps.

98
0:05:42.538,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now, efficiency, "E," the energy for each service --

99
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
here, finally we have some good news.

100
0:05:48.261,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We have something that's not going up.

101
0:05:50.147,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,

102
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --

103
0:05:58.715,000 --> 0:05:59,000
there are a lot of services

104
0:06:00.374,000 --> 0:06:03,000
where you can bring the energy for that service down

105
0:06:03.738,000 --> 0:06:04,000
quite substantially.

106
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.

107
0:06:08.779,000 --> 0:06:11,000
There are other services, like how we make fertilizer,

108
0:06:12.149,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or how we do air transport,

109
0:06:13.815,000 --> 0:06:15,000
where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.

110
0:06:17.156,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And so overall, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction

111
0:06:21.478,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.

112
0:06:26.868,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But for these first three factors now,

113
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,

114
0:06:34.344,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and that just won't cut it.

115
0:06:36.259,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So let's look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one --

116
0:06:40.081,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.

117
0:06:46.434,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?

118
0:06:49.983,000 --> 0:06:51,000
If you burn coal, no.

119
0:06:52.913,000 --> 0:06:53,000
If you burn natural gas, no.

120
0:06:54.412,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Almost every way we make electricity today,

121
0:06:57.539,000 --> 0:07:02,000
except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.

122
0:07:03.551,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,

123
0:07:06.828,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is create a new system.

124
0:07:09.133,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So we need energy miracles.

125
0:07:11.786,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now, when I use the term "miracle," I don't mean something that's impossible.

126
0:07:16.103,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The microprocessor is a miracle.

127
0:07:18.547,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The personal computer is a miracle.

128
0:07:20.556,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The Internet and its services are a miracle.

129
0:07:23.047,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.

130
0:07:28.117,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Usually, we don't have a deadline

131
0:07:30.118,000 --> 0:07:32,000
where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.

132
0:07:32.62,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.

133
0:07:36.625,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed

134
0:07:40.748,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.

135
0:07:45.749,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, I thought, "How could I really capture this?

136
0:07:48.718,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Is there some kind of natural illustration,

137
0:07:50.965,000 --> 0:07:53,000
some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?"

138
0:07:55.502,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes,

139
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and somehow people enjoyed that.

140
0:08:01.914,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

141
0:08:03.545,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It really got them involved in the idea of, you know,

142
0:08:07.615,000 --> 0:08:09,000
there are people who live with mosquitoes.

143
0:08:09.691,000 --> 0:08:12,000
With energy, all I could come up with is this.

144
0:08:14.101,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I decided that releasing fireflies

145
0:08:17.259,000 --> 0:08:2,000
would be my contribution to the environment here this year.

146
0:08:21.376,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So here we have some natural fireflies.

147
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.

148
0:08:27.893,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

149
0:08:31.093,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,

150
0:08:35.255,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but they don't really add up to much.

151
0:08:37.18,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We need solutions, either one or several,

152
0:08:41.227,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability.

153
0:08:47.268,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And although there's many directions that people are seeking,

154
0:08:50.76,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers.

155
0:08:54.861,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.

156
0:08:59.172,000 --> 0:09:,000
Those may make some contribution,

157
0:09:01.173,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better.

158
0:09:04.046,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But my key point here is that we're going to have to work on

159
0:09:07.992,000 --> 0:09:08,000
each of these five,

160
0:09:09.742,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,

161
0:09:13.563,000 --> 0:09:15,000
because they all have significant challenges.

162
0:09:17.061,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Let's look first at burning fossil fuels,

163
0:09:19.705,000 --> 0:09:21,000
either burning coal or burning natural gas.

164
0:09:23.021,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What you need to do there seems like it might be simple, but it's not.

165
0:09:27.131,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And that's to take all the CO2,

166
0:09:29.588,000 --> 0:09:31,000
after you've burned it, going out the flue,

167
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,

168
0:09:35.429,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and hope it stays there.

169
0:09:37.452,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now, we have some pilot things

170
0:09:39.098,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level.

171
0:09:41.461,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But getting up to that full percentage -- that will be very tricky.

172
0:09:45.884,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,

173
0:09:51.48,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but the toughest one here is this long-term issue:

174
0:09:54.166,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Who's going to be sure?

175
0:09:55.73,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Who's going to guarantee

176
0:09:57.352,000 --> 0:10:,000
something that is literally billions of times larger

177
0:10:00.445,000 --> 0:10:04,000
than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?

178
0:10:04.615,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is a lot of volume.

179
0:10:07.694,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So that's a tough one.

180
0:10:09.527,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Next would be nuclear.

181
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It also has three big problems:

182
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;

183
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the issue of safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,

184
0:10:22.938,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that, even though you have these human operators,

185
0:10:25.966,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.

186
0:10:28.716,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And then what do you do with the waste?

187
0:10:30.695,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.

188
0:10:34.123,000 --> 0:10:35,000
People need to feel good about it.

189
0:10:35.812,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So three very tough problems that might be solvable,

190
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and so, should be worked on.

191
0:10:42.449,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The last three of the five, I've grouped together.

192
0:10:45.164,000 --> 0:10:48,000
These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.

193
0:10:49.101,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --

194
0:10:53.148,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they have some disadvantages.

195
0:10:55.577,000 --> 0:11:,000
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies

196
0:11:01.443,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is dramatically less than a power plant.

197
0:11:03.53,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is energy farming,

198
0:11:05.236,000 --> 0:11:09,000
so you're talking about many square miles, thousands of times more area

199
0:11:09.381,000 --> 0:11:11,000
than you think of as a normal energy plant.

200
0:11:12.758,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Also, these are intermittent sources.

201
0:11:15.37,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,

202
0:11:18.809,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.

203
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And so, if you depend on these sources,

204
0:11:23.673,000 --> 0:11:25,000
you have to have some way of getting the energy

205
0:11:26.047,000 --> 0:11:28,000
during those time periods that it's not available.

206
0:11:29.418,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So we've got big cost challenges here.

207
0:11:32.498,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We have transmission challenges;

208
0:11:34.42,000 --> 0:11:37,000
for example, say this energy source is outside your country,

209
0:11:38.008,000 --> 0:11:4,000
you not only need the technology,

210
0:11:40.125,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.

211
0:11:44.522,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And, finally, this storage problem.

212
0:11:47.06,000 --> 0:11:48,000
To dimensionalize this,

213
0:11:48.585,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I went through and looked at all the types of batteries made --

214
0:11:52.162,000 --> 0:11:56,000
for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --

215
0:11:56.698,000 --> 0:12:,000
and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses.

216
0:12:01.644,000 --> 0:12:04,000
What I found is that all the batteries we make now

217
0:12:05.261,000 --> 0:12:08,000
could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.

218
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,

219
0:12:12.652,000 --> 0:12:15,000
something that's going to be a factor of 100 better

220
0:12:16.544,000 --> 0:12:17,000
than the approaches we have now.

221
0:12:18.401,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.

222
0:12:22.594,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source

223
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.

224
0:12:30.436,000 --> 0:12:32,000
If you're counting on it for 100 percent,

225
0:12:33.054,000 --> 0:12:36,000
you need an incredible miracle battery.

226
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Now, how are we going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach?

227
0:12:41.901,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there?

228
0:12:45.504,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Well, we need lots of companies working on this -- hundreds.

229
0:12:50.339,000 --> 0:12:53,000
In each of these five paths, we need at least a hundred people.

230
0:12:53.942,000 --> 0:12:55,000
A lot of them, you'll look at and say, "They're crazy."

231
0:12:56.676,000 --> 0:12:57,000
That's good.

232
0:12:57.881,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And, I think, here in the TED group,

233
0:13:00.835,000 --> 0:13:03,000
we have many people who are already pursuing this.

234
0:13:04.816,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar

235
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that has some great solar thermal technologies.

236
0:13:11.066,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies

237
0:13:14.54,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,

238
0:13:18.491,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and I'm trying to help back that.

239
0:13:20.664,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company

240
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.

241
0:13:28.056,000 --> 0:13:31,000
There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.

242
0:13:32.658,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,

243
0:13:36.455,000 --> 0:13:39,000
so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around

244
0:13:39.574,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is not all that surprising.

245
0:13:41.789,000 --> 0:13:46,000
The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium --

246
0:13:47.603,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the one percent, which is the U235 --

247
0:13:50.746,000 --> 0:13:53,000
we decided, "Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238."

248
0:13:54.998,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It is kind of a crazy idea.

249
0:13:57.375,000 --> 0:14:,000
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,

250
0:14:00.542,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,

251
0:14:04.727,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers

252
0:14:07.616,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that now you can simulate and see that, yes,

253
0:14:09.771,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with the right materials approach, this looks like it would work.

254
0:14:15.453,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And because you're burning that 99 percent,

255
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
you have greatly improved cost profile.

256
0:14:22.667,000 --> 0:14:26,000
You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel

257
0:14:26.901,000 --> 0:14:29,000
all the leftover waste from today's reactors.

258
0:14:29.95,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So instead of worrying about them, you just take that, it's a great thing.

259
0:14:34.088,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It breeds this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.

260
0:14:38.607,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.

261
0:14:42.76,000 --> 0:14:45,000
In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.

262
0:14:46.703,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.

263
0:14:49.628,000 --> 0:14:51,000
This is the leftover, the 99 percent,

264
0:14:51.852,000 --> 0:14:53,000
where they've taken out the part they burn now,

265
0:14:54.106,000 --> 0:14:55,000
so it's called depleted uranium.

266
0:14:55.7,000 --> 0:14:57,000
That would power the US for hundreds of years.

267
0:14:58.571,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,

268
0:15:02.13,000 --> 0:15:05,000
you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.

269
0:15:06.314,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,

270
0:15:10.399,000 --> 0:15:15,000
but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas

271
0:15:15.818,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that we need to move forward.

272
0:15:18.667,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So let's think: How should we measure ourselves?

273
0:15:21.389,000 --> 0:15:23,000
What should our report card look like?

274
0:15:24.616,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,

275
0:15:27.164,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and then look at the intermediate.

276
0:15:29.331,000 --> 0:15:34,000
For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.

277
0:15:35.102,000 --> 0:15:38,000
That really is very important, that we get there.

278
0:15:38.178,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries --

279
0:15:42.623,000 --> 0:15:47,000
still some agriculture; hopefully, we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.

280
0:15:48.041,000 --> 0:15:5,000
So, to get to that 80 percent,

281
0:15:51.054,000 --> 0:15:55,000
the developed countries, including countries like China,

282
0:15:55.583,000 --> 0:15:59,000
will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.

283
0:16:00.385,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,

284
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
have we deployed it in all the developed countries

285
0:16:08.681,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and are in the process of getting it elsewhere?

286
0:16:11.492,000 --> 0:16:12,000
That's super important.

287
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
That's a key element of making that report card.

288
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?

289
0:16:22.015,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Well, again, it should have the two elements.

290
0:16:24.357,000 --> 0:16:28,000
We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:

291
0:16:28.52,000 --> 0:16:31,000
The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,

292
0:16:31.808,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and therefore, the less the temperature.

293
0:16:33.904,000 --> 0:16:35,000
But in some ways, the grade we get there,

294
0:16:36.857,000 --> 0:16:4,000
doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,

295
0:16:41.125,000 --> 0:16:44,000
is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,

296
0:16:44.993,000 --> 0:16:47,000
which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.

297
0:16:48.773,000 --> 0:16:51,000
These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,

298
0:16:52.035,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and we can measure that in terms of companies,

299
0:16:54.484,000 --> 0:16:56,000
pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.

300
0:16:57.858,000 --> 0:16:59,000
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.

301
0:17:00.856,000 --> 0:17:02,000
The Al Gore book, "Our Choice,"

302
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and the David MacKay book, "Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."

303
0:17:06.864,000 --> 0:17:09,000
They really go through it and create a framework

304
0:17:10.064,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that this can be discussed broadly,

305
0:17:11.921,000 --> 0:17:12,000
because we need broad backing for this.

306
0:17:14.246,000 --> 0:17:16,000
There's a lot that has to come together.

307
0:17:16.497,000 --> 0:17:17,000
So this is a wish.

308
0:17:18.003,000 --> 0:17:22,000
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.

309
0:17:22.632,000 --> 0:17:25,000
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --

310
0:17:25.745,000 --> 0:17:26,000
I could pick who's president,

311
0:17:27.746,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,

312
0:17:30.532,000 --> 0:17:32,000
or I could pick that this thing

313
0:17:32.613,000 --> 0:17:35,000
that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --

314
0:17:36.098,000 --> 0:17:37,000
this is the wish I would pick.

315
0:17:38.029,000 --> 0:17:4,000
This is the one with the greatest impact.

316
0:17:40.138,000 --> 0:17:41,000
If we don't get this wish,

317
0:17:41.807,000 --> 0:17:44,000
the division between the people who think short term and long term

318
0:17:45.269,000 --> 0:17:46,000
will be terrible,

319
0:17:46.451,000 --> 0:17:48,000
between the US and China, between poor countries and rich,

320
0:17:49.419,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and most of all,

321
0:17:50.637,000 --> 0:17:53,000
the lives of those two billion will be far worse.

322
0:17:54.418,000 --> 0:17:55,000
So what do we have to do?

323
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?

324
0:18:01.449,000 --> 0:18:03,000
We need to go for more research funding.

325
0:18:04.45,000 --> 0:18:06,000
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen,

326
0:18:07.099,000 --> 0:18:09,000
they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.

327
0:18:09.542,000 --> 0:18:11,000
They should discuss this innovation agenda.

328
0:18:11.933,000 --> 0:18:15,000
You'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending

329
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
on these innovative approaches.

330
0:18:18.443,000 --> 0:18:21,000
We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --

331
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
something that gets that price signal out there.

332
0:18:25.141,000 --> 0:18:26,000
We need to get the message out.

333
0:18:26.763,000 --> 0:18:28,000
We need to have this dialogue be a more rational,

334
0:18:29.191,000 --> 0:18:3,000
more understandable dialogue,

335
0:18:30.805,000 --> 0:18:32,000
including the steps that the government takes.

336
0:18:33.36,000 --> 0:18:36,000
This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.

337
0:18:37.676,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Thank you.

338
0:18:38.853,000 --> 0:18:45,000
(Applause)

339
0:18:48.235,000 --> 0:18:5,000
(Applause ends)

340
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
Thank you.

341
0:18:52.563,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

342
0:18:54.432,000 --> 0:18:59,000
(Applause)

343
0:18:59.517,000 --> 0:19:,000
CA: Thank you.

344
0:19:01.039,000 --> 0:19:05,000
So to understand more about TerraPower.

345
0:19:05.659,000 --> 0:19:08,000
I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?

346
0:19:10.158,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Bill Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,

347
0:19:14.516,000 --> 0:19:16,000
hire all the great scientists, which we've done,

348
0:19:16.869,000 --> 0:19:18,000
that's only tens of millions.

349
0:19:19.15,000 --> 0:19:22,000
And even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor

350
0:19:23.122,000 --> 0:19:26,000
to make sure our materials work properly,

351
0:19:26.321,000 --> 0:19:28,000
then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.

352
0:19:28.862,000 --> 0:19:3,000
The tough thing is building the pilot reactor --

353
0:19:31.244,000 --> 0:19:35,000
finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location

354
0:19:36.072,000 --> 0:19:38,000
that will actually build the first one of these.

355
0:19:38.355,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,

356
0:19:42.541,000 --> 0:19:43,000
then it's just clear as day,

357
0:19:43.915,000 --> 0:19:46,000
because the economics, the energy density, are so different

358
0:19:47.135,000 --> 0:19:48,000
than nuclear as we know it.

359
0:19:48.573,000 --> 0:19:49,000
CA: So to understand it right,

360
0:19:50.059,000 --> 0:19:52,000
this involves building deep into the ground,

361
0:19:52.365,000 --> 0:19:57,000
almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,

362
0:19:57.949,000 --> 0:20:,000
and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?

363
0:20:01.113,000 --> 0:20:02,000
BG: That's right.

364
0:20:02.314,000 --> 0:20:04,000
Today, you're always refueling the reactor,

365
0:20:04.397,000 --> 0:20:07,000
so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong,

366
0:20:07.613,000 --> 0:20:09,000
where you're opening it up and moving things in and out --

367
0:20:10.376,000 --> 0:20:12,000
that's not good.

368
0:20:12.557,000 --> 0:20:13,000
So if you have very --

369
0:20:13.754,000 --> 0:20:14,000
(Laughter)

370
0:20:14.867,000 --> 0:20:16,000
very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --

371
0:20:17.638,000 --> 0:20:18,000
just think of it as a log --

372
0:20:19.216,000 --> 0:20:22,000
put it down and not have those same complexities.

373
0:20:22.778,000 --> 0:20:26,000
And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.

374
0:20:27.707,000 --> 0:20:3,000
CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.

375
0:20:31.669,000 --> 0:20:32,000
BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,

376
0:20:33.587,000 --> 0:20:38,000
you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --

377
0:20:38.991,000 --> 0:20:39,000
then you can actually take that

378
0:20:40.651,000 --> 0:20:42,000
and put it into another one and burn that.

379
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:47,000
And we start out, actually, by taking the waste that exists today

380
0:20:47.49,000 --> 0:20:51,000
that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors --

381
0:20:51.746,000 --> 0:20:53,000
that's our fuel to begin with.

382
0:20:53.922,000 --> 0:20:55,000
So the thing that's been a problem from those reactors

383
0:20:56.553,000 --> 0:20:57,000
is actually what gets fed into ours,

384
0:20:58.504,000 --> 0:21:,000
and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically

385
0:21:01.515,000 --> 0:21:02,000
as you're going through this process.

386
0:21:03.516,000 --> 0:21:05,000
CA: You're talking to different people around the world

387
0:21:06.115,000 --> 0:21:07,000
about the possibilities.

388
0:21:07.428,000 --> 0:21:1,000
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?

389
0:21:10.86,000 --> 0:21:14,000
BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,

390
0:21:15.039,000 --> 0:21:18,000
and there's all these interesting disclosure rules

391
0:21:18.523,000 --> 0:21:2,000
about anything that's called "nuclear."

392
0:21:21.023,000 --> 0:21:23,000
So we've got a lot of interest.

393
0:21:23.976,000 --> 0:21:26,000
People from the company have been in Russia, India, China.

394
0:21:27.075,000 --> 0:21:29,000
I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,

395
0:21:29.713,000 --> 0:21:32,000
talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.

396
0:21:33.069,000 --> 0:21:34,000
So I'm optimistic.

397
0:21:34.669,000 --> 0:21:36,000
The French and Japanese have done some work.

398
0:21:36.87,000 --> 0:21:39,000
This is a variant on something that has been done.

399
0:21:40.554,000 --> 0:21:43,000
It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,

400
0:21:44.26,000 --> 0:21:45,000
and a lot of countries have built them,

401
0:21:46.26,000 --> 0:21:48,000
so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate

402
0:21:48.858,000 --> 0:21:5,000
to be where the first one gets built.

403
0:21:51.26,000 --> 0:21:54,000
CA: So, in your mind,

404
0:21:54.726,000 --> 0:21:58,000
timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live?

405
0:21:59.508,000 --> 0:22:05,000
BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things

406
0:22:05.619,000 --> 0:22:06,000
that's very cheap,

407
0:22:06.801,000 --> 0:22:09,000
we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.

408
0:22:10.503,000 --> 0:22:11,000
That's sort of the deadline

409
0:22:12.283,000 --> 0:22:17,000
that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet.

410
0:22:17.565,000 --> 0:22:22,000
And TerraPower -- if things go well, which is wishing for a lot --

411
0:22:23.001,000 --> 0:22:24,000
could easily meet that.

412
0:22:24.668,000 --> 0:22:27,000
And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies --

413
0:22:27.964,000 --> 0:22:28,000
we need it to be hundreds --

414
0:22:29.339,000 --> 0:22:31,000
who, likewise, if their science goes well,

415
0:22:31.58,000 --> 0:22:33,000
if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,

416
0:22:34.499,000 --> 0:22:36,000
that they can compete for this.

417
0:22:36.549,000 --> 0:22:37,000
And it's best if multiple succeed,

418
0:22:38.547,000 --> 0:22:4,000
because then you could use a mix of these things.

419
0:22:41.26,000 --> 0:22:43,000
We certainly need one to succeed.

420
0:22:43.365,000 --> 0:22:45,000
CA: In terms of big-scale possible game changers,

421
0:22:46.348,000 --> 0:22:48,000
is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?

422
0:22:49.106,000 --> 0:22:53,000
BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.

423
0:22:53.479,000 --> 0:22:55,000
It would have been, even without the environmental constraint,

424
0:22:56.486,000 --> 0:22:59,000
but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.

425
0:23:00.373,000 --> 0:23:03,000
In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.

426
0:23:03.721,000 --> 0:23:05,000
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,

427
0:23:06.735,000 --> 0:23:09,000
but the modular people, that's a different approach.

428
0:23:10.016,000 --> 0:23:13,000
There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,

429
0:23:13.645,000 --> 0:23:15,000
but maybe they say that about us.

430
0:23:15.905,000 --> 0:23:17,000
And so, there are different ones,

431
0:23:18.26,000 --> 0:23:2,000
but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium

432
0:23:21.26,000 --> 0:23:25,000
has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal.

433
0:23:25.962,000 --> 0:23:28,000
And so, if you can deal with the negatives,

434
0:23:29.002,000 --> 0:23:32,000
which are essentially the radiation, the footprint and cost,

435
0:23:32.878,000 --> 0:23:35,000
the potential, in terms of effect on land and various things,

436
0:23:36.893,000 --> 0:23:39,000
is almost in a class of its own.

437
0:23:41.299,000 --> 0:23:44,000
CA: If this doesn't work, then what?

438
0:23:44.962,000 --> 0:23:47,000
Do we have to start taking emergency measures

439
0:23:48.26,000 --> 0:23:51,000
to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?

440
0:23:51.382,000 --> 0:23:52,000
BG: If you get into that situation,

441
0:23:53.26,000 --> 0:23:57,000
it's like if you've been overeating, and you're about to have a heart attack.

442
0:23:58.26,000 --> 0:24:,000
Then where do you go?

443
0:24:00.809,000 --> 0:24:01,000
You may need heart surgery or something.

444
0:24:02.766,000 --> 0:24:05,000
There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,

445
0:24:06.66,000 --> 0:24:08,000
which are various techniques that would delay the heating

446
0:24:09.661,000 --> 0:24:12,000
to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.

447
0:24:12.971,000 --> 0:24:15,000
Now, that's just an insurance policy; you hope you don't need to do that.

448
0:24:16.603,000 --> 0:24:19,000
Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy

449
0:24:19.669,000 --> 0:24:2,000
because it might make you lazy,

450
0:24:21.214,000 --> 0:24:24,000
that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.

451
0:24:25.104,000 --> 0:24:28,000
I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,

452
0:24:28.245,000 --> 0:24:31,000
but there's now the geoengineering discussion

453
0:24:31.37,000 --> 0:24:35,000
about: Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,

454
0:24:35.601,000 --> 0:24:38,000
or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?

455
0:24:40.809,000 --> 0:24:41,000
CA: Climate skeptics:

456
0:24:42.634,000 --> 0:24:45,000
If you had a sentence or two to say to them,

457
0:24:46.164,000 --> 0:24:49,000
how might you persuade them that they're wrong?

458
0:24:50.905,000 --> 0:24:53,000
BG: Well, unfortunately, the skeptics come in different camps.

459
0:24:53.98,000 --> 0:24:57,000
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few.

460
0:24:58.445,000 --> 0:25:,000
Are they saying there's negative feedback effects

461
0:25:01.458,000 --> 0:25:03,000
that have to do with clouds that offset things?

462
0:25:03.684,000 --> 0:25:06,000
There are very, very few things that they can even say

463
0:25:07.016,000 --> 0:25:09,000
there's a chance in a million of those things.

464
0:25:09.687,000 --> 0:25:12,000
The main problem we have here -- it's kind of like with AIDS:

465
0:25:12.915,000 --> 0:25:15,000
you make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.

466
0:25:16.742,000 --> 0:25:19,000
And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,

467
0:25:20.021,000 --> 0:25:24,000
the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,

468
0:25:24.106,000 --> 0:25:26,000
and a somewhat uncertain pain thing.

469
0:25:26.416,000 --> 0:25:32,000
In fact, the IPCC report -- that's not necessarily the worst case,

470
0:25:32.528,000 --> 0:25:36,000
and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC and say,

471
0:25:36.627,000 --> 0:25:37,000
"OK, that isn't that big of a deal."

472
0:25:38.435,000 --> 0:25:42,000
The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.

473
0:25:42.608,000 --> 0:25:43,000
But my dream here is that,

474
0:25:44.264,000 --> 0:25:47,000
if you can make it economic, and meet the CO2 constraints,

475
0:25:47.948,000 --> 0:25:48,000
then the skeptics say,

476
0:25:49.131,000 --> 0:25:51,000
"OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,

477
0:25:51.435,000 --> 0:25:52,000
I kind of wish it did put out CO2.

478
0:25:53.139,000 --> 0:25:54,000
But I guess I'll accept it,

479
0:25:54.519,000 --> 0:25:56,000
because it's cheaper than what's come before."

480
0:25:57.26,000 --> 0:26:01,000
(Applause)

481
0:26:02.115,000 --> 0:26:05,000
CA: So that would be your response to the Bjørn Lomborg argument,

482
0:26:05.319,000 --> 0:26:09,000
basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,

483
0:26:09.799,000 --> 0:26:11,000
it's going to take away all your other goals

484
0:26:11.917,000 --> 0:26:13,000
of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,

485
0:26:14.934,000 --> 0:26:16,000
it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources

486
0:26:17.191,000 --> 0:26:18,000
to put money towards that

487
0:26:18.488,000 --> 0:26:19,000
when there are better things we can do.

488
0:26:20.43,000 --> 0:26:23,000
BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&D piece --

489
0:26:23.845,000 --> 0:26:26,000
say the US should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now --

490
0:26:27.365,000 --> 0:26:28,000
it's not that dramatic.

491
0:26:29.26,000 --> 0:26:3,000
It shouldn't take away from other things.

492
0:26:31.26,000 --> 0:26:34,000
The thing you get into big money on, and reasonable people can disagree,

493
0:26:34.704,000 --> 0:26:36,000
is when you have something that's non-economic

494
0:26:36.894,000 --> 0:26:37,000
and you're trying to fund that --

495
0:26:38.537,000 --> 0:26:39,000
that, to me, mostly is a waste.

496
0:26:40.489,000 --> 0:26:41,000
Unless you're very close,

497
0:26:42.06,000 --> 0:26:45,000
and you're just funding the learning curve and it's going to get very cheap,

498
0:26:45.728,000 --> 0:26:47,000
I believe we should try more things

499
0:26:48.55,000 --> 0:26:5,000
that have a potential to be far less expensive.

500
0:26:51.26,000 --> 0:26:56,000
If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"

501
0:26:56.476,000 --> 0:26:58,000
then the rich can afford that.

502
0:26:58.522,000 --> 0:27:01,000
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy

503
0:27:01.675,000 --> 0:27:02,000
and not change our lifestyle.

504
0:27:03.09,000 --> 0:27:05,000
The disaster is for that two billion.

505
0:27:05.378,000 --> 0:27:07,000
And even Lomborg has changed.

506
0:27:07.709,000 --> 0:27:11,000
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?"

507
0:27:12.26,000 --> 0:27:14,000
He's still, because of his earlier stuff,

508
0:27:14.797,000 --> 0:27:15,000
still associated with the skeptic camp,

509
0:27:16.721,000 --> 0:27:18,000
but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,

510
0:27:19.518,000 --> 0:27:22,000
and so, he's making the R&D point.

511
0:27:22.8,000 --> 0:27:26,000
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.

512
0:27:27.26,000 --> 0:27:29,000
The R&D piece -- it's crazy how little it's funded.

513
0:27:30.816,000 --> 0:27:33,000
CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak on behalf of most people here

514
0:27:34.127,000 --> 0:27:36,000
to say I really hope your wish comes true.

515
0:27:36.219,000 --> 0:27:37,000
Thank you so much.

516
0:27:37.415,000 --> 0:27:38,000
BG: Thank you.

517
0:27:38.59,000 --> 0:27:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And I want to start with a question

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that has just been consuming me

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
since I first became familiar with your work.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
of a natural force

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in some sort of interplay with creative force.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Are they ever in equilibrium

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the way that you see your work?

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Tom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it's usually to solve a question.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I had the question popped into my head:

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
if you could connect the two spheres?

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And so I went about and made that sculpture,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
turning it out of solid bronze.

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I did one that was about 35 feet long.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The sun end was about four inches in diameter,

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and then it tapered over about 35 feet

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to about a millimeter at the Earth end.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so for me, it was really exciting

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
just to see what it looks like

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
if you could step outside and into a larger context,

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as though you were an astronaut,

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and see these two things as an object,

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
because they are so intimately bound,

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and one is meaningless without the other.

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
JH: Is there a relief

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in playing with these forces?

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in playing with these forces.

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects --

35
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
like that silver one there,

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that was the result

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of hundreds of experiments with magnets,

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
trying to find a way to make something float

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
with the least possible connection to the ground.

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So I got it down to just one tether

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to be able to support that.

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
TS: Yeah.

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
JH: I agree.

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
TS: The magnetic works

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are a combination of gravity and magnetism,

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that influence everything.

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The sun has a tremendous field

53
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that extends way beyond the planets

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So there's this huge

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
invisible shape structures

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that magnetism takes in the universe.

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But with the pendulum,

59
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it allows me to manifest

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
these invisible forces

61
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that are holding the magnets up.

62
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
My sculptures

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
are normally very simplified.

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I try to refine them down

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to very simple forms.

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But the paintings become very complex,

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because I think the fields

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that are supporting them,

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and they're interference patterns.

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
JH: And they're non-deterministic.

72
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,

73
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
even though the forces can be calculated.

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So the evolution of this --

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I gather this isn't your first pendulum.

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
TS: No. (JH: No.)

77
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and I just had a simple cone

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with a spigot at the bottom of it.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I threw it into an orbit,

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and it only had one color,

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,

83
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
so I had to run in there,

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.

85
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But then I started dreaming of having six colors.

87
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I sort of think about it as the DNA --

88
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
these colors, the red, blue, yellow,

89
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the primary colors and white and black.

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And if you put them together in different combinations --

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
just like printing in a sense,

92
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
like how a magazine color is printed --

93
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and put them under certain forces,

94
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which is orbiting them

95
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or passing them back and forth

96
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or drawing with them,

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
these amazing things started appearing.

98
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.

99
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.

100
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'll ask a couple of my sons

101
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to set up the canvases here.

102
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I want to just say --

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so this is Jack, Nick and Louie.

104
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
JH: Thanks guys.

105
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
TS: So here are the --

106
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
JH: All right, I'll get out of the way here.

107
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
TS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit

108
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.

109
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
JH: Whoa. That is ...

111
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
ooh, nice.

112
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
TS: So something like this.

113
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm doing this as a demo,

114
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it's more playful,

115
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but inevitably,

116
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
all of this can be used.

117
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I can redeem this painting,

118
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
just continuing on,

119
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
doing layers upon layers.

120
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks,

121
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and I'm contemplating it,

122
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and I'll do another session with it

123
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and bring it up to another level,

124
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
where all of this

125
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
becomes the background, the depth of it.

126
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
JH: That's fantastic.

127
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there

128
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are like radio-controlled airplane valves.

129
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
TS: Yes, they're servos with cams

130
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that pinch these rubber tubes.

131
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And they can pinch them very tight and stop it,

132
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
or you can have them wide open.

133
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And all of the colors

134
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
come out one central port

135
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
at the bottom.

136
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,

137
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or I could put anything into this.

138
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It could be tomato sauce,

139
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or anything could be dispensed --

140
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
sand, powders or anything like that.

141
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
JH: So many forces there.

142
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,

143
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you've got the fluid dynamics.

144
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Each of these beautiful paintings,

145
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
are they images in and of themselves,

146
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
or are they records

147
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of a physical event

148
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
called the pendulum approaching the canvas?

149
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
TS: Well, this painting here,

150
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I wanted to do something very simple,

151
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a simple, iconic image

152
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
of two ripples interfering.

153
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So the one on the right was done first,

154
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and then the one on the left

155
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
was done over it.

156
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And then I left gaps

157
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so you could see the one that was done before.

158
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And then when I did the second one,

159
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
it really disturbed the piece --

160
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
these big blue lines

161
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
crashing through the center of it --

162
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.

163
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
There are lines in front of the one on the right,

164
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and there are lines behind the one on the left,

165
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and so it takes it into different planes.

166
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
What it's also about,

167
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
just the little events,

168
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the events of the interpenetration of --

169
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
JH: Two stars, or --

170
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
TS: Two things that happened --

171
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.

172
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
There are shapes that come about

173
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
just by the marriage

174
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of two events that are happening,

175
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and I'm very interested in that.

176
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.

177
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Like this green one,

178
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
this is a painting I did about 10 years ago,

179
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but it has some --

180
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
see, in the upper third --

181
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
there are these moires and interference patterns

182
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that are radio kind of imagery.

183
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And that's something that in painting

184
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I've never seen done.

185
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I've never seen a representation

186
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
of a kind of radio interference patterns,

187
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which are so ubiquitous

188
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and such an important part of our lives.

189
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
JH: Is that a literal part of the image,

190
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or is my eye making that interference pattern --

191
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is my eye completing that interference pattern?

192
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
TS: It is the paint actually,

193
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
makes it real.

194
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's really manifested there.

195
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
If I throw a very concentric circle,

196
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
or concentric ellipse,

197
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
it just dutifully makes

198
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
these evenly spaced lines,

199
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which get closer and closer together,

200
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which describes how gravity works.

201
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
There's something very appealing

202
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
about the exactitude of science

203
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that I really enjoy.

204
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I love the shapes that I see

205
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in scientific observations

206
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and apparatus,

207
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
especially astronomical forms

208
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and the idea of the vastness of it,

209
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the scale,

210
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is very interesting to me.

211
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
My focus in recent years

212
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
has kind of shifted more toward biology.

213
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close,

214
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
odd things appear

215
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that really look like horses or birds

216
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or crocodiles, elephants.

217
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
There are lots of things that appear.

218
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,

219
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.

220
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And then there are all these forms

221
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that we don't know what they are,

222
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but they're equally well-resolved

223
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and complex.

224
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.

225
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Because since it has the ability

226
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to make forms

227
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that look like forms that we're familiar with

228
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in biology,

229
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.

230
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And maybe it's the kind of forms

231
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,

232
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
where there are probably lakes

233
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
with fish swimming under the surface.

234
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.

235
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.

236
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
You know, it seems

237
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
at this stage in your life,

238
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you also very personally

239
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
are in this state of confrontation

240
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
with a sort of dissonant --

241
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I suppose it's an electromagnetic force

242
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that somehow governs your Parkinson's

243
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and this creative force

244
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that is both the artist

245
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who is in the here and now

246
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and this sort of arc of your whole life.

247
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Is that relevant to your work?

248
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
TS: As it turns out,

249
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
this device kind of comes in handy,

250
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
because I don't have to have

251
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the fine motor skills to do,

252
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that I can operate slides,

253
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
which is more of a mental process.

254
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I'm looking at it and making decisions:

255
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It needs more red, it needs more blue,

256
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
it needs a different shape.

257
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And so I make these creative decisions

258
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and can execute them

259
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
in a much, much simpler way.

260
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I mean, I've got the symptoms.

261
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,

262
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.

263
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In my case,

264
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
my left hand has a significant tremor

265
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and my left leg also.

266
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I'm left-handed, and so I draw.

267
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
All my creations

268
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
really start on small drawings,

269
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which I have thousands of,

270
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and it's my way of just thinking.

271
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I draw with a simple pencil,

272
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and at first, the Parkinson's

273
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
was really upsetting,

274
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.

275
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.

276
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.

277
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
You think of yourself as the servant.

278
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.

279
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It just has so much in it.

280
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And I think nature

281
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
wants to express itself

282
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in the sense that we are nature,

283
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
humans are of the universe.

284
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The universe is in our mind,

285
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and our minds are in the universe.

286
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And we are expressions

287
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of the universe, basically.

288
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
As humans,

289
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
ultimately being part of the universe,

290
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
we're kind of the spokespeople

291
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
or the observer part

292
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
of the constituency

293
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
of the universe.

294
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And to interface with it,

295
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with a device that lets these forces

296
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
that are everywhere

297
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
act and show what they can do,

298
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
giving them pigment and paint just like an artist,

299
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
it's a good ally.

300
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It's a terrific studio assistant.

301
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
JH: Well, I love the idea

302
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that somewhere within this idea

303
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
of fine motion and control

304
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
with the traditional skills

305
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that you have with your hand,

306
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
some sort of more elemental force gets revealed,

307
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and that's the beauty here.

308
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.

309
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
TS: Thank you, John.

310
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.926,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It would be nice to be objective in life,

2
0:00:15.571,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in many ways.

3
0:00:17.593,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The problem is that we have these color-tinted glasses

4
0:00:20.971,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as we look at all kinds of situations.

5
0:00:25.65,000 --> 0:00:28,000
For example, think about something as simple as beer.

6
0:00:29.366,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If I gave you a few beers to taste

7
0:00:31.548,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I asked you to rate them on intensity and bitterness,

8
0:00:35.356,000 --> 0:00:38,000
different beers would occupy different space.

9
0:00:39.053,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But what if we tried to be objective about it?

10
0:00:41.81,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In the case of beer, it would be very simple.

11
0:00:43.97,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What if we did a blind taste?

12
0:00:46.122,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well, if we did the same thing, you tasted the same beer,

13
0:00:48.846,000 --> 0:00:51,000
now in the blind taste, things would look slightly different.

14
0:00:52.817,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Most of the beers will go into one place.

15
0:00:55.039,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You will basically not be able to distinguish them,

16
0:00:57.484,000 --> 0:01:,000
and the exception, of course, will be Guinness.

17
0:01:00.573,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:02.801,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Similarly, we can think about physiology.

19
0:01:05.587,000 --> 0:01:08,000
What happens when people expect something from their physiology?

20
0:01:08.629,000 --> 0:01:1,000
For example, we sold people pain medications.

21
0:01:11.137,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Some people, we told them the medications were expensive.

22
0:01:13.876,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Some people, we told them it was cheap.

23
0:01:15.757,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And the expensive pain medication worked better.

24
0:01:18.729,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It relieved more pain from people,

25
0:01:21.283,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because expectations do change our physiology.

26
0:01:24.787,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And of course, we all know that in sports,

27
0:01:26.849,000 --> 0:01:27,000
if you are a fan of a particular team,

28
0:01:28.667,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you can't help but see the game

29
0:01:31.036,000 --> 0:01:34,000
develop from the perspective of your team.

30
0:01:34.541,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So all of those are cases in which our preconceived notions

31
0:01:38.717,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and our expectations color our world.

32
0:01:42.157,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But what happened in more important questions?

33
0:01:45.559,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What happened with questions that had to do with social justice?

34
0:01:49.111,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So we wanted to think about what is the blind tasting version

35
0:01:52.516,000 --> 0:01:55,000
for thinking about inequality?

36
0:01:55.581,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So we started looking at inequality,

37
0:01:57.88,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and we did some large-scale surveys

38
0:01:59.83,000 --> 0:02:01,000
around the U.S. and other countries.

39
0:02:02.384,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So we asked two questions:

40
0:02:04.335,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Do people know what kind of level of inequality we have?

41
0:02:07.701,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And then, what level of inequality do we want to have?

42
0:02:11.812,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So let's think about the first question.

43
0:02:14.226,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Imagine I took all the people in the U.S.

44
0:02:16.339,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I sorted them from the poorest on the right

45
0:02:19.264,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to the richest on the left,

46
0:02:21.656,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and then I divided them into five buckets:

47
0:02:24.318,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the poorest 20 percent, the next 20 percent,

48
0:02:26.616,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the next, the next, and the richest 20 percent.

49
0:02:29.472,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And then I asked you to tell me how much wealth do you think

50
0:02:32.468,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is concentrated in each of those buckets.

51
0:02:35.417,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So to make it simpler, imagine I ask you to tell me,

52
0:02:37.878,000 --> 0:02:39,000
how much wealth do you think is concentrated

53
0:02:40.138,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in the bottom two buckets,

54
0:02:42.398,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the bottom 40 percent?

55
0:02:44.659,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Take a second. Think about it and have a number.

56
0:02:47.351,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Usually we don't think.

57
0:02:49.255,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Think for a second, have a real number in your mind.

58
0:02:51.74,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You have it?

59
0:02:53.365,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Okay, here's what lots of Americans tell us.

60
0:02:56.43,000 --> 0:02:57,000
They think that the bottom 20 percent

61
0:02:58.357,000 --> 0:03:,000
has about 2.9 percent of the wealth,

62
0:03:00.679,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the next group has 6.4,

63
0:03:02.862,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so together it's slightly more than nine.

64
0:03:05.369,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The next group, they say, has 12 percent,

65
0:03:08.782,000 --> 0:03:09,000
20 percent,

66
0:03:10.431,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the richest 20 percent, people think has 58 percent of the wealth.

67
0:03:15.075,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You can see how this relates to what you thought.

68
0:03:18.21,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, what's reality?

69
0:03:19.951,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Reality is slightly different.

70
0:03:21.762,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The bottom 20 percent has 0.1 percent of the wealth.

71
0:03:25.575,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The next 20 percent has 0.2 percent of the wealth.

72
0:03:28.826,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Together, it's 0.3.

73
0:03:30.939,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The next group has 3.9,

74
0:03:34.468,000 --> 0:03:36,000
11.3,

75
0:03:36.651,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and the richest group has 84-85 percent of the wealth.

76
0:03:42.392,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So what we actually have and what we think we have

77
0:03:45.358,000 --> 0:03:46,000
are very different.

78
0:03:47.331,000 --> 0:03:49,000
What about what we want?

79
0:03:49.421,000 --> 0:03:5,000
How do we even figure this out?

80
0:03:51.418,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So to look at this,

81
0:03:52.829,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to look at what we really want,

82
0:03:54.407,000 --> 0:03:57,000
we thought about the philosopher John Rawls.

83
0:03:57.472,000 --> 0:03:58,000
If you remember John Rawls,

84
0:03:59.307,000 --> 0:04:02,000
he had this notion of what's a just society.

85
0:04:02.557,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He said a just society

86
0:04:04.039,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is a society that if you knew everything about it,

87
0:04:06.754,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you would be willing to enter it in a random place.

88
0:04:09.187,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And it's a beautiful definition,

89
0:04:10.711,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because if you're wealthy, you might want the wealthy

90
0:04:13.189,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to have more money, the poor to have less.

91
0:04:15.226,000 --> 0:04:17,000
If you're poor, you might want more equality.

92
0:04:17.335,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But if you're going to go into that society

93
0:04:19.339,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in every possible situation, and you don't know,

94
0:04:22.659,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you have to consider all the aspects.

95
0:04:24.865,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's a little bit like blind tasting in which you don't know

96
0:04:27.791,000 --> 0:04:29,000
what the outcome will be when you make a decision,

97
0:04:30.461,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and Rawls called this the "veil of ignorance."

98
0:04:34.176,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So, we took another group, a large group of Americans,

99
0:04:37.783,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and we asked them the question in the veil of ignorance.

100
0:04:40.538,000 --> 0:04:44,000
What are the characteristics of a country that would make you want to join it,

101
0:04:44.648,000 --> 0:04:47,000
knowing that you could end randomly at any place?

102
0:04:47.806,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And here is what we got.

103
0:04:49.285,000 --> 0:04:51,000
What did people want to give to the first group,

104
0:04:51.544,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the bottom 20 percent?

105
0:04:53.727,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They wanted to give them about 10 percent of the wealth.

106
0:04:56.421,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The next group, 14 percent of the wealth,

107
0:04:59.021,000 --> 0:05:04,000
21, 22 and 32.

108
0:05:04.384,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, nobody in our sample wanted full equality.

109
0:05:07.89,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Nobody thought that socialism is a fantastic idea in our sample.

110
0:05:12.323,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But what does it mean?

111
0:05:13.611,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It means that we have this knowledge gap

112
0:05:15.649,000 --> 0:05:17,000
between what we have and what we think we have,

113
0:05:18.307,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but we have at least as big a gap between what we think is right

114
0:05:22.022,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to what we think we have.

115
0:05:24.82,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, we can ask these questions, by the way, not just about wealth.

116
0:05:28.012,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We can ask it about other things as well.

117
0:05:30.427,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So for example, we asked people from different parts of the world

118
0:05:34.63,000 --> 0:05:35,000
about this question,

119
0:05:36.348,000 --> 0:05:38,000
people who are liberals and conservatives,

120
0:05:38.691,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and they gave us basically the same answer.

121
0:05:40.735,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We asked rich and poor, they gave us the same answer,

122
0:05:43.217,000 --> 0:05:44,000
men and women,

123
0:05:44.518,000 --> 0:05:46,000
NPR listeners and Forbes readers.

124
0:05:47.211,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We asked people in England, Australia, the U.S. --

125
0:05:50.44,000 --> 0:05:51,000
very similar answers.

126
0:05:52.157,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We even asked different departments of a university.

127
0:05:54.928,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We went to Harvard and we checked almost every department,

128
0:05:57.686,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and in fact, from Harvard Business School,

129
0:05:59.698,000 --> 0:06:02,000
where a few people wanted the wealthy to have more and the [poor] to have less,

130
0:06:03.41,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the similarity was astonishing.

131
0:06:05.95,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I know some of you went to Harvard Business School.

132
0:06:08.774,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We also asked this question about something else.

133
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We asked, what about the ratio of CEO pay to unskilled workers?

134
0:06:17.089,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So you can see what people think is the ratio,

135
0:06:20.246,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and then we can ask the question, what do they think should be the ratio?

136
0:06:24.147,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And then we can ask, what is reality?

137
0:06:26.774,000 --> 0:06:29,000
What is reality? And you could say, well, it's not that bad, right?

138
0:06:30.052,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The red and the yellow are not that different.

139
0:06:32.205,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But the fact is, it's because I didn't draw them on the same scale.

140
0:06:38.105,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's hard to see, there's yellow and blue in there.

141
0:06:42.015,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So what about other outcomes of wealth?

142
0:06:44.36,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Wealth is not just about wealth.

143
0:06:46.055,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We asked, what about things like health?

144
0:06:48.679,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What about availability of prescription medication?

145
0:06:52.812,000 --> 0:06:54,000
What about life expectancy?

146
0:06:54.832,000 --> 0:06:56,000
What about life expectancy of infants?

147
0:06:57.247,000 --> 0:06:59,000
How do we want this to be distributed?

148
0:06:59.592,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What about education for young people?

149
0:07:02.401,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And for older people?

150
0:07:04.271,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And across all of those things, what we learned was that people

151
0:07:07.254,000 --> 0:07:1,000
don't like inequality of wealth,

152
0:07:10.412,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but there's other things where inequality, which is an outcome of wealth,

153
0:07:13.918,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is even more aversive to them:

154
0:07:15.961,000 --> 0:07:18,000
for example, inequality in health or education.

155
0:07:19.932,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We also learned that people are particularly open

156
0:07:22.393,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to changes in equality when it comes to people

157
0:07:24.947,000 --> 0:07:26,000
who have less agency --

158
0:07:26.991,000 --> 0:07:28,000
basically, young kids and babies,

159
0:07:29.336,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because we don't think of them as responsible for their situation.

160
0:07:34.003,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So what are some lessons from this?

161
0:07:36.348,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We have two gaps:

162
0:07:37.508,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We have a knowledge gap and we have a desirability gap

163
0:07:40.088,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And the knowledge gap is something that we think about,

164
0:07:42.71,000 --> 0:07:43,000
how do we educate people?

165
0:07:44.08,000 --> 0:07:46,000
How do we get people to think differently about inequality

166
0:07:46.796,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and the consequences of inequality in terms of health, education,

167
0:07:50.558,000 --> 0:07:52,000
jealousy, crime rate, and so on?

168
0:07:52.949,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Then we have the desirability gap.

169
0:07:54.83,000 --> 0:07:57,000
How do we get people to think differently about what we really want?

170
0:07:58.653,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You see, the Rawls definition, the Rawls way of looking at the world,

171
0:08:02.028,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the blind tasting approach,

172
0:08:03.77,000 --> 0:08:05,000
takes our selfish motivation out of the picture.

173
0:08:06.695,000 --> 0:08:08,000
How do we implement that to a higher degree

174
0:08:09.272,000 --> 0:08:11,000
on a more extensive scale?

175
0:08:11.896,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And finally, we also have an action gap.

176
0:08:14.752,000 --> 0:08:16,000
How do we take these things and actually do something about it?

177
0:08:17.701,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I think part of the answer is to think about people

178
0:08:20.603,000 --> 0:08:23,000
like young kids and babies that don't have much agency,

179
0:08:23.715,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because people seem to be more willing to do this.

180
0:08:27.523,000 --> 0:08:32,000
To summarize, I would say, next time you go to drink beer or wine,

181
0:08:32.793,000 --> 0:08:36,000
first of all, think about, what is it in your experience that is real,

182
0:08:36.88,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and what is it in your experience that is a placebo effect

183
0:08:40.154,000 --> 0:08:41,000
coming from expectations?

184
0:08:41.758,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And then think about what it also means for other decisions in your life,

185
0:08:45.287,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and hopefully also for policy questions

186
0:08:47.362,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that affect all of us.

187
0:08:48.667,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Thanks a lot.

188
0:08:50.394,000 --> 0:08:52,000

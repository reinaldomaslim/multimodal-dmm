1
0:00:12.5,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Here's a question for you:

2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
how many different scents do you think you can smell,

3
0:00:18.42,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and maybe even identify with accuracy?

4
0:00:22.62,000 --> 0:00:23,000
100?

5
0:00:24.66,000 --> 0:00:25,000
300?

6
0:00:26.9,000 --> 0:00:27,000
1,000?

7
0:00:30.1,000 --> 0:00:35,000
One study estimates that humans can detect up to one trillion different odors.

8
0:00:36.1,000 --> 0:00:37,000
A trillion.

9
0:00:37.74,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's hard to imagine,

10
0:00:39.58,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but your nose has the molecular machinery to make it happen.

11
0:00:44.78,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Olfactory receptors --

12
0:00:46.58,000 --> 0:00:47,000
tiny scent detectors --

13
0:00:48.54,000 --> 0:00:49,000
are packed into your nose,

14
0:00:50.5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
each one patiently waiting to be activated by the odor,

15
0:00:53.94,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or ligand,

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that it's been assigned to detect.

17
0:00:58.34,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It turns out we humans, like all vertebrates,

18
0:01:01.46,000 --> 0:01:03,000
have lots of olfactory receptors.

19
0:01:04.62,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In fact, more of our DNA is devoted to genes for different olfactory receptors

20
0:01:11.38,000 --> 0:01:13,000
than for any other type of protein.

21
0:01:15.06,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Why is that?

22
0:01:17.46,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Could olfactory receptors be doing something else

23
0:01:20.78,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in addition to allowing us to smell?

24
0:01:25.66,000 --> 0:01:3,000
In 1991, Linda Buck and Richard Axel uncovered the molecular identity

25
0:01:30.74,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of olfactory receptors --

26
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
work which ultimately led to a Nobel Prize.

27
0:01:36.38,000 --> 0:01:37,000
At the time,

28
0:01:37.62,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we all assumed that these receptors were only found in the nose.

29
0:01:42.3,000 --> 0:01:44,000
However, about a year or so later,

30
0:01:44.54,000 --> 0:01:48,000
a report emerged of an olfactory receptor expressed in a tissue

31
0:01:49.06,000 --> 0:01:51,000
other than the nose.

32
0:01:51.18,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And then another such report emerged,

33
0:01:53.86,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and another.

34
0:01:55.7,000 --> 0:01:59,000
We now know that these receptors are found all over the body,

35
0:01:59.78,000 --> 0:02:02,000
including in some pretty unexpected places --

36
0:02:03.74,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in muscle,

37
0:02:05.38,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in kidneys,

38
0:02:06.98,000 --> 0:02:07,000
lungs

39
0:02:08.54,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and blood vessels.

40
0:02:10.34,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But what are they doing there?

41
0:02:15.58,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, we know that olfactory receptors act as sensitive chemical sensors

42
0:02:20.299,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in the nose --

43
0:02:21.54,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that's how they mediate our sense of smell.

44
0:02:24.3,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It turns out they also act as sensitive chemical sensors

45
0:02:28.5,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in many other parts of the body.

46
0:02:31.1,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Now, I'm not saying that your liver can detect the aroma of your morning coffee

47
0:02:36.02,000 --> 0:02:37,000
as you walk into the kitchen.

48
0:02:38.3,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Rather, after you drink your morning coffee,

49
0:02:41.46,000 --> 0:02:43,000
your liver might use an olfactory receptor

50
0:02:44.46,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to chemically detect the change in concentration

51
0:02:47.66,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of a chemical floating through your bloodstream.

52
0:02:50.82,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Many cell types and tissues in the body use chemical sensors,

53
0:02:54.34,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or chemosensors,

54
0:02:55.86,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to keep track of the concentration of hormones, metabolites

55
0:02:59.86,000 --> 0:03:,000
and other molecules,

56
0:03:01.34,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and some of these chemosensors are olfactory receptors.

57
0:03:07.14,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If you are a pancreas or a kidney

58
0:03:09.02,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and you need a specialized chemical sensor

59
0:03:11.86,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that will allow you to keep track of a specific molecule,

60
0:03:15.46,000 --> 0:03:16,000
why reinvent the wheel?

61
0:03:19.46,000 --> 0:03:2,000
One of the first examples

62
0:03:21.22,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of an olfactory receptor found outside the nose

63
0:03:24.18,000 --> 0:03:28,000
showed that human sperm express an olfactory receptor,

64
0:03:29.22,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and that sperm with this receptor will seek out the chemical

65
0:03:33.54,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that the receptor responds to --

66
0:03:35.5,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the receptor's ligand.

67
0:03:37.18,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That is, the sperm will swim toward the ligand.

68
0:03:42.06,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This has intriguing implications.

69
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Are sperm aided in finding the egg

70
0:03:48.3,000 --> 0:03:51,000
by sniffing out the area with the highest ligand concentration?

71
0:03:53.42,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I like this example because it clearly demonstrates

72
0:03:56.78,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that an olfactory receptor's primary job is to be a chemical sensor,

73
0:04:02.1,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but depending on the context,

74
0:04:05.02,000 --> 0:04:08,000
it can influence how you perceive a smell,

75
0:04:08.74,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or in which direction sperm will swim,

76
0:04:13.42,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and as it turns out,

77
0:04:14.74,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a huge variety of other processes.

78
0:04:17.74,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Olfactory receptors have been implicated in muscle cell migration,

79
0:04:22.78,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in helping the lung to sense and respond to inhaled chemicals,

80
0:04:26.82,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and in wound healing.

81
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Similarly, taste receptors once thought to be found only in the tongue,

82
0:04:33.86,000 --> 0:04:37,000
are now known to be expressed in cells and tissues throughout the body.

83
0:04:38.98,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Even more surprisingly,

84
0:04:41.18,000 --> 0:04:42,000
a recent study found

85
0:04:42.7,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that the light receptors in our eyes also play a role in our blood vessels.

86
0:04:50.62,000 --> 0:04:51,000
In my lab,

87
0:04:51.9,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we work on trying to understand the roles of olfactory receptors and taste receptors

88
0:04:57.38,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in the context of the kidney.

89
0:05:00.9,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The kidney is a central control center for homeostasis.

90
0:05:04.7,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And to us,

91
0:05:05.94,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it makes sense that a homeostatic control center would be a logical place

92
0:05:09.74,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to employ chemical sensors.

93
0:05:13.34,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors

94
0:05:17.02,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in the kidney,

95
0:05:18.38,000 --> 0:05:21,000
one of which, olfactory receptor 78,

96
0:05:21.98,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is known to be expressed in cells and tissues

97
0:05:25.38,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that are important in the regulation of blood pressure.

98
0:05:30.1,000 --> 0:05:33,000
When this receptor is deleted in mice,

99
0:05:33.38,000 --> 0:05:35,000
their blood pressure is low.

100
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Surprisingly, this receptor was found to respond

101
0:05:40.74,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to chemicals called short-chain fatty acids

102
0:05:43.98,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that are produced by the bacteria that reside in your gut --

103
0:05:47.82,000 --> 0:05:48,000
your gut microbiota.

104
0:05:50.66,000 --> 0:05:52,000
After being produced by your gut microbiota,

105
0:05:53.38,000 --> 0:05:55,000
these chemicals are absorbed into your bloodstream

106
0:05:56.22,000 --> 0:05:58,000
where they can then interact with receptors

107
0:05:58.34,000 --> 0:06:01,000
like olfactory receptor 78,

108
0:06:01.38,000 --> 0:06:05,000
meaning that the changes in metabolism of your gut microbiota

109
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
may influence your blood pressure.

110
0:06:11.66,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Although we've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors

111
0:06:15.98,000 --> 0:06:16,000
in the kidney,

112
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
we've only just begun to tease out their different functions

113
0:06:20.42,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and to figure out which chemicals each of them responds to.

114
0:06:25.06,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Similar investigations lie ahead for many other organs and tissues --

115
0:06:29.02,000 --> 0:06:32,000
only a small minority of receptors has been studied to date.

116
0:06:35.06,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is exciting stuff.

117
0:06:37.9,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's revolutionizing our understanding of the scope of influence

118
0:06:41.46,000 --> 0:06:42,000
for one of the five senses.

119
0:06:44.42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And it has the potential to change our understanding

120
0:06:47.1,000 --> 0:06:49,000
of some aspects of human physiology.

121
0:06:51.38,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It's still early,

122
0:06:52.62,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but I think we've picked up on the scent of something we're following.

123
0:06:56.9,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:57.94,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Thank you.

125
0:06:59.18,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

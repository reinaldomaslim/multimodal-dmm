1
0:00:12.764,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Let's go south.

2
0:00:16.094,000 --> 0:00:22,000
All of you are actually going south.

3
0:00:22.539,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is the direction of south, this way,

4
0:00:27.229,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and if you go 8,000 kilometers out of the back of this room,

5
0:00:33.749,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you will come to as far south as you can go anywhere on Earth,

6
0:00:38.982,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the Pole itself.

7
0:00:41.393,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Now, I am not an explorer.

8
0:00:45.201,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm not an environmentalist.

9
0:00:48.753,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'm actually just a survivor,

10
0:00:52.282,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and these photographs that I'm showing you here are dangerous.

11
0:00:57.851,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They are the ice melt of the South and North Poles.

12
0:01:03.976,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And ladies and gentlemen,

13
0:01:05.516,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we need to listen to what these places are telling us,

14
0:01:11.944,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and if we don't, we will end up with our own survival situation

15
0:01:18.19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
here on planet Earth.

16
0:01:21.636,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I have faced head-on these places,

17
0:01:27.668,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and to walk across a melting ocean of ice

18
0:01:32.196,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is without doubt the most frightening thing

19
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that's ever happened to me.

20
0:01:39.117,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Antarctica is such a hopeful place.

21
0:01:45.064,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It is protected by the Antarctic Treaty, signed in 1959.

22
0:01:52.845,000 --> 0:01:58,000
In 1991, a 50-year agreement was entered into

23
0:01:59.1,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that stops any exploitation in Antarctica,

24
0:02:04.855,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and this agreement could be altered,

25
0:02:09.695,000 --> 0:02:14,000
changed, modified, or even abandoned

26
0:02:15.058,000 --> 0:02:19,000
starting in the year 2041.

27
0:02:21.527,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

28
0:02:24.299,000 --> 0:02:29,000
people already far up north from here in the Arctic

29
0:02:30.267,000 --> 0:02:33,000
are already taking advantage

30
0:02:33.378,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of this ice melt,

31
0:02:37.325,000 --> 0:02:43,000
taking out resources from areas already that have been covered in ice

32
0:02:43.553,000 --> 0:02:46,000
for the last 10, 20, 30,000,

33
0:02:46.961,000 --> 0:02:49,000
100,000 years.

34
0:02:50.305,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Can they not join the dots

35
0:02:53.578,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and think, "Why is the ice actually melting?"

36
0:02:59.94,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is such an amazing place,

37
0:03:03.284,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the Antarctic, and I have worked hard

38
0:03:07.138,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for the last 23 years on this mission

39
0:03:12.293,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to make sure that what's happening up here in the North

40
0:03:16.297,000 --> 0:03:21,000
does never happen, cannot happen in the South.

41
0:03:21.716,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Where did this all begin?

42
0:03:23.508,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It began for me at the age of 11.

43
0:03:26.457,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Check out that haircut. It's a bit odd. (Laughter)

44
0:03:29.452,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And at the age of 11, I was inspired by the real explorers

45
0:03:34.556,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to want to try to be the first to walk to both Poles.

46
0:03:39.32,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I found it incredibly inspiring

47
0:03:43.685,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that the idea of becoming a polar traveler

48
0:03:47.563,000 --> 0:03:51,000
went down pretty well with girls at parties when I was at university.

49
0:03:51.91,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That was a bit more inspiring.

50
0:03:53.878,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And after years, seven years of fundraising,

51
0:03:57.5,000 --> 0:03:59,000
seven years of being told no,

52
0:04:00.147,000 --> 0:04:06,000
seven years of being told by my family to seek counseling

53
0:04:06.393,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and psychiatric help,

54
0:04:10.155,000 --> 0:04:15,000
eventually three of us found ourselves marching to the South Geographic Pole

55
0:04:16.112,000 --> 0:04:22,000
on the longest unassisted march ever made anywhere on Earth in history.

56
0:04:22.14,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In this photograph, we are standing in an area

57
0:04:25.874,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the size of the United States of America,

58
0:04:29.612,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and we're on our own.

59
0:04:30.936,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We have no radio communications, no backup.

60
0:04:34.467,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Beneath our feet, 90 percent of all the world's ice,

61
0:04:42.22,000 --> 0:04:46,000
70 percent of all the world's fresh water.

62
0:04:46.353,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We're standing on it.

63
0:04:48.095,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This is the power of Antarctica.

64
0:04:52.762,000 --> 0:04:55,000
On this journey, we faced the danger of crevasses,

65
0:04:56.268,000 --> 0:04:58,000
intense cold,

66
0:04:58.566,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so cold that sweat turns to ice inside your clothing,

67
0:05:04.046,000 --> 0:05:05,000
your teeth can crack,

68
0:05:05.834,000 --> 0:05:07,000
water can freeze in your eyes.

69
0:05:07.993,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Let's just say it's a bit chilly. (Laughter)

70
0:05:11.058,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And after 70 desperate days, we arrive at the South Pole.

71
0:05:15.229,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We had done it.

72
0:05:16.977,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But something happened to me on that 70-day journey in 1986

73
0:05:22.696,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that brought me here, and it hurt.

74
0:05:25.5,000 --> 0:05:3,000
My eyes changed color in 70 days through damage.

75
0:05:30.615,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Our faces blistered out.

76
0:05:32.652,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The skin ripped off and we wondered why.

77
0:05:37.644,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And when we got home, we were told by NASA

78
0:05:41.173,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that a hole in the ozone had been discovered

79
0:05:44.029,000 --> 0:05:45,000
above the South Pole,

80
0:05:45.562,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we'd walked underneath it the same year it had been discovered.

81
0:05:50.925,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Ultraviolet rays down, hit the ice, bounced back, fried out the eyes,

82
0:05:56.896,000 --> 0:05:59,000
ripped off our faces.

83
0:06:00.027,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It was a bit of a shock -- (Laughter) --

84
0:06:03.371,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and it started me thinking.

85
0:06:06.877,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In 1989, we now head north.

86
0:06:10.104,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Sixty days, every step away from the safety of land

87
0:06:14.743,000 --> 0:06:15,000
across a frozen ocean.

88
0:06:16.629,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It was desperately cold again.

89
0:06:18.854,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Here's me coming in from washing naked at -60 Celsius.

90
0:06:25.823,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And if anybody ever says to you, "I am cold" -- (Laughter) --

91
0:06:30.305,000 --> 0:06:35,000
if they look like this, they are cold, definitely.

92
0:06:36.04,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Applause)

93
0:06:38.958,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And 1,000 kilometers away from the safety of land,

94
0:06:44.982,000 --> 0:06:46,000
disaster strikes.

95
0:06:47.646,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The Arctic Ocean melts beneath our feet four months before it ever had in history,

96
0:06:55.401,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we're 1,000 kilometers from safety.

97
0:06:58.91,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The ice is crashing around us, grinding, and I'm thinking, "Are we going to die?"

98
0:07:05.411,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But something clicked in my head on this day,

99
0:07:09.614,000 --> 0:07:16,000
as I realized we, as a world, are in a survival situation,

100
0:07:16.706,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and that feeling has never gone away for 25 long years.

101
0:07:21.07,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Back then, we had to march or die.

102
0:07:25.543,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And we're not some TV survivor program.

103
0:07:29.351,000 --> 0:07:31,000
When things go wrong for us, it's life or death,

104
0:07:32.282,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and our brave African-American Daryl,

105
0:07:35.596,000 --> 0:07:38,000
who would become the first American to walk to the North Pole,

106
0:07:39.474,000 --> 0:07:43,000
his heel dropped off from frostbite 200 klicks out.

107
0:07:44.071,000 --> 0:07:46,000
He must keep going, he does,

108
0:07:46.231,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and after 60 days on the ice, we stood at the North Pole.

109
0:07:51.061,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We had done it.

110
0:07:52.555,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Yes, I became the first person in history stupid enough to walk to both Poles,

111
0:07:57.825,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but it was our success.

112
0:08:01.387,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And sadly, on return home,

113
0:08:05.247,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it was not all fun.

114
0:08:08.382,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I became very low.

115
0:08:10.123,000 --> 0:08:16,000
To succeed at something is often harder than actually making it happen.

116
0:08:16.412,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I was empty, lonely, financially destroyed.

117
0:08:20.525,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I was without hope,

118
0:08:22.87,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but hope came in the form of the great Jacques Cousteau,

119
0:08:26.585,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and he inspired me to take on the 2041 mission.

120
0:08:31.981,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Being Jacques, he gave me clear instructions:

121
0:08:35.153,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Engage the world leaders, talk to industry and business,

122
0:08:39.55,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and above all, Rob, inspire young people,

123
0:08:43.489,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because they will choose the future of the preservation of Antarctica.

124
0:08:48.344,000 --> 0:08:52,000
For the world leaders, we've been to every world Earth Summit,

125
0:08:52.73,000 --> 0:08:56,000
all three of them, with our brave yacht, 2041,

126
0:08:57.095,000 --> 0:09:01,000
twice to Rio, once in '92, once in 2012,

127
0:09:01.925,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and for the Earth Summit in Johannesburg,

128
0:09:05.547,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we made the longest overland voyage ever made with a yacht,

129
0:09:12.861,000 --> 0:09:16,000
13,000 kilometers around the whole of Southern Africa

130
0:09:17.04,000 --> 0:09:23,000
doing our best to inspire over a million young people in person

131
0:09:23.518,000 --> 0:09:28,000
about 2041 and about their environment.

132
0:09:28.58,000 --> 0:09:34,000
For the last 11 years, we have taken over 1,000 people,

133
0:09:35.499,000 --> 0:09:38,000
people from industry and business, women and men from companies,

134
0:09:38.518,000 --> 0:09:42,000
students from all over the world, down to Antarctica,

135
0:09:42.893,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and during those missions, we've managed to pull out

136
0:09:46.002,000 --> 0:09:51,000
over 1,500 tons of twisted metal left in Antarctica.

137
0:09:51.652,000 --> 0:09:54,000
That took eight years, and I'm so proud of it

138
0:09:55.111,000 --> 0:10:02,000
because we recycled all of it back here in South America.

139
0:10:02.246,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I have been inspired ever since I could walk

140
0:10:05.754,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to recycle by my mum.

141
0:10:09.051,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Here she is, and my mum --

142
0:10:11.528,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause) --

143
0:10:15.175,000 --> 0:10:17,000
my mum is still recycling,

144
0:10:17.872,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and as she is in her 100th year, isn't that fantastic?

145
0:10:22.847,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Applause)

146
0:10:25.197,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And when -- I love my mum.

147
0:10:28.439,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

148
0:10:29.559,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But when Mum was born,

149
0:10:32.78,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the population of our planet was only 1.8 billion people,

150
0:10:39.119,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and talking in terms of billions,

151
0:10:41.07,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we have taken young people from industry and business

152
0:10:44.738,000 --> 0:10:46,000
from India, from China.

153
0:10:46.944,000 --> 0:10:51,000
These are game-changing nations, and will be hugely important

154
0:10:52.724,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in the decision about the preservation of the Antarctic.

155
0:10:57.544,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Unbelievably, we've engaged and inspired women to come from the Middle East,

156
0:11:04.393,000 --> 0:11:1,000
often for the first time they've represented their nations in Antarctica.

157
0:11:10.551,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Fantastic people, so inspired.

158
0:11:13.066,000 --> 0:11:16,000
To look after Antarctica,

159
0:11:16.322,000 --> 0:11:22,000
you've got to first engage people with this extraordinary place,

160
0:11:22.658,000 --> 0:11:26,000
form a relationship, form a bond,

161
0:11:26.858,000 --> 0:11:28,000
form some love.

162
0:11:29.621,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It is such a privilege to go to Antarctica,

163
0:11:33.08,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I can't tell you.

164
0:11:34.427,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I feel so lucky,

165
0:11:36.006,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and I've been 35 times in my life,

166
0:11:39.233,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and all those people who come with us return home as great champions,

167
0:11:43.951,000 --> 0:11:44,000
not only for Antarctica,

168
0:11:45.899,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but for local issues back in their own nations.

169
0:11:49.543,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Let's go back to where we began: the ice melt of the North and South Poles.

170
0:11:55.891,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And it's not good news.

171
0:11:59.713,000 --> 0:12:02,000
NASA informed us six months ago

172
0:12:03.689,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that the Western Antarctic Ice Shelf is now disintegrating.

173
0:12:08.688,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Huge areas of ice --

174
0:12:11.113,000 --> 0:12:15,000
look how big Antarctica is even compared to here --

175
0:12:15.385,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Huge areas of ice are breaking off from Antarctica,

176
0:12:19.926,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the size of small nations.

177
0:12:22.761,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And NASA have calculated that the sea level will rise,

178
0:12:27.166,000 --> 0:12:29,000
it is definite,

179
0:12:29.34,000 --> 0:12:32,000
by one meter in the next 100 years,

180
0:12:32.753,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the same time that my mum has been on planet Earth.

181
0:12:36.288,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It's going to happen,

182
0:12:37.978,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and I've realized that the preservation of Antarctica

183
0:12:43.649,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and our survival here on Earth are linked.

184
0:12:48.194,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And there is a very simple solution.

185
0:12:50.088,000 --> 0:12:55,000
If we are using more renewable energy in the real world,

186
0:12:55.607,000 --> 0:13:,000
if we are being more efficient with the energy here,

187
0:13:01.469,000 --> 0:13:05,000
running our energy mix in a cleaner way,

188
0:13:05.765,000 --> 0:13:09,000
there will be no financial reason to go and exploit Antarctica.

189
0:13:10.611,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It won't make financial sense,

190
0:13:12.67,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and if we manage our energy better, we also may be able to slow down,

191
0:13:20.366,000 --> 0:13:22,000
maybe even stop,

192
0:13:22.506,000 --> 0:13:25,000
this great ice melt that threatens us.

193
0:13:25.547,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It's a big challenge, and what is our response to it?

194
0:13:29.097,000 --> 0:13:32,000
We've got to go back one last time,

195
0:13:33.069,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and at the end of next year,

196
0:13:34.965,000 --> 0:13:37,000
we will go back to the South Geographic Pole,

197
0:13:38.8,000 --> 0:13:42,000
where we arrived 30 years ago on foot,

198
0:13:43.052,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and retrace our steps of 1,600 kilometers,

199
0:13:48.777,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but this time only using renewable energy to survive.

200
0:13:54.827,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We will walk across those icecaps, which far down below are melting,

201
0:14:00.386,000 --> 0:14:04,000
hopefully inspiring some solutions on that issue.

202
0:14:05.295,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This is my son, Barney.

203
0:14:07.72,000 --> 0:14:09,000
He is coming with me.

204
0:14:10.511,000 --> 0:14:14,000
He is committed to walking side by side with his father,

205
0:14:15.261,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and what he will do is to translate these messages

206
0:14:19.275,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and inspire these messages to the minds of future young leaders.

207
0:14:24.9,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I'm extremely proud of him.

208
0:14:26.939,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Good on him, Barney.

209
0:14:31.623,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Ladies and gentlemen, a survivor -- and I'm good --

210
0:14:38.198,000 --> 0:14:45,000
a survivor sees a problem and doesn't go, "Whatever."

211
0:14:46.686,000 --> 0:14:5,000
A survivor sees a problem and deals with that problem

212
0:14:50.846,000 --> 0:14:53,000
before it becomes a threat.

213
0:14:53.919,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We have 27 years to preserve the Antarctic.

214
0:14:59.967,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We all own it.

215
0:15:02.482,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We all have responsibility.

216
0:15:05.262,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The fact that nobody owns it maybe means that we can succeed.

217
0:15:10.232,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Antarctica is a moral line in the snow,

218
0:15:15.051,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and on one side of that line we should fight,

219
0:15:18.598,000 --> 0:15:23,000
fight hard for this one beautiful, pristine place left alone on Earth.

220
0:15:24.311,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I know it's possible.

221
0:15:26.472,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We are going to do it.

222
0:15:28.492,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And I'll leave you with these words from Goethe.

223
0:15:32.37,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I've tried to live by them.

224
0:15:35.977,000 --> 0:15:4,000
"If you can do, or dream you can,

225
0:15:43.262,000 --> 0:15:45,000
begin it now,

226
0:15:46.234,000 --> 0:15:52,000
for boldness has genius, power and magic in it."

227
0:15:53.026,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Good luck to you all.

228
0:15:54.59,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thank you very much.

229
0:15:56.75,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

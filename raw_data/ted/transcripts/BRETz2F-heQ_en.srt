0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hello. I would like to start my talk

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
with actually two questions, and the first one is:

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
How many people here actually eat pig meat?

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Please raise your hand --

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
oh, that's a lot.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And how many people have actually seen

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a live pig producing this meat?

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In the last year?

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In the Netherlands -- where I come from --

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you actually never see a pig, which is really strange,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because, on a population of 16 million people,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we have 12 million pigs.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
They eat about one-third, and the rest is exported

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
A lot goes to the U.K., Germany.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And what I was curious about --

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so nothing would be wasted --

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I was curious to find out

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
if this was actually still the case.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I spent about three years researching.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I followed this one pig

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with number "05049,"

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
all the way up until the end

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and to what products it's made of.

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And in these years, I met all kinds people

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
like, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But I also met aluminum mold makers,

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
ammunition producers

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and all kinds of people.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And what was striking to me

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is that the farmers actually had no clue

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what was made of their pigs,

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but the consumers -- as in us --

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
had also no idea

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of the pigs being in all these products.

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So what I did is,

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I took all this research

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
on the back.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And it consists of seven chapters --

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
blood, fat and miscellaneous.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In total,

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they weigh 103.7 kilograms.

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And to show you how often you actually

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
meet part of this pig in a regular day,

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I want to show you some images of the book.

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You probably start the day with a shower.

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So, in soap, fatty acids

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
made from boiling pork bone fat

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
are used as a hardening agent,

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Then if you look around you in the bathroom,

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you see lots more products

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
like shampoo, conditioner,

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but also toothpaste.

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Then, so, before breakfast,

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
you've already met the pig so many times.

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Then, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
were used as an improver of dough.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

68
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of course."

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So what they do is they put gelatin back in,

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in order to retain the texture.

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Well, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see,

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
there might very well be cellular concrete,

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
which is a very light kind of concrete

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that's actually got proteins from bones inside

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and it's also fully reusable.

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes --

80
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
there's this part of the brake

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that's made of bone ash.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
everything that's cooled in the supermarket,

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
there's gelatin to make it look good.

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
gives it its translucency

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and also its strength,

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in order to make these really fine shapes,

91
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
like this deer.

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's used in paint for the texture,

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but also for the glossiness.

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
In sandpaper, bone glue

96
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is actually the glue between the sand and the paper.

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then in paintbrushes,

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because of their hard-wearing nature.

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I was not planning on showing you any meat

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because, of course, half the book's meat

102
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and you probably all know what meats they are.

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one,

104
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And this is actually sold

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in the frozen area of the supermarket.

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And what it is -- it's actually steak.

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So, this is sold as cow,

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but what happens when you slaughter a cow --

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
at least in industrial factory farming --

111
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
they have all these little bits of steak left

112
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that they can't actually sell as steak,

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
so what they do is they glue them all together

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with fibrin from pig blood

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
into this really large sausage,

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices

117
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and sell those as steak again.

118
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
so to get rid of these cloudy elements,

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
what some companies do

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in order to get rid of that cloudiness.

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
There's actually a company in Greece

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that produces these cigarettes

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.

129
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And according to them,

130
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
this creates an artificial lung in the filter.

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.

133
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs --

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
has been used for injecting into wrinkles.

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,

137
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
so the collagen is as well.

138
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is a bullet coming from

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
a very large ammunition company in the United States.

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And while I was making the book,

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I contacted all the producers of products

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because I wanted them to send me the real samples

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the real specimens.

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So I sent this company an email

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And can you send me a bullet?"

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.

150
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But they answered

151
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.

152
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"

153
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I thought that was really weird,

154
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

156
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So, the most beautiful thing I found --

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart valve.

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's actually a very low-tech

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and very high-tech product at the same time.

160
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
mounted in the high-tech bit,

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which is a memory metal casing.

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart

164
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
without open heart surgery.

165
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And once it's in the right spot,

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they remove the outer shell,

167
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It's really a sort of magical moment.

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So this is actually a Dutch company,

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so I called them up, and I asked,

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"

173
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.

174
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,

175
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and you can borrow it."

176
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Great -- and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
so I called,

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And they said, "Well the director of the company

180
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
decided not to let you borrow this heart valve,

181
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because want his product

182
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to be associated with pigs."

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy --

185
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
actually, to show that my first question,

186
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.

187
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else

188
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is made into a fuel

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that can be used as renewable energy source.

190
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
In total, I found 185 products.

191
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And what they showed me

192
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is that, well, firstly,

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
it's at least to say odd

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that we don't treat these pigs

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as absolute kings and queens.

196
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And the second, is that we actually don't have a clue

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of what all these products that surround us are made of.

198
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And you might think I'm very fond of pigs,

199
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but actually -- well, I am a little bit --

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but I'm more fond

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of raw materials in general.

202
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And I think that, in order to take better care

203
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
of what's behind our products --

204
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
so, the livestock, the crops, the plants,

205
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the non-renewable materials,

206
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but also the people that produce these products --

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the first step would actually be to know that they are there.

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Thank you very much.

209
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Applause)

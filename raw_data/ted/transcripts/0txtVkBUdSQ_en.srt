1
0:00:13.674,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A little over 100 years ago, in 1915,

2
0:00:18.038,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Einstein published his theory of general relativity,

3
0:00:21.77,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which is sort of a strange name,

4
0:00:24.028,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but it's a theory that explains gravity.

5
0:00:27.395,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It states that mass -- all matter, the planets -- attracts mass,

6
0:00:31.737,000 --> 0:00:35,000
not because of an instantaneous force, as Newton claimed,

7
0:00:36.375,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but because all matter -- all of us, all the planets --

8
0:00:40.362,000 --> 0:00:44,000
wrinkles the flexible fabric of space-time.

9
0:00:45.128,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Space-time is this thing in which we live and that connects us all.

10
0:00:49.905,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's like when we lie down on a mattress and distort its contour.

11
0:00:55.938,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The masses move -- again, not according to Newton's laws,

12
0:01:00.894,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but because they see this space-time curvature

13
0:01:04.825,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and follow the little curves,

14
0:01:07.672,000 --> 0:01:1,000
just like when our bedmate nestles up to us

15
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because of the mattress curvature.

16
0:01:13.596,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:16.841,000 --> 0:01:18,000
A year later, in 1916,

18
0:01:19.809,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Einstein derived from his theory

19
0:01:24.224,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that gravitational waves existed,

20
0:01:28.061,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and that these waves were produced when masses move,

21
0:01:31.22,000 --> 0:01:35,000
like, for example, when two stars revolve around one another

22
0:01:36.049,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and create folds in space-time which carry energy from the system,

23
0:01:41.033,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and the stars move toward each other.

24
0:01:44.148,000 --> 0:01:46,000
However, he also estimated

25
0:01:47.103,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that these effects were so minute,

26
0:01:51.879,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that it would never be possible to measure them.

27
0:01:55.323,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm going to tell you the story of how,

28
0:01:57.653,000 --> 0:02:03,000
with the work of hundreds of scientists working in many countries

29
0:02:04.137,000 --> 0:02:05,000
over the course of many decades,

30
0:02:05.947,000 --> 0:02:08,000
just recently, in 2015,

31
0:02:09.58,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we discovered those gravitational waves for the first time.

32
0:02:15.542,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's a rather long story.

33
0:02:18.598,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It started 1.3 billion years ago.

34
0:02:25.017,000 --> 0:02:27,000
A long, long time ago,

35
0:02:27.574,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in a galaxy far, far away --

36
0:02:30.789,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:32.606,000 --> 0:02:37,000
two black holes were revolving around one another --

38
0:02:38.249,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"dancing the tango," I like to say.

39
0:02:41.161,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It started slowly,

40
0:02:42.736,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but as they emitted gravitational waves,

41
0:02:45.862,000 --> 0:02:47,000
they grew closer together, accelerating in speed,

42
0:02:48.825,000 --> 0:02:51,000
until, when they were revolving at almost the speed of light,

43
0:02:52.448,000 --> 0:02:55,000
they fused into a single black hole

44
0:02:55.667,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that had 60 times the mass of the Sun,

45
0:02:59.325,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but compressed into the space of 360 kilometers.

46
0:03:03.851,000 --> 0:03:06,000
That's the size of the state of Louisiana,

47
0:03:06.886,000 --> 0:03:07,000
where I live.

48
0:03:08.669,000 --> 0:03:13,000
This incredible effect produced gravitational waves

49
0:03:14.289,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that carried the news of this cosmic hug to the rest of the universe.

50
0:03:21.893,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It took us a long time to figure out the effects of these gravitational waves,

51
0:03:28.827,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because the way we measure them is by looking for effects in distances.

52
0:03:35.59,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We want to measure longitudes, distances.

53
0:03:38.73,000 --> 0:03:41,000
When these gravitational waves passed by Earth,

54
0:03:41.887,000 --> 0:03:43,000
which was in 2015,

55
0:03:44.76,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they produced changes in all distances --

56
0:03:48.815,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the distances between all of you, the distances between you and me,

57
0:03:52.455,000 --> 0:03:53,000
our heights --

58
0:03:53.675,000 --> 0:03:56,000
every one of us stretched and shrank a tiny bit.

59
0:03:58.303,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The prediction is that the effect is proportional to the distance.

60
0:04:02.904,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But it's very small:

61
0:04:04.718,000 --> 0:04:08,000
even for distances much greater than my slight height,

62
0:04:09.6,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the effect is infinitesimal.

63
0:04:13.443,000 --> 0:04:17,000
For example, the distance between the Earth and the Sun

64
0:04:17.965,000 --> 0:04:21,000
changed by one atomic diameter.

65
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:24,000
How can that be measured?

66
0:04:24.902,000 --> 0:04:26,000
How could we measure it?

67
0:04:28.571,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Fifty years ago,

68
0:04:30.953,000 --> 0:04:33,000
some visionary physicists at Caltech and MIT --

69
0:04:35.181,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss --

70
0:04:37.91,000 --> 0:04:41,000
thought they could precisely measure distances

71
0:04:41.98,000 --> 0:04:46,000
using lasers that measured distances between mirrors

72
0:04:47.187,000 --> 0:04:49,000
kilometers apart.

73
0:04:50.478,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It took many years, a lot of work and many scientists

74
0:04:54.522,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to develop the technology and develop the ideas.

75
0:04:57.781,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And 20 years later,

76
0:05:00.112,000 --> 0:05:03,000
almost 30 years ago,

77
0:05:03.164,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they started to build two gravitational wave detectors, two interferometers,

78
0:05:09.201,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in the United States.

79
0:05:11.307,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Each one is four kilometers long;

80
0:05:15.014,000 --> 0:05:19,000
one is in Livingston, Louisiana,

81
0:05:19.636,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in the middle of a beautiful forest,

82
0:05:22.592,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the other is in Hanford, Washington,

83
0:05:26.444,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in the middle of the desert.

84
0:05:29.094,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The interferometers have lasers

85
0:05:32.203,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that travel from the center through four kilometers in-vacuum,

86
0:05:36.153,000 --> 0:05:38,000
are reflected in mirrors and then they return.

87
0:05:39.018,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We measure the difference in the distances

88
0:05:41.686,000 --> 0:05:42,000
between this arm and this arm.

89
0:05:44.546,000 --> 0:05:48,000
These detectors are very, very, very sensitive;

90
0:05:48.771,000 --> 0:05:51,000
they're the most precise instruments in the world.

91
0:05:53.115,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Why did we make two?

92
0:05:54.73,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It's because the signals that we want to measure come from space,

93
0:06:00.353,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but the mirrors are moving all the time,

94
0:06:02.842,000 --> 0:06:06,000
so in order to distinguish the gravitational wave effects --

95
0:06:06.869,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which are astrophysical effects and should show up on the two detectors --

96
0:06:11.237,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we can distinguish them from the local effects,

97
0:06:14.102,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which appear separately, either on one or the other.

98
0:06:19.323,000 --> 0:06:21,000
In September of 2015,

99
0:06:22.099,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we were finishing installing the second-generation technology

100
0:06:27.092,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in the detectors,

101
0:06:29.333,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we still weren't at the optimal sensitivity that we wanted --

102
0:06:33.732,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we're still not, even now, two years later --

103
0:06:37.128,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but we wanted to gather data.

104
0:06:39.679,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We didn't think we'd see anything,

105
0:06:41.719,000 --> 0:06:44,000
but we were getting ready to start collecting a few months' worth of data.

106
0:06:45.924,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And then nature surprised us.

107
0:06:49.454,000 --> 0:06:53,000
On September 14, 2015,

108
0:06:53.761,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we saw, in both detectors,

109
0:06:56.847,000 --> 0:06:58,000
a gravitational wave.

110
0:06:59.05,000 --> 0:07:01,000
In both detectors, we saw a signal

111
0:07:01.546,000 --> 0:07:04,000
with cycles that increased in amplitude and frequency

112
0:07:04.582,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and then go back down.

113
0:07:05.859,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And they were the same in both detectors.

114
0:07:09.315,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They were gravitational waves.

115
0:07:12.028,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And not only that -- in decoding this type of wave,

116
0:07:17.249,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we were able to deduce that they came from black holes

117
0:07:21.281,000 --> 0:07:22,000
fusing together to make one,

118
0:07:23.298,000 --> 0:07:26,000
more than a billion years ago.

119
0:07:27.613,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And that was --

120
0:07:28.82,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Applause)

121
0:07:36.339,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that was fantastic.

122
0:07:38.994,000 --> 0:07:41,000
At first, we couldn't believe it.

123
0:07:42.497,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We didn't imagine this would happen until much later;

124
0:07:46.101,000 --> 0:07:48,000
it was a surprise for all of us.

125
0:07:48.577,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It took us months to convince ourselves that it was true,

126
0:07:51.282,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because we didn't want to leave any room for error.

127
0:07:54.818,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But it was true, and to clear up any doubt

128
0:07:57.835,000 --> 0:08:,000
that the detectors really could measure these things,

129
0:08:00.891,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in December of that same year,

130
0:08:02.809,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we measured another gravitational wave,

131
0:08:05.713,000 --> 0:08:06,000
smaller than the first one.

132
0:08:07.152,000 --> 0:08:1,000
The first gravitational wave produced a difference in the distance

133
0:08:10.989,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of four-thousandths of a proton

134
0:08:14.651,000 --> 0:08:15,000
over four kilometers.

135
0:08:16.01,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Yes, the second detection was smaller,

136
0:08:18.528,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but still very convincing by our standards.

137
0:08:25.064,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Despite the fact that these are space-time waves and not sound waves,

138
0:08:29.612,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we like to put them into loudspeakers and listen to them.

139
0:08:34.315,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We call this "the music of the universe."

140
0:08:37.834,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I'd like you to listen to the first two notes of that music.

141
0:08:43.102,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Chirping sound)

142
0:08:46.448,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Chirping sound)

143
0:08:48.6,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The second, shorter sound was the last fraction of a second

144
0:08:53.49,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of the two black holes which,

145
0:08:55.308,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in that fraction of a second, emitted vast amounts of energy --

146
0:09:00.262,000 --> 0:09:06,000
so much energy, it was like three Suns converting into energy,

147
0:09:06.937,000 --> 0:09:07,000
following that famous formula,

148
0:09:08.537,000 --> 0:09:09,000
E = mc2.

149
0:09:10.318,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Remember that one?

150
0:09:12.473,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We love this music so much we actually dance to it.

151
0:09:18.031,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I'm going to have you listen again.

152
0:09:22.546,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Chirping sound)

153
0:09:26.558,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Chirping sound)

154
0:09:29.303,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It's the music of the universe!

155
0:09:31.327,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Applause)

156
0:09:35.017,000 --> 0:09:38,000
People frequently ask me now:

157
0:09:38.163,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"What can gravitational waves be used for?

158
0:09:41.455,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And now that you've discovered them, what else is there left to do?"

159
0:09:46.39,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What can gravitational waves be used for?

160
0:09:50.034,000 --> 0:09:54,000
When they asked Borges, "What is the purpose of poetry?"

161
0:09:54.376,000 --> 0:09:55,000
he, in turn, answered,

162
0:09:56.241,000 --> 0:09:57,000
"What's the purpose of dawn?

163
0:09:57.961,000 --> 0:09:59,000
What's the purpose of caresses?

164
0:09:59.985,000 --> 0:10:01,000
What's the purpose of the smell of coffee?"

165
0:10:02.58,000 --> 0:10:03,000
He answered,

166
0:10:04.448,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"The purpose of poetry is pleasure; it's for emotion, it's for living."

167
0:10:11.769,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And understanding the universe,

168
0:10:13.457,000 --> 0:10:16,000
this human curiosity for knowing how everything works,

169
0:10:17.131,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is similar.

170
0:10:19.177,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Since time immemorial, humanity -- all of us, everyone, as kids --

171
0:10:24.66,000 --> 0:10:27,000
when we look up at the sky for the first time and see the stars,

172
0:10:28.553,000 --> 0:10:29,000
we wonder,

173
0:10:29.74,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"What are stars?"

174
0:10:31.847,000 --> 0:10:33,000
That curiosity is what makes us human.

175
0:10:35.174,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And that's what we do with science.

176
0:10:39.856,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We like to say that gravitational waves now have a purpose,

177
0:10:45.64,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because we're opening up a new way to explore the universe.

178
0:10:49.847,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Until now, we were able to see the light of the stars

179
0:10:54.15,000 --> 0:10:56,000
via electromagnetic waves.

180
0:10:57.168,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Now we can listen to the sound of the universe,

181
0:11:01.768,000 --> 0:11:04,000
even of things that don't emit light, like gravitational waves.

182
0:11:07.667,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Applause)

183
0:11:08.955,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Thank you.

184
0:11:10.131,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Applause)

185
0:11:13.556,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But are they useful?

186
0:11:16.325,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Can't we derive any technology from gravitational waves?

187
0:11:21.507,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Yes, probably.

188
0:11:23.04,000 --> 0:11:25,000
But it will probably take a lot of time.

189
0:11:25.652,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We've developed the technology to detect them,

190
0:11:28.34,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but in terms of the waves themselves,

191
0:11:30.401,000 --> 0:11:34,000
maybe we'll discover 100 years from now that they are useful.

192
0:11:34.685,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But it takes a lot of time to derive technology from science,

193
0:11:38.763,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and that's not why we do it.

194
0:11:40.373,000 --> 0:11:42,000
All technology is derived from science,

195
0:11:42.672,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but we practice science for the enjoyment.

196
0:11:46.64,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What's left to do?

197
0:11:49.386,000 --> 0:11:5,000
A lot.

198
0:11:50.851,000 --> 0:11:52,000
A lot; this is only the beginning.

199
0:11:54.613,000 --> 0:11:57,000
As we make the detectors more and more sensitive --

200
0:11:57.731,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and we have lots of work to do there --

201
0:11:59.672,000 --> 0:12:01,000
not only are we going to see more black holes

202
0:12:01.941,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and be able to catalog how many there are, where they are

203
0:12:06.269,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and how big they are,

204
0:12:07.865,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we'll also be able to see other objects.

205
0:12:11.296,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We'll see neutron stars fuse and turn into black holes.

206
0:12:16.913,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We'll see a black holes being born.

207
0:12:19.536,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We'll be able to see rotating stars in our galaxy

208
0:12:22.698,000 --> 0:12:24,000
produce sinusoidal waves.

209
0:12:24.93,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We'll be able to see explosions of supernovas in our galaxy.

210
0:12:30.792,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We'll be seeing a whole spectrum of new sources.

211
0:12:35.641,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We like to say

212
0:12:37.637,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that we've added a new sense to the human body:

213
0:12:41.262,000 --> 0:12:42,000
now, in addition to seeing,

214
0:12:42.984,000 --> 0:12:44,000
we're able to hear.

215
0:12:45.101,000 --> 0:12:48,000
This is a revolution in astronomy,

216
0:12:48.672,000 --> 0:12:51,000
like when Galileo invented the telescope.

217
0:12:52.859,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It's like when they added sound to silent movies.

218
0:12:57.11,000 --> 0:12:59,000
This is just the beginning.

219
0:13:01.12,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We like to think

220
0:13:03.5,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that the road to science is very long -- very fun, but very long --

221
0:13:09.791,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and that we, this large, international community of scientists,

222
0:13:16.178,000 --> 0:13:18,000
working from many countries, together as a team,

223
0:13:18.762,000 --> 0:13:2,000
are helping to build that road;

224
0:13:22.048,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that we're shedding light -- sometimes encountering detours --

225
0:13:26.488,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and building, perhaps,

226
0:13:28.915,000 --> 0:13:3,000
a highway to the universe.

227
0:13:31.931,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Thank you.

228
0:13:33.13,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Applause)

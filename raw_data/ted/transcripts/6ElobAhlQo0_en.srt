1
0:00:13.388,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Alright, let me tell you about building synthetic cells

2
0:00:16.587,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and printing life.

3
0:00:18.556,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But first, let me tell you a quick story.

4
0:00:21.063,000 --> 0:00:23,000
On March 31, 2013,

5
0:00:23.593,000 --> 0:00:27,000
my team and I received an email from an international health organization,

6
0:00:27.8,000 --> 0:00:29,000
alerting us that two men died in China

7
0:00:30.657,000 --> 0:00:33,000
shortly after contracting the H7N9 bird flu.

8
0:00:34.149,000 --> 0:00:35,000
There were fears of a global pandemic

9
0:00:36.03,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as the virus started rapidly moving across China.

10
0:00:40.004,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Although methods existed to produce a flu vaccine

11
0:00:42.81,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and stop the disease from spreading,

12
0:00:44.806,000 --> 0:00:47,000
at best, it would not be available for at least six months.

13
0:00:49.474,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is because a slow, antiquated flu vaccine manufacturing process

14
0:00:54.228,000 --> 0:00:57,000
developed over 70 years ago was the only option.

15
0:00:59.14,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The virus would need to be isolated from infected patients,

16
0:01:02.616,000 --> 0:01:04,000
packaged up and then sent to a facility

17
0:01:04.934,000 --> 0:01:08,000
where scientists would inject the virus into chicken eggs,

18
0:01:08.974,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and incubate those chicken eggs for several weeks

19
0:01:11.569,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in order to prepare the virus for the start of a multistep,

20
0:01:15.315,000 --> 0:01:18,000
multimonth flu vaccine manufacturing process.

21
0:01:19.363,000 --> 0:01:2,000
My team and I received this email

22
0:01:21.381,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because we had just invented a biological printer,

23
0:01:25.291,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which would allow for the flu vaccine instructions

24
0:01:27.736,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to be instantly downloaded from the internet and printed.

25
0:01:31.633,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Drastically speeding up the way in which flu vaccines are made,

26
0:01:34.943,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and potentially saving thousands of lives.

27
0:01:38.776,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The biological printer leverages our ability to read and write DNA

28
0:01:43.774,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and starts to bring into focus

29
0:01:45.768,000 --> 0:01:48,000
what we like to call biological teleportation.

30
0:01:49.704,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I am a biologist and an engineer who builds stuff out of DNA.

31
0:01:54.577,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Believe it or not, one of my favorite things to do

32
0:01:56.95,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is to take DNA apart and put it back together

33
0:01:59.351,000 --> 0:02:01,000
so that I can understand better how it works.

34
0:02:02.442,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I can edit and program DNA to do things, just like coders programing a computer.

35
0:02:07.797,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But my apps are different.

36
0:02:09.622,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They create life.

37
0:02:10.892,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Self-replicating living cells and things like vaccines and therapeutics

38
0:02:15.188,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that work in ways that were previously impossible.

39
0:02:19.141,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Here's National Medal of Science recipient Craig Venter

40
0:02:22.466,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and Nobel laureate Ham Smith.

41
0:02:25.038,000 --> 0:02:27,000
These two guys shared a similar vision.

42
0:02:27.371,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That vision was, because all of the functions and characteristics

43
0:02:31.792,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of all biological entities, including viruses and living cells,

44
0:02:35.973,000 --> 0:02:37,000
are written into the code of DNA,

45
0:02:38.427,000 --> 0:02:41,000
if one can read and write that code of DNA,

46
0:02:41.847,000 --> 0:02:44,000
then they can be reconstructed in a distant location.

47
0:02:46.043,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This is what we mean by biological teleportation.

48
0:02:50.21,000 --> 0:02:51,000
To prove out this vision,

49
0:02:51.576,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Craig and Ham set a goal of creating, for the first time,

50
0:02:54.593,000 --> 0:02:57,000
a synthetic cell, starting from DNA code in the computer.

51
0:02:58.284,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I mean, come on, as a scientist looking for a job,

52
0:03:03.165,000 --> 0:03:06,000
doing cutting-edge research, it doesn't get any better than this.

53
0:03:06.252,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:08.035,000 --> 0:03:12,000
OK, a genome is a complete set of DNA within an organism.

55
0:03:13.138,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Following the Human Genome Project in 2003,

56
0:03:15.871,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which was an international effort to identify

57
0:03:18.094,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the complete genetic blueprint of a human being,

58
0:03:21.276,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a genomics revolution happened.

59
0:03:23.553,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Scientists started mastering the techniques for reading DNA.

60
0:03:27.269,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In order to determine the order of the As, Cs, Ts and Gs

61
0:03:30.587,000 --> 0:03:31,000
within an organism.

62
0:03:32.475,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But my job was far different.

63
0:03:34.412,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I needed to master the techniques for writing DNA.

64
0:03:37.442,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Like an author of a book,

65
0:03:38.736,000 --> 0:03:4,000
this started out as writing short sentences,

66
0:03:40.942,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or sequences of DNA code,

67
0:03:43.069,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but this soon turned into writing paragraphs

68
0:03:45.371,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and then full-on novels of DNA code,

69
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to make important biological instructions for proteins and living cells.

70
0:03:52.466,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Living cells are nature's most efficient machines at making new products,

71
0:03:55.99,000 --> 0:03:56,000
accounting for the production

72
0:03:57.673,000 --> 0:04:,000
of 25 percent of the total pharmaceutical market,

73
0:04:01.268,000 --> 0:04:02,000
which is billions of dollars.

74
0:04:03.823,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We knew that writing DNA would drive this bioeconomy even more,

75
0:04:07.728,000 --> 0:04:1,000
once cells could be programmed just like computers.

76
0:04:11.339,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We also knew that writing DNA would enable biological teleportation ...

77
0:04:17.186,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the printing of defined, biological material,

78
0:04:20.118,000 --> 0:04:21,000
starting from DNA code.

79
0:04:22.575,000 --> 0:04:24,000
As a step toward bringing these promises to fruition,

80
0:04:25.561,000 --> 0:04:27,000
our team set out to create, for the first time,

81
0:04:28.307,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a synthetic bacterial cell,

82
0:04:30.569,000 --> 0:04:32,000
starting from DNA code in the computer.

83
0:04:33.918,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Synthetic DNA is a commodity.

84
0:04:36.069,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You can order very short pieces of DNA from a number of companies,

85
0:04:39.704,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and they will start from these four bottles of chemicals that make up DNA,

86
0:04:43.395,000 --> 0:04:44,000
G, A, T and C,

87
0:04:44.864,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they will build those very short pieces of DNA for you.

88
0:04:48.986,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Over the past 15 years or so,

89
0:04:50.843,000 --> 0:04:52,000
my teams have been developing the technology

90
0:04:53.19,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for stitching together those short pieces of DNA

91
0:04:55.97,000 --> 0:04:57,000
into complete bacterial genomes.

92
0:04:58.871,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The largest genome that we constructed contained over one million letters.

93
0:05:03.942,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Which is more than twice the size of your average novel,

94
0:05:06.626,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and we had to put every single one of those letters in the correct order,

95
0:05:10.093,000 --> 0:05:11,000
without a single typo.

96
0:05:11.386,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We were able to accomplish this by developing a procedure

97
0:05:15.703,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that I tried to call the "one-step isothermal in vitro recombination method."

98
0:05:20.774,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:22.887,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But, surprisingly, the science community didn't like this technically accurate name

100
0:05:27.903,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and decided to call it Gibson Assembly.

101
0:05:31.625,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Gibson Assembly is now the gold standard tool,

102
0:05:34.506,000 --> 0:05:36,000
used in laboratories around the world

103
0:05:36.998,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for building short and long pieces of DNA.

104
0:05:40.236,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Applause)

105
0:05:45.593,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Once we chemically synthesized the complete bacterial genome,

106
0:05:48.942,000 --> 0:05:5,000
our next challenge was to find a way

107
0:05:51.276,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to convert it into a free-living, self-replicating cell.

108
0:05:55.427,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Our approach was to think of the genome as the operating system of the cell,

109
0:05:59.276,000 --> 0:06:03,000
with the cell containing the hardware necessary to boot up the genome.

110
0:06:04.553,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Through a lot of trial and error,

111
0:06:06.196,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we developed a procedure where we could reprogram cells

112
0:06:09.355,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and even convert one bacterial species into another,

113
0:06:12.728,000 --> 0:06:15,000
by replacing the genome of one cell with that of another.

114
0:06:17.363,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This genome transplantation technology then paved the way

115
0:06:21.451,000 --> 0:06:24,000
for the booting-up of genomes written by scientists

116
0:06:24.704,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and not by Mother Nature.

117
0:06:26.768,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In 2010, all of the technologies

118
0:06:29.411,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that we had been developing for reading and writing DNA

119
0:06:32.22,000 --> 0:06:34,000
all came together when we announced the creation

120
0:06:35.165,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of the first synthetic cell,

121
0:06:37.403,000 --> 0:06:39,000
which of course, we called Synthia.

122
0:06:39.585,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:41.61,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Ever since the first bacterial genome was sequenced, back in 1995,

124
0:06:46.214,000 --> 0:06:49,000
thousands more whole bacterial genomes have been sequenced and stored

125
0:06:49.697,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in computer databases.

126
0:06:51.601,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Our synthetic cell work was the proof of concept

127
0:06:54.012,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that we could reverse this process:

128
0:06:56.046,000 --> 0:06:59,000
pull a complete bacterial genome sequence out of the computer

129
0:06:59.665,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and convert that information into a free-living, self-replicating cell,

130
0:07:04.45,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with all of the expected characteristics of the species that we constructed.

131
0:07:10.409,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Now I can understand why there may be concerns

132
0:07:12.982,000 --> 0:07:15,000
about the safety of this level of genetic manipulation.

133
0:07:16.918,000 --> 0:07:2,000
While the technology has the potential for great societal benefit,

134
0:07:21.093,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it also has the potential for doing harm.

135
0:07:24.355,000 --> 0:07:28,000
With this in mind, even before carrying out the very first experiment,

136
0:07:28.442,000 --> 0:07:3,000
our team started to work with the public and the government

137
0:07:31.331,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to find solutions together

138
0:07:33.958,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to responsibly develop and regulate this new technology.

139
0:07:38.331,000 --> 0:07:41,000
One of the outcomes from those discussions was to screen every customer

140
0:07:42.157,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and every customer's DNA synthesis orders,

141
0:07:44.776,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to make sure that pathogens or toxins are not being made by bad guys,

142
0:07:49.696,000 --> 0:07:5,000
or accidentally by scientists.

143
0:07:52.974,000 --> 0:07:55,000
All suspicious orders are reported to the FBI

144
0:07:56.386,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and other relevant law-enforcement agencies.

145
0:08:00.641,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Synthetic cell technologies will power the next industrial revolution

146
0:08:04.935,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and transform industries and economies

147
0:08:07.823,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in ways that address global sustainability challenges.

148
0:08:12.006,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The possibilities are endless.

149
0:08:14.236,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I mean, you can think of clothes

150
0:08:15.848,000 --> 0:08:18,000
constructed form renewable biobased sources,

151
0:08:19.569,000 --> 0:08:22,000
cars running on biofuel from engineered microbes,

152
0:08:23.244,000 --> 0:08:26,000
plastics made from biodegradable polymers

153
0:08:26.847,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and customized therapies, printed at a patient's bedside.

154
0:08:31.196,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The massive efforts to create synthetic cells

155
0:08:33.807,000 --> 0:08:35,000
have made us world leaders at writing DNA.

156
0:08:37.149,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Throughout the process, we found ways to write DNA faster,

157
0:08:40.895,000 --> 0:08:42,000
more accurately and more reliably.

158
0:08:43.688,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Because of the robustness of these technologies,

159
0:08:46.006,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we found that we could readily automate the processes

160
0:08:49.03,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and move the laboratory workflows out of the scientist's hands

161
0:08:52.72,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and onto a machine.

162
0:08:55.004,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In 2013, we built the first DNA printer.

163
0:08:58.631,000 --> 0:09:,000
We call it the BioXp.

164
0:09:00.964,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And it has been absolutely essential in writing DNA

165
0:09:04.184,000 --> 0:09:05,000
across a number of applications

166
0:09:05.823,000 --> 0:09:08,000
my team and researchers around the world are working on.

167
0:09:10.077,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It was shortly after we built the BioXp

168
0:09:12.118,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that we received that email about the H7N9 bird flu scare in China.

169
0:09:17.498,000 --> 0:09:2,000
A team of Chinese scientists had already isolated the virus,

170
0:09:20.943,000 --> 0:09:23,000
sequenced its DNA and uploaded the DNA sequence to the internet.

171
0:09:25.616,000 --> 0:09:28,000
At the request of the US government, we downloaded the DNA sequence

172
0:09:29.155,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and in less than 12 hours, we printed it on the BioXp.

173
0:09:33.529,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Our collaborators at Novartis

174
0:09:35.131,000 --> 0:09:39,000
then quickly started turning that synthetic DNA into a flu vaccine.

175
0:09:39.497,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Meanwhile, the CDC, using technology dating back to the 1940s,

176
0:09:44.051,000 --> 0:09:46,000
was still waiting for the virus to arrive from China

177
0:09:47.005,000 --> 0:09:49,000
so that they could begin their egg-based approach.

178
0:09:50.234,000 --> 0:09:53,000
For the first time, we had a flu vaccine developed ahead of time

179
0:09:53.807,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for a new and potentially dangerous strain,

180
0:09:56.3,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and the US government ordered a stockpile.

181
0:09:58.965,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

182
0:10:04.617,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This was when I began to appreciate, more than ever,

183
0:10:07.109,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the power of biological teleportation.

184
0:10:09.887,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

185
0:10:11.061,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Naturally, with this in mind,

186
0:10:13.173,000 --> 0:10:15,000
we started to build a biological teleporter.

187
0:10:16.402,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We call it the DBC.

188
0:10:18.615,000 --> 0:10:21,000
That's short for digital-to-biological converter.

189
0:10:22.267,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Unlike the BioXp,

190
0:10:23.625,000 --> 0:10:26,000
which starts from pre-manufactured short pieces of DNA,

191
0:10:26.728,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the DBC starts from digitized DNA code

192
0:10:29.855,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and converts that DNA code into biological entities,

193
0:10:32.934,000 --> 0:10:35,000
such as DNA, RNA, proteins or even viruses.

194
0:10:37.188,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You can think of the BioXp as a DVD player,

195
0:10:40.085,000 --> 0:10:43,000
requiring a physical DVD to be inserted,

196
0:10:43.157,000 --> 0:10:45,000
whereas the DBC is Netflix.

197
0:10:47.974,000 --> 0:10:48,000
To build the DBC,

198
0:10:49.23,000 --> 0:10:53,000
my team of scientists worked with software and instrumentation engineers

199
0:10:54.103,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to collapse multiple laboratory workflows,

200
0:10:56.895,000 --> 0:10:57,000
all in a single box.

201
0:10:58.696,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This included software algorithms to predict what DNA to build,

202
0:11:02.601,000 --> 0:11:06,000
chemistry to link the G, A, T and C building blocks of DNA into short pieces,

203
0:11:07.077,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Gibson Assembly to stitch together those short pieces into much longer ones,

204
0:11:11.379,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and biology to convert the DNA into other biological entities,

205
0:11:14.962,000 --> 0:11:15,000
such as proteins.

206
0:11:17.089,000 --> 0:11:18,000
This is the prototype.

207
0:11:18.74,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Although it wasn't pretty, it was effective.

208
0:11:20.954,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It made therapeutic drugs and vaccines.

209
0:11:23.271,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And laboratory workflows that once took weeks or months

210
0:11:27.069,000 --> 0:11:3,000
could now be carried out in just one to two days.

211
0:11:30.641,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And that's all without any human intervention

212
0:11:33.252,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and simply activated by the receipt of an email

213
0:11:35.867,000 --> 0:11:37,000
which could be sent from anywhere in the world.

214
0:11:39.069,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We like to compare the DBC to fax machines.

215
0:11:43.016,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But whereas fax machines received images and documents,

216
0:11:46.405,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the DBC receives biological materials.

217
0:11:50.024,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now, consider how fax machines have evolved.

218
0:11:53.553,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The prototype of the 1840s is unrecognizable,

219
0:11:56.76,000 --> 0:11:58,000
compared with the fax machines of today.

220
0:11:59.958,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In the 1980s, most people still didn't know what a fax machine was,

221
0:12:03.792,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and if they did,

222
0:12:05.212,000 --> 0:12:07,000
it was difficult for them to grasp the concept

223
0:12:07.595,000 --> 0:12:1,000
of instantly reproducing an image on the other side of the world.

224
0:12:11.672,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But nowadays, everything that a fax machine does

225
0:12:13.99,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is integrated on our smart phones,

226
0:12:15.689,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and of course, we take this rapid exchange of digital information for granted.

227
0:12:20.831,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Here's what our DBC looks like today.

228
0:12:23.307,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We imagine the DBC evolving in similar ways as fax machines have.

229
0:12:28.212,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We're working to reduce the size of the instrument,

230
0:12:30.863,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and we're working to make the underlying technology

231
0:12:33.506,000 --> 0:12:36,000
more reliable, cheaper, faster and more accurate.

232
0:12:38.061,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Accuracy is extremely important when synthesizing DNA,

233
0:12:41.847,000 --> 0:12:43,000
because a single change to a DNA letter

234
0:12:43.887,000 --> 0:12:46,000
could mean the difference between a medicine working or not

235
0:12:46.935,000 --> 0:12:48,000
or synthetic cell being alive or dead.

236
0:12:50.292,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The DBC will be useful for the distributed manufacturing

237
0:12:53.776,000 --> 0:12:55,000
of medicine starting from DNA.

238
0:12:56.649,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Every hospital in the world could use a DBC

239
0:12:59.436,000 --> 0:13:02,000
for printing personalized medicines for a patient at their bedside.

240
0:13:03.846,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I can even imagine a day when it's routine for people to have a DBC

241
0:13:08.88,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to connect to their home computer or smart phone

242
0:13:11.173,000 --> 0:13:13,000
as a means to download their prescriptions,

243
0:13:13.212,000 --> 0:13:15,000
such as insulin or antibody therapies.

244
0:13:15.355,000 --> 0:13:19,000
The DBC will also be valuable when placed in strategic areas around the world,

245
0:13:19.832,000 --> 0:13:21,000
for rapid response to disease outbreaks.

246
0:13:22.879,000 --> 0:13:25,000
For example, the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia

247
0:13:26.006,000 --> 0:13:3,000
could send flu vaccine instructions to a DBC on the other side of the world,

248
0:13:30.823,000 --> 0:13:33,000
where the flu vaccine is manufactured right on the front lines.

249
0:13:35.085,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That flu vaccine could even be specifically tailored to the flu strain

250
0:13:40.339,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that's circulating in that local area.

251
0:13:43.585,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Sending vaccines around in a digital file,

252
0:13:46.101,000 --> 0:13:49,000
rather than stockpiling those same vaccines and shipping them out,

253
0:13:49.942,000 --> 0:13:51,000
promises to save thousands of lives.

254
0:13:53.212,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Of course, the applications go as far as the imagination goes.

255
0:13:58.164,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It's not hard to imagine placing a DBC on another planet.

256
0:14:03.315,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Scientists on Earth could then send the digital instructions to that DBC

257
0:14:08.443,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to make new medicines or to make synthetic organisms

258
0:14:12.474,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that produce oxygen, food, fuel or building materials,

259
0:14:16.165,000 --> 0:14:19,000
as a means for making the planet more habitable for humans.

260
0:14:20.002,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

261
0:14:24.466,000 --> 0:14:27,000
With digital information traveling at the speed of light,

262
0:14:27.831,000 --> 0:14:29,000
it would only take minutes to send those digital instructions

263
0:14:30.752,000 --> 0:14:31,000
from Earth to Mars,

264
0:14:31.966,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but it would take months to physically deliver those same samples

265
0:14:35.839,000 --> 0:14:36,000
on a spacecraft.

266
0:14:37.821,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But for now, I would be satisfied beaming new medicines across the globe,

267
0:14:42.448,000 --> 0:14:44,000
fully automated and on demand,

268
0:14:44.662,000 --> 0:14:47,000
saving lives from emerging infectious diseases

269
0:14:48.284,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and printing personalized cancer medicines for those who don't have time to wait.

270
0:14:53.06,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Thank you.

271
0:14:54.259,000 --> 0:15:01,000
(Applause)

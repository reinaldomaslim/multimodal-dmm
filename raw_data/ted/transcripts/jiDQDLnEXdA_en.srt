1
0:00:12.901,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Your company launches a search for an open position.

2
0:00:16.848,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The applications start rolling in,

3
0:00:19.238,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and the qualified candidates are identified.

4
0:00:22.613,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now the choosing begins.

5
0:00:25.78,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Person A: Ivy League, 4.0, flawless resume,

6
0:00:31.482,000 --> 0:00:32,000
great recommendations.

7
0:00:33.39,000 --> 0:00:34,000
All the right stuff.

8
0:00:35.784,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Person B: state school, fair amount of job hopping,

9
0:00:40.809,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress.

10
0:00:45.785,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But remember -- both are qualified.

11
0:00:49.648,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I ask you:

12
0:00:51.188,000 --> 0:00:53,000
who are you going to pick?

13
0:00:53.985,000 --> 0:00:56,000
My colleagues and I created very official terms

14
0:00:57.575,000 --> 0:01:,000
to describe two distinct categories of candidates.

15
0:01:01.731,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We call A "the Silver Spoon,"

16
0:01:05.338,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success.

17
0:01:10.415,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And we call B "the Scrapper,"

18
0:01:13.862,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the one who had to fight against tremendous odds

19
0:01:16.958,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to get to the same point.

20
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
You just heard a human resources director refer to people

21
0:01:23.764,000 --> 0:01:24,000
as Silver Spoons and Scrappers --

22
0:01:25.512,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:26.537,000 --> 0:01:3,000
which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental.

24
0:01:30.94,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But before my human resources certification gets revoked --

25
0:01:35.364,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:36.508,000 --> 0:01:37,000
let me explain.

27
0:01:38.73,000 --> 0:01:4,000
A resume tells a story.

28
0:01:41.087,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And over the years, I've learned something about people

29
0:01:44.441,000 --> 0:01:47,000
whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt,

30
0:01:47.684,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that makes me stop and fully consider them

31
0:01:51.184,000 --> 0:01:53,000
before tossing their resumes away.

32
0:01:54.698,000 --> 0:01:56,000
A series of odd jobs may indicate

33
0:01:57.139,000 --> 0:02:01,000
inconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability.

34
0:02:02.089,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Or it may signal a committed struggle against obstacles.

35
0:02:07.455,000 --> 0:02:11,000
At the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview.

36
0:02:12.671,000 --> 0:02:13,000
To be clear,

37
0:02:14.186,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon;

38
0:02:17.463,000 --> 0:02:2,000
getting into and graduating from an elite university

39
0:02:20.953,000 --> 0:02:22,000
takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice.

40
0:02:24.397,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But if your whole life has been engineered toward success,

41
0:02:28.388,000 --> 0:02:3,000
how will you handle the tough times?

42
0:02:31.2,000 --> 0:02:35,000
One person I hired felt that because he attended an elite university,

43
0:02:35.648,000 --> 0:02:37,000
there were certain assignments that were beneath him,

44
0:02:38.535,000 --> 0:02:43,000
like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation.

45
0:02:44.505,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Eventually, he quit.

46
0:02:47.553,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But on the flip side,

47
0:02:50.022,000 --> 0:02:54,000
what happens when your whole life is destined for failure

48
0:02:54.73,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and you actually succeed?

49
0:02:57.832,000 --> 0:03:,000
I want to urge you to interview the Scrapper.

50
0:03:02.626,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper.

51
0:03:07.618,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Before I was born,

52
0:03:09.168,000 --> 0:03:12,000
my father was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia,

53
0:03:13.155,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his brilliance.

54
0:03:17.599,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest,"

55
0:03:20.971,000 --> 0:03:22,000
one part "Awakenings"

56
0:03:23.061,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and one part "A Beautiful Mind."

57
0:03:25.509,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:28.921,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother

59
0:03:32.458,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in a rough neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.

60
0:03:35.306,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We never owned a home, a car, a washing machine,

61
0:03:40.086,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and for most of my childhood, we didn't even have a telephone.

62
0:03:45.035,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So I was highly motivated

63
0:03:46.485,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to understand the relationship between business success and Scrappers,

64
0:03:50.888,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because my life could easily have turned out very differently.

65
0:03:56.598,000 --> 0:03:58,000
As I met successful business people

66
0:03:58.878,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and read profiles of high-powered leaders,

67
0:04:02.224,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I noticed some commonality.

68
0:04:04.692,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Many of them had experienced early hardships,

69
0:04:08.642,000 --> 0:04:11,000
anywhere from poverty, abandonment,

70
0:04:12.235,000 --> 0:04:14,000
death of a parent while young,

71
0:04:14.465,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to learning disabilities, alcoholism and violence.

72
0:04:18.935,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The conventional thinking has been that trauma leads to distress,

73
0:04:23.195,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction.

74
0:04:26.658,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight:

75
0:04:32.159,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that even the worst circumstances can result in growth and transformation.

76
0:04:38.415,000 --> 0:04:41,000
A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered,

77
0:04:42.271,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which scientists call Post Traumatic Growth.

78
0:04:47.494,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity

79
0:04:50.694,000 --> 0:04:51,000
on children at risk,

80
0:04:52.676,000 --> 0:04:56,000
among a subset of 698 children

81
0:04:57.273,000 --> 0:05:01,000
who experienced the most severe and extreme conditions,

82
0:05:01.582,000 --> 0:05:07,000
fully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive lives.

83
0:05:08.476,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded.

84
0:05:13.665,000 --> 0:05:14,000
One-third.

85
0:05:15.948,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Take this resume.

86
0:05:17.649,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This guy's parents give him up for adoption.

87
0:05:20.783,000 --> 0:05:22,000
He never finishes college.

88
0:05:23.514,000 --> 0:05:25,000
He job-hops quite a bit,

89
0:05:25.672,000 --> 0:05:28,000
goes on a sojourn to India for a year,

90
0:05:28.801,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and to top it off, he has dyslexia.

91
0:05:32.43,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Would you hire this guy?

92
0:05:34.918,000 --> 0:05:36,000
His name is Steve Jobs.

93
0:05:38.424,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In a study of the world's most highly successful entrepreneurs,

94
0:05:42.426,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia.

95
0:05:46.795,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In the US,

96
0:05:48.213,000 --> 0:05:51,000
35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia.

97
0:05:52.681,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What's remarkable -- among those entrepreneurs

98
0:05:56.729,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who experience post traumatic growth,

99
0:05:59.76,000 --> 0:06:02,000
they now view their learning disability

100
0:06:03.063,000 --> 0:06:07,000
as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage

101
0:06:07.531,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because they became better listeners and paid greater attention to detail.

102
0:06:13.183,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity,

103
0:06:18.294,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they know they are who they are because of adversity.

104
0:06:23.028,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They embrace their trauma and hardships

105
0:06:25.406,000 --> 0:06:27,000
as key elements of who they've become,

106
0:06:28.066,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and know that without those experiences,

107
0:06:31.367,000 --> 0:06:34,000
they might not have developed the muscle and grit required

108
0:06:34.797,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to become successful.

109
0:06:38.034,000 --> 0:06:41,000
One of my colleagues had his life completely upended

110
0:06:41.341,000 --> 0:06:45,000
as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966.

111
0:06:46.568,000 --> 0:06:51,000
At age 13, his parents were relocated to the countryside,

112
0:06:51.753,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the schools were closed

113
0:06:54.078,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and he was left alone in Beijing to fend for himself until 16,

114
0:06:59.328,000 --> 0:07:01,000
when he got a job in a clothing factory.

115
0:07:01.983,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But instead of accepting his fate,

116
0:07:04.289,000 --> 0:07:08,000
he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education.

117
0:07:09.652,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Eleven years later, when the political landscape changed,

118
0:07:13.367,000 --> 0:07:17,000
he heard about a highly selective university admissions test.

119
0:07:18.383,000 --> 0:07:21,000
He had three months to learn the entire curriculum

120
0:07:22.287,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of middle and high school.

121
0:07:24.605,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So, every day he came home from the factory,

122
0:07:28.786,000 --> 0:07:32,000
took a nap, studied until 4am, went back to work

123
0:07:33.499,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and repeated this cycle every day for three months.

124
0:07:38.394,000 --> 0:07:4,000
He did it, he succeeded.

125
0:07:41.619,000 --> 0:07:46,000
His commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope.

126
0:07:47.281,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Today, he holds a master's degree,

127
0:07:50.241,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard.

128
0:07:55.478,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Scrappers are propelled by the belief

129
0:07:58.179,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that the only person you have full control over is yourself.

130
0:08:03.647,000 --> 0:08:04,000
When things don't turn out well,

131
0:08:05.667,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a better result?"

132
0:08:11.099,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Scrappers have a sense of purpose

133
0:08:13.058,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that prevents them from giving up on themselves,

134
0:08:16.188,000 --> 0:08:22,000
kind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings,

135
0:08:22.244,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you figure, "Business challenges? --

136
0:08:25.013,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:26.069,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Really?

138
0:08:27.481,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Piece of cake. I got this."

139
0:08:29.681,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

140
0:08:30.866,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And that reminds me -- humor.

141
0:08:33.418,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times,

142
0:08:36.864,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and laughter helps you change your perspective.

143
0:08:40.151,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And finally, there are relationships.

144
0:08:43.412,000 --> 0:08:46,000
People who overcome adversity don't do it alone.

145
0:08:47.349,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Somewhere along the way,

146
0:08:49.19,000 --> 0:08:52,000
they find people who bring out the best in them

147
0:08:52.65,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and who are invested in their success.

148
0:08:56.312,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Having someone you can count on no matter what

149
0:08:59.6,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is essential to overcoming adversity.

150
0:09:02.862,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I was lucky.

151
0:09:04.703,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In my first job after college,

152
0:09:06.707,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges

153
0:09:09.861,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with a woman who was the president's assistant.

154
0:09:13.145,000 --> 0:09:14,000
She watched me work

155
0:09:14.821,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and encouraged me to focus on my future

156
0:09:17.822,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and not dwell on my past.

157
0:09:20.668,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Along the way I've met many people

158
0:09:23.661,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who've provided me brutally honest feedback,

159
0:09:27.336,000 --> 0:09:28,000
advice and mentorship.

160
0:09:29.933,000 --> 0:09:3,000
These people don't mind

161
0:09:31.794,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that I once worked as a singing waitress to help pay for college.

162
0:09:36.061,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

163
0:09:37.331,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I'll leave you with one final, valuable insight.

164
0:09:40.915,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Companies that are committed to diversity and inclusive practices

165
0:09:45.912,000 --> 0:09:47,000
tend to support Scrappers

166
0:09:48.04,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and outperform their peers.

167
0:09:51.479,000 --> 0:09:53,000
According to DiversityInc,

168
0:09:54.127,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a study of their top 50 companies for diversity

169
0:09:57.969,000 --> 0:10:01,000
outperformed the S&P 500 by 25 percent.

170
0:10:04.203,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So back to my original question.

171
0:10:08.34,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Who are you going to bet on:

172
0:10:10.449,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Silver Spoon or Scrapper?

173
0:10:13.73,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I say choose the underestimated contender,

174
0:10:17.539,000 --> 0:10:2,000
whose secret weapons are passion and purpose.

175
0:10:22.321,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Hire the Scrapper.

176
0:10:24.413,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Applause)

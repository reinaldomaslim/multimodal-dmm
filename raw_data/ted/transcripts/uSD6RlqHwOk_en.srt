1
0:00:13.315,000 --> 0:00:16,000
How many times have you used the word "awesome" today?

2
0:00:16.362,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Once? Twice? Seventeen times?

3
0:00:20.497,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Do you remember what you were describing

4
0:00:21.863,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when you used the word?

5
0:00:23.213,000 --> 0:00:26,000
No, I didn't think so, because it's come down to this, people:

6
0:00:26.453,000 --> 0:00:27,000
You're using the word incorrectly,

7
0:00:28.355,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and tonight I hope to show you

8
0:00:30.424,000 --> 0:00:33,000
how to put the "awe" back in "awesome."

9
0:00:33.506,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Recently, I was dining at an outdoor cafe,

10
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and the server came up to our table,

11
0:00:38.243,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and asked us if we had dined there before,

12
0:00:39.79,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I said, "Yes, yes, we have."

13
0:00:41.739,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And she said, "Awesome."

14
0:00:44.519,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I thought, "Really?

15
0:00:46.754,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Awesome or just merely good

16
0:00:49.376,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that we decided to visit your restaurant again?"

17
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The other day, one of my coworkers asked me

18
0:00:56.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
if I could save that file as a PDF,

19
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and I said, "Well, of course," and he said, "Awesome."

20
0:01:02.621,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Seriously, can saving anything as a PDF

21
0:01:08.848,000 --> 0:01:1,000
be awesome?

22
0:01:11.796,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Sadly, the frequent overuse of the word "awesome"

23
0:01:14.956,000 --> 0:01:18,000
has now replaced words like "great" and "thank you."

24
0:01:19.123,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So Webster's dictionary defines the word "awesome"

25
0:01:23.495,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as fear mingled with admiration or reverence,

26
0:01:27.623,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a feeling produced by something majestic.

27
0:01:31.019,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, with that in mind,

28
0:01:32.943,000 --> 0:01:35,000
was your Quiznos sandwich awesome?

29
0:01:36.24,000 --> 0:01:38,000
How about that parking space? Was that awesome?

30
0:01:38.51,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Or that game the other day? Was that awesome?

31
0:01:41.056,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The answer is no, no and no.

32
0:01:43.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
A sandwich can be delicious,

33
0:01:45.113,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that parking space can be nearby,

34
0:01:47.415,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and that game can be a blowout,

35
0:01:50.155,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but not everything can be awesome.

36
0:01:54.38,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:56.01,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So when you use the word "awesome"

38
0:01:57.659,000 --> 0:02:,000
to describe the most mundane of things,

39
0:02:00.977,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you're taking away the very power of the word.

40
0:02:03.88,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This author says, "Snowy days

41
0:02:06.298,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or finding money in your pants is awesome."

42
0:02:10.573,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:11.451,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Um, no, it is not,

44
0:02:13.433,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we need to raise the bar for this poor schmuck. (Laughter)

45
0:02:19.831,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So in other words, if you have everything, you value nothing.

46
0:02:23.401,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's a lot like drinking from a firehose

47
0:02:25.771,000 --> 0:02:28,000
like this jackass right here.

48
0:02:29.719,000 --> 0:02:31,000
There's no dynamic, there's no highs or lows,

49
0:02:32.138,000 --> 0:02:33,000
if everything is awesome.

50
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Ladies and gentlemen, here are 10 things

51
0:02:36.165,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that are truly awesome.

52
0:02:38.083,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Imagine, if you will, having to schlep

53
0:02:40.766,000 --> 0:02:41,000
everything on your back.

54
0:02:42.227,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Wouldn't this be easier for me

55
0:02:44.22,000 --> 0:02:45,000
if I could roll this home?

56
0:02:46.188,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Yes, so I think I'll invent the wheel.

57
0:02:48.517,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The wheel, ladies and gentlemen.

58
0:02:51.389,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Is the wheel awesome? Say it with me.

59
0:02:54.186,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Yes, the wheel is awesome!

60
0:02:57.809,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The Great Pyramids were the tallest

61
0:02:59.87,000 --> 0:03:,000
man-made structure in the world

62
0:03:01.488,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for 4,000 years.

63
0:03:03.872,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Pharaoh had his slaves move millions of blocks

64
0:03:07.411,000 --> 0:03:11,000
just to this site to erect a big freaking headstone.

65
0:03:11.427,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Were the Great Pyramids awesome?

66
0:03:12.78,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Yes, the pyramids were awesome.

67
0:03:15.03,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The Grand Canyon. Come on.

68
0:03:17.176,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's almost 80 million years old.

69
0:03:20.404,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Is the Grand Canyon awesome?

70
0:03:22.171,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Yes, the Grand Canyon is.

71
0:03:23.712,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Louis Daguerre invented photography in 1829,

72
0:03:28.47,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and earlier today,

73
0:03:29.989,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when you whipped out your smartphone

74
0:03:31.954,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and you took a shot of your awesome sandwich,

75
0:03:34.566,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and you know who you are —

76
0:03:36.311,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter) —

77
0:03:38.527,000 --> 0:03:4,000
wasn't that easier than exposing the image

78
0:03:40.867,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to copper plates coated with iodized silver?

79
0:03:43.443,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I mean, come on. Is photography awesome?

80
0:03:45.515,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Yes, photography is awesome.

81
0:03:47.405,000 --> 0:03:49,000
D-Day, June 6, 1944,

82
0:03:49.818,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the Allied invasion of Normandy,

83
0:03:52.186,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the largest amphibious invasion in world history.

84
0:03:56.282,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Was D-Day awesome? Yes, it was awesome.

85
0:03:59.422,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Did you eat food today? Did you eat?

86
0:04:01.973,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Then you can thank the honeybee, that's the one,

87
0:04:04.301,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because if crops aren't pollinated, we can't grow food,

88
0:04:07.395,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and then we're all going to die.

89
0:04:09.217,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's just like that.

90
0:04:10.337,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But it's not like a flower can just get up

91
0:04:12.682,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and have sex with another flower,

92
0:04:15.154,000 --> 0:04:17,000
although that would be awesome.

93
0:04:17.485,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:20.304,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Bees are awesome. Are you kidding me?

95
0:04:23.242,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Landing on the moon! Come on!

96
0:04:27.198,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Apollo 11. Are you kidding me?

97
0:04:30.171,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Sixty-six years after the Wright Brothers

98
0:04:32.995,000 --> 0:04:34,000
took off from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina,

99
0:04:35.605,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Neil Armstrong was 240,000 miles away.

100
0:04:38.934,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That's like from here to the moon.

101
0:04:40.959,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:43.195,000 --> 0:04:45,000
That's one small step for a man,

103
0:04:45.549,000 --> 0:04:47,000
one giant leap for awesome!

104
0:04:48.131,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You're damn right, it was.

105
0:04:50.152,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Woodstock, 1969: Rolling Stone Magazine said

106
0:04:53.928,000 --> 0:04:56,000
this changed the history of rock and roll.

107
0:04:57.097,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Tickets were only 24 dollars back then.

108
0:04:59.707,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You can't even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now.

109
0:05:03.339,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Jimi Hendrix's version of "The Star-Spangled Banner"

110
0:05:06.459,000 --> 0:05:08,000
was the most iconic.

111
0:05:08.69,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Was Woodstock awesome? Yes, it was awesome.

112
0:05:11.238,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Sharks! They're at the top of the food chain.

113
0:05:13.987,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Sharks have multiple rows of teeth

114
0:05:16.424,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that grow in their jaw

115
0:05:17.669,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and they move forward like a conveyor belt.

116
0:05:21.067,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Some sharks can lose 30,000 teeth in their lifetime.

117
0:05:24.76,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Does awesome inspire fear?

118
0:05:27.357,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Oh, hell yeah, sharks are awesome!

119
0:05:31.103,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The Internet was born in 1982

120
0:05:33.93,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it instantly took over global communication,

121
0:05:37.695,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and later tonight, when all these PowerPoints

122
0:05:39.798,000 --> 0:05:4,000
are uplifted to the Internet

123
0:05:41.756,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so that a guy in Siberia can get drunk

124
0:05:44.58,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and watch this crap,

125
0:05:47.549,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the Internet is awesome.

126
0:05:50.303,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And finally, finally some of you can't wait

127
0:05:52.79,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to come up and tell me how awesome my PowerPoint was.

128
0:05:55.952,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I will save you the time.

129
0:05:57.62,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It was not awesome, but it was true,

130
0:06:00.282,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I hope it was entertaining,

131
0:06:02.06,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and out of all the audiences I've ever had,

132
0:06:05.407,000 --> 0:06:07,000
y'all are the most recent. Thank you and good night.

133
0:06:08.107,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Applause)

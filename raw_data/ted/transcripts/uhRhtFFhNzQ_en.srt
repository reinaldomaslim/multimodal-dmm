1
0:00:12.774,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Right now

2
0:00:14.515,000 --> 0:00:17,000
you have a movie playing inside your head.

3
0:00:17.989,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's an amazing multi-track movie.

4
0:00:20.516,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It has 3D vision and surround sound

5
0:00:23.84,000 --> 0:00:25,000
for what you're seeing and hearing right now,

6
0:00:26.476,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but that's just the start of it.

7
0:00:28.795,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Your movie has smell and taste and touch.

8
0:00:33.978,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It has a sense of your body,

9
0:00:36.53,000 --> 0:00:4,000
pain, hunger, orgasms.

10
0:00:40.849,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It has emotions,

11
0:00:42.89,000 --> 0:00:45,000
anger and happiness.

12
0:00:46.426,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It has memories, like scenes from your childhood

13
0:00:50.22,000 --> 0:00:52,000
playing before you.

14
0:00:52.92,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And it has this constant voiceover narrative

15
0:00:57.375,000 --> 0:01:01,000
in your stream of conscious thinking.

16
0:01:01.751,000 --> 0:01:06,000
At the heart of this movie is you

17
0:01:06.824,000 --> 0:01:1,000
experiencing all this directly.

18
0:01:11.189,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This movie is your stream of consciousness,

19
0:01:16.881,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the subject of experience

20
0:01:18.188,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of the mind and the world.

21
0:01:23.326,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts

22
0:01:25.631,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of human existence.

23
0:01:27.648,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Each of us is conscious.

24
0:01:30.58,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We all have our own inner movie,

25
0:01:33.309,000 --> 0:01:35,000
you and you and you.

26
0:01:36.04,000 --> 0:01:39,000
There's nothing we know about more directly.

27
0:01:39.76,000 --> 0:01:42,000
At least, I know about my consciousness directly.

28
0:01:43.232,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.

29
0:01:47.23,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.

30
0:01:50.658,000 --> 0:01:53,000
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives

31
0:01:54.358,000 --> 0:01:57,000
would have meaning or value.

32
0:01:57.723,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But at the same time, it's the most

33
0:01:58.889,000 --> 0:02:02,000
mysterious phenomenon in the universe.

34
0:02:03.059,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Why are we conscious?

35
0:02:06.432,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Why do we have these inner movies?

36
0:02:07.973,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Why aren't we just robots

37
0:02:10.226,000 --> 0:02:12,000
who process all this input,

38
0:02:12.469,000 --> 0:02:14,000
produce all that output,

39
0:02:14.486,000 --> 0:02:17,000
without experiencing the inner movie at all?

40
0:02:18.341,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Right now, nobody knows the answers

41
0:02:20.85,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to those questions.

42
0:02:22.596,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness

43
0:02:26.305,000 --> 0:02:3,000
into science, some radical ideas may be needed.

44
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Some people say a science of consciousness

45
0:02:33.966,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is impossible.

46
0:02:35.918,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Science, by its nature, is objective.

47
0:02:39.686,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.

48
0:02:43.111,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So there can never be a science of consciousness.

49
0:02:47.56,000 --> 0:02:5,000
For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.

50
0:02:50.78,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Psychologists studied behavior objectively,

51
0:02:54.598,000 --> 0:02:58,000
neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,

52
0:02:58.66,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and nobody even mentioned consciousness.

53
0:03:02.21,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,

54
0:03:04.966,000 --> 0:03:06,000
there was very little scientific work

55
0:03:07.348,000 --> 0:03:09,000
on consciousness.

56
0:03:09.9,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, about 20 years ago,

57
0:03:11.605,000 --> 0:03:13,000
all that began to change.

58
0:03:14.578,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick

59
0:03:17.355,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and physicists like Roger Penrose

60
0:03:20.111,000 --> 0:03:22,000
said now is the time for science

61
0:03:22.351,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to attack consciousness.

62
0:03:25.127,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And since then, there's been a real explosion,

63
0:03:27.447,000 --> 0:03:29,000
a flowering of scientific work

64
0:03:29.784,000 --> 0:03:3,000
on consciousness.

65
0:03:31.048,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.

66
0:03:33.087,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But it also has some fundamental

67
0:03:35.175,000 --> 0:03:38,000
limitations so far.

68
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The centerpiece

69
0:03:40.658,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of the science of consciousness in recent years

70
0:03:43.478,000 --> 0:03:45,000
has been the search for correlations,

71
0:03:45.973,000 --> 0:03:48,000
correlations between certain areas of the brain

72
0:03:49.102,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and certain states of consciousness.

73
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We saw some of this kind of work

74
0:03:54.21,000 --> 0:03:55,000
from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work

75
0:03:55.97,000 --> 0:03:58,000
she presented just a few minutes ago.

76
0:03:59.246,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now we understand much better, for example,

77
0:04:02.809,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the kinds of brain areas that go along with

78
0:04:05.126,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the conscious experience of seeing faces

79
0:04:08.497,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or of feeling pain

80
0:04:11.617,000 --> 0:04:13,000
or of feeling happy.

81
0:04:14.106,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But this is still a science of correlations.

82
0:04:16.922,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It's not a science of explanations.

83
0:04:20.278,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We know that these brain areas

84
0:04:22.901,000 --> 0:04:25,000
go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,

85
0:04:26.825,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but we don't know why they do.

86
0:04:30.461,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I like to put this by saying

87
0:04:32.786,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that this kind of work from neuroscience

88
0:04:36.183,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is answering some of the questions

89
0:04:37.929,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we want answered about consciousness,

90
0:04:39.734,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the questions about what certain brain areas do

91
0:04:43.507,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and what they correlate with.

92
0:04:45.616,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.

93
0:04:48.772,000 --> 0:04:5,000
No knock on the neuroscientists.

94
0:04:51.213,000 --> 0:04:53,000
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness.

95
0:04:53.834,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But it doesn't address the real mystery

96
0:04:58.425,000 --> 0:04:59,000
at the core of this subject:

97
0:05:00.355,000 --> 0:05:04,000
why is it that all that physical processing in a brain

98
0:05:04.575,000 --> 0:05:06,000
should be accompanied by consciousness at all?

99
0:05:07.5,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Why is there this inner subjective movie?

100
0:05:10.706,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.

101
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And you might say,

102
0:05:15.993,000 --> 0:05:18,000
let's just give neuroscience a few years.

103
0:05:19.548,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon

104
0:05:23.328,000 --> 0:05:27,000
like traffic jams, like hurricanes,

105
0:05:28.21,000 --> 0:05:3,000
like life, and we'll figure it out.

106
0:05:30.831,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The classical cases of emergence

107
0:05:32.902,000 --> 0:05:35,000
are all cases of emergent behavior,

108
0:05:36.28,000 --> 0:05:38,000
how a traffic jam behaves,

109
0:05:38.627,000 --> 0:05:39,000
how a hurricane functions,

110
0:05:40.123,000 --> 0:05:42,000
how a living organism reproduces

111
0:05:42.316,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and adapts and metabolizes,

112
0:05:45.905,000 --> 0:05:47,000
all questions about objective functioning.

113
0:05:48.188,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You could apply that to the human brain

114
0:05:51.01,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in explaining some of the behaviors

115
0:05:52.519,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and the functions of the human brain

116
0:05:54.792,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as emergent phenomena:

117
0:05:55.951,000 --> 0:05:59,000
how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,

118
0:06:00.349,000 --> 0:06:01,000
all these questions about behavior.

119
0:06:02.239,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But when it comes to consciousness,

120
0:06:04.366,000 --> 0:06:05,000
questions about behavior

121
0:06:06.255,000 --> 0:06:08,000
are among the easy problems.

122
0:06:09.18,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When it comes to the hard problem,

123
0:06:10.777,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that's the question of why is it

124
0:06:13.154,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that all this behavior

125
0:06:14.965,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is accompanied by subjective experience?

126
0:06:17.81,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And here, the standard paradigm

127
0:06:19.565,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of emergence,

128
0:06:21.411,000 --> 0:06:23,000
even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,

129
0:06:24.358,000 --> 0:06:28,000
don't really, so far, have that much to say.

130
0:06:28.801,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.

131
0:06:32.446,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I want a scientific theory of consciousness

132
0:06:36.473,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that works,

133
0:06:38.802,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and for a long time, I banged my head

134
0:06:41.209,000 --> 0:06:42,000
against the wall

135
0:06:42.65,000 --> 0:06:44,000
looking for a theory of consciousness

136
0:06:44.787,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in purely physical terms

137
0:06:46.543,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that would work.

138
0:06:47.87,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But I eventually came to the conclusion

139
0:06:49.613,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.

140
0:06:53.798,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's a long story,

141
0:06:55.733,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but the core idea is just that what you get

142
0:06:58.45,000 --> 0:07:,000
from purely reductionist explanations

143
0:07:00.79,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in physical terms, in brain-based terms,

144
0:07:03.434,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is stories about the functioning of a system,

145
0:07:05.549,000 --> 0:07:07,000
its structure, its dynamics,

146
0:07:07.675,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the behavior it produces,

147
0:07:09.667,000 --> 0:07:11,000
great for solving the easy problems —

148
0:07:11.747,000 --> 0:07:13,000
how we behave, how we function —

149
0:07:14.245,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but when it comes to subjective experience —

150
0:07:17.698,000 --> 0:07:2,000
why does all this feel like something from the inside? —

151
0:07:21.259,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that's something fundamentally new,

152
0:07:23.334,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and it's always a further question.

153
0:07:27.227,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.

154
0:07:32.64,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,

155
0:07:35.855,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,

156
0:07:39.455,000 --> 0:07:42,000
chemistry explains biology,

157
0:07:42.695,000 --> 0:07:45,000
biology explains parts of psychology.

158
0:07:46.542,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But consciousness

159
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
doesn't seem to fit into this picture.

160
0:07:50.771,000 --> 0:07:51,000
On the one hand, it's a datum

161
0:07:52.661,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that we're conscious.

162
0:07:54.63,000 --> 0:07:55,000
On the other hand, we don't know how

163
0:07:55.916,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.

164
0:07:59.894,000 --> 0:08:,000
So I think consciousness right now

165
0:08:01.841,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is a kind of anomaly,

166
0:08:04.304,000 --> 0:08:06,000
one that we need to integrate

167
0:08:06.34,000 --> 0:08:09,000
into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.

168
0:08:10.24,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Faced with an anomaly like this,

169
0:08:12.168,000 --> 0:08:15,000
radical ideas may be needed,

170
0:08:15.407,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and I think that we may need one or two ideas

171
0:08:18.412,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that initially seem crazy

172
0:08:20.852,000 --> 0:08:22,000
before we can come to grips with consciousness

173
0:08:23.788,000 --> 0:08:25,000
scientifically.

174
0:08:25.88,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, there are a few candidates

175
0:08:27.479,000 --> 0:08:29,000
for what those crazy ideas might be.

176
0:08:29.975,000 --> 0:08:33,000
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.

177
0:08:34.317,000 --> 0:08:36,000
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem

178
0:08:36.714,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of consciousness.

179
0:08:38.457,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie

180
0:08:41.82,000 --> 0:08:45,000
involves a kind of illusion or confusion.

181
0:08:46.432,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Actually, all we've got to do is explain

182
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,

183
0:08:51.337,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and then we've explained everything

184
0:08:53.362,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that needs to be explained.

185
0:08:55.837,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Well I say, more power to him.

186
0:08:58.446,000 --> 0:09:,000
That's the kind of radical idea

187
0:09:00.46,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that we need to explore

188
0:09:02.384,000 --> 0:09:04,000
if you want to have a purely reductionist

189
0:09:04.723,000 --> 0:09:07,000
brain-based theory of consciousness.

190
0:09:08.273,000 --> 0:09:1,000
At the same time, for me and for many other people,

191
0:09:10.344,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that view is a bit too close to simply

192
0:09:12.171,000 --> 0:09:14,000
denying the datum of consciousness

193
0:09:14.192,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to be satisfactory.

194
0:09:15.695,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So I go in a different direction.

195
0:09:18.763,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In the time remaining,

196
0:09:19.949,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I want to explore two crazy ideas

197
0:09:22.948,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that I think may have some promise.

198
0:09:26.665,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The first crazy idea

199
0:09:28.285,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is that consciousness is fundamental.

200
0:09:32.91,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe

201
0:09:35.751,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as fundamental building blocks:

202
0:09:37.911,000 --> 0:09:4,000
space and time and mass.

203
0:09:41.66,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They postulate fundamental laws governing them,

204
0:09:45.27,000 --> 0:09:48,000
like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.

205
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
These fundamental properties and laws

206
0:09:51.47,000 --> 0:09:54,000
aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.

207
0:09:54.687,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Rather, they're taken as primitive,

208
0:09:57.427,000 --> 0:10:,000
and you build up the world from there.

209
0:10:00.806,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.

210
0:10:05.905,000 --> 0:10:07,000
In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out

211
0:10:08.362,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena

212
0:10:11.53,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

213
0:10:13.881,000 --> 0:10:16,000
space, time, mass, Newton's laws —

214
0:10:16.95,000 --> 0:10:18,000
so he postulated fundamental laws

215
0:10:19.521,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of electromagnetism

216
0:10:21.335,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and postulated electric charge

217
0:10:23.746,000 --> 0:10:24,000
as a fundamental element

218
0:10:25.514,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that those laws govern.

219
0:10:28.473,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I think that's the situation we're in

220
0:10:31.756,000 --> 0:10:32,000
with consciousness.

221
0:10:33.366,000 --> 0:10:35,000
If you can't explain consciousness

222
0:10:35.851,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in terms of the existing fundamentals —

223
0:10:38.269,000 --> 0:10:4,000
space, time, mass, charge —

224
0:10:40.94,000 --> 0:10:43,000
then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.

225
0:10:44.37,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The natural thing to do is to postulate

226
0:10:46.846,000 --> 0:10:49,000
consciousness itself as something fundamental,

227
0:10:50.102,000 --> 0:10:53,000
a fundamental building block of nature.

228
0:10:53.134,000 --> 0:10:55,000
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.

229
0:10:56.102,000 --> 0:10:59,000
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.

230
0:10:59.7,000 --> 0:11:,000
What we then need is to study

231
0:11:01.604,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the fundamental laws governing consciousness,

232
0:11:04.557,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the laws that connect consciousness

233
0:11:06.937,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,

234
0:11:09.738,000 --> 0:11:11,000
physical processes.

235
0:11:12.674,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Physicists sometimes say

236
0:11:14.856,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that we want fundamental laws so simple

237
0:11:17.736,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

238
0:11:21.538,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Well I think something like that is the situation

239
0:11:23.259,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we're in with consciousness.

240
0:11:25.127,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We want to find fundamental laws so simple

241
0:11:27.877,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.

242
0:11:29.964,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We don't know what those laws are yet,

243
0:11:31.539,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but that's what we're after.

244
0:11:35.566,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The second crazy idea

245
0:11:37.983,000 --> 0:11:4,000
is that consciousness might be universal.

246
0:11:41.461,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Every system might have some degree

247
0:11:44.522,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of consciousness.

248
0:11:48.247,000 --> 0:11:5,000
This view is sometimes called panpsychism:

249
0:11:51.208,000 --> 0:11:54,000
pan for all, psych for mind,

250
0:11:54.21,000 --> 0:11:55,000
every system is conscious,

251
0:11:55.981,000 --> 0:11:59,000
not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,

252
0:12:00.228,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but even Rob Knight's microbes,

253
0:12:02.805,000 --> 0:12:04,000
elementary particles.

254
0:12:04.992,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.

255
0:12:07.705,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The idea is not that photons are intelligent

256
0:12:11.484,000 --> 0:12:12,000
or thinking.

257
0:12:12.561,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's not that a photon

258
0:12:13.991,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is wracked with angst

259
0:12:15.436,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.

260
0:12:18.728,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I never get to slow down and smell the roses."

261
0:12:21.72,000 --> 0:12:23,000
No, not like that.

262
0:12:23.864,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But the thought is maybe photons might have

263
0:12:26.912,000 --> 0:12:28,000
some element of raw, subjective feeling,

264
0:12:29.535,000 --> 0:12:33,000
some primitive precursor to consciousness.

265
0:12:33.687,000 --> 0:12:35,000
This may sound a bit kooky to you.

266
0:12:36.541,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?

267
0:12:39.324,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,

268
0:12:42.884,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that consciousness is fundamental.

269
0:12:45.03,000 --> 0:12:49,000
If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,

270
0:12:49.405,000 --> 0:12:51,000
it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,

271
0:12:52.07,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the way they are.

272
0:12:53.97,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It's also worth noting that although the idea

273
0:12:55.919,000 --> 0:12:57,000
seems counterintuitive to us,

274
0:12:57.943,000 --> 0:12:59,000
it's much less counterintuitive to people

275
0:13:00.687,000 --> 0:13:01,000
from different cultures,

276
0:13:02.418,000 --> 0:13:03,000
where the human mind is seen as much more

277
0:13:03.938,000 --> 0:13:06,000
continuous with nature.

278
0:13:07.01,000 --> 0:13:1,000
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that

279
0:13:10.744,000 --> 0:13:12,000
perhaps the most simple and powerful way

280
0:13:12.753,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness

281
0:13:14.987,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to physical processing

282
0:13:16.967,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is to link consciousness to information.

283
0:13:20.062,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Wherever there's information processing,

284
0:13:22.073,000 --> 0:13:23,000
there's consciousness.

285
0:13:23.138,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Complex information processing, like in a human,

286
0:13:25.688,000 --> 0:13:26,000
complex consciousness.

287
0:13:27.22,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Simple information processing,

288
0:13:29.349,000 --> 0:13:3,000
simple consciousness.

289
0:13:31.307,000 --> 0:13:33,000
A really exciting thing is in recent years

290
0:13:33.638,000 --> 0:13:36,000
a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,

291
0:13:36.903,000 --> 0:13:37,000
has taken this kind of theory

292
0:13:38.146,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and developed it rigorously

293
0:13:40.221,000 --> 0:13:41,000
with a mathematical theory.

294
0:13:42.07,000 --> 0:13:43,000
He has a mathematical measure

295
0:13:43.587,000 --> 0:13:44,000
of information integration

296
0:13:45.317,000 --> 0:13:46,000
which he calls phi,

297
0:13:47.236,000 --> 0:13:48,000
measuring the amount of information

298
0:13:48.843,000 --> 0:13:49,000
integrated in a system.

299
0:13:50.463,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And he supposes that phi goes along

300
0:13:52.832,000 --> 0:13:53,000
with consciousness.

301
0:13:54.27,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So in a human brain,

302
0:13:55.591,000 --> 0:13:57,000
incredibly large amount of information integration,

303
0:13:58.11,000 --> 0:14:,000
high degree of phi,

304
0:14:00.144,000 --> 0:14:01,000
a whole lot of consciousness.

305
0:14:01.693,000 --> 0:14:04,000
In a mouse, medium degree of information integration,

306
0:14:05.386,000 --> 0:14:06,000
still pretty significant,

307
0:14:06.405,000 --> 0:14:08,000
pretty serious amount of consciousness.

308
0:14:08.43,000 --> 0:14:1,000
But as you go down to worms,

309
0:14:10.695,000 --> 0:14:13,000
microbes, particles,

310
0:14:14.172,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the amount of phi falls off.

311
0:14:15.706,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The amount of information integration falls off,

312
0:14:18.139,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but it's still non-zero.

313
0:14:19.587,000 --> 0:14:2,000
On Tononi's theory,

314
0:14:21.526,000 --> 0:14:23,000
there's still going to be a non-zero degree

315
0:14:23.733,000 --> 0:14:24,000
of consciousness.

316
0:14:25.562,000 --> 0:14:27,000
In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law

317
0:14:28.101,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.

318
0:14:31.485,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Now, I don't know if this theory is right,

319
0:14:34.107,000 --> 0:14:37,000
but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now

320
0:14:37.318,000 --> 0:14:38,000
in the science of consciousness,

321
0:14:38.704,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and it's been used to integrate a whole range

322
0:14:40.935,000 --> 0:14:42,000
of scientific data,

323
0:14:43.322,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough

324
0:14:45.565,000 --> 0:14:48,000
you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.

325
0:14:49.06,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Another final motivation is that

326
0:14:51.685,000 --> 0:14:53,000
panpsychism might help us to integrate

327
0:14:53.736,000 --> 0:14:56,000
consciousness into the physical world.

328
0:14:56.95,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Physicists and philosophers have often observed

329
0:15:00.127,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that physics is curiously abstract.

330
0:15:02.568,000 --> 0:15:04,000
It describes the structure of reality

331
0:15:04.716,000 --> 0:15:06,000
using a bunch of equations,

332
0:15:06.8,000 --> 0:15:09,000
but it doesn't tell us about the reality

333
0:15:09.824,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that underlies it.

334
0:15:11.392,000 --> 0:15:12,000
As Stephen Hawking puts it,

335
0:15:13.289,000 --> 0:15:17,000
what puts the fire into the equations?

336
0:15:17.343,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Well, on the panpsychist view,

337
0:15:19.961,000 --> 0:15:21,000
you can leave the equations of physics as they are,

338
0:15:22.6,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but you can take them to be describing

339
0:15:24.164,000 --> 0:15:25,000
the flux of consciousness.

340
0:15:25.838,000 --> 0:15:27,000
That's what physics really is ultimately doing,

341
0:15:27.876,000 --> 0:15:29,000
describing the flux of consciousness.

342
0:15:30.205,000 --> 0:15:31,000
On this view, it's consciousness

343
0:15:31.858,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that puts the fire into the equations.

344
0:15:36.104,000 --> 0:15:37,000
On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle

345
0:15:37.764,000 --> 0:15:38,000
outside the physical world

346
0:15:39.44,000 --> 0:15:4,000
as some kind of extra.

347
0:15:40.858,000 --> 0:15:43,000
It's there right at its heart.

348
0:15:44.314,000 --> 0:15:46,000
This view, I think, the panpsychist view,

349
0:15:47.188,000 --> 0:15:5,000
has the potential to transfigure our relationship

350
0:15:50.489,000 --> 0:15:51,000
to nature,

351
0:15:51.984,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and it may have some pretty serious social

352
0:15:54.219,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and ethical consequences.

353
0:15:57.912,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Some of these may be counterintuitive.

354
0:16:00.071,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I used to think I shouldn't eat anything

355
0:16:03.142,000 --> 0:16:05,000
which is conscious,

356
0:16:05.604,000 --> 0:16:07,000
so therefore I should be vegetarian.

357
0:16:08.208,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,

358
0:16:10.775,000 --> 0:16:12,000
you're going to go very hungry.

359
0:16:13.505,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So I think when you think about it,

360
0:16:14.793,000 --> 0:16:16,000
this tends to transfigure your views,

361
0:16:16.96,000 --> 0:16:18,000
whereas what matters for ethical purposes

362
0:16:19.203,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and moral considerations,

363
0:16:20.477,000 --> 0:16:23,000
not so much the fact of consciousness,

364
0:16:23.554,000 --> 0:16:26,000
but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.

365
0:16:27.51,000 --> 0:16:28,000
It's also natural to ask about consciousness

366
0:16:29.448,000 --> 0:16:32,000
in other systems, like computers.

367
0:16:32.498,000 --> 0:16:33,000
What about the artificially intelligent system

368
0:16:34.287,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in the movie "Her," Samantha?

369
0:16:37.729,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Is she conscious?

370
0:16:39.129,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Well, if you take the informational,

371
0:16:40.56,000 --> 0:16:41,000
panpsychist view,

372
0:16:41.74,000 --> 0:16:44,000
she certainly has complicated information processing

373
0:16:45.211,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and integration,

374
0:16:46.632,000 --> 0:16:48,000
so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.

375
0:16:49.299,000 --> 0:16:51,000
If that's right, it raises pretty serious

376
0:16:52.237,000 --> 0:16:54,000
ethical issues about both the ethics

377
0:16:54.602,000 --> 0:16:57,000
of developing intelligent computer systems

378
0:16:58.123,000 --> 0:17:,000
and the ethics of turning them off.

379
0:17:00.859,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Finally, you might ask about the consciousness

380
0:17:03.359,000 --> 0:17:04,000
of whole groups,

381
0:17:05.241,000 --> 0:17:06,000
the planet.

382
0:17:07.078,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Does Canada have its own consciousness?

383
0:17:10.001,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Or at a more local level,

384
0:17:12.1,000 --> 0:17:13,000
does an integrated group

385
0:17:13.308,000 --> 0:17:15,000
like the audience at a TED conference,

386
0:17:15.571,000 --> 0:17:18,000
are we right now having a collective TED consciousness,

387
0:17:19.02,000 --> 0:17:2,000
an inner movie

388
0:17:20.513,000 --> 0:17:22,000
for this collective TED group

389
0:17:23.319,000 --> 0:17:24,000
which is distinct from the inner movies

390
0:17:24.999,000 --> 0:17:25,000
of each of our parts?

391
0:17:26.088,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I don't know the answer to that question,

392
0:17:28.253,000 --> 0:17:29,000
but I think it's at least one

393
0:17:29.624,000 --> 0:17:31,000
worth taking seriously.

394
0:17:32.098,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Okay, so this panpsychist vision,

395
0:17:34.435,000 --> 0:17:35,000
it is a radical one,

396
0:17:36.248,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and I don't know that it's correct.

397
0:17:38.462,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I'm actually more confident about

398
0:17:40.315,000 --> 0:17:41,000
the first crazy idea,

399
0:17:41.948,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that consciousness is fundamental,

400
0:17:44.117,000 --> 0:17:45,000
than about the second one,

401
0:17:45.92,000 --> 0:17:47,000
that it's universal.

402
0:17:48.141,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I mean, the view raises any number of questions,

403
0:17:50.219,000 --> 0:17:51,000
has any number of challenges,

404
0:17:51.76,000 --> 0:17:52,000
like how do those little bits

405
0:17:53.12,000 --> 0:17:54,000
of consciousness add up

406
0:17:54.86,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to the kind of complex consciousness

407
0:17:57.157,000 --> 0:17:59,000
we know and love.

408
0:17:59.48,000 --> 0:18:,000
If we can answer those questions,

409
0:18:00.94,000 --> 0:18:01,000
then I think we're going to be well on our way

410
0:18:02.445,000 --> 0:18:05,000
to a serious theory of consciousness.

411
0:18:05.532,000 --> 0:18:08,000
If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps

412
0:18:08.92,000 --> 0:18:09,000
in science and philosophy.

413
0:18:10.764,000 --> 0:18:13,000
We can't expect to solve it overnight.

414
0:18:14.209,000 --> 0:18:17,000
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.

415
0:18:17.749,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,

416
0:18:20.736,000 --> 0:18:22,000
both to understanding the universe

417
0:18:23.188,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and to understanding ourselves.

418
0:18:25.718,000 --> 0:18:27,000
It may just take the right crazy idea.

419
0:18:28.621,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Thank you.

420
0:18:30.612,000 --> 0:18:31,000
(Applause)

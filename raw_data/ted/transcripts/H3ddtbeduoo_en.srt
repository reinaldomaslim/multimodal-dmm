1
0:00:13.039,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Right now

2
0:00:14.797,000 --> 0:00:16,000
there is an aspiring teacher

3
0:00:17.539,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who is working on a 60-page paper

4
0:00:21.19,000 --> 0:00:24,000
based on some age-old education theory

5
0:00:24.7,000 --> 0:00:28,000
developed by some dead education professor

6
0:00:28.893,000 --> 0:00:3,000
wondering to herself what this task

7
0:00:31.611,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that she's engaging in

8
0:00:33.251,000 --> 0:00:35,000
has to do with what she wants to do with her life,

9
0:00:35.779,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which is be an educator,

10
0:00:38.005,000 --> 0:00:42,000
change lives, and spark magic.

11
0:00:42.119,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Right now there is an aspiring teacher

12
0:00:47.003,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in a graduate school of education

13
0:00:48.959,000 --> 0:00:51,000
who is watching a professor babble on and on

14
0:00:51.967,000 --> 0:00:53,000
about engagement

15
0:00:54.091,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in the most disengaging way possible.

16
0:00:59.265,000 --> 0:01:,000
Right now

17
0:01:00.915,000 --> 0:01:02,000
there's a first-year teacher at home

18
0:01:03.114,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who is pouring through lesson plans

19
0:01:05.666,000 --> 0:01:07,000
trying to make sense of standards,

20
0:01:07.996,000 --> 0:01:1,000
who is trying to make sense of how to grade students appropriately,

21
0:01:11.186,000 --> 0:01:12,000
while at the same time saying to herself

22
0:01:12.825,000 --> 0:01:14,000
over and over again,

23
0:01:15.039,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"Don't smile till November,"

24
0:01:16.997,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because that's what she was taught

25
0:01:19.08,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in her teacher education program.

26
0:01:22.102,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Right now there's a student

27
0:01:24.958,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who is coming up with a way

28
0:01:26.642,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to convince his mom or dad

29
0:01:29.13,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that he's very, very sick

30
0:01:30.638,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and can't make it to school tomorrow.

31
0:01:34.511,000 --> 0:01:36,000
On the other hand, right now

32
0:01:37.408,000 --> 0:01:39,000
there are amazing educators

33
0:01:39.758,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that are sharing information,

34
0:01:41.532,000 --> 0:01:43,000
information that is shared in such a beautiful way

35
0:01:44.179,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that the students are sitting at the edge of their seats

36
0:01:46.57,000 --> 0:01:48,000
just waiting for a bead of sweat

37
0:01:48.682,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to drop off the face of this person

38
0:01:51.267,000 --> 0:01:54,000
so they can soak up all that knowledge.

39
0:01:54.312,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Right now there is also a person

40
0:01:58.03,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who has an entire audience rapt with attention,

41
0:02:01.391,000 --> 0:02:03,000
a person that is weaving a powerful narrative

42
0:02:04.283,000 --> 0:02:05,000
about a world

43
0:02:05.959,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that the people who are listening

44
0:02:07.514,000 --> 0:02:09,000
have never imagined or seen before,

45
0:02:09.88,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but if they close their eyes tightly enough,

46
0:02:12.398,000 --> 0:02:13,000
they can envision that world

47
0:02:14.037,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because the storytelling is so compelling.

48
0:02:18.032,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Right now there's a person who can tell an audience

49
0:02:21.171,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to put their hands up in the air

50
0:02:23.074,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and they will stay there till he says,

51
0:02:24.724,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"Put them down."

52
0:02:26.468,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Right now.

53
0:02:28.136,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So people will then say,

54
0:02:29.54,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Well, Chris, you describe the guy

55
0:02:32.403,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who is going through some awful training

56
0:02:34.427,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but you're also describing these powerful educators.

57
0:02:36.96,000 --> 0:02:37,000
If you're thinking about the world of education

58
0:02:38.494,000 --> 0:02:39,000
or urban education in particular,

59
0:02:40.092,000 --> 0:02:42,000
these guys will probably cancel each other out,

60
0:02:42.138,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and then we'll be okay."

61
0:02:44.384,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The reality is, the folks I described

62
0:02:46.886,000 --> 0:02:47,000
as the master teachers,

63
0:02:48.602,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the master narrative builders,

64
0:02:50.939,000 --> 0:02:51,000
the master storytellers

65
0:02:52.89,000 --> 0:02:55,000
are far removed from classrooms.

66
0:02:56.488,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The folks who know the skills about how to teach

67
0:02:58.87,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and engage an audience

68
0:03:00.192,000 --> 0:03:02,000
don't even know what teacher certification means.

69
0:03:03.112,000 --> 0:03:05,000
They may not even have the degrees

70
0:03:05.174,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to be able to have anything

71
0:03:08.435,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to call an education.

72
0:03:10.739,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And that to me is sad.

73
0:03:12.471,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's sad because the people who I described,

74
0:03:15.47,000 --> 0:03:17,000
they were very disinterested in the learning process,

75
0:03:18.237,000 --> 0:03:19,000
want to be effective teachers,

76
0:03:20.095,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but they have no models.

77
0:03:21.447,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I'm going to paraphrase Mark Twain.

78
0:03:23.192,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Mark Twain says that proper preparation,

79
0:03:25.722,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or teaching,

80
0:03:27.122,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is so powerful that it can turn bad morals to good,

81
0:03:30.738,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it can turn awful practices into powerful ones,

82
0:03:33.41,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it can change men and transform them

83
0:03:35.994,000 --> 0:03:37,000
into angels.

84
0:03:38.595,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The folks who I described earlier

85
0:03:40.898,000 --> 0:03:41,000
got proper preparation in teaching,

86
0:03:42.888,000 --> 0:03:44,000
not in any college or university,

87
0:03:44.972,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but by virtue of just being in the same spaces of those who engage.

88
0:03:48.967,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Guess where those places are?

89
0:03:51.21,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Barber shops,

90
0:03:53.276,000 --> 0:03:56,000
rap concerts, and most importantly,

91
0:03:56.464,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in the black church.

92
0:03:58.112,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I've been framing this idea called Pentecostal pedagogy.

93
0:04:01.031,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Who here has been to a black church?

94
0:04:03.341,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We got a couple of hands.

95
0:04:05.65,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You go to a black church,

96
0:04:07.013,000 --> 0:04:08,000
their preacher starts off

97
0:04:08.624,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and he realizes that he has to engage the audience,

98
0:04:11.51,000 --> 0:04:12,000
so he starts off with this sort of wordplay

99
0:04:13.356,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in the beginning oftentimes,

100
0:04:15.04,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and then he takes a pause,

101
0:04:16.858,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and he says, "Oh my gosh, they're not quite paying attention."

102
0:04:19.039,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So he says, "Can I get an amen?"

103
0:04:20.64,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Audience: Amen.

104
0:04:21.626,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Chris Emdin: So I can I get an amen? Audience: Amen.

105
0:04:23.925,000 --> 0:04:26,000
CE: And all of a sudden, everybody's reawoken.

106
0:04:27.257,000 --> 0:04:29,000
That preacher bangs on the pulpit for attention.

107
0:04:29.318,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He drops his voice at a very, very low volume

108
0:04:31.978,000 --> 0:04:32,000
when he wants people to key into him,

109
0:04:33.852,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and those things are the skills that we need

110
0:04:36.108,000 --> 0:04:38,000
for the most engaging teachers.

111
0:04:38.183,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So why does teacher education

112
0:04:39.621,000 --> 0:04:41,000
only give you theory and theory

113
0:04:41.694,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and tell you about standards and tell you about

114
0:04:43.93,000 --> 0:04:44,000
all of these things that have nothing to do

115
0:04:45.874,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with the basic skills, that magic that you need

116
0:04:49.19,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to engage an audience, to engage a student?

117
0:04:52.159,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I make the argument that we reframe teacher education,

118
0:04:55.177,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that we could focus on content, and that's fine,

119
0:04:57.962,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and we could focus on theories, and that's fine,

120
0:05:00.268,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but content and theories

121
0:05:01.839,000 --> 0:05:03,000
with the absence of the magic

122
0:05:04.443,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of teaching and learning means nothing.

123
0:05:07.354,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now people oftentimes say, "Well, magic is just magic."

124
0:05:10.109,000 --> 0:05:11,000
There are teachers who,

125
0:05:11.49,000 --> 0:05:13,000
despite all their challenges, who have those skills,

126
0:05:13.954,000 --> 0:05:15,000
get into those schools and are able to engage an audience,

127
0:05:16.675,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the administrator walks by and says,

128
0:05:17.969,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Wow, he's so good, I wish all my teachers could be that good."

129
0:05:20.897,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And when they try to describe what that is,

130
0:05:22.94,000 --> 0:05:24,000
they just say, "He has that magic."

131
0:05:25.17,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But I'm here to tell you

132
0:05:26.432,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that magic can be taught.

133
0:05:28.89,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Magic can be taught.

134
0:05:31.237,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Magic can be taught.

135
0:05:34.049,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, how do you teach it?

136
0:05:35.58,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You teach it by allowing people

137
0:05:37.251,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to go into those spaces

138
0:05:38.656,000 --> 0:05:39,000
where the magic is happening.

139
0:05:40.258,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If you want to be an aspiring teacher in urban education,

140
0:05:42.99,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you've got to leave the confines of that university

141
0:05:45.272,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and go into the hood.

142
0:05:47.03,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You've got to go in there and hang out at the barbershop,

143
0:05:49.14,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you've got to attend that black church,

144
0:05:50.522,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and you've got to view those folks

145
0:05:51.977,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that have the power to engage

146
0:05:53.78,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and just take notes on what they do.

147
0:05:55.56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
At our teacher education classes at my university,

148
0:05:58.56,000 --> 0:06:,000
I've started a project where every single student

149
0:06:00.954,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that comes in there sits and watches rap concerts.

150
0:06:05.546,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They watch the way that the rappers move

151
0:06:07.769,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and talk with their hands.

152
0:06:09.302,000 --> 0:06:11,000
They study the way that he walks proudly across that stage.

153
0:06:12.282,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They listen to his metaphors and analogies,

154
0:06:14.488,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they start learning these little things

155
0:06:16.1,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that if they practice enough

156
0:06:17.9,000 --> 0:06:18,000
becomes the key to magic.

157
0:06:19.589,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They learn that if you just stare at a student

158
0:06:21.85,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and raise your eyebrow about a quarter of an inch,

159
0:06:24.353,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you don't have to say a word

160
0:06:25.82,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because they know that that means that you want more.

161
0:06:29.393,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And if we could transform teacher education

162
0:06:31.848,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to focus on teaching teachers

163
0:06:34.11,000 --> 0:06:35,000
how to create that magic

164
0:06:36.063,000 --> 0:06:39,000
then poof! we could make dead classes come alive,

165
0:06:39.86,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we could reignite imaginations,

166
0:06:41.574,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and we can change education.

167
0:06:43.29,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:16.046,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If I should have a daughter,

2
0:00:18.728,000 --> 0:00:2,000
instead of "Mom,"

3
0:00:20.863,000 --> 0:00:23,000
she's going to call me "Point B,"

4
0:00:24.188,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because that way she knows that no matter what happens,

5
0:00:26.839,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at least she can always find her way to me.

6
0:00:29.783,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands

7
0:00:33.204,000 --> 0:00:34,000
so she has to learn the entire universe

8
0:00:35.166,000 --> 0:00:38,000
before she can say, "Oh, I know that like the back of my hand."

9
0:00:38.617,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And she's going to learn

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that this life will hit you hard in the face,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach.

12
0:00:46.579,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But getting the wind knocked out of you

13
0:00:48.515,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is the only way to remind your lungs

14
0:00:50.385,000 --> 0:00:51,000
how much they like the taste of air.

15
0:00:53.011,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There is hurt, here,

16
0:00:54.56,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that cannot be fixed by Band-Aids or poetry.

17
0:00:56.924,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So the first time she realizes that Wonder Woman isn't coming,

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I'll make sure she knows

19
0:01:01.798,000 --> 0:01:03,000
she doesn't have to wear the cape all by herself,

20
0:01:04.221,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because no matter how wide you stretch your fingers,

21
0:01:06.735,000 --> 0:01:07,000
your hands will always be too small

22
0:01:08.434,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to catch all the pain you want to heal.

23
0:01:10.975,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Believe me, I've tried.

24
0:01:12.978,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"And, baby," I'll tell her,

25
0:01:14.297,000 --> 0:01:16,000
don't keep your nose up in the air like that.

26
0:01:16.439,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I know that trick; I've done it a million times.

27
0:01:18.737,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You're just smelling for smoke

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
so you can follow the trail back to a burning house,

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so you can find the boy who lost everything in the fire

30
0:01:25.903,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to see if you can save him.

31
0:01:27.833,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Or else find the boy who lit the fire in the first place,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to see if you can change him.

33
0:01:33.761,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But I know she will anyway,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so instead I'll always keep an extra supply

35
0:01:37.332,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of chocolate and rain boots nearby,

36
0:01:39.474,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because there is no heartbreak that chocolate can't fix.

37
0:01:43.418,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Okay, there's a few that chocolate can't fix.

38
0:01:45.585,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But that's what the rain boots are for,

39
0:01:47.847,000 --> 0:01:5,000
because rain will wash away everything, if you let it.

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I want her to look at the world

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
through the underside of a glass-bottom boat,

42
0:01:55.866,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to look through a microscope

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
at the galaxies that exist

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
on the pinpoint of a human mind,

45
0:02:01.459,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because that's the way my mom taught me.

46
0:02:03.491,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That there'll be days like this.

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Singing) There'll be days like this, my momma said.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
When you open your hands to catch

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and wind up with only blisters and bruises;

50
0:02:12.831,000 --> 0:02:14,000
when you step out of the phone booth and try to fly

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the very people you want to save

52
0:02:17.161,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are the ones standing on your cape;

53
0:02:18.924,000 --> 0:02:19,000
when your boots will fill with rain,

54
0:02:20.852,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and you'll be up to your knees in disappointment.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And those are the very days you have all the more reason to say thank you.

56
0:02:26.786,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Because there's nothing more beautiful

57
0:02:28.665,000 --> 0:02:3,000
than the way the ocean refuses to stop kissing the shoreline,

58
0:02:31.55,000 --> 0:02:33,000
no matter how many times it's sent away.

59
0:02:33.816,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You will put the wind in win some, lose some.

60
0:02:37.871,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You will put the star in starting over, and over.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute,

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
be sure your mind lands

63
0:02:45.91,000 --> 0:02:47,000
on the beauty of this funny place called life.

64
0:02:48.291,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And yes, on a scale from one to over-trusting,

65
0:02:51.077,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I am pretty damn naive.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But I want her to know that this world is made out of sugar.

67
0:02:56.783,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It can crumble so easily,

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
but don't be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"Baby," I'll tell her, "remember, your momma is a worrier,

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and your poppa is a warrior,

71
0:03:06.118,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and you are the girl with small hands and big eyes

72
0:03:08.504,000 --> 0:03:09,000
who never stops asking for more."

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Remember that good things come in threes

74
0:03:12.863,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and so do bad things.

75
0:03:14.768,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Always apologize when you've done something wrong,

76
0:03:17.672,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but don't you ever apologize

77
0:03:19.077,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for the way your eyes refuse to stop shining.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Your voice is small, but don't ever stop singing.

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And when they finally hand you heartache,

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when they slip war and hatred under your door

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and offer you handouts on street-corners

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of cynicism and defeat,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
you tell them that they really ought to meet your mother.

84
0:03:38.83,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Applause)

85
0:03:39.855,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Thank you. Thank you.

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Applause)

87
0:03:46.609,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Thank you.

88
0:03:47.997,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Thanks.

90
0:03:52.293,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

91
0:03:55.553,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Thank you.

92
0:03:56.76,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Applause)

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
All right, so I want you to take a moment,

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and I want you to think of three things that you know to be true.

95
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They can be about whatever you want --

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
technology, entertainment, design,

97
0:04:11.842,000 --> 0:04:12,000
your family, what you had for breakfast.

98
0:04:13.795,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The only rule is don't think too hard.

99
0:04:16.541,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Okay, ready? Go.

100
0:04:24.982,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Okay.

101
0:04:26.387,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So here are three things I know to be true.

102
0:04:28.618,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I know that Jean-Luc Godard was right when he said that,

103
0:04:31.673,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"A good story has a beginning, a middle and an end,

104
0:04:34.721,000 --> 0:04:36,000
although not necessarily in that order."

105
0:04:37.032,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I know that I'm incredibly nervous and excited to be up here,

106
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which is greatly inhibiting my ability to keep it cool.

107
0:04:43.285,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

108
0:04:44.642,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I know

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that I have been waiting all week to tell this joke.

110
0:04:49.596,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:51.176,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Why was the scarecrow invited to TED?

112
0:04:54.128,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Because he was out standing in his field.

113
0:04:57.025,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:59.803,000 --> 0:05:,000
I'm sorry.

115
0:05:02.525,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Okay, so these are three things I know to be true.

116
0:05:05.685,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But there are plenty of things I have trouble understanding.

117
0:05:08.892,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So I write poems to figure things out.

118
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Sometimes the only way I know how to work through something

119
0:05:15.094,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is by writing a poem.

120
0:05:16.571,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Sometimes I get to the end of the poem,

121
0:05:18.493,000 --> 0:05:2,000
look back and go, "Oh, that's what this is all about,"

122
0:05:21.044,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and sometimes I get to the end of the poem

123
0:05:23.085,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and haven't solved anything,

124
0:05:24.444,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but at least I have a new poem out of it.

125
0:05:26.642,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Spoken-word poetry is the art of performance poetry.

126
0:05:29.365,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I tell people it involves creating poetry

127
0:05:31.836,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that doesn't just want to sit on paper,

128
0:05:33.748,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that something about it demands it be heard out loud

129
0:05:36.581,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or witnessed in person.

130
0:05:38.509,000 --> 0:05:39,000
When I was a freshman in high school,

131
0:05:40.438,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I was a live wire of nervous hormones.

132
0:05:44.802,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I was underdeveloped and over-excitable.

133
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And despite my fear

134
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of ever being looked at for too long,

135
0:05:52.45,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I was fascinated by the idea of spoken-word poetry.

136
0:05:55.695,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I felt that my two secret loves, poetry and theater,

137
0:05:59.359,000 --> 0:06:01,000
had come together, had a baby,

138
0:06:02.312,000 --> 0:06:03,000
a baby I needed to get to know.

139
0:06:04.001,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So I decided to give it a try.

140
0:06:05.97,000 --> 0:06:06,000
My first spoken-word poem,

141
0:06:07.898,000 --> 0:06:1,000
packed with all the wisdom of a 14-year-old,

142
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
was about the injustice

143
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
of being seen as unfeminine.

144
0:06:15.286,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The poem was very indignant,

145
0:06:18.144,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and mainly exaggerated,

146
0:06:19.31,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but the only spoken-word poetry that I had seen up until that point

147
0:06:22.562,000 --> 0:06:23,000
was mainly indignant,

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
so I thought that's what was expected of me.

149
0:06:26.618,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The first time that I performed,

150
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the audience of teenagers hooted and hollered their sympathy,

151
0:06:31.773,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and when I came off the stage, I was shaking.

152
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I felt this tap on my shoulder,

153
0:06:36.171,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and I turned around to see

154
0:06:37.751,000 --> 0:06:39,000
this giant girl in a hoodie sweatshirt emerge from the crowd.

155
0:06:40.686,000 --> 0:06:41,000
She was maybe eight feet tall

156
0:06:42.125,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and looked like she could beat me up with one hand,

157
0:06:44.607,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but instead she just nodded at me and said,

158
0:06:47.79,000 --> 0:06:48,000
"Hey, I really felt that. Thanks."

159
0:06:50.774,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And lightning struck.

160
0:06:52.234,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I was hooked.

161
0:06:53.731,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I discovered this bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side

162
0:06:57.023,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that hosted a weekly poetry open Mic,

163
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and my bewildered, but supportive, parents took me

164
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to soak in every ounce of spoken word that I could.

165
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I was the youngest by at least a decade,

166
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but somehow the poets at the Bowery Poetry Club

167
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
didn't seem bothered by the 14-year-old wandering about.

168
0:07:14.505,000 --> 0:07:15,000
In fact, they welcomed me.

169
0:07:16.054,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And it was here, listening to these poets share their stories,

170
0:07:19.015,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that I learned that spoken-word poetry didn't have to be indignant,

171
0:07:22.222,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it could be fun or painful

172
0:07:24.566,000 --> 0:07:25,000
or serious or silly.

173
0:07:26.526,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The Bowery Poetry Club became my classroom and my home,

174
0:07:29.804,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and the poets who performed

175
0:07:31.464,000 --> 0:07:33,000
encouraged me to share my stories as well.

176
0:07:33.868,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Never mind the fact that I was 14.

177
0:07:35.781,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They told me, "Write about being 14."

178
0:07:38.9,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So I did and stood amazed every week

179
0:07:41.003,000 --> 0:07:43,000
when these brilliant, grown-up poets

180
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
laughed with me and groaned their sympathy

181
0:07:45.285,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and clapped and told me, "Hey, I really felt that too."

182
0:07:49.421,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Now I can divide my spoken-word journey

183
0:07:52.687,000 --> 0:07:53,000
into three steps.

184
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Step one was the moment I said,

185
0:07:56.101,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"I can. I can do this."

186
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And that was thanks to a girl in a hoodie.

187
0:08:00.471,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Step two was the moment I said,

188
0:08:02.55,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"I will. I will continue.

189
0:08:04.742,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I love spoken word. I will keep coming back week after week."

190
0:08:07.646,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And step three began

191
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
when I realized I didn't have to write indignant poems,

192
0:08:12.084,000 --> 0:08:13,000
if that's not what I was.

193
0:08:13.506,000 --> 0:08:15,000
There were things that were specific to me,

194
0:08:15.695,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and the more that I focused on those things,

195
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the weirder my poetry got,

196
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but the more that it felt like mine.

197
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It's not just the adage "Write what you know."

198
0:08:25.982,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's about gathering up all of the knowledge and experience

199
0:08:28.831,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you've collected up to now

200
0:08:30.466,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to help you dive into the things you don't know.

201
0:08:33.229,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I use poetry to help me work through what I don't understand,

202
0:08:36.136,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but I show up to each new poem

203
0:08:38.105,000 --> 0:08:41,000
with a backpack full of everywhere else that I've been.

204
0:08:41.726,000 --> 0:08:43,000
When I got to university, I met a fellow poet

205
0:08:44.475,000 --> 0:08:47,000
who shared my belief in the magic of spoken-word poetry.

206
0:08:47.991,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And actually, Phil Kaye and I

207
0:08:50.009,000 --> 0:08:52,000
coincidentally also share the same last name.

208
0:08:52.626,000 --> 0:08:54,000
When I was in high school I had created Project V.O.I.C.E.

209
0:08:55.385,000 --> 0:08:57,000
as a way to encourage my friends to do spoken word with me.

210
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
But Phil and I decided to reinvent Project V.O.I.C.E.,

211
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
this time changing the mission

212
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to using spoken-word poetry as a way to entertain,

213
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
educate and inspire.

214
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We stayed full-time students, but in between we traveled,

215
0:09:10.999,000 --> 0:09:11,000
performing and teaching

216
0:09:12.851,000 --> 0:09:14,000
nine-year-olds to MFA candidates,

217
0:09:15.259,000 --> 0:09:18,000
from California to Indiana to India

218
0:09:18.629,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to a public high school just up the street from campus.

219
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And we saw over and over

220
0:09:23.261,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the way that spoken-word poetry

221
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
cracks open locks.

222
0:09:27.361,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But it turns out sometimes, poetry can be really scary.

223
0:09:32.083,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Turns out sometimes,

224
0:09:33.599,000 --> 0:09:35,000
you have to trick teenagers into writing poetry.

225
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So I came up with lists. Everyone can write lists.

226
0:09:39.749,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And the first list that I assign

227
0:09:41.799,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is "10 Things I Know to be True."

228
0:09:45.082,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And here's what happens, you would discover it too

229
0:09:47.462,000 --> 0:09:49,000
if we all started sharing our lists out loud.

230
0:09:49.605,000 --> 0:09:54,000
At a certain point, you would realize that someone has the exact same thing,

231
0:09:54.959,000 --> 0:09:55,000
or one thing very similar,

232
0:09:56.96,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to something on your list.

233
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And then someone else

234
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
has something the complete opposite of yours.

235
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Third, someone has something you've never even heard of before.

236
0:10:06.284,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Fourth, someone has something you thought you knew everything about,

237
0:10:09.753,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but they're introducing a new angle of looking at it.

238
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I tell people that this is where great stories start from --

239
0:10:15.332,000 --> 0:10:17,000
these four intersections

240
0:10:17.484,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of what you're passionate about

241
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and what others might be invested in.

242
0:10:21.667,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And most people respond really well to this exercise.

243
0:10:24.936,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But one of my students, a freshman named Charlotte,

244
0:10:27.405,000 --> 0:10:28,000
was not convinced.

245
0:10:29.301,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Charlotte was very good at writing lists, but she refused to write any poems.

246
0:10:32.951,000 --> 0:10:34,000
"Miss," she'd say, "I'm just not interesting.

247
0:10:35.263,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I don't have anything interesting to say."

248
0:10:38.371,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So I assigned her list after list,

249
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and one day I assigned the list

250
0:10:41.935,000 --> 0:10:42,000
"10 Things I Should Have Learned by Now."

251
0:10:44.553,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Number three on Charlotte's list was,

252
0:10:46.487,000 --> 0:10:48,000
"I should have learned not to crush on guys

253
0:10:48.528,000 --> 0:10:49,000
three times my age."

254
0:10:50.955,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I asked her what that meant,

255
0:10:52.352,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and she said, "Miss, it's kind of a long story."

256
0:10:54.814,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And I said, "Charlotte, it sounds pretty interesting to me."

257
0:10:57.662,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And so she wrote her first poem,

258
0:10:59.44,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a love poem unlike any I had ever heard before.

259
0:11:03.041,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And the poem began,

260
0:11:05.486,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"Anderson Cooper is a gorgeous man."

261
0:11:07.628,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

262
0:11:10.121,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"Did you see him on 60 Minutes,

263
0:11:11.762,000 --> 0:11:12,000
racing Michael Phelps in a pool --

264
0:11:13.566,000 --> 0:11:14,000
nothing but swim trunks on --

265
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
diving in the water, determined to beat this swimming champion?

266
0:11:18.416,000 --> 0:11:2,000
After the race, he tossed his wet, cloud-white hair

267
0:11:20.829,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and said, 'You're a god.'

268
0:11:22.112,000 --> 0:11:24,000
No, Anderson, you're the god."

269
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

270
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

271
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now, I know that the number one rule to being cool

272
0:11:34.076,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is to seem unfazed,

273
0:11:35.987,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to never admit that anything scares you

274
0:11:39.207,000 --> 0:11:4,000
or impresses you or excites you.

275
0:11:40.84,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Somebody once told me

276
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
it's like walking through life like this.

277
0:11:44.433,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You protect yourself

278
0:11:45.831,000 --> 0:11:48,000
from all the unexpected miseries or hurt that might show up.

279
0:11:49.093,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But I try to walk through life like this.

280
0:11:51.747,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And yes, that means catching all of those miseries and hurt,

281
0:11:54.638,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but it also means that when beautiful, amazing things

282
0:11:58.388,000 --> 0:11:59,000
just fall out of the sky,

283
0:11:59.829,000 --> 0:12:,000
I'm ready to catch them.

284
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I use spoken word to help my students

285
0:12:03.665,000 --> 0:12:04,000
rediscover wonder,

286
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed

287
0:12:08.05,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and, instead, actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them,

288
0:12:11.589,000 --> 0:12:14,000
so that they can reinterpret and create something from it.

289
0:12:14.906,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's not that I think that spoken-word poetry

290
0:12:17.223,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is the ideal art form.

291
0:12:18.723,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I'm always trying to find the best way to tell each story.

292
0:12:21.882,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I write musicals; I make short films alongside my poems.

293
0:12:24.931,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But I teach spoken-word poetry

294
0:12:27.129,000 --> 0:12:28,000
because it's accessible.

295
0:12:29.098,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Not everyone can read music or owns a camera,

296
0:12:32.57,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but everyone can communicate in some way,

297
0:12:34.959,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and everyone has stories that the rest of us can learn from.

298
0:12:38.76,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Plus, spoken-word poetry allows for immediate connection.

299
0:12:42.016,000 --> 0:12:44,000
It's not uncommon to feel like you're alone

300
0:12:44.235,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or that nobody understands you,

301
0:12:45.852,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but spoken word teaches

302
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that if you have the ability to express yourself

303
0:12:50.015,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and the courage to present those stories and opinions,

304
0:12:52.856,000 --> 0:12:53,000
you could be rewarded

305
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
with a room full of your peers,

306
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
or your community, who will listen.

307
0:12:58.57,000 --> 0:13:,000
And maybe even a giant girl in a hoodie

308
0:13:00.889,000 --> 0:13:02,000
who will connect with what you've shared.

309
0:13:02.959,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And that is an amazing realization to have,

310
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
especially when you're 14.

311
0:13:07.726,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Plus, now with YouTube,

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that connection's not even limited to the room we're in.

313
0:13:11.926,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I'm so lucky that there's this archive of performances

314
0:13:15.172,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that I can share with my students.

315
0:13:16.86,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It allows for even more opportunities

316
0:13:19.329,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for them to find a poet or a poem that they connect to.

317
0:13:23.127,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Once you've figured this out,

318
0:13:25.618,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it is tempting to keep writing the same poem,

319
0:13:27.785,000 --> 0:13:29,000
or keep telling the same story, over and over,

320
0:13:29.992,000 --> 0:13:31,000
once you've figured out that it will gain you applause.

321
0:13:32.595,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It's not enough to just teach that you can express yourself.

322
0:13:35.602,000 --> 0:13:36,000
You have to grow and explore

323
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and take risks and challenge yourself.

324
0:13:39.581,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And that is step three:

325
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
infusing the work you're doing

326
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
with the specific things that make you you,

327
0:13:46.332,000 --> 0:13:48,000
even while those things are always changing.

328
0:13:48.969,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Because step three never ends.

329
0:13:51.809,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But you don't get to start on step three,

330
0:13:53.837,000 --> 0:13:55,000
until you take step one first:

331
0:13:56.025,000 --> 0:13:57,000
"I can."

332
0:13:57.062,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I travel a lot while I'm teaching,

333
0:13:58.808,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and I don't always get to watch all of my students reach their step three,

334
0:14:02.334,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but I was very lucky with Charlotte,

335
0:14:04.076,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that I got to watch her journey unfold the way it did.

336
0:14:06.74,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I watched her realize

337
0:14:08.096,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that, by putting the things that she knows to be true into the work she's doing,

338
0:14:11.896,000 --> 0:14:13,000
she can create poems that only Charlotte can write,

339
0:14:14.36,000 --> 0:14:16,000
about eyeballs and elevators and Dora the Explorer.

340
0:14:17.672,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And I'm trying to tell stories only I can tell --

341
0:14:20.037,000 --> 0:14:21,000
like this story.

342
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to tell this story,

343
0:14:24.548,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and I wondered if the best way

344
0:14:26.014,000 --> 0:14:28,000
was going to be a PowerPoint, a short film --

345
0:14:28.141,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And where exactly was the beginning, the middle or the end?

346
0:14:30.942,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I wondered whether I'd get to the end of this talk

347
0:14:33.339,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and finally have figured it all out, or not.

348
0:14:36.568,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And I always thought that my beginning was at the Bowery Poetry Club,

349
0:14:39.856,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but it's possible that it was much earlier.

350
0:14:41.956,000 --> 0:14:42,000
In preparing for TED,

351
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I discovered this diary page in an old journal.

352
0:14:45.523,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I think December 54th was probably supposed to be 24th.

353
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It's clear that when I was a child,

354
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I definitely walked through life like this.

355
0:14:53.537,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I think that we all did.

356
0:14:55.323,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I would like to help others rediscover that wonder --

357
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
to want to engage with it, to want to learn,

358
0:15:00.749,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to want to share what they've learned,

359
0:15:02.66,000 --> 0:15:03,000
what they've figured out to be true

360
0:15:04.36,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and what they're still figuring out.

361
0:15:06.36,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So I'd like to close with this poem.

362
0:15:10.066,000 --> 0:15:12,000
When they bombed Hiroshima,

363
0:15:12.671,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the explosion formed a mini-supernova,

364
0:15:15.75,000 --> 0:15:18,000
so every living animal, human or plant

365
0:15:18.828,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that received direct contact with the rays from that sun

366
0:15:22.53,000 --> 0:15:23,000
was instantly turned to ash.

367
0:15:24.412,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And what was left of the city soon followed.

368
0:15:26.525,000 --> 0:15:28,000
The long-lasting damage of nuclear radiation

369
0:15:28.953,000 --> 0:15:3,000
caused an entire city and its population

370
0:15:31.894,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to turn into powder.

371
0:15:34.406,000 --> 0:15:37,000
When I was born, my mom says I looked around the whole hospital room

372
0:15:38.043,000 --> 0:15:41,000
with a stare that said, "This? I've done this before."

373
0:15:41.684,000 --> 0:15:42,000
She says I have old eyes.

374
0:15:43.6,000 --> 0:15:45,000
When my Grandpa Genji died, I was only five years old,

375
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
but I took my mom by the hand and told her,

376
0:15:48.433,000 --> 0:15:5,000
"Don't worry, he'll come back as a baby."

377
0:15:51.544,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And yet, for someone who's apparently done this already,

378
0:15:54.732,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I still haven't figured anything out yet.

379
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
My knees still buckle every time I get on a stage.

380
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
My self-confidence can be measured out

381
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
in teaspoons mixed into my poetry,

382
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and it still always tastes funny in my mouth.

383
0:16:07.562,000 --> 0:16:1,000
But in Hiroshima, some people were wiped clean away,

384
0:16:10.807,000 --> 0:16:12,000
leaving only a wristwatch or a diary page.

385
0:16:13.585,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So no matter that I have inhibitions to fill all my pockets,

386
0:16:17.041,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I keep trying,

387
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
hoping that one day I'll write a poem

388
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I can be proud to let sit in a museum exhibit

389
0:16:22.427,000 --> 0:16:24,000
as the only proof I existed.

390
0:16:25.115,000 --> 0:16:28,000
My parents named me Sarah, which is a biblical name.

391
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
In the original story, God told Sarah she could do something impossible, and --

392
0:16:33.085,000 --> 0:16:34,000
she laughed,

393
0:16:34.363,000 --> 0:16:35,000
because the first Sarah,

394
0:16:35.964,000 --> 0:16:37,000
she didn't know what to do with impossible.

395
0:16:38.332,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And me?

396
0:16:39.716,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Well, neither do I,

397
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
but I see the impossible every day.

398
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Impossible is trying to connect in this world,

399
0:16:46.189,000 --> 0:16:49,000
trying to hold onto others while things are blowing up around you,

400
0:16:49.317,000 --> 0:16:5,000
knowing that while you're speaking,

401
0:16:51.017,000 --> 0:16:54,000
they aren't just waiting for their turn to talk -- they hear you.

402
0:16:54.099,000 --> 0:16:55,000
They feel exactly what you feel

403
0:16:55.614,000 --> 0:16:56,000
at the same time that you feel it.

404
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
It's what I strive for every time I open my mouth --

405
0:16:59.761,000 --> 0:17:01,000
that impossible connection.

406
0:17:01.865,000 --> 0:17:03,000
There's this piece of wall in Hiroshima

407
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
that was completely burnt black by the radiation.

408
0:17:07.026,000 --> 0:17:09,000
But on the front step, a person who was sitting there

409
0:17:09.724,000 --> 0:17:11,000
blocked the rays from hitting the stone.

410
0:17:12.018,000 --> 0:17:13,000
The only thing left now

411
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
is a permanent shadow of positive light.

412
0:17:16.185,000 --> 0:17:17,000
After the A-bomb,

413
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
specialists said it would take 75 years

414
0:17:19.872,000 --> 0:17:21,000
for the radiation-damaged soil of Hiroshima City

415
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
to ever grow anything again.

416
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
But that spring, there were new buds popping up from the earth.

417
0:17:27.649,000 --> 0:17:29,000
When I meet you, in that moment,

418
0:17:29.676,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I'm no longer a part of your future.

419
0:17:31.536,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I start quickly becoming part of your past.

420
0:17:33.799,000 --> 0:17:35,000
But in that instant, I get to share your present.

421
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And you, you get to share mine.

422
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And that is the greatest present of all.

423
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So if you tell me I can do the impossible --

424
0:17:43.154,000 --> 0:17:44,000
I'll probably laugh at you.

425
0:17:44.672,000 --> 0:17:46,000
I don't know if I can change the world yet,

426
0:17:46.784,000 --> 0:17:48,000
because I don't know that much about it --

427
0:17:48.827,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and I don't know that much about reincarnation either,

428
0:17:51.441,000 --> 0:17:52,000
but if you make me laugh hard enough,

429
0:17:53.309,000 --> 0:17:55,000
sometimes I forget what century I'm in.

430
0:17:55.561,000 --> 0:17:58,000
This isn't my first time here. This isn't my last time here.

431
0:17:59.044,000 --> 0:18:,000
These aren't the last words I'll share.

432
0:18:00.98,000 --> 0:18:02,000
But just in case, I'm trying my hardest

433
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
to get it right this time around.

434
0:18:06.156,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Thank you.

435
0:18:07.283,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Applause)

436
0:18:09.137,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Thank you.

437
0:18:10.193,000 --> 0:18:13,000
(Applause)

438
0:18:13.45,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Thank you.

439
0:18:14.621,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

440
0:18:17.482,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Thank you.

441
0:18:18.626,000 --> 0:18:2,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.868,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was a young boy,

3
0:00:14.654,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I used to gaze through the microscope of my father

4
0:00:17.262,000 --> 0:00:2,000
at the insects in amber that he kept in the house.

5
0:00:20.62,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And they were remarkably well preserved,

6
0:00:23.177,000 --> 0:00:25,000
morphologically just phenomenal.

7
0:00:25.422,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And we used to imagine that someday,

8
0:00:27.616,000 --> 0:00:28,000
they would actually come to life

9
0:00:29.225,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and they would crawl out of the resin,

10
0:00:31.222,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and, if they could, they would fly away.

11
0:00:33.966,000 --> 0:00:35,000
If you had asked me 10 years ago whether or not

12
0:00:36.342,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals,

13
0:00:39.54,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I would have told you, it's unlikely.

14
0:00:42.015,000 --> 0:00:43,000
If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able

15
0:00:43.91,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to revive an extinct species,

16
0:00:46.062,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I would have said, pipe dream.

17
0:00:47.721,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But I'm actually standing here today, amazingly,

18
0:00:50.246,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to tell you that not only is the sequencing

19
0:00:52.253,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of extinct genomes a possibility, actually a modern-day reality,

20
0:00:56.443,000 --> 0:01:,000
but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach,

21
0:01:00.736,000 --> 0:01:01,000
maybe not from the insects in amber --

22
0:01:02.575,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in fact, this mosquito was actually used

23
0:01:04.535,000 --> 0:01:06,000
for the inspiration for "Jurassic Park" —

24
0:01:06.887,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but from woolly mammoths, the well preserved remains

25
0:01:09.447,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of woolly mammoths in the permafrost.

26
0:01:11.654,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Woollies are a particularly interesting,

27
0:01:13.727,000 --> 0:01:15,000
quintessential image of the Ice Age.

28
0:01:16.273,000 --> 0:01:17,000
They were large. They were hairy.

29
0:01:18.098,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They had large tusks, and we seem to have

30
0:01:20.082,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a very deep connection with them, like we do with elephants.

31
0:01:22.982,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Maybe it's because elephants share

32
0:01:25.497,000 --> 0:01:26,000
many things in common with us.

33
0:01:27.319,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin.

34
0:01:30.047,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They have social knits that are very close.

35
0:01:33.067,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time,

36
0:01:35.937,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because elephants, like us, share their origins in Africa

37
0:01:39.275,000 --> 0:01:41,000
some seven million years ago,

38
0:01:41.398,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and as habitats changed and environments changed,

39
0:01:44.192,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we actually, like the elephants, migrated out

40
0:01:47.802,000 --> 0:01:49,000
into Europe and Asia.

41
0:01:50.022,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene

42
0:01:52.725,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is meridionalis, which was standing four meters tall

43
0:01:56.131,000 --> 0:01:59,000
weighing about 10 tons, and was a woodland-adapted species

44
0:01:59.963,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia,

45
0:02:02.925,000 --> 0:02:04,000
across the Bering land bridge

46
0:02:05.175,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and into parts of North America.

47
0:02:07.485,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And then, again, as climate changed as it always does,

48
0:02:10.173,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and new habitats opened up,

49
0:02:11.683,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we had the arrival of a steppe-adapted species

50
0:02:14.159,000 --> 0:02:16,000
called trogontherii in Central Asia

51
0:02:16.407,000 --> 0:02:18,000
pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe.

52
0:02:19.157,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And the open grassland savannas of North America

53
0:02:21.552,000 --> 0:02:23,000
opened up, leading to the Columbian mammoth,

54
0:02:23.712,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a large, hairless species in North America.

55
0:02:26.252,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And it was really only about 500,000 years later

56
0:02:29.163,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that we had the arrival of the woolly,

57
0:02:31.868,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the one that we all know and love so much,

58
0:02:33.896,000 --> 0:02:36,000
spreading from an East Beringian point of origin

59
0:02:37.206,000 --> 0:02:39,000
across Central Asia, again pushing the trogontherii

60
0:02:40.092,000 --> 0:02:41,000
out through Central Europe,

61
0:02:41.743,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and over hundreds of thousands of years

62
0:02:43.809,000 --> 0:02:46,000
migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge

63
0:02:46.893,000 --> 0:02:48,000
during times of glacial peaks

64
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and coming into direct contact

65
0:02:50.716,000 --> 0:02:52,000
with the Columbian relatives living in the south,

66
0:02:53.52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years

67
0:02:56.808,000 --> 0:02:58,000
during traumatic climatic shifts.

68
0:02:58.985,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions

69
0:03:03.201,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in temperature and environment, and doing very, very well.

70
0:03:06.049,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And there they survive on the mainland until about 10,000 years ago,

71
0:03:10.04,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and actually, surprisingly, on the small islands off of Siberia

72
0:03:13.193,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and Alaska until about 3,000 years ago.

73
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So Egyptians are building pyramids

74
0:03:17.356,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and woollies are still living on islands.

75
0:03:20.122,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And then they disappear.

76
0:03:21.671,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Like 99 percent of all the animals that have once lived,

77
0:03:23.925,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they go extinct, likely due to a warming climate

78
0:03:27.204,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and fast-encroaching dense forests

79
0:03:29.286,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that are migrating north,

80
0:03:30.787,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and also, as the late, great Paul Martin once put it,

81
0:03:33.76,000 --> 0:03:34,000
probably Pleistocene overkill,

82
0:03:35.511,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so the large game hunters that took them down.

83
0:03:38.084,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Fortunately, we find millions of their remains

84
0:03:40.346,000 --> 0:03:42,000
strewn across the permafrost buried deep

85
0:03:43.023,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in Siberia and Alaska, and we can actually go up there

86
0:03:46.148,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and actually take them out.

87
0:03:48.058,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And the preservation is, again,

88
0:03:49.582,000 --> 0:03:51,000
like those insects in [amber], phenomenal.

89
0:03:52.152,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So you have teeth, bones with blood

90
0:03:55.672,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which look like blood, you have hair,

91
0:03:57.712,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and you have intact carcasses or heads

92
0:03:59.239,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which still have brains in them.

93
0:04:02.182,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So the preservation and the survival of DNA

94
0:04:04.553,000 --> 0:04:06,000
depends on many factors, and I have to admit,

95
0:04:06.625,000 --> 0:04:08,000
most of which we still don't quite understand,

96
0:04:08.953,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but depending upon when an organism dies

97
0:04:11.025,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and how quickly he's buried, the depth of that burial,

98
0:04:15.514,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment,

99
0:04:18.816,000 --> 0:04:2,000
will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive

100
0:04:21.384,000 --> 0:04:23,000
over geologically meaningful time frames.

101
0:04:24.245,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And it's probably surprising to many of you

102
0:04:25.889,000 --> 0:04:28,000
sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters,

103
0:04:29.029,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it's not the length of preservation,

104
0:04:30.656,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most.

105
0:04:34.638,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So if we were to go deep now within the bones

106
0:04:37.457,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process,

107
0:04:40.432,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the DNA which was once intact, tightly wrapped

108
0:04:43.824,000 --> 0:04:45,000
around histone proteins, is now under attack

109
0:04:46.192,000 --> 0:04:48,000
by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth

110
0:04:49.158,000 --> 0:04:5,000
for years during its lifetime.

111
0:04:50.968,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So those bacteria, along with the environmental bacteria,

112
0:04:54.169,000 --> 0:04:57,000
free water and oxygen, actually break apart the DNA

113
0:04:57.872,000 --> 0:04:59,000
into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments,

114
0:05:00.417,000 --> 0:05:02,000
until all you have are fragments that range

115
0:05:02.738,000 --> 0:05:04,000
from 10 base pairs to, in the best case scenarios,

116
0:05:05.419,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a few hundred base pairs in length.

117
0:05:07.792,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So most fossils out there in the fossil record

118
0:05:10.103,000 --> 0:05:12,000
are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures.

119
0:05:12.816,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But a few of them actually have DNA fragments

120
0:05:15.249,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that survive for thousands,

121
0:05:17.123,000 --> 0:05:2,000
even a few millions of years in time.

122
0:05:20.872,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And using state-of-the-art clean room technology,

123
0:05:23.06,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs

124
0:05:25.724,000 --> 0:05:27,000
away from all the rest of the gunk in there,

125
0:05:28.228,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room

126
0:05:30.427,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth

127
0:05:32.548,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA,

128
0:05:35.547,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth,

129
0:05:39.358,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and, more complicated, I'll get all the DNA

130
0:05:41.605,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that survived in that environment with it,

131
0:05:43.789,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so the bacteria, the fungi, and so on and so forth.

132
0:05:46.963,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Not surprising then again that a mammoth

133
0:05:49.368,000 --> 0:05:5,000
preserved in the permafrost will have something

134
0:05:51.04,000 --> 0:05:53,000
on the order of 50 percent of its DNA being mammoth,

135
0:05:53.908,000 --> 0:05:55,000
whereas something like the Columbian mammoth,

136
0:05:55.931,000 --> 0:05:57,000
living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment

137
0:05:58.548,000 --> 0:06:01,000
over its laying-in will only have 3 to 10 percent endogenous.

138
0:06:02.365,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But we've come up with very clever ways

139
0:06:04.808,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that we can actually discriminate, capture and discriminate,

140
0:06:07.914,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the mammoth from the non-mammoth DNA,

141
0:06:09.889,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and with the advances in high-throughput sequencing,

142
0:06:12.439,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we can actually pull out and bioinformatically

143
0:06:15.276,000 --> 0:06:17,000
re-jig all these small mammoth fragments

144
0:06:18.245,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and place them onto a backbone

145
0:06:20.542,000 --> 0:06:22,000
of an Asian or African elephant chromosome.

146
0:06:23.101,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And so by doing that, we can actually get all the little points

147
0:06:25.677,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant,

148
0:06:28.502,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and what do we know, then, about a mammoth?

149
0:06:31.541,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Well, the mammoth genome is almost at full completion,

150
0:06:34.694,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth.

151
0:06:38.235,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs,

152
0:06:41.42,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but an elephant and mammoth genome

153
0:06:42.997,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is about two billion base pairs larger, and most of that

154
0:06:45.653,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is composed of small, repetitive DNAs

155
0:06:48.277,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that make it very difficult to actually re-jig the entire structure of the genome.

156
0:06:52.91,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So having this information allows us to answer

157
0:06:55.271,000 --> 0:06:57,000
one of the interesting relationship questions

158
0:06:57.406,000 --> 0:06:59,000
between mammoths and their living relatives,

159
0:06:59.578,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the African and the Asian elephant,

160
0:07:01.622,000 --> 0:07:04,000
all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago,

161
0:07:04.789,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share

162
0:07:06.878,000 --> 0:07:08,000
a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants

163
0:07:09.658,000 --> 0:07:1,000
about six million years ago,

164
0:07:11.074,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so slightly closer to the Asian elephant.

165
0:07:13.547,000 --> 0:07:15,000
With advances in ancient DNA technology,

166
0:07:16.271,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we can actually now start to begin to sequence

167
0:07:18.224,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned,

168
0:07:21.535,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and I just wanted to talk about two of them,

169
0:07:23.422,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the woolly and the Columbian mammoth,

170
0:07:25.476,000 --> 0:07:27,000
both of which were living very close to each other

171
0:07:27.894,000 --> 0:07:29,000
during glacial peaks,

172
0:07:30.519,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so when the glaciers were massive in North America,

173
0:07:32.682,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones,

174
0:07:35.277,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and came into contact with the relatives living to the south,

175
0:07:38.488,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and there they shared refugia,

176
0:07:40.5,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and a little bit more than the refugia, it turns out.

177
0:07:42.884,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It looks like they were interbreeding.

178
0:07:45.384,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And that this is not an uncommon feature

179
0:07:47.017,000 --> 0:07:48,000
in Proboscideans, because it turns out

180
0:07:48.655,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that large savanna male elephants will outcompete

181
0:07:51.568,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the smaller forest elephants for their females.

182
0:07:54.936,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So large, hairless Columbians

183
0:07:57.248,000 --> 0:07:58,000
outcompeting the smaller male woollies.

184
0:07:59.051,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It reminds me a bit of high school, unfortunately.

185
0:08:01.669,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:04.008,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So this is not trivial, given the idea that we want

187
0:08:06.702,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to revive extinct species, because it turns out

188
0:08:08.907,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that an African and an Asian elephant

189
0:08:10.727,000 --> 0:08:12,000
can actually interbreed and have live young,

190
0:08:12.822,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo

191
0:08:14.963,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in Chester, U.K., in 1978.

192
0:08:18.005,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes,

193
0:08:21.151,000 --> 0:08:23,000
modify them into all those positions we've actually now

194
0:08:23.309,000 --> 0:08:25,000
been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome,

195
0:08:25.693,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we can put that into an enucleated cell,

196
0:08:28.474,000 --> 0:08:3,000
differentiate that into a stem cell,

197
0:08:30.733,000 --> 0:08:32,000
subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm,

198
0:08:33.053,000 --> 0:08:35,000
artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg,

199
0:08:35.677,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and over a long and arduous procedure,

200
0:08:38.784,000 --> 0:08:41,000
actually bring back something that looks like this.

201
0:08:42.293,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, this wouldn't be an exact replica,

202
0:08:43.983,000 --> 0:08:45,000
because the short DNA fragments that I told you about

203
0:08:46.465,000 --> 0:08:48,000
will prevent us from building the exact structure,

204
0:08:48.946,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but it would make something that looked and felt

205
0:08:50.482,000 --> 0:08:53,000
very much like a woolly mammoth did.

206
0:08:53.589,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now, when I bring up this with my friends,

207
0:08:56.333,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we often talk about, well, where would you put it?

208
0:08:58.941,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Where are you going to house a mammoth?

209
0:09:00.629,000 --> 0:09:02,000
There's no climates or habitats suitable.

210
0:09:02.669,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Well, that's not actually the case.

211
0:09:04.009,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It turns out that there are swaths of habitat

212
0:09:06.902,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in the north of Siberia and Yukon

213
0:09:09.237,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that actually could house a mammoth.

214
0:09:10.443,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Remember, this was a highly plastic animal

215
0:09:12.688,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that lived over tremendous climate variation.

216
0:09:15.349,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So this landscape would be easily able to house it,

217
0:09:18.231,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and I have to admit that there [is] a part of the child in me,

218
0:09:21.891,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the boy in me, that would love to see

219
0:09:23.176,000 --> 0:09:25,000
these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost

220
0:09:26.022,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of the north once again, but I do have to admit

221
0:09:28.477,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders

222
0:09:30.621,000 --> 0:09:32,000
whether or not we should.

223
0:09:33.026,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Thank you very much.

224
0:09:34.711,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Applause)

225
0:09:39.909,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Ryan Phelan: Don't go away.

226
0:09:41.426,000 --> 0:09:42,000
You've left us with a question.

227
0:09:43.158,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say, "Should we?"

228
0:09:46.682,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it feels like you're reticent there,

229
0:09:49.291,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible.

230
0:09:52.269,000 --> 0:09:53,000
What's your reticence?

231
0:09:53.595,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Hendrik Poinar: I don't think it's reticence.

232
0:09:54.901,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I think it's just that we have to think very deeply

233
0:09:58.699,000 --> 0:10:,000
about the implications, ramifications of our actions,

234
0:10:01.25,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and so as long as we have good, deep discussion

235
0:10:03.45,000 --> 0:10:05,000
like we're having now, I think

236
0:10:05.466,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it.

237
0:10:08.172,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But I just want to make sure that we spend time

238
0:10:09.809,000 --> 0:10:1,000
thinking about why we're doing it first.

239
0:10:11.658,000 --> 0:10:13,000
RP: Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much, Hendrik.

240
0:10:14.439,000 --> 0:10:16,000
HP: Thank you. (Applause)

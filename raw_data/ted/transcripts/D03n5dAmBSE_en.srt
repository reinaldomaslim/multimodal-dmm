0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
By the end of this year,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that actively use social networking sites.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The one thing that all of them have in common

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is that they're going to die.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I think it has some really profound implications

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that are worth exploring.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What first got me thinking about this

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
who was a science and technology journalist

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who died of cancer.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that went out shortly after he died.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Here's what he wrote in starting that out.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
He said, "Here it is. I'm dead,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and this is my last post to my blog.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In advance, I asked that once my body finally shut down

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
from the punishments of my cancer,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote --

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the first part of the process

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of turning this from an active website to an archive."

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now, while as a journalist,

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Miller's archive may have been better written

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and more carefully curated than most,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the fact of the matter is that all of us today

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
are creating an archive

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that's something completely different

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
than anything that's been created

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
by any previous generation.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Consider a few stats for a moment.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Right now there are 48 hours of video

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
being uploaded to YouTube every single minute.

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And the average Facebook user

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is creating 90 pieces of content each month.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
at best they may have created

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
some photos or home videos,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital archive

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
years after we're gone.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for technologists.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist,

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so what I'd like to do briefly

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is paint a picture

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of what the present and the future are going to look like.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Now we're already seeing some services

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that are designed to let us decide

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
after we die.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
One of them actually, fittingly enough,

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
found me when I checked into a deli

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
at a restaurant in New York

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
on foursquare.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Recording) Adam Ostrow: Hello.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Death: Adam?

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
AO: Yeah.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
even at the Organic.

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
AO: Who is this?

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Death: Go to ifidie.net

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
before it's too late.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right?

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So what that service does, quite simply,

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is let you create a message or a video

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that can be posted to Facebook after you die.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Another service right now

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is called 1,000 Memories.

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones,

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
complete with photos and videos and stories

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that they can post after you die.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But what I think comes next is far more interesting.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
who, back in March,

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I think as machines' ability

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to understand human language and process vast amounts of data

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
continues to improve,

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
it's going to become possible

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to analyze an entire life's worth of content --

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog posts --

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that we're producing in such massive numbers.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And I think as that happens,

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's going to become possible for our digital personas

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to continue to interact in the real world long after we're gone

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and technology's ability to make sense of it all.

92
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
One service called My Next Tweet

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've posted onto Twitter,

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to make some predictions as to what you might say next.

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Well right now, as you can see,

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the results can be somewhat comical.

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You can imagine what something like this might look like

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
five, 10 or 20 years from now

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
as our technical capabilities improve.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Taking it a step further,

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
MIT's media lab is working on robots

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that can interact more like humans.

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But what if those robots were able to interact

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
based on the unique characteristics of a specific person

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that person produces in their lifetime?

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Finally, think back to this famous scene

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
from election night 2008

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
back in the United States,

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where CNN beamed a live hologram

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for an interview with Anderson Cooper.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
What if we were able to use that same type of technology

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms --

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
interacting in a very lifelike way

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
based on all the content they created while they were alive?

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I think that's going to become completely possible

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as the amount of data we're producing

120
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and technology's ability to understand it

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
both expand exponentially.

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now in closing, I think what we all need to be thinking about

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is if we want that to become our reality --

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and if so,

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it.

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Thank you very much.

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Applause)

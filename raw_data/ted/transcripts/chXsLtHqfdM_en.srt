0:00:16.495,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --

3
0:00:19.974,000 --> 0:00:22,000
my life -- has been shaped

4
0:00:23.959,000 --> 0:00:28,000
by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.

5
0:00:29.783,000 --> 0:00:32,000
From 1971 to 1977 --

6
0:00:33.304,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I look young, but I'm not — (Laughter) --

7
0:00:37.184,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia,

8
0:00:42.117,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in projects of technical cooperation with African countries.

9
0:00:46.334,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I worked for an Italian NGO,

10
0:00:49.452,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and every single project that we set up in Africa

11
0:00:55.602,000 --> 0:00:58,000
failed.

12
0:00:59.046,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I was distraught.

13
0:01:03.19,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people

14
0:01:07.438,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and we were doing good work in Africa.

15
0:01:10.82,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Instead, everything we touched we killed.

16
0:01:17.833,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book,

17
0:01:22.936,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"Ripples from the Zambezi,"

18
0:01:25.824,000 --> 0:01:27,000
was a project where we Italians

19
0:01:28.389,000 --> 0:01:33,000
decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food.

20
0:01:34.31,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia

21
0:01:38.659,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in this absolutely magnificent valley

22
0:01:42.139,000 --> 0:01:45,000
going down to the Zambezi River,

23
0:01:45.392,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes

24
0:01:49.02,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and zucchini and ...

25
0:01:51.811,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest

26
0:01:54.006,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,

27
0:01:56.921,000 --> 0:02:,000
and sometimes they would show up. (Laughter)

28
0:02:01.056,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And we were amazed that the local people,

29
0:02:03.783,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.

30
0:02:06.87,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But instead of asking them how come they were not

31
0:02:10.078,000 --> 0:02:14,000
growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." (Laughter)

32
0:02:14.1,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation."

33
0:02:18.768,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully.

34
0:02:22.228,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato

35
0:02:24.886,000 --> 0:02:27,000
would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.

36
0:02:28.495,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,

37
0:02:31.316,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"Look how easy agriculture is."

38
0:02:33.788,000 --> 0:02:36,000
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,

39
0:02:36.799,000 --> 0:02:39,000
overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river

40
0:02:40.227,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they ate everything. (Laughter)

41
0:02:44.23,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!"

42
0:02:48.814,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." (Laughter)

43
0:02:54.495,000 --> 0:03:,000
"Why didn't you tell us?""You never asked."

44
0:03:00.747,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,

45
0:03:05.835,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but then I saw what the Americans were doing,

46
0:03:08.579,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what the English were doing, what the French were doing,

47
0:03:11.315,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and after seeing what they were doing,

48
0:03:13.908,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.

49
0:03:17.267,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos.

50
0:03:22.256,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You should see the rubbish — (Applause) --

51
0:03:26.503,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed

52
0:03:28.997,000 --> 0:03:29,000
on unsuspecting African people.

53
0:03:30.797,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You want to read the book,

54
0:03:32.373,000 --> 0:03:36,000
read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo,

55
0:03:37.304,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Zambian woman economist.

56
0:03:40.311,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The book was published in 2009.

57
0:03:42.681,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We Western donor countries have given the African continent

58
0:03:47.255,000 --> 0:03:51,000
two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years.

59
0:03:52.248,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done.

60
0:03:56.073,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Just go and read her book.

61
0:03:58.261,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done.

62
0:04:06.624,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries,

63
0:04:12.591,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and there are only two ways we deal with people:

64
0:04:15.905,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic.

65
0:04:20.294,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The two words come from the Latin root "pater,"

66
0:04:23.398,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which means "father."

67
0:04:25.628,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But they mean two different things.

68
0:04:29.481,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture

69
0:04:32.842,000 --> 0:04:37,000
as if they were my children. "I love you so much."

70
0:04:38.645,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture

71
0:04:43.152,000 --> 0:04:45,000
as if they were my servants.

72
0:04:45.55,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss.

73
0:04:51.621,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I was given a slap in the face reading a book,

74
0:04:55.204,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said,

75
0:05:00.171,000 --> 0:05:02,000
above all in economic development, if people

76
0:05:03.129,000 --> 0:05:07,000
do not wish to be helped, leave them alone.

77
0:05:07.684,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This should be the first principle of aid.

78
0:05:10.511,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The first principle of aid is respect.

79
0:05:14.197,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference

80
0:05:16.725,000 --> 0:05:19,000
lay a stick on the floor, and said,

81
0:05:20.526,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"Can we -- can you imagine a city

82
0:05:24.784,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that is not neocolonial?"

83
0:05:28.706,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I decided when I was 27 years old

84
0:05:32.859,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to only respond to people,

85
0:05:37.066,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation,

86
0:05:41.49,000 --> 0:05:44,000
where you never initiate anything,

87
0:05:44.865,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant

88
0:05:49.087,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of the local passion, the servant of local people

89
0:05:52.648,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who have a dream to become a better person.

90
0:05:57.046,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So what you do -- you shut up.

91
0:06:01.455,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You never arrive in a community with any ideas,

92
0:06:05.167,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and you sit with the local people.

93
0:06:09.606,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We don't work from offices.

94
0:06:11.798,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub.

95
0:06:15.764,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We have zero infrastructure.

96
0:06:19.079,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And what we do, we become friends,

97
0:06:22.406,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and we find out what that person wants to do.

98
0:06:27.166,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The most important thing is passion.

99
0:06:29.024,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You can give somebody an idea.

100
0:06:31.264,000 --> 0:06:32,000
If that person doesn't want to do it,

101
0:06:32.886,000 --> 0:06:35,000
what are you going to do?

102
0:06:36.567,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The passion that the person has for her own growth

103
0:06:41.113,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is the most important thing.

104
0:06:42.839,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth

105
0:06:47.396,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is the most important thing.

106
0:06:49.061,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge,

107
0:06:52.148,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because nobody in the world can succeed alone.

108
0:06:57.617,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge,

109
0:07:00.336,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but the knowledge is available.

110
0:07:02.474,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So years and years ago, I had this idea:

111
0:07:06.333,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community

112
0:07:10.499,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to tell people what to do, why don't, for once,

113
0:07:15.202,000 --> 0:07:19,000
listen to them? But not in community meetings.

114
0:07:20.027,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Let me tell you a secret.

115
0:07:24.941,000 --> 0:07:28,000
There is a problem with community meetings.

116
0:07:29.286,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Entrepreneurs never come,

117
0:07:32.992,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and they never tell you, in a public meeting,

118
0:07:36.164,000 --> 0:07:39,000
what they want to do with their own money,

119
0:07:39.78,000 --> 0:07:42,000
what opportunity they have identified.

120
0:07:43.609,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So planning has this blind spot.

121
0:07:48.533,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The smartest people in your community you don't even know,

122
0:07:52.824,000 --> 0:07:59,000
because they don't come to your public meetings.

123
0:08:00.664,000 --> 0:08:03,000
What we do, we work one-on-one,

124
0:08:04.624,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and to work one-on-one, you have to create

125
0:08:06.337,000 --> 0:08:08,000
a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.

126
0:08:09.012,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You have to create a new profession.

127
0:08:11.584,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise,

128
0:08:17.088,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the family doctor of business, who sits with you

129
0:08:20.659,000 --> 0:08:23,000
in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe,

130
0:08:23.784,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and helps you find the resources to transform your passion

131
0:08:27.822,000 --> 0:08:29,000
into a way to make a living.

132
0:08:30.215,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia.

133
0:08:35.536,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time,

134
0:08:37.788,000 --> 0:08:41,000
trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit

135
0:08:42.111,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that we arrive and tell you what to do.

136
0:08:45.923,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And so what I did in Esperance that first year

137
0:08:50.503,000 --> 0:08:54,000
was to just walk the streets, and in three days

138
0:08:55.129,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I had my first client, and I helped this first guy

139
0:08:58.023,000 --> 0:09:02,000
who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy,

140
0:09:02.568,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth,

141
0:09:05.873,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say,

142
0:09:09.003,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?"

143
0:09:11.989,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I helped these five fishermen to work together

144
0:09:15.153,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany

145
0:09:19.289,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way

146
0:09:23.122,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo,

147
0:09:28.473,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and the farmers came to talk to me, said,

148
0:09:29.995,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?"

149
0:09:32.284,000 --> 0:09:34,000
In a year, I had 27 projects going on,

150
0:09:35.21,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and the government came to see me to say,

151
0:09:37.362,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"How can you do that?

152
0:09:39.749,000 --> 0:09:42,000
How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult.

153
0:09:43.075,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I shut up, and listen to them." (Laughter)

154
0:09:48.728,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So — (Applause) —

155
0:09:56.95,000 --> 0:10:,000
So the government says, "Do it again." (Laughter)

156
0:10:01.555,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We've done it in 300 communities around the world.

157
0:10:04.713,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.

158
0:10:08.248,000 --> 0:10:09,000
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs

159
0:10:09.92,000 --> 0:10:11,000
who are dying of solitude.

160
0:10:12.449,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history,

161
0:10:18.608,000 --> 0:10:22,000
died age 96, a few years ago.

162
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy

163
0:10:24.94,000 --> 0:10:25,000
before becoming involved in business,

164
0:10:26.904,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and this is what Peter Drucker says:

165
0:10:29.781,000 --> 0:10:34,000
"Planning is actually incompatible

166
0:10:35.445,000 --> 0:10:39,000
with an entrepreneurial society and economy."

167
0:10:39.694,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.

168
0:10:45.937,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So now you're rebuilding Christchurch

169
0:10:48.632,000 --> 0:10:51,000
without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch

170
0:10:52.113,000 --> 0:10:56,000
want to do with their own money and their own energy.

171
0:10:56.771,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You have to learn how to get these people

172
0:10:59.969,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to come and talk to you.

173
0:11:02.966,000 --> 0:11:06,000
You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy,

174
0:11:07.794,000 --> 0:11:1,000
you have to be fantastic at helping them,

175
0:11:11.578,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and then they will come, and they will come in droves.

176
0:11:15.572,000 --> 0:11:17,000
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.

177
0:11:18.467,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people,

178
0:11:21.039,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the intelligence and the passion?

179
0:11:23.281,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning?

180
0:11:26.812,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded.

181
0:11:32.772,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So what I'm saying is that

182
0:11:38.043,000 --> 0:11:4,000
entrepreneurship is where it's at.

183
0:11:40.51,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution --

184
0:11:43.656,000 --> 0:11:46,000
nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing --

185
0:11:46.969,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable.

186
0:11:51.426,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.

187
0:11:54.073,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable.

188
0:11:57.394,000 --> 0:12:,000
What we have to look at is at how we

189
0:12:00.482,000 --> 0:12:06,000
feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate

190
0:12:06.5,000 --> 0:12:09,000
for seven billion people in a sustainable way.

191
0:12:10.051,000 --> 0:12:13,000
The technologies do not exist to do that.

192
0:12:13.945,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Who is going to invent the technology

193
0:12:17.313,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it!

194
0:12:23.811,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Government? Forget about it!

195
0:12:26.704,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now.

196
0:12:31.958,000 --> 0:12:33,000
There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine

197
0:12:34.853,000 --> 0:12:35,000
many, many years ago.

198
0:12:36.526,000 --> 0:12:38,000
There was a group of experts who were invited

199
0:12:38.746,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860.

200
0:12:43.374,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And in 1860, this group of people came together,

201
0:12:45.864,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and they all speculated about what would happen

202
0:12:48.811,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to the city of New York in 100 years,

203
0:12:50.665,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and the conclusion was unanimous:

204
0:12:52.141,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The city of New York would not exist in 100 years.

205
0:12:56.082,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Why? Because they looked at the curve and said,

206
0:12:58.343,000 --> 0:13:,000
if the population keeps growing at this rate,

207
0:13:01.309,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to move the population of New York around,

208
0:13:05.445,000 --> 0:13:07,000
they would have needed six million horses,

209
0:13:08.31,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and the manure created by six million horses

210
0:13:11.665,000 --> 0:13:13,000
would be impossible to deal with.

211
0:13:14.044,000 --> 0:13:19,000
They were already drowning in manure. (Laughter)

212
0:13:19.674,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology

213
0:13:24.723,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that is going to choke the life out of New York.

214
0:13:29.541,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900,

215
0:13:34.67,000 --> 0:13:38,000
in the United States of America, there were 1,001

216
0:13:39.273,000 --> 0:13:45,000
car manufacturing companies -- 1,001.

217
0:13:45.653,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The idea of finding a different technology

218
0:13:49.259,000 --> 0:13:51,000
had absolutely taken over,

219
0:13:51.621,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters.

220
0:13:56.537,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford.

221
0:14:02.169,000 --> 0:14:06,000
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.

222
0:14:06.54,000 --> 0:14:09,000
First, you have to offer them confidentiality.

223
0:14:09.934,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Otherwise they don't come and talk to you.

224
0:14:12.272,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated,

225
0:14:16.582,000 --> 0:14:19,000
passionate service to them.

226
0:14:20.034,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship.

227
0:14:23.681,000 --> 0:14:25,000
The smallest company, the biggest company,

228
0:14:26.452,000 --> 0:14:29,000
has to be capable of doing three things beautifully:

229
0:14:29.842,000 --> 0:14:33,000
The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic,

230
0:14:34.093,000 --> 0:14:37,000
you have to have fantastic marketing,

231
0:14:37.917,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and you have to have tremendous financial management.

232
0:14:41.286,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Guess what?

233
0:14:43.874,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We have never met a single human being

234
0:14:46.288,000 --> 0:14:51,000
in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money.

235
0:14:51.935,000 --> 0:14:53,000
It doesn't exist.

236
0:14:54.766,000 --> 0:14:56,000
This person has never been born.

237
0:14:57.516,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We've done the research, and we have looked

238
0:15:00.008,000 --> 0:15:03,000
at the 100 iconic companies of the world --

239
0:15:03.959,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford,

240
0:15:08.54,000 --> 0:15:1,000
all the new companies, Google, Yahoo.

241
0:15:11.143,000 --> 0:15:13,000
There's only one thing that all the successful companies

242
0:15:13.819,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in the world have in common, only one:

243
0:15:17.307,000 --> 0:15:21,000
None were started by one person.

244
0:15:21.842,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds

245
0:15:26.344,000 --> 0:15:29,000
in Northumberland, and we start the class

246
0:15:29.885,000 --> 0:15:33,000
by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography,

247
0:15:34.309,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline,

248
0:15:38.146,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography

249
0:15:41.774,000 --> 0:15:44,000
how many times Richard uses the word "I"

250
0:15:44.929,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and how many times he uses the word "we."

251
0:15:47.638,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times.

252
0:15:52.378,000 --> 0:15:55,000
He wasn't alone when he started.

253
0:15:55.631,000 --> 0:16:,000
Nobody started a company alone. No one.

254
0:16:00.675,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So we can create the community

255
0:16:03.781,000 --> 0:16:06,000
where we have facilitators who come from a small business background

256
0:16:07.207,000 --> 0:16:14,000
sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies

257
0:16:14.704,000 --> 0:16:17,000
who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman

258
0:16:18.376,000 --> 0:16:21,000
who talks about this epic,

259
0:16:21.617,000 --> 0:16:23,000
somebody who will say to you, "What do you need?

260
0:16:23.872,000 --> 0:16:24,000
What can you do? Can you make it?

261
0:16:25.811,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?"

262
0:16:28.061,000 --> 0:16:31,000
"Oh, no, I cannot do this.""Would you like me to find you somebody?"

263
0:16:31.815,000 --> 0:16:33,000
We activate communities.

264
0:16:33.903,000 --> 0:16:37,000
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator

265
0:16:37.947,000 --> 0:16:4,000
to help you to find resources and people

266
0:16:41.07,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and we have discovered that the miracle

267
0:16:44.059,000 --> 0:16:46,000
of the intelligence of local people is such

268
0:16:46.563,000 --> 0:16:49,000
that you can change the culture and the economy

269
0:16:50.27,000 --> 0:16:54,000
of this community just by capturing the passion,

270
0:16:54.451,000 --> 0:16:57,000
the energy and imagination of your own people.

271
0:16:58.088,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Thank you. (Applause)

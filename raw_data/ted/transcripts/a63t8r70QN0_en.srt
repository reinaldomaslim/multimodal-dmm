1
0:00:13.192,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"It gets easier, right?"

2
0:00:15.307,000 --> 0:00:17,000
These are the words I often hear from young parents

3
0:00:18.294,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who are new to the game of worrying about their children.

4
0:00:21.435,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I tell them that it doesn't.

5
0:00:23.582,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It gets different,

6
0:00:25.176,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but there's always something to worry about as parents.

7
0:00:29.275,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I remember how I would lie half-awake at night

8
0:00:32.113,000 --> 0:00:33,000
listening to my son breathe

9
0:00:33.892,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when he was young and had asthma,

10
0:00:36.498,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and then, when he was a teen,

11
0:00:37.919,000 --> 0:00:39,000
until I heard the front door chime open,

12
0:00:40.095,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I knew that he was home safe.

13
0:00:43.037,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Worrying about our kids comes with the territory.

14
0:00:46.318,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, many of these worries are about basic issues,

15
0:00:49.686,000 --> 0:00:52,000
like what they eat, where they are, who they're with.

16
0:00:53.493,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But we also need to keep an eye on new behaviors and fads.

17
0:00:58.47,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The latest craze is something that may not yet be on everyone's radar

18
0:01:02.772,000 --> 0:01:04,000
as a serious health concern,

19
0:01:04.883,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and that is the newfound popularity of vaping,

20
0:01:08.026,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or inhaling sweet aerosols

21
0:01:10.151,000 --> 0:01:13,000
produced by vaporizing e-liquids in e-cigarettes.

22
0:01:14.835,000 --> 0:01:16,000
E-cigarettes, or "vapes," as they are commonly called,

23
0:01:17.658,000 --> 0:01:19,000
are flying off the shelves like candy.

24
0:01:20.375,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This year, the e-cigarette market is expected to drive

25
0:01:23.106,000 --> 0:01:26,000
26 billion dollars in sales worldwide.

26
0:01:26.639,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Over the next six years,

27
0:01:28.256,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that volume is expected to double.

28
0:01:31.681,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We have a lot of serious concerns about the health impact of vaping,

29
0:01:35.091,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and unfortunately, not nearly enough answers.

30
0:01:38.625,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This becomes even more concerning when you think of who uses e-cigarettes.

31
0:01:43.558,000 --> 0:01:45,000
E-cigarette use, at least in the US,

32
0:01:46.031,000 --> 0:01:49,000
has grown rapidly among youth and young adults --

33
0:01:49.727,000 --> 0:01:5,000
our kids,

34
0:01:50.967,000 --> 0:01:51,000
our most vulnerable population.

35
0:01:53.75,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There was a 900 percent growth in the use of e-cigarettes by youth

36
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:02:,000
between 2012 and 2015.

37
0:02:01.415,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The most recent estimates suggest

38
0:02:03.57,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that approximately 3.6 million high school and middle school students

39
0:02:08.087,000 --> 0:02:1,000
have used e-cigarettes in the US.

40
0:02:11.635,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, e-cigarettes were originally created

41
0:02:14.51,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to offer smokers a cleaner form of nicotine

42
0:02:16.752,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to help with their cigarette addiction.

43
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:22,000
In the US, these devices come under the FDA's jurisdiction

44
0:02:23.445,000 --> 0:02:24,000
as a tobacco product.

45
0:02:25.187,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But the science on these devices has not been able to keep up

46
0:02:28.594,000 --> 0:02:3,000
with the rapid market growth,

47
0:02:30.972,000 --> 0:02:34,000
so regulations on the components of these devices and e-liquids

48
0:02:35.397,000 --> 0:02:36,000
are lagging.

49
0:02:37.586,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Current regulations do restrict sales of these devices

50
0:02:40.951,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to anyone under the age of 18,

51
0:02:43.669,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but these do not seem to have had much of an impact

52
0:02:46.577,000 --> 0:02:49,000
on the explosion in the use of these devices by teens.

53
0:02:51.052,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You know, the first time I heard of and saw an e-cigarette,

54
0:02:54.198,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I knew right away that teens would love it.

55
0:02:57.335,000 --> 0:02:59,000
These devices are technology on a stick,

56
0:03:00.178,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a perfect fit for the smartphone generation --

57
0:03:03.269,000 --> 0:03:09,000
small, rechargeable, easy to use, easy to modify, nice smelling --

58
0:03:09.415,000 --> 0:03:12,000
some even sync with your smartphone to let you know how much you have vaped.

59
0:03:13.214,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Even I was very drawn to these very clever devices.

60
0:03:17.429,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And since I had spent a long time researching teen and adult addictions,

61
0:03:22.002,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I immediately realized that these devices fit perfectly into the teen psyche.

62
0:03:28.622,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Teens are impulsive, and they love to try new things.

63
0:03:32.589,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They're also craving independence, and they love to make things their own.

64
0:03:37.086,000 --> 0:03:39,000
E-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly

65
0:03:39.69,000 --> 0:03:42,000
by allowing them the chance to both innovate and personalize

66
0:03:43.514,000 --> 0:03:44,000
their vape experience.

67
0:03:45.624,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They can choose from over 15,000 different e-liquid flavors

68
0:03:50.546,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and multiple nicotine concentrations.

69
0:03:52.823,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They can even create their own nicotine flavor combination.

70
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They can change how much vapor is produced from these devices

71
0:04:01.88,000 --> 0:04:03,000
by modifying the puff volume and the constituents

72
0:04:04.867,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and the power and temperature of the devices.

73
0:04:08.41,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They can even use these devices for "cloud chasing."

74
0:04:12.317,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Cloud chasing, also called vape tricks

75
0:04:15.169,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or smoke tricks,

76
0:04:16.479,000 --> 0:04:2,000
involves producing large vape clouds with quirky shapes and names,

77
0:04:20.623,000 --> 0:04:22,000
like rings, dragons, ghosts ...

78
0:04:23.462,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Cloud chasers can even participate in cloud competitions

79
0:04:26.828,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and win prizes for creating the most innovative shaped clouds.

80
0:04:31.884,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Teens can also change the strength and throat hit from the vapor

81
0:04:35.689,000 --> 0:04:38,000
by either vaporizing the e-liquid at higher temperatures

82
0:04:39.174,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or dripping the e-liquid directly onto a heated coil.

83
0:04:43.423,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They can even use these devices for marijuana vaping.

84
0:04:46.941,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And since the devices use lower temperatures

85
0:04:49.332,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and do not combust or burn the marijuana,

86
0:04:52.377,000 --> 0:04:53,000
they can do this very discreetly,

87
0:04:54.206,000 --> 0:04:56,000
without the distinctive smell of burnt marijuana.

88
0:04:57.577,000 --> 0:05:,000
So they can really make these vape experiences their own,

89
0:05:00.828,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which may explain the astounding rise in the use of these devices by youth.

90
0:05:06.723,000 --> 0:05:08,000
E-cigarettes are technically a very simple device.

91
0:05:10.388,000 --> 0:05:15,000
There is a receptacle for the e-liquid which can be a tank, a pod or a plug.

92
0:05:16.29,000 --> 0:05:2,000
There is a battery that charges the coil, which then vaporizes the e-liquid.

93
0:05:20.847,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And then there is a mouthpiece,

94
0:05:22.365,000 --> 0:05:24,000
where the user can actually draw from the e-cigarette.

95
0:05:25.624,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In 2017, there were 466 e-cigarette devices in the marketplace.

96
0:05:32.594,000 --> 0:05:36,000
These range from cigarette-like devices which are also called "cigalikes"

97
0:05:37.197,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to tank systems, which are also called "pens."

98
0:05:40.892,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And then there are modified devices, which are also called "mods."

99
0:05:44.844,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Mods look nothing like a cigarette,

100
0:05:47.324,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and they come in various shapes and sizes,

101
0:05:50.486,000 --> 0:05:53,000
with different kinds of attachments and user adjustments.

102
0:05:53.814,000 --> 0:05:55,000
They're very popular for cloud chasing.

103
0:05:56.772,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The most recent entrance into the marketplace

104
0:05:59.181,000 --> 0:06:,000
are the pod devices,

105
0:06:00.739,000 --> 0:06:02,000
which contain the e-liquid in a pod.

106
0:06:03.713,000 --> 0:06:05,000
These are very popular, by the way, among teens.

107
0:06:06.039,000 --> 0:06:08,000
An example of this is the Juul,

108
0:06:08.413,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which not only looks like a USB device

109
0:06:11.04,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but can also be plugged into a USB outlet to charge.

110
0:06:15.142,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Many teens do not even think that these are e-cigarettes,

111
0:06:17.833,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which has led to the use of terms like "juuling" instead of "vaping."

112
0:06:22.897,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Many of these devices are so discreet and produce so little vapor

113
0:06:27.009,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that teens are using them in classrooms

114
0:06:29.195,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and hiding them in objects like Sharpie pens, their clothes,

115
0:06:32.898,000 --> 0:06:33,000
their books.

116
0:06:34.452,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, many teens think that these devices produce water vapor,

117
0:06:37.497,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and therefore, they are safe to use.

118
0:06:39.327,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But this could not be further from the truth.

119
0:06:42.285,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What is produced is not even a vapor,

120
0:06:44.503,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it's an aerosol,

121
0:06:45.77,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and let me tell you, the difference is quite pronounced.

122
0:06:49.237,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Aerosols contain many finely suspended particles of liquids and gases

123
0:06:54.019,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that are created from whatever is in the e-liquid.

124
0:06:57.338,000 --> 0:07:,000
So an aerosol could contain propylene glycol and glycerin,

125
0:07:00.694,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which are solvents in the e-liquid.

126
0:07:02.883,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, these solvents are known to be safe for edible use,

127
0:07:06.014,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so for use in products that you eat,

128
0:07:08.852,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but we know very little about their safety following long-term inhalational exposure.

129
0:07:14.918,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The e-liquids can also contain alcohol,

130
0:07:16.946,000 --> 0:07:17,000
sometimes in high levels,

131
0:07:18.713,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and inhaling alcohol is known to have toxic effects on the brain.

132
0:07:23.957,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I told you earlier that the e-liquids contain over 15,000 different flavors.

133
0:07:28.202,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Here are some examples,

134
0:07:30.44,000 --> 0:07:34,000
some with very catchy but familiar names like "Skittles" and "Fruit Loops,"

135
0:07:35.139,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and others with more exotic names like "Dragon's Milk" and "Tiger's Blood"

136
0:07:39.609,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and "Unicorn Puke."

137
0:07:41.522,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The e-liquid or the aerosol can also contain metallic particles

138
0:07:46.034,000 --> 0:07:48,000
like chromium, cadmium and lead.

139
0:07:48.521,000 --> 0:07:51,000
These are generated from the heating coil in the devices

140
0:07:51.911,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and are also known to have many toxic effects on vital organs.

141
0:07:55.973,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So no, let me make this very clear:

142
0:07:58.613,000 --> 0:08:01,000
what is produced is definitely not water vapor.

143
0:08:04.009,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Exposure of the teen brain to nicotine through e-cigarettes

144
0:08:07.451,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is also very concerning.

145
0:08:09.833,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The teen brain is very sensitive to even low levels of nicotine

146
0:08:12.995,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and gets very easily addicted.

147
0:08:15.174,000 --> 0:08:17,000
In fact, we have known for a long time

148
0:08:17.915,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that 90 percent of smokers start smoking cigarettes prior to the age of 18.

149
0:08:23.256,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Those who start early are more addicted and have a harder time quitting smoking.

150
0:08:28.269,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In other words, and to quote a past FDA commissioner,

151
0:08:32.298,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"Nicotine addiction ... is a pediatric disease."

152
0:08:36.435,000 --> 0:08:39,000
E-cigarettes can expose teens to a lot of nicotine.

153
0:08:40.043,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Many of these devices contain the amount of nicotine

154
0:08:42.538,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that is in a full pack of cigarettes.

155
0:08:45.165,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The more recent pod devices contain a nicotine salt,

156
0:08:48.918,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which has a smoother taste and is much easier to use

157
0:08:51.897,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and can produce rapid increases in brain nicotine levels.

158
0:08:56.487,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Teens who use e-cigarettes regularly report symptoms of craving --

159
0:09:00.318,000 --> 0:09:02,000
feeling anxious when they don't have their e-cigarettes.

160
0:09:03.144,000 --> 0:09:05,000
All these are hallmarks of a behavioral addiction.

161
0:09:07.087,000 --> 0:09:11,000
E-cigarettes are not only addictive

162
0:09:11.959,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but they also affect many other organs in the body.

163
0:09:15.34,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So nicotine, which is in e-cigarettes, for example,

164
0:09:17.856,000 --> 0:09:21,000
binds to a receptor called the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor,

165
0:09:21.933,000 --> 0:09:24,000
which plays a key role in the functioning of almost all organ systems

166
0:09:25.78,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in the human body.

167
0:09:27.415,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And chronic exposure to nicotine changes the functioning of these systems.

168
0:09:32.016,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So as an example,

169
0:09:33.788,000 --> 0:09:36,000
chronic exposure to nicotine decreases the flexibility of the blood vessels

170
0:09:37.677,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and changes how the heart responds to acute challenges like stress.

171
0:09:43.221,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The teen brain is not only sensitive to the addictive effects of nicotine

172
0:09:46.962,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but also to its toxic effects.

173
0:09:49.605,000 --> 0:09:53,000
In adolescent animals, nicotine is a very well-established neurotoxin,

174
0:09:54.231,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and it decreases learning, memory and attention processes

175
0:09:57.495,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and increases hyperactivity symptoms.

176
0:09:59.951,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Teens who use tobacco products are more likely to use

177
0:10:02.876,000 --> 0:10:03,000
marijuana and alcohol

178
0:10:04.42,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and also develop depression and anxiety as a teen or as an adult.

179
0:10:10.648,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So nicotine addiction through e-cigarettes could be leading them down the path

180
0:10:14.936,000 --> 0:10:17,000
of other addictions and other mental health problems.

181
0:10:19.21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, in adolescent animals, nicotine also produces epigenetic changes,

182
0:10:23.635,000 --> 0:10:25,000
or heritable changes in gene expression,

183
0:10:26.067,000 --> 0:10:28,000
for example, in the genes involved in asthma.

184
0:10:29.385,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So teens who use nicotine may not only be harming themselves

185
0:10:33.035,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but they could be harming their future generations.

186
0:10:37.141,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You know, the very existence of e-cigarettes

187
0:10:39.771,000 --> 0:10:42,000
could have led to an entire generation of nicotine-addicted youth.

188
0:10:44.861,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Easy access to these devices could have led to more experimentation

189
0:10:48.279,000 --> 0:10:51,000
with marijuana and many other vaporizable substances by youth.

190
0:10:53.308,000 --> 0:10:57,000
While there is no doubt that providing smokers with a cleaner form of nicotine

191
0:10:57.941,000 --> 0:11:,000
is and should continue to be a critical goal,

192
0:11:01.365,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we still do not know if these devices help smokers quit smoking,

193
0:11:05.25,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and we know very little about the long-term effects of these devices.

194
0:11:10.19,000 --> 0:11:14,000
What we do know is that youth -- lots of youth -- are using these devices.

195
0:11:15.489,000 --> 0:11:19,000
In fact, the FDA commissioner recently used the term "epidemic"

196
0:11:19.517,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to describe e-cigarette use in the US.

197
0:11:23.28,000 --> 0:11:27,000
While trying to solve one huge public health problem, cigarette smoking,

198
0:11:27.551,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we may have created another colossal one.

199
0:11:30.759,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Our lack of vigilance in the earlier years around cigarette smoking

200
0:11:34.383,000 --> 0:11:37,000
led to a cigarette epidemic and many, many cigarette-related diseases.

201
0:11:38.764,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We do not want to repeat the same mistakes with e-cigarettes.

202
0:11:43.092,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So now is the time for action,

203
0:11:46.476,000 --> 0:11:5,000
for regulations that address the appeal and access of these devices to youth.

204
0:11:52.405,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Do smokers really need 15,000 kid-friendly flavors to quit smoking?

205
0:11:58.736,000 --> 0:12:,000
Do they need so many different kinds of devices?

206
0:12:02.458,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Is it a good idea to have devices which are so easy to hide

207
0:12:06.273,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and so easy to use?

208
0:12:09.292,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We recently heard that the FDA plans to introduce stricter regulations

209
0:12:13.926,000 --> 0:12:16,000
on sales of these devices that contain e-liquid flavors

210
0:12:17.875,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in retail locations like convenience stores and gas stations,

211
0:12:21.444,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and also introduce stricter regulations

212
0:12:23.394,000 --> 0:12:25,000
on sales of devices to minors over the internet.

213
0:12:26.951,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Is this going to be sufficient to change this rapid increase in youth uptake?

214
0:12:32.411,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We need to ask and answer such critical questions.

215
0:12:36.684,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now is also the time for a serious public education campaign.

216
0:12:40.946,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Teens and their parents need to know

217
0:12:43.287,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that while e-cigarettes may contain less toxins than cigarettes,

218
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:48,000
they're certainly not benign.

219
0:12:49.773,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Exposure of their bodies to the chemicals produced by these devices

220
0:12:53.408,000 --> 0:12:55,000
could be changing them in ways they may not like

221
0:12:56.176,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and setting them up for future unknown toxicities and health problems.

222
0:13:01.526,000 --> 0:13:02,000
You know, when I said earlier

223
0:13:02.946,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that e-cigarettes were a perfect fit for the smartphone generation,

224
0:13:06.15,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I was not kidding.

225
0:13:07.911,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We live in a technology-crazed world,

226
0:13:10.826,000 --> 0:13:14,000
where the latest device and technology gets a lot of attention

227
0:13:14.974,000 --> 0:13:17,000
just because it is technology and because it is the latest thing.

228
0:13:19.414,000 --> 0:13:22,000
More and more over the next few years and for the rest of our lives,

229
0:13:23.088,000 --> 0:13:26,000
we are going to see technologies coming into the marketplace

230
0:13:26.146,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that may not raise any health flags at first,

231
0:13:28.746,000 --> 0:13:3,000
simply because they don't look unhealthy

232
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
or they're not a medical device.

233
0:13:33.938,000 --> 0:13:34,000
For example, we could see devices

234
0:13:35.933,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that may make it easier to go longer without sleep

235
0:13:39.332,000 --> 0:13:4,000
or help us lose weight --

236
0:13:40.643,000 --> 0:13:41,000
a personal goal of mine --

237
0:13:42.218,000 --> 0:13:44,000
or achieve any number of other goals

238
0:13:44.508,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that we as consumers are very, very interested in.

239
0:13:48.832,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But many of these devices may come with unacceptable risks to our own health.

240
0:13:54.904,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So if we want to protect our health and the health of our children,

241
0:13:58.803,000 --> 0:14:,000
perhaps we should get out of the habit

242
0:14:00.973,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of automatically celebrating such new technology

243
0:14:04.54,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and get into the habit of looking at them with a critical eye,

244
0:14:08.764,000 --> 0:14:09,000
perhaps even through a medical lens.

245
0:14:11.331,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Because, you know something?

246
0:14:13.037,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Our health, the health of our children and our future generations

247
0:14:17.462,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is far too valuable to let it go up in smoke --

248
0:14:21.498,000 --> 0:14:22,000
or even in aerosol.

249
0:14:23.363,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Thank you.

250
0:14:24.537,000 --> 0:14:26,000
(Applause)

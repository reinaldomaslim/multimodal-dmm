1
0:00:12.7,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Today, I want to tell you about a pressing social issue.

2
0:00:16.54,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Now, it's not nuclear arms,

3
0:00:18.9,000 --> 0:00:19,000
it's not immigration,

4
0:00:20.5,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and it's not malaria.

5
0:00:22.46,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm here to talk about movies.

6
0:00:25.94,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, in all seriousness, movies are actually really important.

7
0:00:30.3,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In film, we can be wildly entertained,

8
0:00:34.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we can also be transported through storytelling.

9
0:00:39.3,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Storytelling is so important.

10
0:00:41.14,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Stories tell us what societies value,

11
0:00:44.7,000 --> 0:00:45,000
they offer us lessons,

12
0:00:46.7,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they share and preserve our history.

13
0:00:49.9,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Stories are amazing.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But stories don't give everyone

15
0:00:55.22,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the same opportunity to appear within them,

16
0:00:59.7,000 --> 0:01:01,000
particularly not stories

17
0:01:02.18,000 --> 0:01:06,000
compartmentalized in the form of American movies.

18
0:01:06.34,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In film, interestingly enough,

19
0:01:08.66,000 --> 0:01:11,000
females are still erased and marginalized

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in a lot of our stories.

21
0:01:14.34,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I learned this for the first time about 10 years ago

22
0:01:17.22,000 --> 0:01:2,000
when I did my first study on gender role in G-rated films.

23
0:01:21.02,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Since then, we've conducted more than 30 investigations.

24
0:01:24.62,000 --> 0:01:25,000
My team is tired.

25
0:01:26.5,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I've committed my life

26
0:01:29.9,000 --> 0:01:31,000
as researcher and activist

27
0:01:32.42,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to fighting the inclusion crisis

28
0:01:35.14,000 --> 0:01:36,000
in Hollywood.

29
0:01:37.02,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So today, what I'd like to do is tell you about that crisis.

30
0:01:40.54,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I want to talk about gender inequality in film.

31
0:01:43.14,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I want to tell you how it is perpetuated,

32
0:01:45.54,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and then I'm going to tell you how we're going to fix it.

33
0:01:49.58,000 --> 0:01:52,000
However, one caveat before I begin:

34
0:01:53.42,000 --> 0:01:56,000
my data are really depressing.

35
0:01:56.78,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I want to apologize in advance,

36
0:01:58.86,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because I'm going to put you all in a really bad mood.

37
0:02:02.02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But I'm going to bring it up at the end,

38
0:02:05.42,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I'm going to present a silver lining

39
0:02:08.3,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to fix this mess that we've been in

40
0:02:10.7,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for a very, very long time.

41
0:02:13.3,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So, let's start with the gravity of the situation.

42
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Each year, my research team examines the top 100 grossing films

43
0:02:20.9,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in the United States.

44
0:02:22.54,000 --> 0:02:26,000
What we do is we look at every speaking or named character on-screen.

45
0:02:26.78,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, to count in one of my investigations,

46
0:02:29.74,000 --> 0:02:33,000
all a character has to do is say one word.

47
0:02:33.94,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is a very low bar.

48
0:02:36.54,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:38.02,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Thus far, we've looked at 800 movies,

50
0:02:40.46,000 --> 0:02:42,000
from 2007 to 2015,

51
0:02:42.5,000 --> 0:02:46,000
cataloguing every speaking character on-screen for gender, race, ethnicity,

52
0:02:47.38,000 --> 0:02:5,000
LGBT and characters with a disability.

53
0:02:51.74,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Let's take a look at really some problematic trends.

54
0:02:55.62,000 --> 0:02:59,000
First, females are still noticeably absent on-screen in film.

55
0:03:00.22,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Across 800 movies and 35,205 speaking characters,

56
0:03:04.58,000 --> 0:03:07,000
less than a third of all roles go to girls and women.

57
0:03:08.3,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Less than a third!

58
0:03:09.62,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There's been no change from 2007 to 2015,

59
0:03:13.1,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and if you compare our results

60
0:03:14.553,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to a small sample of films from 1946 to 1955,

61
0:03:19.22,000 --> 0:03:23,000
there's been no change in over a half of a century.

62
0:03:23.54,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Over half of a century!

63
0:03:24.94,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But we're half of the population.

64
0:03:27.58,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, if we look at this data intersectionally,

65
0:03:30.42,000 --> 0:03:32,000
which has been a focus of today,

66
0:03:32.58,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the picture becomes even more problematic.

67
0:03:35.7,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Across the top 100 films of just last year,

68
0:03:38.74,000 --> 0:03:42,000
48 films didn't feature one black or African-American speaking character,

69
0:03:43.06,000 --> 0:03:44,000
not one.

70
0:03:44.34,000 --> 0:03:48,000
70 films were devoid of Asian or Asian-American speaking characters

71
0:03:48.58,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that were girls or women.

72
0:03:50.02,000 --> 0:03:51,000
None.

73
0:03:51.66,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Eighty-four films didn't feature one female character that had a disability.

74
0:03:56.06,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And 93 were devoid of lesbian, bisexual or transgender female speaking characters.

75
0:04:02.66,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is not underrepresentation.

76
0:04:05.86,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This is erasure,

77
0:04:07.78,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and I call this the epidemic of invisibility.

78
0:04:12.62,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now, when we move from prevalence to protagonist,

79
0:04:16.34,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the story is still problematic.

80
0:04:18.82,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Out of a hundred films last year,

81
0:04:20.46,000 --> 0:04:24,000
only 32 featured a female lead or colead driving the action.

82
0:04:25.1,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Only three out of a hundred films

83
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
featured an underrepresented female driving the story,

84
0:04:31.06,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and only one diverse woman

85
0:04:33.38,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that was 45 years of age or older at the time of theatrical release.

86
0:04:38.14,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now let's look at portrayal.

87
0:04:40.74,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In addition to the numbers you just saw,

88
0:04:42.7,000 --> 0:04:45,000
females are far more likely to be sexualized in film

89
0:04:46.34,000 --> 0:04:47,000
than their male counterparts.

90
0:04:48.1,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Matter of fact, they're about three times as likely

91
0:04:50.54,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to be shown in sexually revealing clothing,

92
0:04:52.58,000 --> 0:04:53,000
partially naked,

93
0:04:53.82,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and they're far more likely to be thin.

94
0:04:56.42,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now, sometimes, in animation, females are so thin

95
0:05:00.18,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that their waist size approximates the circumference of their upper arm.

96
0:05:04.86,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:06.54,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We like to say that these gals have no room for a womb

98
0:05:09.98,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or any other internal organ.

99
0:05:12.58,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:14.62,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, all joking aside,

101
0:05:16.22,000 --> 0:05:17,000
theories suggest, research confirms,

102
0:05:18.18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
exposure to thin ideals and objectifying content

103
0:05:20.58,000 --> 0:05:23,000
can lead to body dissatisfaction, internalization of the thin ideal

104
0:05:24.42,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and self-objectification among some female viewers.

105
0:05:28.86,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Obviously, what we see on-screen

106
0:05:30.86,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and what we see in the world,

107
0:05:32.86,000 --> 0:05:33,000
they do not match.

108
0:05:34.62,000 --> 0:05:35,000
They do not match!

109
0:05:35.9,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Matter of fact, if we lived in the screen world,

110
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we would have a population crisis on our hands.

111
0:05:42.62,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So, as soon as I recognized these patterns,

112
0:05:44.7,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I wanted to find out why,

113
0:05:45.98,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it turns out that there are two drivers to inequality on-screen:

114
0:05:49.9,000 --> 0:05:52,000
content creator gender and misperceptions of the audience.

115
0:05:53.02,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Let's unpack them really quick.

116
0:05:54.78,000 --> 0:05:56,000
If you want to change any of the patterns I just talked about,

117
0:05:57.74,000 --> 0:05:59,000
all you have to do is hire female directors.

118
0:06:00.22,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Turns out, the female directors

119
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
are associated with, in terms of short films and indie films,

120
0:06:06.78,000 --> 0:06:07,000
more girls and women on-screen,

121
0:06:08.62,000 --> 0:06:1,000
more stories with women in the center,

122
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
more stories with women 40 years of age or older on-screen,

123
0:06:15.82,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which I think is good news for this crowd.

124
0:06:18.74,000 --> 0:06:19,000
More underrepresented --

125
0:06:20.7,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:22.06,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Sorry.

127
0:06:23.3,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:25.1,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Sorry but not sorry.

129
0:06:26.38,000 --> 0:06:29,000
More underrepresented characters in terms of race and ethnicity,

130
0:06:30.06,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and most importantly,

131
0:06:31.38,000 --> 0:06:33,000
more women working behind the camera

132
0:06:33.78,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in key production roles.

133
0:06:35.9,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Easy answer to the problems that we just talked about.

134
0:06:39.66,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Or is it?

135
0:06:40.9,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's actually not.

136
0:06:42.7,000 --> 0:06:45,000
800 films, 2007-2015,

137
0:06:45.98,000 --> 0:06:46,000
886 directors.

138
0:06:47.58,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Only 4.1 percent are women.

139
0:06:51.22,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Only three are African-American or black,

140
0:06:54.14,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and only one woman was Asian.

141
0:06:57.34,000 --> 0:07:,000
So why is it so difficult

142
0:07:00.86,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to have female directors

143
0:07:02.66,000 --> 0:07:04,000
if they're part of the solution?

144
0:07:05.34,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Well, to answer this question,

145
0:07:07.14,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we conducted a study.

146
0:07:08.94,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We interviewed dozens of industry insiders

147
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and asked them about directors.

148
0:07:13.7,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Turns out, both male and female executives,

149
0:07:17.54,000 --> 0:07:18,000
when they think director,

150
0:07:19.22,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they think male.

151
0:07:20.82,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They perceive the traits of leadership

152
0:07:23.7,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to be masculine in nature.

153
0:07:25.98,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So when they're going to hire a director

154
0:07:29.18,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to command a crew, lead a ship,

155
0:07:31.5,000 --> 0:07:33,000
be a visionary or be General Patton,

156
0:07:33.9,000 --> 0:07:35,000
all the things that we've heard --

157
0:07:36.18,000 --> 0:07:39,000
their thoughts and ideations pull male.

158
0:07:39.66,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The perception of director or a leader

159
0:07:42.14,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is inconsistent with the perception of a woman.

160
0:07:45.82,000 --> 0:07:47,000
The roles are incongruous,

161
0:07:47.86,000 --> 0:07:51,000
which is consistent with a lot of research in the psychological arena.

162
0:07:52.02,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Second factor contributing to inequality on-screen

163
0:07:55.18,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is misperceptions of the audience.

164
0:07:57.78,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I don't need to tell this crowd:

165
0:07:59.46,000 --> 0:08:02,000
50 percent of the people that go to the box office and buy tickets

166
0:08:02.74,000 --> 0:08:03,000
are girls and women in this country.

167
0:08:04.74,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Right?

168
0:08:05.98,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But we're not perceived to be a viable or financially lucrative target audience.

169
0:08:11.34,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Further, there's some misperceptions

170
0:08:13.58,000 --> 0:08:16,000
about whether females can open a film.

171
0:08:16.7,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Open a film means that if you place a female at the center,

172
0:08:19.58,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it doesn't have the return on investment

173
0:08:21.54,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that if you place a male at the center of a story does.

174
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
This misperception is actually costly.

175
0:08:28.94,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Right?

176
0:08:30.18,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Especially in the wake of franchise successes

177
0:08:32.5,000 --> 0:08:34,000
like "The Hunger Games,"

178
0:08:34.62,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"Pitch Perfect"

179
0:08:35.86,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or that small little indie film, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."

180
0:08:41.66,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Our own economic analyses show that gender of the lead character

181
0:08:45.06,000 --> 0:08:48,000
doesn't play a role in economic success in the United States.

182
0:08:48.58,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But what does?

183
0:08:49.9,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Production costs alone

184
0:08:51.78,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or in conjunction with how widely a film is distributed in this country.

185
0:08:58.22,000 --> 0:09:,000
It's not the gender of the lead character.

186
0:09:00.78,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So at this point, we should all be sufficiently depressed.

187
0:09:05.18,000 --> 0:09:06,000
No change in 50 years,

188
0:09:06.74,000 --> 0:09:08,000
few female directors working behind the camera

189
0:09:09.14,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and the entertainment industry does not trust us as an audience.

190
0:09:14.06,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Well, I told you there would be a silver lining,

191
0:09:16.46,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and there is.

192
0:09:18.5,000 --> 0:09:21,000
There are actually simple and tangible solutions

193
0:09:21.82,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to fixing this problem

194
0:09:23.38,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that involve content creators,

195
0:09:25.02,000 --> 0:09:27,000
executives and consumers

196
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
like the individuals in this room.

197
0:09:29.62,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Let's talk about a few of them.

198
0:09:31.54,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The first is what I call "just add five."

199
0:09:34.02,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Did you know if we looked at the top 100 films next year

200
0:09:37.1,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and simply added five female speaking characters on-screen

201
0:09:40.34,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to each of those films,

202
0:09:41.78,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it would create a new norm.

203
0:09:43.42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
If we were to do this for three contiguous years,

204
0:09:46.22,000 --> 0:09:48,000
we would be at gender parity

205
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
for the first time in over a half of a century.

206
0:09:53.46,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now, this approach is advantageous for a variety of reasons.

207
0:09:56.74,000 --> 0:09:59,000
One? It doesn't take away jobs for male actors.

208
0:10:00.7,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Heaven forbid.

209
0:10:02.06,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

210
0:10:04.5,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Two, it's actually cost-effective. It doesn't cost that much.

211
0:10:08.46,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Three, it builds a pipeline for talent.

212
0:10:10.38,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And four, it humanizes the production process.

213
0:10:13.02,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Why? Because it makes sure that there's women on set.

214
0:10:17.18,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Second solution is for A-list talent.

215
0:10:20.62,000 --> 0:10:23,000
A-listers, as we all know, can make demands in their contracts,

216
0:10:24.22,000 --> 0:10:27,000
particularly the ones that work on the biggest Hollywood films.

217
0:10:27.94,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What if those A-listers

218
0:10:29.7,000 --> 0:10:33,000
simply added an equity clause or an inclusion rider

219
0:10:33.82,000 --> 0:10:35,000
into their contract?

220
0:10:35.9,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now, what does that mean?

221
0:10:37.86,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Well, you probably don't know

222
0:10:39.58,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but the typical feature film

223
0:10:40.94,000 --> 0:10:42,000
has about 40 to 45 speaking characters in it.

224
0:10:44.34,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I would argue that only 8 to 10 of those characters

225
0:10:47.78,000 --> 0:10:5,000
are actually relevant to the story.

226
0:10:50.82,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Except maybe "Avengers." Right?

227
0:10:52.86,000 --> 0:10:53,000
A few more in "Avengers."

228
0:10:55.5,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The remaining 30 or so roles,

229
0:10:57.9,000 --> 0:10:59,000
there's no reason why those minor roles

230
0:11:00.34,000 --> 0:11:02,000
can't match or reflect the demography

231
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of where the story is taking place.

232
0:11:06.94,000 --> 0:11:09,000
An equity rider by an A-lister in their contract

233
0:11:10.54,000 --> 0:11:12,000
can stipulate that those roles

234
0:11:12.98,000 --> 0:11:15,000
reflect the world in which we actually live.

235
0:11:16.3,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now, there's no reason why a network,

236
0:11:18.86,000 --> 0:11:2,000
a studio or a production company

237
0:11:21.06,000 --> 0:11:24,000
cannot adopt the same contractual language

238
0:11:24.7,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in their negotiation processes.

239
0:11:27.54,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Third solution:

240
0:11:29.22,000 --> 0:11:31,000
this would be for the entertainment industry,

241
0:11:31.58,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Hollywood in particular,

242
0:11:32.82,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to adopt the Rooney Rule

243
0:11:35.78,000 --> 0:11:38,000
when it comes to hiring practices around directors.

244
0:11:39.46,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Now, in the NFL, the Rooney Rule stipulates

245
0:11:42.1,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that if a team wants to hire a coach from outside the organization,

246
0:11:45.98,000 --> 0:11:48,000
what they have to do is interview an underrepresented candidate.

247
0:11:49.94,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The exact same principle can apply to Hollywood films.

248
0:11:54.06,000 --> 0:11:55,000
How?

249
0:11:55.3,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Well, on these top films,

250
0:11:56.78,000 --> 0:11:59,000
executives and agents can make sure

251
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that women and people of color are not only on the consideration list,

252
0:12:05.5,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but they're actually interviewed for the job.

253
0:12:08.9,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now, one might say,

254
0:12:10.42,000 --> 0:12:11,000
why is this important?

255
0:12:11.86,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Because it exposes or introduces executives to female directors

256
0:12:17.1,000 --> 0:12:21,000
who otherwise fall prey to exclusionary hiring practices.

257
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The fourth solution

258
0:12:23.74,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is for consumers like me and you.

259
0:12:27.1,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If we want to see more films by, for and about women,

260
0:12:30.1,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we have to support them.

261
0:12:32.3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It may mean going to the independent theater chain

262
0:12:34.82,000 --> 0:12:35,000
instead of the multiplex.

263
0:12:36.78,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Or it might mean scrolling down a little further online

264
0:12:40.3,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to find a film by a female director.

265
0:12:42.9,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Or it may be writing a check and funding a film,

266
0:12:45.78,000 --> 0:12:49,000
particularly by a female director from an underrepresented background.

267
0:12:50.3,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Right?

268
0:12:51.54,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We need to write, call and email companies

269
0:12:54.22,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that are making and distributing films,

270
0:12:56.102,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and we need to post on our social media accounts

271
0:12:59.02,000 --> 0:13:02,000
when we want to see inclusive representation,

272
0:13:02.14,000 --> 0:13:03,000
women on-screen,

273
0:13:03.42,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and most importantly, women behind the camera.

274
0:13:07.34,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We need to make our voices heard and our dollars count.

275
0:13:13.22,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Now, we actually have the ability to change the world on this one.

276
0:13:19.46,000 --> 0:13:21,000
The US and its content,

277
0:13:21.94,000 --> 0:13:22,000
films in particular,

278
0:13:23.46,000 --> 0:13:28,000
have captured the imaginations of audiences worldwide.

279
0:13:28.5,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Worldwide.

280
0:13:30.66,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So that means that the film industry has unprecedented access

281
0:13:35.06,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to be able to distribute stories about equality

282
0:13:40.1,000 --> 0:13:42,000
all around the world.

283
0:13:42.34,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Imagine what would happen

284
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
if the film industry aligned its values

285
0:13:47.82,000 --> 0:13:48,000
with what it shows on-screen.

286
0:13:50.1,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It could foster inclusion

287
0:13:52.22,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and acceptance for girls and women,

288
0:13:55.5,000 --> 0:13:56,000
people of color,

289
0:13:57.02,000 --> 0:13:58,000
the LGBT community,

290
0:13:58.9,000 --> 0:13:59,000
individuals with disabilities,

291
0:14:00.7,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and so many more around the world.

292
0:14:05.34,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The only thing that the film industry has to do is unleash its secret weapon,

293
0:14:11.9,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and that's storytelling.

294
0:14:15.14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Now, at the beginning of this talk,

295
0:14:17.54,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I said that films --

296
0:14:19.98,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that they can actually transport us,

297
0:14:22.54,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but I would like to argue that films, they can transform us.

298
0:14:28.58,000 --> 0:14:29,000
None of us in this room

299
0:14:30.5,000 --> 0:14:34,000
have grown up or experienced a storytelling landscape

300
0:14:34.78,000 --> 0:14:37,000
with fully realized female characters,

301
0:14:38.3,000 --> 0:14:39,000
none of us,

302
0:14:39.82,000 --> 0:14:41,000
because the numbers haven't changed.

303
0:14:42.58,000 --> 0:14:46,000
What would happen if the next generation of audiences

304
0:14:46.7,000 --> 0:14:5,000
grew up with a whole different screen reality?

305
0:14:51.1,000 --> 0:14:52,000
What would happen?

306
0:14:52.38,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Well I'm here to tell you today

307
0:14:54.38,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that it's not only possible to change what we see on-screen

308
0:14:58.46,000 --> 0:15:02,000
but I am impatient for it to get here.

309
0:15:03.22,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So let's agree to take action today

310
0:15:07.54,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to eradicate the epidemic of invisibility.

311
0:15:11.78,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And let's agree to take action today

312
0:15:14.1,000 --> 0:15:18,000
to agree that US audiences and global viewers

313
0:15:18.54,000 --> 0:15:21,000
demand and deserve more.

314
0:15:21.7,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And let's agree today

315
0:15:24.3,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that the next generation of viewers and audiences,

316
0:15:29.5,000 --> 0:15:32,000
that they deserve to see the stories

317
0:15:32.7,000 --> 0:15:35,000
we were never able to see.

318
0:15:35.86,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Thank you.

319
0:15:37.1,000 --> 0:15:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm speaking to you about what I call the "mesh."

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's essentially a fundamental shift

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in our relationship with stuff, with the things in our lives.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And it's starting to look at --

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
not always and not for everything --

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but in certain moments of time,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
access to certain kinds of goods and service

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
will trump ownership of them.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And so it's the pursuit of better things,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
easily shared.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And we come from a long tradition of sharing.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We've shared transportation.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We've shared wine and food

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and other sorts of fabulous experiences

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in coffee bars in Amsterdam.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We've also shared other sorts of entertainment --

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
sports arenas, public parks,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
concert halls, libraries,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
universities.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
All these things are share-platforms,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but sharing ultimately starts and ends

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
with what I refer to

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
as the "mother of all share-platforms."

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And as I think about the mesh

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I think about, well, what's driving it,

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
how come it's happening now,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I think there's a number of vectors

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that I want to give you as background.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
One is the recession --

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that the recession has caused us

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to rethink our relationship

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
with the things in our lives relative to the value --

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
so starting to align the value

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
with the true cost.

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Secondly, population growth

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and density into cities.

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
More people, smaller spaces,

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
less stuff.

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Climate change:

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we're trying to reduce the stress

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in our personal lives and in our communities

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and on the planet.

43
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Also, there's been this recent distrust

44
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of big brands, global big brands,

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in a bunch of different industries,

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and that's created an opening.

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Research is showing here, in the States,

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and in Canada and Western Europe,

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that most of us are much more open

50
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to local companies,

51
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
or brands that maybe we haven't heard of.

52
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Whereas before, we went with the big brands

53
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that we were sure we trusted.

54
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And last is that

55
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we're more connected now to more people on the planet

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
than ever before --

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
except for if you're sitting next to someone.

58
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The other thing that's worth considering

60
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is that we've made a huge investment

61
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
over decades and decades,

62
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and tens of billions of dollars

63
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
have gone into this investment

64
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that now is our inheritance.

65
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's a physical infrastructure

66
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that allows us to get from point A to point B

67
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and move things that way.

68
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's also -- Web and mobile

69
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
allow us to be connected

70
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and create all kinds of platforms and systems,

71
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and the investment of those technologies

72
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and that infrastructure

73
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is really our inheritance.

74
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It allows us to engage

75
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
in really new and interesting ways.

76
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And so for me, a mesh company, the "classic" mesh company,

77
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
brings together these three things:

78
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
our ability to connect to each other --

79
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
most of us are walking around with these mobile devices

80
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that are GPS-enabled and Web-enabled --

81
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
allows us to find each other

82
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and find things in time and space.

83
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And third is that physical things

84
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are readable on a map --

85
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so restaurants, a variety of venues,

86
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but also with GPS and other technology

87
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
like RFID

88
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and it continues to expand beyond that,

89
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we can also track things that are moving,

90
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
like a car, a taxicab, a transit system,

91
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a box that's moving through time and space.

92
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And so that sets up

93
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
for making access to get goods and services

94
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
more convenient and less costly in many cases

95
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
than owning them.

96
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
For example, I want to use Zipcar.

97
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
How many people here have experienced

98
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
car-sharing or bike-sharing?

99
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Wow, that's great. Okay, thank you.

100
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Basically Zipcar

101
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is the largest car-sharing company in the world.

102
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They did not invent car-sharing.

103
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Car-sharing was actually invented in Europe.

104
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
One of the founders went to Switzerland,

105
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
saw it implemented someplace,

106
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
said, "Wow, that looks really cool.

107
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I think we can do that in Cambridge,"

108
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
brought it to Cambridge

109
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and they started -- two women --

110
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Robin Chase being the other person who started it.

111
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Zipcar got some really important things right.

112
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
First, they really understood

113
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir.

114
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And so they were very clever

115
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
about the way that they packaged car-sharing.

116
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They made it sexy. They made it fresh.

117
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They made it aspirational.

118
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
If you were a member of the club,

119
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
when you're a member of a club, you're a Zipster.

120
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The cars they picked didn't look like ex-cop cars

121
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that were hollowed out or something.

122
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They picked these sexy cars.

123
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They targeted to universities.

124
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They made sure that the demographic

125
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for who they were targeting and the car was all matching.

126
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It was a very nice experience,

127
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the cars were clean and reliable, and it all worked.

128
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so from a branding perspective, they got a lot right.

129
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But they understood fundamentally

130
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that they are not a car company.

131
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
They understand that they are an information company.

132
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because when we buy a car

133
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we go to the dealer once, we have an interaction, and we're chow --

134
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
usually as quickly as possible.

135
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But when you're sharing a car and you have a car-share service,

136
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you might use an E.V. to commute,

137
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
you get a truck because you're doing a home project.

138
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
When you pick your aunt up at the airport, you get a sedan.

139
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And you're going to the mountains to ski,

140
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
you get different accessories put on the car

141
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for doing that sort of thing.

142
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Meanwhile, these guys are sitting back,

143
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
collecting all sorts of data

144
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
about our behavior and how we interact with the service.

145
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And so it's not only an option for them,

146
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but I believe it's an imperative

147
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
for Zipcar and other mesh companies

148
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to actually just wow us,

149
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to be like a concierge service.

150
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Because we give them so much information,

151
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and they are entitled to really see

152
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
how it is that we're moving.

153
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
They're in really good shape to anticipate

154
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
what we're going to want next.

155
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And so what percent of the day

156
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
do you think the average person uses a car?

157
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What percentage of the time?

158
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Any guesses?

159
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Those are really very good.

160
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I was imagining it was like

161
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
20 percent when I first started.

162
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The number across the U.S. and Western Europe

163
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is eight percent.

164
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And so basically even if you think it's 10 percent,

165
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
90 percent of the time,

166
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
something that costs us a lot of money --

167
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
personally, and also we organize our cities around it

168
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and all sorts of things --

169
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
90 percent of the time it's sitting around.

170
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So for this reason,

171
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I think one of the other themes with the mesh

172
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is essentially that, if we squeeze hard

173
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
on things that we've thrown away,

174
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
there's a lot of value in those things.

175
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
What set up with Zipcar -- Zipcar started in 2000.

176
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In the last year, 2010,

177
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
two car companies started,

178
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar,

179
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and the other one, RelayRides, in the U.S.

180
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They're both peer-to-peer car-sharing services,

181
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
because the two things that really work for car-sharing

182
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is, one, the car has to be available,

183
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and two, it's within one or two blocks

184
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of where you stand.

185
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office

186
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is probably your neighbor's car,

187
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and it's probably also available.

188
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So people have created this business.

189
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Zipcar started a decade earlier,

190
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in 2000.

191
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It took them six years

192
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to get 1,000 cars in service.

193
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
WhipCar, which started April of last year,

194
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it took them six months

195
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to get 1,000 cars in the service.

196
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So, really interesting.

197
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
People are making anywhere between

198
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
200 and 700 dollars a month

199
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it.

200
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So it's like vacation rentals for cars.

201
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Since I'm here --

202
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and I hope some people in the audience

203
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
are in the car business --

204
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
-- I'm thinking that, coming from the technology side of things --

206
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
we saw cable-ready TVs

207
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and WiFi-ready Notebooks --

208
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
it would be really great if, any minute now,

209
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
you guys could start rolling share-ready cars off.

210
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Because it just creates more flexibility.

211
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It allows us as owners to have other options.

212
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I think we're going there anyway.

213
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses --

214
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix

215
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that are full mesh businesses,

216
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies,

217
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
car manufacturers,

218
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
who are beginning to offer

219
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
their own car-share services

220
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
as well as a second flanker brand,

221
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or as really a test, I think --

222
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is to make sharing irresistible.

223
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We have experiences in our lives, certainly,

224
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
when sharing has been irresistible.

225
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's just, how do we make that recurrent

226
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and scale it?

227
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We know also, because we're connected in social networks,

228
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that it's easy to create delight

229
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in one little place.

230
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It's contagious because we're all connected to each other.

231
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So if I have a terrific experience

232
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and I tweet it, or I tell five people standing next to me, news travels.

233
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The opposite, as we know, is also true,

234
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
often more true.

235
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So here we have LudoTruck, which is in L.A.,

236
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
doing the things that gourmet food trucks do,

237
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and they've gathered quite a following.

238
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
In general, and maybe, again, it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur,

239
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I look at things as platforms.

240
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Platforms are invitations.

241
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So creating Craigslist

242
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or iTunes and the iPhone developer network,

243
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
there are all these networks -- Facebook as well.

244
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
These platforms invite all sorts of developers

245
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and all sorts of people

246
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to come with their ideas and their opportunity

247
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to create and target an application

248
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
for a particular audience.

249
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And honestly, it's full of surprises.

250
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Because I don't think any of us in this room

251
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
could have predicted the sorts of applications

252
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that have happened at Facebook, around Facebook,

253
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for example, two years ago,

254
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
when Mark announced

255
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that they were going to go with a platform.

256
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So in this way, I think that cities are platforms,

257
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and certainly Detroit is a platform.

258
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The invitation of bringing

259
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
makers and artists and entrepreneurs --

260
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity

261
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and helps a city to thrive.

262
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's inviting participation,

263
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and cities have, historically,

264
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
invited all sorts of participation.

265
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now we're saying that there's other options as well.

266
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So, for example, city departments

267
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
can open up transit data.

268
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Google has made available transit data API.

269
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S.

270
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that have provided the transit data,

271
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and different developers are building applications.

272
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So I was having a coffee in Portland,

273
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and half-of-a-latte in

274
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and the little board in the cafe

275
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
all of a sudden starts showing me

276
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that the next bus is coming in three minutes

277
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and the train is coming in 16 minutes.

278
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And so it's reliable, real data

279
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
that's right in my face, where I am,

280
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
so I can finish the latte.

281
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now:

282
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
about 21 percent

283
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
of vacant commercial and industrial space.

284
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
That space is not vital.

285
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The areas around it lack vitality

286
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and vibrancy and engagement.

287
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
There's this thing -- how many people here

288
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
have heard of pop-up stores or pop-up shops?

289
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Oh, great. So I'm a big fan of this.

290
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And this is a very mesh-y thing.

291
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Essentially, there are all sorts

292
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of restaurants in Oakland, near where I live.

293
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
There's a pop-up general store every three weeks,

294
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and they do a fantastic job

295
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
of making a very social event

296
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
happening for foodies.

297
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Super fun, and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood.

298
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Subsequent to that,

299
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
after it's been going for about a year now,

300
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
they actually started to lease and create and extend.

301
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
An area that was edgy-artsy

302
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is now starting to become much cooler

303
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and engage a lot more people.

304
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So this is an example.

305
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts,

306
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and she does these pop-up crafts fairs around London.

307
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But these sorts of things are happening

308
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
in many different environments.

309
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
From my perspective, one of the things pop-up stores do

310
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is create perishability and urgency.

311
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson:

312
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
sold out.

313
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention

314
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is a wonderful thing.

315
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So a lot of what we see in the mesh,

316
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built

317
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
allows us to define, refine and scale.

318
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur,

319
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to go to market,

320
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to be in conversation with people,

321
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
listen, refine something and go back.

322
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
It's very cost-effective,

323
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and it's very mesh-y.

324
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The infrastructure enables that.

325
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
In closing, and as we're moving towards the end,

326
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I just also want to encourage --

327
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and I'm willing to share my failures as well,

328
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
though not from the stage.

329
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Laughter)

330
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I would just like to say that one of the big things,

331
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
when we look at waste

332
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and when we look at ways that we can really be generous

333
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and contribute to each other,

334
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but also move to create a better economic situation

335
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and a better environmental situation,

336
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
is by sharing failures.

337
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And one quick example

338
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is Velib, in 2007,

339
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
came forward in Paris

340
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
with a very bold proposition,

341
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
a very big bike-sharing service.

342
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
They made a lot of mistakes.

343
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
They had some number of big successes.

344
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But they were very transparent, or they had to be,

345
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in the way that they exposed

346
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
what worked and didn't work.

347
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And so B.C. in Barcelona

348
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and B-cycle

349
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and Boris Bikes in London --

350
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
no one has had to repeat

351
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the version 1.0 screw-ups

352
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and expensive learning exercises

353
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that happened in Paris.

354
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So the opportunity when we're connected

355
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
is also to share failures and successes.

356
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We're at the very beginning of something

357
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that, what we're seeing

358
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and the way that mesh companies are coming forward,

359
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
is inviting, it's engaging, but it's very early.

360
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I have a website -- it's a directory --

361
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and it started with about 1,200 companies,

362
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and in the last two-and-a-half months

363
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
it's up to about 3,300 companies.

364
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And it grows on a very regular daily basis.

365
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
But it's very much at the beginning.

366
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride.

367
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And thank you very much.

368
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
(Applause)

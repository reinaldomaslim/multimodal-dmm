1
0:00:12.87,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Imagine if your daily commute involved tens of kilometers

2
0:00:16.803,000 --> 0:00:17,000
on these kinds of roads,

3
0:00:18.636,000 --> 0:00:19,000
driving this kind of vehicle,

4
0:00:20.234,000 --> 0:00:22,000
without any nearby service stations or breakdown assistance.

5
0:00:23.865,000 --> 0:00:26,000
For millions of drivers in many parts of Africa, this is the norm.

6
0:00:28.102,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Since over 90 percent of passenger cars are imported,

7
0:00:30.974,000 --> 0:00:31,000
often used,

8
0:00:32.219,000 --> 0:00:34,000
they're just not designed for local usage.

9
0:00:34.775,000 --> 0:00:37,000
High import duties often compound the problem,

10
0:00:37.884,000 --> 0:00:38,000
sometimes doubling the price of a car.

11
0:00:40.195,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So most vehicles are either too expensive or too unreliable

12
0:00:44.426,000 --> 0:00:45,000
for the average consumer.

13
0:00:46.144,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Well-designed vehicles are only part of the transport challenge, though.

14
0:00:49.833,000 --> 0:00:51,000
For every 100 adults in Africa,

15
0:00:52.069,000 --> 0:00:54,000
less than five people actually own a vehicle.

16
0:00:54.948,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Public transport is available,

17
0:00:56.49,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and in countries like Kenya, it's often run by local entrepreneurs

18
0:00:59.672,000 --> 0:01:,000
using minivans like this.

19
0:01:00.937,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But in most rural and peri-urban areas,

20
0:01:03.318,000 --> 0:01:05,000
it's fragmented and unreliable.

21
0:01:06.607,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In more remote areas without transport,

22
0:01:08.638,000 --> 0:01:1,000
people have to walk, typically tens of kilometers,

23
0:01:11.205,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to get to school or collect clean drinking water

24
0:01:13.862,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or buy supplies from nearby markets.

25
0:01:16.348,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Bad roads, disparate communities, low average income levels

26
0:01:19.989,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and inadequate vehicles

27
0:01:21.171,000 --> 0:01:22,000
all impair the transport system

28
0:01:22.942,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and ultimately constrain economic output.

29
0:01:26.577,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Despite this constraint, the Pan-African economy is booming.

30
0:01:29.835,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Combined GDP is already over two trillion dollars.

31
0:01:33.518,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This is a massive commercial and social opportunity,

32
0:01:36.828,000 --> 0:01:37,000
not a helpless continent.

33
0:01:39.016,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So why isn't there already something better?

34
0:01:42.151,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Around the world, automotive is quarter the manufacturing sector.

35
0:01:45.513,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But in Africa, it's generally been overlooked by carmakers,

36
0:01:48.459,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who are focused on larger, established markets

37
0:01:50.635,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and emerging economies like India and China.

38
0:01:53.562,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This lack of industrialization,

39
0:01:55.099,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which itself creates a vicious-cycle barrier to the emergence of industry,

40
0:01:58.646,000 --> 0:02:,000
has caused the dependence on imports.

41
0:02:01.406,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There is a supply-demand disconnect,

42
0:02:03.295,000 --> 0:02:06,000
with the vast majority of automotive spending on the continent today,

43
0:02:06.61,000 --> 0:02:08,000
essentially funding an international network of car exporters

44
0:02:09.587,000 --> 0:02:11,000
instead of fueling the growth of local industry.

45
0:02:12.534,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's entirely possible to solve this disconnect, though,

46
0:02:15.285,000 --> 0:02:17,000
starting with products that people actually want.

47
0:02:17.983,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And this is what motivated me to start Mobius,

48
0:02:20.838,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to build a vehicle in Africa, for Africa.

49
0:02:25.12,000 --> 0:02:28,000
To us, this meant reimagining the car around the needs of the consumer,

50
0:02:28.788,000 --> 0:02:3,000
simplifying nonessential features like interior fixtures

51
0:02:31.648,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and investing in performance-critical systems like suspension

52
0:02:34.646,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to create durable and affordable vehicles

53
0:02:36.941,000 --> 0:02:37,000
built for purpose.

54
0:02:38.53,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And built for purpose is exactly where we started

55
0:02:41.03,000 --> 0:02:43,000
with our first-generation model, Mobius II,

56
0:02:43.505,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which was designed as a really rugged, low-cost SUV,

57
0:02:47.01,000 --> 0:02:49,000
able to handle heavy loads and rough terrain reliably.

58
0:02:50.666,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This launched in 2015,

59
0:02:52.937,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and we've now developed the next-generation version

60
0:02:55.442,000 --> 0:02:56,000
based on customer feedback.

61
0:02:57.137,000 --> 0:02:58,000
For high stress and heavy loading,

62
0:02:59.073,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we engineered a sturdy steel space frame.

63
0:03:01.48,000 --> 0:03:03,000
To handle acute vibration from rough roads,

64
0:03:04.003,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we ruggedized the suspension.

65
0:03:06.521,000 --> 0:03:09,000
For potholes and uneven terrain, high ground clearance was a no-brainer.

66
0:03:10.145,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And to make this something customers could actually be proud to drive in,

67
0:03:13.696,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we designed an aspirational body aesthetic.

68
0:03:16.463,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Underpinning all of this, we simplified or eliminated components

69
0:03:19.966,000 --> 0:03:21,000
like parking sensors and automatic windows

70
0:03:22.035,000 --> 0:03:23,000
wherever we could,

71
0:03:23.219,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to keep costs low

72
0:03:24.547,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and sell this at half the price of a five-year-old SUV in Kenya today.

73
0:03:30.271,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The new --

74
0:03:31.446,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

75
0:03:35.66,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The new Mobius II launches in 2018.

76
0:03:38.793,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And while durable, affordable vehicles like this are vital,

77
0:03:41.855,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a broader solution to immobility needs to go further.

78
0:03:45.304,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Over the last decade,

79
0:03:46.479,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a transport-centric, shared economy has connected people across Africa

80
0:03:49.862,000 --> 0:03:51,000
with minivans, auto rickshaws and sedans.

81
0:03:52.277,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's just not operated very effectively or efficiently.

82
0:03:55.712,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Enabling better access to transport is all about strengthening

83
0:03:58.686,000 --> 0:03:59,000
this public transit network,

84
0:04:00.083,000 --> 0:04:03,000
empowering local entrepreneurs who already offer similar services

85
0:04:03.265,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in their communities

86
0:04:04.468,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to operate these services more profitably and more widely.

87
0:04:08.221,000 --> 0:04:11,000
With this aim, we're taking human-centered design a step further

88
0:04:11.46,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and developing a transport platform model,

89
0:04:13.763,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which enables owners to plug in different modules,

90
0:04:16.121,000 --> 0:04:17,000
like a goods cage or ambulance unit,

91
0:04:18.036,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and run other services like goods delivery or medical transport,

92
0:04:21.132,000 --> 0:04:22,000
as well as public transport.

93
0:04:23.301,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Transportation services like this are the fundamental driver

94
0:04:26.883,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of logistics, trade, social services,

95
0:04:29.689,000 --> 0:04:31,000
access to education, health care and employment.

96
0:04:32.081,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The transportation grid to physical economies

97
0:04:34.287,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is akin to the internet to virtual economies.

98
0:04:36.785,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And the impact of increased mobility is only part of the potential here.

99
0:04:41.381,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Since the late 1700s, the Industrial Revolution has catapulted

100
0:04:45.122,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the development of economies around the world

101
0:04:47.276,000 --> 0:04:48,000
into thriving societies.

102
0:04:49.139,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Today, manufacturing is still the engine of economic growth and stability,

103
0:04:52.736,000 --> 0:04:55,000
even as new technologies have inevitably transformed the way we live.

104
0:04:56.51,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Making stuff is important,

105
0:04:58.298,000 --> 0:05:,000
especially for nation-states wanting to boost employment,

106
0:05:01.013,000 --> 0:05:03,000
increase skills and reduce import dependence.

107
0:05:03.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But while few countries can skip this industrialized stage,

108
0:05:06.657,000 --> 0:05:08,000
many have negligible manufacturing output.

109
0:05:09.707,000 --> 0:05:1,000
There are various reasons for this,

110
0:05:11.689,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but one reason is universal: hardware is hard.

111
0:05:14.601,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:16.768,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So what are the challenges to industry, and how are we approaching them?

113
0:05:20.459,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The first issue many people think of is a lack of skilled labor.

114
0:05:23.499,000 --> 0:05:26,000
In areas where access to good primary and secondary education are limited

115
0:05:27.064,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and employment opportunities are scarce,

116
0:05:29.03,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a small skill base is inevitable.

117
0:05:31.352,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But that doesn't mean it's immutable.

118
0:05:33.634,000 --> 0:05:36,000
There's an abundance of smart, hardworking and ambitious people in Africa,

119
0:05:37.222,000 --> 0:05:38,000
obviously.

120
0:05:38.61,000 --> 0:05:39,000
What's really lacking are good jobs

121
0:05:40.355,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that offer a path not just to employment but also professional growth.

122
0:05:44.414,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The first person we employed at Mobius over six years ago

123
0:05:47.241,000 --> 0:05:48,000
was a mechanic named Kazungu.

124
0:05:48.774,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Kazungu had gone to school up to the age of 18

125
0:05:51.262,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and worked as an odd-job mechanic.

126
0:05:53.019,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Joining the company at the time was a near-vertical learning curve.

127
0:05:56.548,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But he rose to the challenge,

128
0:05:57.985,000 --> 0:06:,000
and with more technical guidance from an expanding engineering team,

129
0:06:01.376,000 --> 0:06:02,000
he's grown over the years

130
0:06:02.621,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to lead a group of mechanics in R&D prototyping.

131
0:06:04.95,000 --> 0:06:07,000
A thirst for learning and the work ethic to step up to a challenge

132
0:06:08.158,000 --> 0:06:09,000
are values we now recruit on.

133
0:06:09.764,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Pairing innate values like this with on-the-job training and systems

134
0:06:13.165,000 --> 0:06:14,000
has strengthened our skill base.

135
0:06:14.822,000 --> 0:06:16,000
This works really well on the production line,

136
0:06:17.135,000 --> 0:06:2,000
where work can be systematized around clear procedural instructions

137
0:06:20.412,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and then reinforced through training.

138
0:06:23.053,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In our experience, it is possible to build a skilled workforce,

139
0:06:26.361,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we plan to hire hundreds more people using this approach.

140
0:06:30.75,000 --> 0:06:32,000
A second challenge is a lack of suppliers.

141
0:06:33.092,000 --> 0:06:36,000
In countries like Kenya, there are only a handful of automotive suppliers

142
0:06:36.699,000 --> 0:06:39,000
manufacturing parts like electrical harnesses, seats and glass.

143
0:06:39.827,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's a burgeoning group,

144
0:06:41.233,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and without much demand from industry,

145
0:06:43.169,000 --> 0:06:45,000
most of these suppliers have no impetus to grow.

146
0:06:46.323,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We've worked hard with a few of them to develop the capacity

147
0:06:49.287,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to consistently manufacture components at the quality levels we need,

148
0:06:52.591,000 --> 0:06:53,000
like this supplier in Nairobi,

149
0:06:54.179,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who are helping to reduce the production cost of metal brackets

150
0:06:57.284,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and improve their ability to build conformant parts

151
0:06:59.763,000 --> 0:07:,000
to our engineering drawings.

152
0:07:01.705,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Supply and development is standard practice in automotive globally,

153
0:07:04.892,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but it needs to be applied from the ground up

154
0:07:07.034,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with a vast majority of local suppliers

155
0:07:08.932,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to properly bolster the ecosystem.

156
0:07:11.201,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And as production volumes rise, these suppliers can employ more staff,

157
0:07:14.896,000 --> 0:07:15,000
invest in better equipment

158
0:07:16.451,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and continue to develop new manufacturing techniques

159
0:07:19.005,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to further increase output.

160
0:07:21.899,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Building up skills and suppliers are not the only hurdles

161
0:07:24.661,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to local industrialization,

162
0:07:26.035,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but they're good examples of how we think about the challenge.

163
0:07:29.121,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You see, we're not just reimagining the car,

164
0:07:31.678,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we're reimagining our entire value chain.

165
0:07:35.171,000 --> 0:07:36,000
None of this has been easy,

166
0:07:36.834,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and we're only just getting started.

167
0:07:38.712,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But once African industry starts to scale,

168
0:07:40.841,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the potential is huge.

169
0:07:42.735,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Better products,

170
0:07:44.285,000 --> 0:07:45,000
costing less,

171
0:07:45.722,000 --> 0:07:46,000
built locally,

172
0:07:47.003,000 --> 0:07:49,000
together creating millions of jobs.

173
0:07:49.956,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Frugal innovation offers a path to economic acceleration

174
0:07:52.686,000 --> 0:07:53,000
across many industries,

175
0:07:54.201,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and the future of this continent depends on it.

176
0:07:57.777,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The Africa 2.0 I believe in can apply locally relevant design

177
0:08:01.984,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and a commitment to solving its industrial challenges

178
0:08:04.566,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to create a more connected, more prosperous future,

179
0:08:07.443,000 --> 0:08:09,000
not just for the privileged few,

180
0:08:09.495,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but for everyone.

181
0:08:10.965,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Thank you.

182
0:08:12.187,000 --> 0:08:14,000

1
0:00:12.98,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There's a man by the name of Captain

2
0:00:15.24,000 --> 0:00:17,000
William Swenson

3
0:00:17.57,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who recently was awarded the congressional Medal of Honor

4
0:00:20.772,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for his actions on September 8, 2009.

5
0:00:25.63,000 --> 0:00:27,000
On that day, a column of American

6
0:00:27.995,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and Afghan troops

7
0:00:29.279,000 --> 0:00:3,000
were making their way

8
0:00:30.756,000 --> 0:00:32,000
through a part of Afghanistan

9
0:00:33.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to help protect

10
0:00:36.913,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a group of government officials,

11
0:00:38.008,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a group of Afghan government officials,

12
0:00:39.854,000 --> 0:00:41,000
who would be meeting with some local

13
0:00:42.22,000 --> 0:00:43,000
village elders.

14
0:00:43.723,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The column came under ambush,

15
0:00:45.99,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and was surrounded on three sides,

16
0:00:48.497,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and amongst many other things,

17
0:00:51.437,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Captain Swenson was recognized

18
0:00:52.843,000 --> 0:00:54,000
for running into live fire

19
0:00:55.06,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to rescue the wounded

20
0:00:56.241,000 --> 0:01:,000
and pull out the dead.

21
0:01:00.464,000 --> 0:01:02,000
One of the people he rescued was a sergeant,

22
0:01:03.32,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and he and a comrade were making their way

23
0:01:05.758,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to a medevac helicopter.

24
0:01:08.048,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And what was remarkable about this day

25
0:01:10.236,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is, by sheer coincidence,

26
0:01:12.227,000 --> 0:01:13,000
one of the medevac medics

27
0:01:13.907,000 --> 0:01:15,000
happened to have a GoPro camera on his helmet

28
0:01:16.295,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and captured the whole scene on camera.

29
0:01:21.057,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It shows Captain Swenson and his comrade

30
0:01:24.263,000 --> 0:01:25,000
bringing this wounded soldier

31
0:01:25.489,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who had received a gunshot to the neck.

32
0:01:30.039,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They put him in the helicopter,

33
0:01:33.532,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and then you see Captain Swenson bend over

34
0:01:37.86,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and give him a kiss

35
0:01:40.043,000 --> 0:01:44,000
before he turns around to rescue more.

36
0:01:44.881,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I saw this, and I thought to myself,

37
0:01:48.088,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where do people like that come from?

38
0:01:50.86,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What is that? That is some deep, deep emotion,

39
0:01:53.903,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when you would want to do that.

40
0:01:55.604,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There's a love there,

41
0:01:57.644,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I wanted to know why is it that

42
0:01:59.778,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I don't have people that I work with like that?

43
0:02:02.462,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You know, in the military, they give medals

44
0:02:03.88,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to people who are willing to sacrifice themselves

45
0:02:06.502,000 --> 0:02:07,000
so that others may gain.

46
0:02:08.34,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In business, we give bonuses to people

47
0:02:10.268,000 --> 0:02:11,000
who are willing to sacrifice others

48
0:02:11.976,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so that we may gain.

49
0:02:13.47,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We have it backwards. Right?

50
0:02:17.134,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I asked myself, where do people like this come from?

51
0:02:19.013,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And my initial conclusion was that they're just better people.

52
0:02:22.236,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That's why they're attracted to the military.

53
0:02:23.756,000 --> 0:02:24,000
These better people are attracted

54
0:02:25.217,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to this concept of service.

55
0:02:27.963,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But that's completely wrong.

56
0:02:29.063,000 --> 0:02:31,000
What I learned was that it's the environment,

57
0:02:31.9,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and if you get the environment right,

58
0:02:34.07,000 --> 0:02:35,000
every single one of us has the capacity

59
0:02:35.793,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to do these remarkable things,

60
0:02:37.311,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and more importantly, others have that capacity too.

61
0:02:40.142,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I've had the great honor of getting to meet

62
0:02:42.587,000 --> 0:02:45,000
some of these, who we would call heroes,

63
0:02:45.702,000 --> 0:02:46,000
who have put themselves and put their lives

64
0:02:47.604,000 --> 0:02:48,000
at risk to save others,

65
0:02:49.203,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and I asked them, "Why would you do it?

66
0:02:51.706,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Why did you do it?"

67
0:02:53.759,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And they all say the same thing:

68
0:02:56.66,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Because they would have done it for me."

69
0:02:58.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's this deep sense of trust and cooperation.

70
0:03:01.667,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So trust and cooperation are really important here.

71
0:03:04.266,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The problem with concepts of trust and cooperation

72
0:03:07.425,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is that they are feelings, they are not instructions.

73
0:03:09.73,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I can't simply say to you, "Trust me," and you will.

74
0:03:12.765,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I can't simply instruct two people to cooperate, and they will.

75
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It's not how it works. It's a feeling.

76
0:03:18.434,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So where does that feeling come from?

77
0:03:20.848,000 --> 0:03:22,000
If you go back 50,000 years

78
0:03:22.93,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to the Paleolithic era,

79
0:03:24.109,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to the early days of Homo sapiens,

80
0:03:26.265,000 --> 0:03:27,000
what we find is that the world

81
0:03:27.88,000 --> 0:03:29,000
was filled with danger,

82
0:03:30.215,000 --> 0:03:34,000
all of these forces working very, very hard to kill us.

83
0:03:34.607,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Nothing personal.

84
0:03:36.106,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Whether it was the weather,

85
0:03:38.548,000 --> 0:03:39,000
lack of resources,

86
0:03:40.188,000 --> 0:03:41,000
maybe a saber-toothed tiger,

87
0:03:41.67,000 --> 0:03:42,000
all of these things working

88
0:03:43.005,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to reduce our lifespan.

89
0:03:45.141,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And so we evolved into social animals,

90
0:03:47.442,000 --> 0:03:48,000
where we lived together and worked together

91
0:03:49.417,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in what I call a circle of safety, inside the tribe,

92
0:03:52.841,000 --> 0:03:54,000
where we felt like we belonged.

93
0:03:54.864,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And when we felt safe amongst our own,

94
0:03:57.595,000 --> 0:04:,000
the natural reaction was trust and cooperation.

95
0:04:00.803,000 --> 0:04:01,000
There are inherent benefits to this.

96
0:04:01.905,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It means I can fall asleep at night

97
0:04:03.793,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and trust that someone from within my tribe will watch for danger.

98
0:04:07.665,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If we don't trust each other, if I don't trust you,

99
0:04:09.997,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that means you won't watch for danger.

100
0:04:11.381,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Bad system of survival.

101
0:04:13.252,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The modern day is exactly the same thing.

102
0:04:15.591,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The world is filled with danger,

103
0:04:17.212,000 --> 0:04:18,000
things that are trying to frustrate our lives

104
0:04:18.967,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or reduce our success,

105
0:04:20.136,000 --> 0:04:21,000
reduce our opportunity for success.

106
0:04:21.86,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It could be the ups and downs in the economy,

107
0:04:24.229,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the uncertainty of the stock market.

108
0:04:26.569,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It could be a new technology that renders

109
0:04:28.313,000 --> 0:04:3,000
your business model obsolete overnight.

110
0:04:30.47,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Or it could be your competition

111
0:04:32.119,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that is sometimes trying to kill you.

112
0:04:34.119,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's sometimes trying to put you out of business,

113
0:04:36.004,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but at the very minimum

114
0:04:37.715,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is working hard to frustrate your growth

115
0:04:40.378,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and steal your business from you.

116
0:04:42.508,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We have no control over these forces.

117
0:04:44.253,000 --> 0:04:45,000
These are a constant,

118
0:04:45.77,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and they're not going away.

119
0:04:47.748,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The only variable are the conditions

120
0:04:49.794,000 --> 0:04:51,000
inside the organization,

121
0:04:52.357,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and that's where leadership matters,

122
0:04:54.282,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because it's the leader that sets the tone.

123
0:04:56.961,000 --> 0:04:58,000
When a leader makes the choice

124
0:04:59.4,000 --> 0:05:,000
to put the safety and lives

125
0:05:00.929,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of the people inside the organization first,

126
0:05:03.19,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice

127
0:05:06.068,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the tangible results, so that the people remain

128
0:05:09.573,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and feel safe and feel like they belong,

129
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
remarkable things happen.

130
0:05:13.894,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I was flying on a trip,

131
0:05:17.013,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I was witness to an incident

132
0:05:19.128,000 --> 0:05:2,000
where a passenger attempted to board

133
0:05:21.016,000 --> 0:05:24,000
before their number was called,

134
0:05:24.627,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I watched the gate agent

135
0:05:27.196,000 --> 0:05:29,000
treat this man like he had broken the law,

136
0:05:29.62,000 --> 0:05:3,000
like a criminal.

137
0:05:31.029,000 --> 0:05:32,000
He was yelled at for attempting to board

138
0:05:32.875,000 --> 0:05:34,000
one group too soon.

139
0:05:35.246,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So I said something.

140
0:05:36.69,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I said, "Why do you have treat us like cattle?

141
0:05:39.36,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Why can't you treat us like human beings?"

142
0:05:42.451,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And this is exactly what she said to me.

143
0:05:44.572,000 --> 0:05:46,000
She said, "Sir, if I don't follow the rules,

144
0:05:47.258,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I could get in trouble or lose my job."

145
0:05:50.408,000 --> 0:05:51,000
All she was telling me

146
0:05:51.99,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is that she doesn't feel safe.

147
0:05:53.646,000 --> 0:05:55,000
All she was telling me is that

148
0:05:55.987,000 --> 0:05:58,000
she doesn't trust her leaders.

149
0:05:59.206,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The reason we like flying Southwest Airlines

150
0:06:01.928,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is not because they necessarily hire better people.

151
0:06:04.395,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's because they don't fear their leaders.

152
0:06:07.434,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You see, if the conditions are wrong,

153
0:06:09.356,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we are forced to expend our own time and energy

154
0:06:11.615,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to protect ourselves from each other,

155
0:06:14.479,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and that inherently weakens the organization.

156
0:06:17.778,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When we feel safe inside the organization,

157
0:06:19.409,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we will naturally combine our talents

158
0:06:21.603,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and our strengths and work tirelessly

159
0:06:23.749,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to face the dangers outside

160
0:06:25.431,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and seize the opportunities.

161
0:06:28.566,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The closest analogy I can give

162
0:06:29.887,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to what a great leader is, is like being a parent.

163
0:06:33.099,000 --> 0:06:34,000
If you think about what being a great parent is,

164
0:06:34.758,000 --> 0:06:35,000
what do you want? What makes a great parent?

165
0:06:36.588,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We want to give our child opportunities,

166
0:06:37.94,000 --> 0:06:39,000
education, discipline them when necessary,

167
0:06:40.658,000 --> 0:06:42,000
all so that they can grow up and achieve more

168
0:06:42.694,000 --> 0:06:44,000
than we could for ourselves.

169
0:06:45.259,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Great leaders want exactly the same thing.

170
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They want to provide their people opportunity,

171
0:06:48.501,000 --> 0:06:49,000
education, discipline when necessary,

172
0:06:50.288,000 --> 0:06:53,000
build their self-confidence, give them the opportunity to try and fail,

173
0:06:53.45,000 --> 0:06:54,000
all so that they could achieve more

174
0:06:55.161,000 --> 0:06:59,000
than we could ever imagine for ourselves.

175
0:06:59.591,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Charlie Kim, who's the CEO of a company called Next Jump

176
0:07:02.728,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in New York City, a tech company,

177
0:07:05.478,000 --> 0:07:06,000
he makes the point that

178
0:07:06.97,000 --> 0:07:08,000
if you had hard times in your family,

179
0:07:09.099,000 --> 0:07:12,000
would you ever consider laying off one of your children?

180
0:07:12.148,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We would never do it.

181
0:07:13.65,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Then why do we consider laying off people

182
0:07:15.677,000 --> 0:07:16,000
inside our organization?

183
0:07:17.254,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Charlie implemented a policy

184
0:07:20.054,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of lifetime employment.

185
0:07:21.99,000 --> 0:07:22,000
If you get a job at Next Jump,

186
0:07:23.62,000 --> 0:07:26,000
you cannot get fired for performance issues.

187
0:07:27.08,000 --> 0:07:28,000
In fact, if you have issues,

188
0:07:29.063,000 --> 0:07:32,000
they will coach you and they will give you support,

189
0:07:32.11,000 --> 0:07:33,000
just like we would with one of our children

190
0:07:33.571,000 --> 0:07:35,000
who happens to come home with a C from school.

191
0:07:36.41,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's the complete opposite.

192
0:07:37.363,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is the reason so many people

193
0:07:38.98,000 --> 0:07:42,000
have such a visceral hatred, anger,

194
0:07:43.244,000 --> 0:07:44,000
at some of these banking CEOs

195
0:07:44.912,000 --> 0:07:46,000
with their disproportionate salaries and bonus structures.

196
0:07:47.74,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's not the numbers.

197
0:07:49.71,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's that they have violated the very definition of leadership.

198
0:07:52.548,000 --> 0:07:54,000
They have violated this deep-seated social contract.

199
0:07:55.442,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We know that they allowed their people

200
0:07:57.045,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to be sacrificed so they could protect their own interests,

201
0:07:59.56,000 --> 0:08:02,000
or worse, they sacrificed their people

202
0:08:02.752,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to protect their own interests.

203
0:08:04.212,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is what so offends us, not the numbers.

204
0:08:07.023,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Would anybody be offended if we gave

205
0:08:08.62,000 --> 0:08:1,000
a $150 million bonus to Gandhi?

206
0:08:11.193,000 --> 0:08:14,000
How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa?

207
0:08:14.232,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Do we have an issue with that? None at all.

208
0:08:16.966,000 --> 0:08:17,000
None at all.

209
0:08:18.298,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Great leaders would never sacrifice

210
0:08:20.509,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the people to save the numbers.

211
0:08:21.87,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They would sooner sacrifice the numbers

212
0:08:23.549,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to save the people.

213
0:08:26.528,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Bob Chapman, who runs

214
0:08:28.651,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a large manufacturing company in the Midwest

215
0:08:30.964,000 --> 0:08:32,000
called Barry-Wehmiller,

216
0:08:33.04,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in 2008 was hit very hard by the recession,

217
0:08:38.397,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and they lost 30 percent of their orders overnight.

218
0:08:42.398,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now in a large manufacturing company,

219
0:08:43.784,000 --> 0:08:44,000
this is a big deal,

220
0:08:45.325,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and they could no longer afford their labor pool.

221
0:08:48.172,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They needed to save 10 million dollars,

222
0:08:49.875,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so, like so many companies today,

223
0:08:51.898,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the board got together and discussed layoffs.

224
0:08:55.292,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And Bob refused.

225
0:08:56.916,000 --> 0:09:,000
You see, Bob doesn't believe in head counts.

226
0:09:01.168,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Bob believes in heart counts,

227
0:09:04.609,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and it's much more difficult to simply reduce

228
0:09:07.117,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the heart count.

229
0:09:08.847,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And so they came up with a furlough program.

230
0:09:11.854,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Every employee, from secretary to CEO,

231
0:09:13.945,000 --> 0:09:16,000
was required to take four weeks of unpaid vacation.

232
0:09:17.411,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They could take it any time they wanted,

233
0:09:19.322,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and they did not have to take it consecutively.

234
0:09:22.303,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But it was how Bob announced the program

235
0:09:23.635,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that mattered so much.

236
0:09:25.532,000 --> 0:09:27,000
He said, it's better that we should all suffer a little

237
0:09:28.18,000 --> 0:09:3,000
than any of us should have to suffer a lot,

238
0:09:30.965,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and morale went up.

239
0:09:34.083,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They saved 20 million dollars,

240
0:09:37.01,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and most importantly, as would be expected,

241
0:09:39.447,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when the people feel safe and protected by the leadership in the organization,

242
0:09:42.676,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the natural reaction is to trust and cooperate.

243
0:09:45.183,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And quite spontaneously, nobody expected,

244
0:09:47.94,000 --> 0:09:48,000
people started trading with each other.

245
0:09:49.856,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Those who could afford it more

246
0:09:51.352,000 --> 0:09:53,000
would trade with those who could afford it less.

247
0:09:53.429,000 --> 0:09:54,000
People would take five weeks

248
0:09:54.918,000 --> 0:09:58,000
so that somebody else only had to take three.

249
0:09:59.08,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Leadership is a choice. It is not a rank.

250
0:10:02.014,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I know many people at the seniormost

251
0:10:03.722,000 --> 0:10:04,000
levels of organizations

252
0:10:04.88,000 --> 0:10:05,000
who are absolutely not leaders.

253
0:10:06.484,000 --> 0:10:08,000
They are authorities, and we do what they say

254
0:10:09.037,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because they have authority over us,

255
0:10:12.08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but we would not follow them.

256
0:10:13.94,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I know many people

257
0:10:15.974,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who are at the bottoms of organizations

258
0:10:17.336,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who have no authority

259
0:10:18.599,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and they are absolutely leaders,

260
0:10:20.662,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and this is because they have chosen to look after

261
0:10:22.447,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the person to the left of them,

262
0:10:23.965,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and they have chosen to look after

263
0:10:25.243,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the person to the right of them.

264
0:10:27.037,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is what a leader is.

265
0:10:31.77,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I heard a story

266
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:35,000
of some Marines

267
0:10:36.39,000 --> 0:10:39,000
who were out in theater,

268
0:10:39.711,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and as is the Marine custom,

269
0:10:41.757,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the officer ate last,

270
0:10:44.082,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and he let his men eat first,

271
0:10:47.258,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and when they were done,

272
0:10:49.11,000 --> 0:10:53,000
there was no food left for him.

273
0:10:53.2,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And when they went back out in the field,

274
0:10:55.933,000 --> 0:10:57,000
his men brought him some of their food

275
0:10:58.877,000 --> 0:10:59,000
so that he may eat,

276
0:11:00.734,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because that's what happens.

277
0:11:02.873,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We call them leaders because they go first.

278
0:11:05.562,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We call them leaders because they take the risk

279
0:11:07.305,000 --> 0:11:08,000
before anybody else does.

280
0:11:08.96,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We call them leaders because they will choose

281
0:11:10.99,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to sacrifice so that their people

282
0:11:12.999,000 --> 0:11:13,000
may be safe and protected

283
0:11:14.118,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and so their people may gain,

284
0:11:16.254,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and when we do, the natural response

285
0:11:19.308,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is that our people will sacrifice for us.

286
0:11:23.155,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They will give us their blood and sweat and tears

287
0:11:25.653,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to see that their leader's vision comes to life,

288
0:11:29.092,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and when we ask them, "Why would you do that?

289
0:11:31.864,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Why would you give your blood and sweat and tears

290
0:11:34.251,000 --> 0:11:38,000
for that person?" they all say the same thing:

291
0:11:38.735,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"Because they would have done it for me."

292
0:11:41.233,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And isn't that the organization

293
0:11:43.383,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we would all like to work in?

294
0:11:45.704,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Thank you very much.

295
0:11:48.261,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Thank you. (Applause)

296
0:11:51.862,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Thank you. (Applause)

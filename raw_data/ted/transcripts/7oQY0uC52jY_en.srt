1
0:00:12.381,000 --> 0:00:13,000
What do we know about the future?

2
0:00:14.383,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Difficult question, simple answer: nothing.

3
0:00:17.448,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We cannot predict the future.

4
0:00:19.939,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We only can create a vision of the future, how it might be,

5
0:00:24.578,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a vision which reveals disruptive ideas, which is inspiring,

6
0:00:27.911,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and this is the most important reason

7
0:00:30.197,000 --> 0:00:33,000
which breaks the chains of common thinking.

8
0:00:33.245,000 --> 0:00:34,000
There are a lot of people

9
0:00:34.573,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who created their own vision about the future,

10
0:00:36.788,000 --> 0:00:39,000
for instance, this vision here from the early 20th century.

11
0:00:39.979,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It says here that this is the ocean plane of the future.

12
0:00:44.039,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It takes only one and a half days to cross the Atlantic Ocean.

13
0:00:47.652,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Today, we know that this future vision didn't come true.

14
0:00:51.153,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So this is our largest airplane which we have,

15
0:00:54.085,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the Airbus A380, and it's quite huge,

16
0:00:56.884,000 --> 0:00:57,000
so a lot of people fit in there

17
0:00:58.432,000 --> 0:01:,000
and it's technically completely different

18
0:01:00.953,000 --> 0:01:02,000
than the vision I've shown to you.

19
0:01:03.164,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm working in a team with Airbus,

20
0:01:05.134,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and we have created our vision

21
0:01:06.713,000 --> 0:01:08,000
about a more sustainable future of aviation.

22
0:01:09.645,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So sustainability is quite important for us,

23
0:01:12.13,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which should incorporate social

24
0:01:13.904,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but as well as environmental and economic values.

25
0:01:16.994,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So we have created a very disruptive structure

26
0:01:19.9,000 --> 0:01:22,000
which mimics the design of bone, or a skeleton,

27
0:01:23.508,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which occurs in nature.

28
0:01:25.233,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So that's why it looks maybe a little bit weird,

29
0:01:27.543,000 --> 0:01:3,000
especially to the people who deal with structures in general.

30
0:01:31.311,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But at least it's just a kind of artwork

31
0:01:33.774,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to explore our ideas about a different future.

32
0:01:38.964,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What are the main customers of the future?

33
0:01:41.116,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So, we have the old, we have the young,

34
0:01:42.998,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we have the uprising power of women,

35
0:01:45.696,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and there's one mega-trend which affects all of us.

36
0:01:49.699,000 --> 0:01:51,000
These are the future anthropometrics.

37
0:01:52.124,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So our children are getting larger, but at the same time

38
0:01:55.616,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we are growing into different directions.

39
0:01:58.118,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So what we need is space inside the aircraft,

40
0:02:03.802,000 --> 0:02:05,000
inside a very dense area.

41
0:02:05.927,000 --> 0:02:06,000
These people have different needs.

42
0:02:07.665,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So we see a clear need of active health promotion,

43
0:02:11.223,000 --> 0:02:13,000
especially in the case of the old people.

44
0:02:13.895,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We want to be treated as individuals.

45
0:02:15.765,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We like to be productive throughout the entire travel chain,

46
0:02:21.258,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and what we are doing in the future is

47
0:02:23.555,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we want to use the latest man-machine interface,

48
0:02:26.735,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and we want to integrate this and show this in one product.

49
0:02:31.106,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So we combined these needs with technology's themes.

50
0:02:34.548,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So for instance, we are asking ourselves,

51
0:02:37.076,000 --> 0:02:39,000
how can we create more light?

52
0:02:39.289,000 --> 0:02:41,000
How can we bring more natural light into the airplane?

53
0:02:41.885,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So this airplane has no windows anymore, for example.

54
0:02:45.259,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What about the data and communication software

55
0:02:47.992,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which we need in the future?

56
0:02:49.665,000 --> 0:02:51,000
My belief is that the airplane of the future

57
0:02:52.566,000 --> 0:02:54,000
will get its own consciousness.

58
0:02:54.699,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It will be more like a living organism

59
0:02:57.178,000 --> 0:03:01,000
than just a collection of very complex technology.

60
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This will be very different in the future.

61
0:03:03.722,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It will communicate directly

62
0:03:05.291,000 --> 0:03:07,000
with the passenger in its environment.

63
0:03:08.171,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And then we are talking also about materials,

64
0:03:10.338,000 --> 0:03:11,000
synthetic biology, for example.

65
0:03:12.258,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And my belief is that we will get more and more

66
0:03:15.973,000 --> 0:03:18,000
new materials which we can put into structure later on,

67
0:03:19.675,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because structure is one of the key issues in aircraft design.

68
0:03:23.821,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So let's compare the old world with the new world.

69
0:03:27.093,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I just want to show you here what we are doing today.

70
0:03:29.641,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So this is a bracket of an A380 crew rest compartment.

71
0:03:33.34,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It takes a lot of weight,

72
0:03:35.037,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and it follows the classical design rules.

73
0:03:38.188,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This here is an equal bracket for the same purpose.

74
0:03:41.839,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It follows the design of bone.

75
0:03:43.988,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The design process is completely different.

76
0:03:46.508,000 --> 0:03:48,000
At the one hand, we have 1.2 kilos,

77
0:03:49.229,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and at the other hand 0.6 kilos.

78
0:03:51.172,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So this technology, 3D printing, and new design rules

79
0:03:54.439,000 --> 0:03:55,000
really help us to reduce the weight,

80
0:03:56.178,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which is the biggest issue in aircraft design,

81
0:03:58.626,000 --> 0:04:,000
because it's directly linked to greenhouse gas emissions.

82
0:04:01.365,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Push this idea a little bit forward.

83
0:04:03.185,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So how does nature build its components and structures?

84
0:04:08.076,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So nature is very clever. It puts all the information

85
0:04:11.117,000 --> 0:04:14,000
into these small building blocks, which we call DNA.

86
0:04:14.314,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And nature builds large skeletons out of it.

87
0:04:16.89,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So we see a bottom-up approach here,

88
0:04:19.384,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because all the information, as I said, are inside the DNA.

89
0:04:22.549,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And this is combined with a top-down approach,

90
0:04:24.764,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because what we are doing in our daily life

91
0:04:26.861,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is we train our muscles, we train our skeleton,

92
0:04:29.966,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and it's getting stronger.

93
0:04:31.966,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And the same approach can be applied to technology as well.

94
0:04:34.801,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So our building block is carbon nanotubes, for example,

95
0:04:38.187,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to create a large, rivet-less skeleton at the end of the day.

96
0:04:42.453,000 --> 0:04:45,000
How this looks in particular, you can show it here.

97
0:04:45.507,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So imagine you have carbon nanotubes growing

98
0:04:47.641,000 --> 0:04:48,000
inside a 3D printer,

99
0:04:49.078,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and they are embedded inside a matrix of plastic,

100
0:04:52.277,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and follow the forces which occur in your component.

101
0:04:55.37,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And you've got trillions of them.

102
0:04:57.113,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So you really align them to wood,

103
0:04:59.306,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and you take this wood and make morphological optimization,

104
0:05:02.475,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so you make structures, sub-structures,

105
0:05:04.434,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which allows you to transmit electrical energy or data.

106
0:05:08.467,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And now we take this material, combine this

107
0:05:10.539,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with a top-down approach,

108
0:05:11.982,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and build bigger and bigger components.

109
0:05:15.534,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So how might the airplane of the future look?

110
0:05:18.579,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So we have very different seats which adapt

111
0:05:20.7,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to the shape of the future passenger,

112
0:05:22.486,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with the different anthropometrics.

113
0:05:24.197,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We have social areas inside the aircraft

114
0:05:26.743,000 --> 0:05:28,000
which might turn into a place

115
0:05:29.503,000 --> 0:05:31,000
where you can play virtual golf.

116
0:05:31.703,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And finally, this bionic structure,

117
0:05:34.166,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which is covered by a transparent

118
0:05:36.327,000 --> 0:05:39,000
biopolymer membrane, will really change radically

119
0:05:40.191,000 --> 0:05:42,000
how we look at aircrafts in the future.

120
0:05:42.584,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So as Jason Silva said,

121
0:05:44.608,000 --> 0:05:46,000
if we can imagine it, why not make it so?

122
0:05:47.131,000 --> 0:05:48,000
See you in the future. Thank you.

123
0:05:48.866,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Applause)

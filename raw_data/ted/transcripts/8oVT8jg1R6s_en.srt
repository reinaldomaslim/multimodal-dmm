1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Just to put everything in context,

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so that a lot of the things I'm going to say,

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and the things I'm going to do --

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or things I'm going to tell you I've done --

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.

9
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.

10
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And by the time I was an intern house officer,

11
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car --

12
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I was a paid doctor.

13
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,

14
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
are now, as they say, in diaspora.

15
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing,

16
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?

17
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not --

18
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because that is not my vision.

19
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,

20
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.

21
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,

22
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.

23
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave

24
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap

25
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.

26
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Very interesting.

27
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
How many people do you think are on that taxi?

28
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.

29
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos,

30
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that's a taxi, and you have police on them.

31
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.

32
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police

33
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,

34
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I didn't have a helmet, either.

35
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us

36
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.

37
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Believe it or not, some of us do survive.

38
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.

39
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,

40
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."

41
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And she's right. Every time you go there,

42
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you know that if you actually need critical care --

43
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident --

44
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere --

45
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
where do they go?

46
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?

47
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,

48
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.

49
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?

50
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things,

51
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things,

52
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?

53
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?

54
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.

55
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden --

56
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.

57
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.

58
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.

59
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You remember all that oil?

60
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but

61
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?

62
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You can say some of this is education.

63
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.

64
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,

65
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated

66
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.

67
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
In fact, when I start running around saying,

68
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,

69
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
can you come home with me and do a mission?"

70
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."

71
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.

72
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And that's my specialty, right?

73
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.

74
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.

75
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And believe me, these are current pictures.

76
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,

77
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.

78
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave

79
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
about intensive care units in Nigeria,

80
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."

81
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?

82
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So, these are the problems.

83
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?

84
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I think we all know. And several speakers before

85
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.

86
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
These are a few of them. So, what did I do?

87
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There we go -- we're going on a mission.

88
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,

89
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,

90
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.

91
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.

92
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid

93
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and I do believe in charity. They have their place,

94
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?

95
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.

96
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.

97
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.

98
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So, here we are, mission. Big trouble.

99
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.

100
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.

101
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Does he look like he's happy?

102
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,

103
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?

104
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,

105
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,

106
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
you can't do this, I just know it."

107
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?

108
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

109
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.

110
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Yes, let's just go work this thing out.

111
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.

112
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We get a lot of donated equipment.

113
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,

114
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,

115
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so long as we use it and we move on.

116
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.

117
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.

118
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So what we going to do now?

119
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It looks like all these Americans are here and

120
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything --

121
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,

122
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I just thought about that.

123
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We eventually got it working, is the truth,

124
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.

125
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,

126
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.

127
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.

128
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.

129
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.

130
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,

131
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
you email them. But we were still using X-rays,

132
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but we didn't even have a viewing box!

133
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And we were doing open-heart surgery.

134
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,

135
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo --

136
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.

137
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,

138
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.

139
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You still get people who believe in it and they came.

140
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.

141
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,

142
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
would have been treated when she was a child.

143
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.

144
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We've done three. We're planning another one in July

145
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,

146
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in --

147
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions

148
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.

149
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.

150
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But how many did we do the first one? 12.

151
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.

152
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care,

153
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and just watch that chair, all right?

154
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is what I mean about appropriate technology.

155
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.

156
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Have you seen one of those before?

157
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.

158
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:

159
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long --

160
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Applause)

161
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
-- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."

162
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Applause)

163
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.

164
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.

165
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.

166
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,

167
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
gives them the tools they need to keep going."

168
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And that's a perfect example of one.

169
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,

170
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
you buy a different one for children,

171
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,

172
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.

173
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,

174
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
because we make it our duty to find out

175
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced,

176
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:

177
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.

178
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,

179
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?

180
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
That's exactly how the outlets are designed.

181
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.

182
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.

183
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.

184
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And guess what, if it all fails,

185
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if you can find a car that's still got a live battery

186
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.

187
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?

188
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.

189
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.

190
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.

191
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,

192
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and what we will have in a few months, I hope,

193
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is that ability to use this same renewable energy system

194
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new --

195
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.

196
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.

197
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.

198
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
These are the basic features of my device, or our device.

199
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
This is what makes it so special.

200
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Apart from the awards it's won,

201
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA --

202
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent

203
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of the FDA in the U.S.

204
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,

205
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
size-wise, ease of use, complexity ...

206
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
This picture was taken last year.

207
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
These are members of my graduating class, 1986.

208
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,

209
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.

210
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
There are too many of us outside and everybody,

211
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy --

212
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,

213
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions

214
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture,

215
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.

216
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.

217
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.

218
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
You have to do it. Africans have to do it,

219
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
in conjunction with everyone else.

220
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

221
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
(Applause)

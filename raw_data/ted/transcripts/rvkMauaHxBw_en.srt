1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was born and raised in Sierra Leone,

2
0:00:17.126,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a small and very beautiful country

3
0:00:19.371,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in West Africa,

4
0:00:21.076,000 --> 0:00:23,000
a country rich both in physical resources

5
0:00:23.98,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and creative talent.

6
0:00:26.312,000 --> 0:00:27,000
However, Sierra Leone is infamous

7
0:00:28.274,000 --> 0:00:3,000
for a decade-long rebel war in the '90s

8
0:00:30.688,000 --> 0:00:33,000
when entire villages were burnt down.

9
0:00:33.778,000 --> 0:00:37,000
An estimated 8,000 men, women and children

10
0:00:37.99,000 --> 0:00:41,000
had their arms and legs amputated during this time.

11
0:00:42.256,000 --> 0:00:44,000
As my family and I ran for safety

12
0:00:45.24,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when I was about 12 from one of those attacks,

13
0:00:47.932,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I resolved that I would do everything I could

14
0:00:51.364,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to ensure that my own children

15
0:00:53.644,000 --> 0:00:56,000
would not go through the same experiences we had.

16
0:00:57.03,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They would, in fact, be part of a Sierra Leone

17
0:00:59.644,000 --> 0:01:01,000
where war and amputation

18
0:01:02.132,000 --> 0:01:06,000
were no longer a strategy for gaining power.

19
0:01:06.838,000 --> 0:01:09,000
As I watched people who I knew, loved ones,

20
0:01:10.571,000 --> 0:01:11,000
recover from this devastation,

21
0:01:12.462,000 --> 0:01:14,000
one thing that deeply troubled me

22
0:01:15.126,000 --> 0:01:17,000
was that many of the amputees in the country

23
0:01:17.63,000 --> 0:01:19,000
would not use their prostheses.

24
0:01:19.686,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The reason, I would come to find out,

25
0:01:21.642,000 --> 0:01:23,000
was that their prosthetic sockets

26
0:01:23.977,000 --> 0:01:28,000
were painful because they did not fit well.

27
0:01:29.437,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The prosthetic socket is the part

28
0:01:31.623,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in which the amputee inserts their residual limb,

29
0:01:35.019,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and which connects to the prosthetic ankle.

30
0:01:37.299,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Even in the developed world,

31
0:01:39.037,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it takes a period of three weeks to often years

32
0:01:42.529,000 --> 0:01:46,000
for a patient to get a comfortable socket, if ever.

33
0:01:46.791,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Prosthetists still use conventional processes

34
0:01:49.673,000 --> 0:01:51,000
like molding and casting

35
0:01:52.029,000 --> 0:01:55,000
to create single-material prosthetic sockets.

36
0:01:55.747,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Such sockets often leave intolerable amounts

37
0:01:58.535,000 --> 0:02:,000
of pressure on the limbs of the patient,

38
0:02:01.363,000 --> 0:02:05,000
leaving them with pressure sores and blisters.

39
0:02:05.663,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It does not matter

40
0:02:07.775,000 --> 0:02:1,000
how powerful your prosthetic ankle is.

41
0:02:10.997,000 --> 0:02:12,000
If your prosthetic socket is uncomfortable,

42
0:02:13.693,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you will not use your leg,

43
0:02:15.265,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and that is just simply unacceptable in our age.

44
0:02:19.145,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So one day, when I met professor Hugh Herr

45
0:02:21.565,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about two and a half years ago,

46
0:02:23.09,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and he asked me if I knew how to solve this problem,

47
0:02:25.577,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I said, "No, not yet,

48
0:02:27.677,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but I would love to figure it out."

49
0:02:30.287,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And so, for my Ph.D. at the MIT Media Lab,

50
0:02:33.577,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I designed custom prosthetic sockets

51
0:02:36.47,000 --> 0:02:38,000
quickly and cheaply

52
0:02:39.377,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that are more comfortable

53
0:02:41.232,000 --> 0:02:43,000
than conventional prostheses.

54
0:02:44.229,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I used magnetic resonance imaging

55
0:02:46.471,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to capture the actual shape of the patient's anatomy,

56
0:02:50.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
then use finite element modeling to better predict

57
0:02:53.464,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the internal stresses and strains

58
0:02:55.407,000 --> 0:02:56,000
on the normal forces,

59
0:02:57.405,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then create a prosthetic socket for manufacture.

60
0:03:02.018,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We use a 3D printer to create

61
0:03:05.432,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a multi-material prosthetic socket

62
0:03:09.248,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which relieves pressure where needed

63
0:03:11.714,000 --> 0:03:14,000
on the anatomy of the patient.

64
0:03:15.246,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In short, we're using data

65
0:03:18.177,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to make novel sockets quickly and cheaply.

66
0:03:21.976,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In a recent trial we just wrapped up

67
0:03:23.772,000 --> 0:03:24,000
at the Media Lab,

68
0:03:25.534,000 --> 0:03:27,000
one of our patients, a U.S. veteran

69
0:03:28.044,000 --> 0:03:3,000
who has been an amputee for about 20 years

70
0:03:30.97,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and worn dozens of legs,

71
0:03:34.052,000 --> 0:03:38,000
said of one of our printed parts,

72
0:03:38.14,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"It's so soft, it's like walking on pillows,

73
0:03:41.544,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and it's effing sexy."

74
0:03:44.48,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:48.198,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Disability in our age

76
0:03:51.474,000 --> 0:03:52,000
should not prevent anyone

77
0:03:53.107,000 --> 0:03:55,000
from living meaningful lives.

78
0:03:55.97,000 --> 0:03:58,000
My hope and desire is that the tools and processes

79
0:03:59.313,000 --> 0:04:,000
we develop in our research group

80
0:04:01.311,000 --> 0:04:03,000
can be used to bring highly functional prostheses

81
0:04:04.249,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to those who need them.

82
0:04:06.54,000 --> 0:04:11,000
For me, a place to begin healing the souls

83
0:04:11.991,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of those affected by war and disease

84
0:04:15.88,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is by creating comfortable and affordable interfaces

85
0:04:19.629,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for their bodies.

86
0:04:21.585,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Whether it's in Sierra Leone or in Boston,

87
0:04:24.813,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I hope this not only restores

88
0:04:28.419,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but indeed transforms their sense of human potential.

89
0:04:31.68,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Thank you very much.

90
0:04:34.591,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Applause)

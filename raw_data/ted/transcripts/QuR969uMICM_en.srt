1
0:00:12.917,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Let's play a game.

2
0:00:14.825,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Imagine that you are in Las Vegas,

3
0:00:17.725,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in a casino,

4
0:00:19.1,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and you decide to play a game on one of the casino's computers,

5
0:00:23.14,000 --> 0:00:25,000
just like you might play solitaire or chess.

6
0:00:26.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The computer can make moves in the game, just like a human player.

7
0:00:30.438,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This is a coin game.

8
0:00:32.732,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It starts with a coin showing heads,

9
0:00:35.811,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the computer will play first.

10
0:00:37.636,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It can choose to flip the coin or not,

11
0:00:40.516,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but you don't get to see the outcome.

12
0:00:43.144,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Next, it's your turn.

13
0:00:44.862,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You can also choose to flip the coin or not,

14
0:00:47.728,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and your move will not be revealed to your opponent, the computer.

15
0:00:51.737,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Finally, the computer plays again, and can flip the coin or not,

16
0:00:55.76,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and after these three rounds,

17
0:00:58.475,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the coin is revealed,

18
0:01:00.428,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and if it is heads, the computer wins,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
if it's tails, you win.

20
0:01:06.21,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So it's a pretty simple game,

21
0:01:07.947,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and if everybody plays honestly, and the coin is fair,

22
0:01:11.364,000 --> 0:01:14,000
then you have a 50 percent chance of winning this game.

23
0:01:15.15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And to confirm that,

24
0:01:17.448,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I asked my students to play this game on our computers,

25
0:01:20.607,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and after many, many tries,

26
0:01:22.615,000 --> 0:01:26,000
their winning rate ended up being 50 percent, or close to 50 percent,

27
0:01:26.679,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as expected.

28
0:01:28.354,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Sounds like a boring game, right?

29
0:01:30.414,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But what if you could play this game on a quantum computer?

30
0:01:34.665,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now, Las Vegas casinos do not have quantum computers,

31
0:01:37.769,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as far as I know,

32
0:01:39.534,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but IBM has built a working quantum computer.

33
0:01:42.994,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Here it is.

34
0:01:44.605,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But what is a quantum computer?

35
0:01:46.534,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Well, quantum physics describes

36
0:01:49.367,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the behavior of atoms and fundamental particles,

37
0:01:53.161,000 --> 0:01:55,000
like electrons and photons.

38
0:01:55.668,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So a quantum computer operates

39
0:01:57.416,000 --> 0:01:59,000
by controlling the behavior of these particles,

40
0:02:00.047,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but in a way that is completely different from our regular computers.

41
0:02:04.279,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So a quantum computer is not just a more powerful version

42
0:02:08.199,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of our current computers,

43
0:02:10.328,000 --> 0:02:14,000
just like a light bulb is not a more powerful candle.

44
0:02:14.359,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You cannot build a light bulb by building better and better candles.

45
0:02:19.048,000 --> 0:02:21,000
A light bulb is a different technology,

46
0:02:21.287,000 --> 0:02:23,000
based on deeper scientific understanding.

47
0:02:23.965,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Similarly, a quantum computer is a new kind of device,

48
0:02:27.726,000 --> 0:02:29,000
based on the science of quantum physics,

49
0:02:30.499,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and just like a light bulb transformed society,

50
0:02:33.673,000 --> 0:02:35,000
quantum computers have the potential to impact

51
0:02:36.357,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so many aspects of our lives,

52
0:02:38.258,000 --> 0:02:41,000
including our security needs, our health care and even the internet.

53
0:02:42.837,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So companies all around the world are working to build these devices,

54
0:02:47.162,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and to see what the excitement is all about,

55
0:02:49.521,000 --> 0:02:51,000
let's play our game on a quantum computer.

56
0:02:52.862,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So I can log into IBM's quantum computer from right here,

57
0:02:57.659,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which means I can play the game remotely,

58
0:03:00.158,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and so can you.

59
0:03:02.151,000 --> 0:03:07,000
To make this happen, you may remember getting an email ahead of time, from TED,

60
0:03:07.597,000 --> 0:03:1,000
asking you whether you would choose to flip the coin or not,

61
0:03:11.346,000 --> 0:03:12,000
if you played the game.

62
0:03:13.065,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Well, actually, we asked you to choose between a circle or a square.

63
0:03:17.957,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You didn't know it, but your choice of circle meant "flip the coin,"

64
0:03:21.823,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and your choice of square was "don't flip."

65
0:03:24.723,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We received 372 responses.

66
0:03:27.588,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Thank you.

67
0:03:28.802,000 --> 0:03:32,000
That means we can play 372 games against the quantum computer

68
0:03:33.294,000 --> 0:03:34,000
using your choices.

69
0:03:34.946,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it's a pretty fast game to play,

70
0:03:37.215,000 --> 0:03:39,000
so I can show you the results right here.

71
0:03:40.231,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Unfortunately, you didn't do very well.

72
0:03:42.561,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:44.658,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The quantum computer won almost every game.

74
0:03:48.159,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It lost a few only because of operational errors in the computer.

75
0:03:51.905,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:53.891,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So how did it achieve this amazing winning streak?

77
0:03:58.224,000 --> 0:04:,000
It seems like magic or cheating,

78
0:04:00.741,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but actually, it's just quantum physics in action.

79
0:04:03.78,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Here's how it works.

80
0:04:05.38,000 --> 0:04:1,000
A regular computer simulates heads or tails of a coin as a bit,

81
0:04:10.856,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a zero or a one,

82
0:04:12.535,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or a current flipping on and off inside your computer chip.

83
0:04:16.439,000 --> 0:04:18,000
A quantum computer is completely different.

84
0:04:19.25,000 --> 0:04:23,000
A quantum bit has a more fluid, nonbinary identity.

85
0:04:24.511,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It can exist in a superposition, or a combination of zero and one,

86
0:04:30.377,000 --> 0:04:34,000
with some probability of being zero and some probability of being one.

87
0:04:35.545,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In other words, its identity is on a spectrum.

88
0:04:38.79,000 --> 0:04:41,000
For example, it could have a 70 percent chance of being zero

89
0:04:42.617,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and a 30 percent chance of being one

90
0:04:44.977,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or 80-20 or 60-40.

91
0:04:49.016,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The possibilities are endless.

92
0:04:51.653,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The key idea here

93
0:04:53.043,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is that we have to give up on precise values of zero and one

94
0:04:57.287,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and allow for some uncertainty.

95
0:04:59.737,000 --> 0:05:,000
So during the game,

96
0:05:01.412,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the quantum computer creates this fluid combination of heads and tails,

97
0:05:06.183,000 --> 0:05:07,000
zero and one,

98
0:05:07.358,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so that no matter what the player does,

99
0:05:09.65,000 --> 0:05:1,000
flip or no flip,

100
0:05:10.862,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the superposition remains intact.

101
0:05:13.83,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's kind of like stirring a mixture of two fluids.

102
0:05:17.714,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Whether or not you stir, the fluids remain in a mixture,

103
0:05:22.123,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but in its final move,

104
0:05:24.568,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the quantum computer can unmix the zero and one,

105
0:05:28.532,000 --> 0:05:31,000
perfectly recovering heads so that you lose every time.

106
0:05:32.294,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:34.267,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If you think this is all a bit weird, you are absolutely right.

108
0:05:38.608,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Regular coins do not exist in combinations of heads and tails.

109
0:05:43.056,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We do not experience this fluid quantum reality

110
0:05:47.284,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in our everyday lives.

111
0:05:49.247,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So if you are confused by quantum,

112
0:05:51.525,000 --> 0:05:52,000
don't worry, you're getting it.

113
0:05:53.455,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:56.643,000 --> 0:06:,000
But even though we don't experience quantum strangeness,

115
0:06:00.923,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we can see its very real effects in action.

116
0:06:04.105,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You've seen the data for yourself.

117
0:06:06.529,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The quantum computer won

118
0:06:08.014,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because it harnessed superposition and uncertainty,

119
0:06:12.826,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and these quantum properties are powerful,

120
0:06:15.206,000 --> 0:06:17,000
not just to win coin games,

121
0:06:17.508,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but also to build future quantum technologies.

122
0:06:21.15,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So let me give you three examples of potential applications

123
0:06:24.69,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that could change our lives.

124
0:06:27.147,000 --> 0:06:32,000
First of all, quantum uncertainty could be used to create private keys

125
0:06:32.472,000 --> 0:06:35,000
for encrypting messages sent from one location to another

126
0:06:36.286,000 --> 0:06:41,000
so that hackers could not secretly copy the key perfectly,

127
0:06:41.439,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because of quantum uncertainty.

128
0:06:43.809,000 --> 0:06:46,000
They would have to break the laws of quantum physics

129
0:06:47.619,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to hack the key.

130
0:06:49.531,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So this kind of unbreakable encryption is already being tested by banks

131
0:06:54.429,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and other institutions worldwide.

132
0:06:57.357,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Today, we use more than 17 billion connected devices globally.

133
0:07:03.619,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Just imagine the impact quantum encryption could have in the future.

134
0:07:08.171,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Secondly, quantum technologies could also transform health care and medicine.

135
0:07:14.427,000 --> 0:07:19,000
For example, the design and analysis of molecules for drug development

136
0:07:19.752,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is a challenging problem today,

137
0:07:22.171,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and that's because exactly describing and calculating

138
0:07:27.147,000 --> 0:07:31,000
all of the quantum properties of all the atoms in the molecule

139
0:07:31.273,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is a computationally difficult task, even for our supercomputers.

140
0:07:35.48,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But a quantum computer could do better,

141
0:07:37.71,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because it operates using the same quantum properties

142
0:07:40.988,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as the molecule it's trying to simulate.

143
0:07:43.564,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So future large-scale quantum simulations for drug development

144
0:07:48.365,000 --> 0:07:51,000
could perhaps lead to treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's,

145
0:07:51.675,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which affects thousands of lives.

146
0:07:54.355,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And thirdly, my favorite quantum application

147
0:07:57.416,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is teleportation of information from one location to another

148
0:08:02.099,000 --> 0:08:05,000
without physically transmitting the information.

149
0:08:05.847,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Sounds like sci-fi, but it is possible,

150
0:08:09.3,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because these fluid identities of the quantum particles

151
0:08:13.043,000 --> 0:08:16,000
can get entangled across space and time

152
0:08:16.425,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in such a way that when you change something about one particle,

153
0:08:20.059,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it can impact the other,

154
0:08:21.539,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and that creates a channel for teleportation.

155
0:08:25.039,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's already been demonstrated in research labs

156
0:08:27.672,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and could be part of a future quantum internet.

157
0:08:31.219,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We don't have such a network as yet,

158
0:08:34.59,000 --> 0:08:36,000
but my team is working on these possibilities,

159
0:08:37.518,000 --> 0:08:4,000
by simulating a quantum network on a quantum computer.

160
0:08:42.052,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So we have designed and implemented some interesting new protocols

161
0:08:46.074,000 --> 0:08:51,000
such as teleportation among different users in the network

162
0:08:51.78,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and efficient data transmission

163
0:08:54.026,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and even secure voting.

164
0:08:56.502,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So it's a lot of fun for me, being a quantum physicist.

165
0:08:59.405,000 --> 0:09:,000
I highly recommend it.

166
0:09:00.922,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Laughter)

167
0:09:02.904,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We get to be explorers in a quantum wonderland.

168
0:09:05.809,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Who knows what applications we will discover next.

169
0:09:09.222,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We must tread carefully and responsibly

170
0:09:12.071,000 --> 0:09:13,000
as we build our quantum future.

171
0:09:14.809,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And for me, personally,

172
0:09:16.631,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I don't see quantum physics as a tool just to build quantum computers.

173
0:09:22.124,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I see quantum computers as a way for us to probe the mysteries of nature

174
0:09:27.282,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and reveal more about this hidden world outside of our experiences.

175
0:09:31.218,000 --> 0:09:33,000
How amazing that we humans,

176
0:09:33.344,000 --> 0:09:35,000
with our relatively limited access to the universe,

177
0:09:36.36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
can still see far beyond our horizons

178
0:09:39.018,000 --> 0:09:41,000
just using our imagination and our ingenuity.

179
0:09:42.211,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And the universe rewards us

180
0:09:44.552,000 --> 0:09:47,000
by showing us how incredibly interesting and surprising it is.

181
0:09:49.171,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The future is fundamentally uncertain,

182
0:09:52.571,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and to me, that is certainly exciting.

183
0:09:56.344,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Thank you.

184
0:09:57.519,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

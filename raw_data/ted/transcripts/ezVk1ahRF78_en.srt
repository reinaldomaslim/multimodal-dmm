Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:15.617,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to talk about religion.

3
0:00:19.482,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But it's a broad and very delicate subject,

4
0:00:24.734,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so I have to limit myself.

5
0:00:26.405,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And therefore I will limit myself

6
0:00:28.885,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality.

7
0:00:33.294,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:34.86,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is a very serious talk.

9
0:00:37.42,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful.

10
0:00:41.515,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's when the young couple whisper,

11
0:00:43.86,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"Tonight we are going to make a baby."

12
0:00:47.032,000 --> 0:00:52,000
My talk will be about the impact of religions

13
0:00:52.368,000 --> 0:00:56,000
on the number of babies per woman.

14
0:00:56.537,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This is indeed important,

15
0:00:58.202,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because everyone understands

16
0:00:59.732,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that there is some sort of limit

17
0:01:02.014,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on how many people we can be on this planet.

18
0:01:05.242,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And there are some people

19
0:01:07.189,000 --> 0:01:1,000
who say that the world population is growing like this --

20
0:01:10.608,000 --> 0:01:11,000
three billion in 1960,

21
0:01:12.415,000 --> 0:01:14,000
seven billion just last year --

22
0:01:15.054,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it will continue to grow

23
0:01:16.6,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because there are religions that stop women from having few babies,

24
0:01:20.38,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and it may continue like this.

25
0:01:22.783,000 --> 0:01:25,000
To what extent are these people right?

26
0:01:26.685,000 --> 0:01:3,000
When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world,

27
0:01:31.565,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and today, 2000, there's almost two billion.

28
0:01:35.74,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What has happened since,

29
0:01:37.442,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and what do the experts predict will happen

30
0:01:40.137,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with the number of children during this century?

31
0:01:42.62,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This is a quiz. What do you think?

32
0:01:45.238,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Do you think it will decrease to one billion?

33
0:01:49.14,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century?

34
0:01:52.968,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years,

35
0:01:56.685,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or will it continue in the same fast rate

36
0:01:59.189,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and be four billion children up there?

37
0:02:01.678,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I will tell you by the end of my speech.

38
0:02:05.103,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But now, what does religion have to do with it?

39
0:02:10.125,000 --> 0:02:12,000
When you want to classify religion,

40
0:02:12.457,000 --> 0:02:13,000
it's more difficult than you think.

41
0:02:13.988,000 --> 0:02:16,000
You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this.

42
0:02:17.192,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion,

43
0:02:22.725,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but that's not detailed enough.

44
0:02:24.497,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia, we found this map.

45
0:02:28.306,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But that subdivides Christianity, Islam and Buddhism

46
0:02:32.952,000 --> 0:02:33,000
into many subgroups,

47
0:02:34.555,000 --> 0:02:35,000
which was too detailed.

48
0:02:36.06,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map,

49
0:02:39.478,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and it looks like this.

50
0:02:41.851,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Each country's a bubble.

51
0:02:45.254,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The size is the population -- big China, big India here.

52
0:02:48.678,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And the color now is the majority religion.

53
0:02:52.792,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's the religion where more than 50 percent of the people

54
0:02:56.023,000 --> 0:02:57,000
say that they belong.

55
0:02:57.278,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries.

56
0:03:01.995,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Islam is the majority religion

57
0:03:03.968,000 --> 0:03:06,000
all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East,

58
0:03:07.743,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Southern Europe and through Asia

59
0:03:10.023,000 --> 0:03:12,000
all the way to Indonesia.

60
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That's where we find Islamic majority.

61
0:03:15.177,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And Christian majority religions, we see in these countries. They are blue.

62
0:03:19.98,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And that is most countries in America and Europe,

63
0:03:24.005,000 --> 0:03:27,000
many countries in Africa and a few in Asia.

64
0:03:27.675,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The white here are countries which cannot be classified,

65
0:03:30.355,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because one religion does not reach 50 percent

66
0:03:32.98,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or there is doubt about the data or there's some other reason.

67
0:03:36.337,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So we were careful with that.

68
0:03:38.097,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot.

69
0:03:41.955,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is in 1960.

70
0:03:43.968,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And now I show the number of babies per woman here:

71
0:03:47.5,000 --> 0:03:5,000
two, four or six --

72
0:03:50.586,000 --> 0:03:52,000
many babies, few babies.

73
0:03:52.777,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And here the income per person in comparable dollars.

74
0:03:55.958,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first

75
0:03:59.555,000 --> 0:04:,000
before you get few babies.

76
0:04:01.225,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So low income here, high income there.

77
0:04:04.857,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And indeed in 1960,

78
0:04:06.495,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies.

79
0:04:09.232,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The exception was Japan.

80
0:04:11.506,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Japan here was regarded as an exception.

81
0:04:14.743,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Otherwise it was only Christian countries.

82
0:04:16.771,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But there was also many Christian countries

83
0:04:18.98,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that had six to seven babies per woman.

84
0:04:21.552,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa.

85
0:04:27.029,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And countries with Islam as the majority religion,

86
0:04:31.202,000 --> 0:04:35,000
all of them almost had six to seven children per woman,

87
0:04:35.832,000 --> 0:04:37,000
irregardless of the income level.

88
0:04:38.257,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level.

89
0:04:42.5,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now let's see what has happened in the world.

90
0:04:44.42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I start the world, and here we go.

91
0:04:46.34,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now 1962 -- can you see they're getting a little richer,

92
0:04:49.558,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but the number of babies per woman is falling?

93
0:04:52.232,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Look at China. They're falling fairly fast.

94
0:04:54.405,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down,

95
0:04:59.168,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range.

96
0:05:04.131,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And when we enter into this century,

97
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you'll find more than half of mankind down here.

98
0:05:10.02,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And by 2010, we are actually 80 percent of humans

99
0:05:14.946,000 --> 0:05:18,000
who live in countries with about two children per woman.

100
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

101
0:05:22.798,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's a quite amazing development which has happened.

102
0:05:26.758,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:28.135,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And these are countries from United States here,

104
0:05:31.337,000 --> 0:05:33,000
with $40,000 per capita,

105
0:05:33.498,000 --> 0:05:35,000
France, Russia, Iran,

106
0:05:36.445,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Mexico, Turkey, Algeria,

107
0:05:40.097,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Indonesia, India

108
0:05:42.322,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam,

109
0:05:45.051,000 --> 0:05:49,000
which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States

110
0:05:49.094,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and the same amount of babies per woman.

111
0:05:52.251,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman

112
0:05:55.482,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is surprisingly good in all countries.

113
0:05:57.571,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We get that from the census data.

114
0:05:59.518,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's not one of these statistics which is very doubtful.

115
0:06:02.911,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So what we can conclude

116
0:06:04.217,000 --> 0:06:06,000
is you don't have to get rich to have few children.

117
0:06:06.998,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It has happened across the world.

118
0:06:09.34,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then when we look at religions,

119
0:06:11.918,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we can see that the Eastern religions,

120
0:06:14.445,000 --> 0:06:17,000
indeed there's not one single country with a majority of that religion

121
0:06:17.445,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that has more than three children.

122
0:06:19.34,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity,

123
0:06:23.392,000 --> 0:06:24,000
you see countries all the way.

124
0:06:25.3,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But there's no major difference.

125
0:06:27.078,000 --> 0:06:3,000
There's no major difference between these religions.

126
0:06:30.58,000 --> 0:06:32,000
There is a difference with income.

127
0:06:32.931,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The countries which have many babies per woman here,

128
0:06:36.86,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they have quite low income.

129
0:06:38.792,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa.

130
0:06:42.223,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But there are also countries here

131
0:06:44.885,000 --> 0:06:48,000
like Guatemala, like Papua New Guinea,

132
0:06:49.002,000 --> 0:06:51,000
like Yemen and Afghanistan.

133
0:06:51.808,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo,

134
0:06:55.685,000 --> 0:06:58,000
which have suffered severe conflicts,

135
0:06:59.135,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that they don't have fast population growth.

136
0:07:01.892,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's the other way around.

137
0:07:03.669,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In the world today, it's the countries that have the highest mortality rates

138
0:07:07.562,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that have the fastest population growth.

139
0:07:09.798,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child.

140
0:07:13.786,000 --> 0:07:15,000
These countries have six children per woman.

141
0:07:16.694,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman.

142
0:07:20.826,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But 30 years from now, Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million.

143
0:07:24.645,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Congo will go from 60 to 120.

144
0:07:28.052,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That's where we have the fast population growth.

145
0:07:30.943,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And many think that these countries are stagnant, but they are not.

146
0:07:35.288,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Let me compare Senegal, a Muslim dominated country,

147
0:07:38.802,000 --> 0:07:4,000
with a Christian dominated country, Ghana.

148
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I take them backwards here to their independence,

149
0:07:44.857,000 --> 0:07:47,000
when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s.

150
0:07:48.54,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Just look what they have done.

151
0:07:50.638,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's an amazing improvement,

152
0:07:52.189,000 --> 0:07:54,000
from seven children per woman,

153
0:07:54.426,000 --> 0:07:57,000
they've gone all the way down to between four and five.

154
0:07:57.491,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's a tremendous improvement.

155
0:07:59.078,000 --> 0:08:,000
So what does it take?

156
0:08:00.503,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries.

157
0:08:04.1,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You need to have children to survive.

158
0:08:06.589,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You need to get out of the deepest poverty

159
0:08:09.202,000 --> 0:08:12,000
so children are not of importance for work in the family.

160
0:08:12.78,000 --> 0:08:14,000
You need to have access to some family planning.

161
0:08:15.651,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And you need the fourth factor, which perhaps is the most important factor.

162
0:08:19.983,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But let me illustrate that fourth factor

163
0:08:22.891,000 --> 0:08:24,000
by looking at Qatar.

164
0:08:24.992,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Here we have Qatar today, and there we have Bangladesh today.

165
0:08:28.792,000 --> 0:08:31,000
If I take these countries back to the years of their independence,

166
0:08:32.429,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which is almost the same year -- '71, '72 --

167
0:08:35.5,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it's a quite amazing development which had happened.

168
0:08:39.374,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Look at Bangladesh and Qatar.

169
0:08:41.18,000 --> 0:08:44,000
With so different incomes, it's almost the same drop

170
0:08:44.438,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in number of babies per woman.

171
0:08:46.552,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And what is the reason in Qatar?

172
0:08:48.555,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Well I do as I always do.

173
0:08:50.214,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I went to the statistical authority of Qatar, to their webpage --

174
0:08:53.986,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's a very good webpage. I recommend it --

175
0:08:56.117,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and I looked up -- oh yeah, you can have lots of fun here --

176
0:09:02.608,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and provided free of charge, I found Qatar's social trends.

177
0:09:06.675,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Very interesting. Lots to read.

178
0:09:09.02,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I found fertility at birth, and I looked at total fertility rate per woman.

179
0:09:13.592,000 --> 0:09:16,000
These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar,

180
0:09:17.143,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and they say the most important factors are:

181
0:09:19.798,000 --> 0:09:2,000
"Increased age at first marriage,

182
0:09:21.74,000 --> 0:09:24,000
increased educational level of Qatari woman

183
0:09:24.765,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and more women integrated in the labor force."

184
0:09:28.078,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I couldn't agree more. Science couldn't agree more.

185
0:09:31.82,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is a country that indeed has gone through

186
0:09:34.337,000 --> 0:09:37,000
a very, very interesting modernization.

187
0:09:37.872,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So what it is, is these four:

188
0:09:40.497,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Children should survive, children shouldn't be needed for work,

189
0:09:43.58,000 --> 0:09:45,000
women should get education and join the labor force

190
0:09:46.482,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and family planning should be accessible.

191
0:09:48.755,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now look again at this.

192
0:09:52.143,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The average number of children in the world

193
0:09:54.435,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is like in Colombia -- it's 2.4 today.

194
0:09:57.857,000 --> 0:10:,000
There are countries up here which are very poor.

195
0:10:00.894,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And that's where family planning, better child survival is needed.

196
0:10:04.845,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I strongly recommend Melinda Gates' last TEDTalk.

197
0:10:08.632,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And here, down, there are many countries which are less than two children per woman.

198
0:10:14.091,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz,

199
0:10:17.703,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it's two.

200
0:10:19.245,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We have reached peak child.

201
0:10:21.774,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The number of children is not growing any longer in the world.

202
0:10:24.663,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We are still debating peak oil,

203
0:10:26.655,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but we have definitely reached peak child.

204
0:10:29.586,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And the world population will stop growing.

205
0:10:32.309,000 --> 0:10:34,000
The United Nations Population Division has said

206
0:10:34.411,000 --> 0:10:36,000
it will stop growing at 10 billion.

207
0:10:36.851,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But why do they grow if the number of children doesn't grow?

208
0:10:40.891,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Well I will show you here.

209
0:10:43.337,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came.

210
0:10:47.112,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They are quite useful for educational purposes.

211
0:10:50.946,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Each card box is one billion people.

212
0:10:53.854,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And there are two billion children in the world.

213
0:10:56.522,000 --> 0:11:02,000
There are two billion young people between 15 and 30.

214
0:11:03.392,000 --> 0:11:04,000
These are rounded numbers.

215
0:11:04.862,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Then there is one billion between 30 and 45,

216
0:11:09.888,000 --> 0:11:12,000
almost one between 45 and 60.

217
0:11:13.731,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And then it's my box.

218
0:11:15.355,000 --> 0:11:17,000
This is me: 60-plus.

219
0:11:17.38,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We are here on top.

220
0:11:19.542,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So what will happen now is what we call "the big fill-up."

221
0:11:24.774,000 --> 0:11:26,000
You can see that it's like three billion missing here.

222
0:11:27.762,000 --> 0:11:31,000
They are not missing because they've died; they were never born.

223
0:11:32.069,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Because before 1980, there were much fewer people born

224
0:11:36.177,000 --> 0:11:38,000
than there were during the last 30 years.

225
0:11:38.934,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So what will happen now is quite straightforward.

226
0:11:42.088,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The old, sadly, we will die.

227
0:11:44.885,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The rest of you, you will grow older and you will get two billion children.

228
0:11:49.54,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Then the old will die.

229
0:11:52.148,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The rest will grow older and get two billion children.

230
0:11:56.186,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children.

231
0:12:01.955,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Applause)

232
0:12:04.209,000 --> 0:12:07,000
This is the great fill-up.

233
0:12:07.842,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's inevitable.

234
0:12:10.614,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And can you see that this increase took place

235
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
without life getting longer and without adding children?

236
0:12:18.063,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman.

237
0:12:22.968,000 --> 0:12:25,000
All the religions in the world are fully capable

238
0:12:26.237,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to maintain their values and adapt to this new world.

239
0:12:31.362,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And we will be just 10 billion in this world,

240
0:12:36.645,000 --> 0:12:39,000
if the poorest people get out of poverty,

241
0:12:40.229,000 --> 0:12:43,000
their children survive, they get access to family planning.

242
0:12:43.402,000 --> 0:12:44,000
That is needed.

243
0:12:45.302,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But it's inevitable that we will be two to three billion more.

244
0:12:51.017,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So when you discuss and when you plan

245
0:12:54.229,000 --> 0:12:57,000
for the resources and the energy needed for the future,

246
0:12:57.632,000 --> 0:12:59,000
for human beings on this planet,

247
0:12:59.965,000 --> 0:13:01,000
you have to plan for 10 billion.

248
0:13:02.122,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you very much.

249
0:13:04.272,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.5,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's story time.

2
0:00:15.492,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Settle back, and I'll begin.

3
0:00:18.643,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Once upon a time, a mother duck sat patiently on her nest of eggs,

4
0:00:23.532,000 --> 0:00:24,000
waiting for them to hatch.

5
0:00:25.953,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And then one day, she felt something move beneath her.

6
0:00:29.246,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Crack, crack!

7
0:00:31.397,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Filled with happiness, she watched as her eggs hatched one by one.

8
0:00:37.726,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I don't know about you, but when I was little,

9
0:00:39.941,000 --> 0:00:42,000
story time was always one of my favorite parts of the day.

10
0:00:43.21,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I loved reading to my two sons when they were small, too.

11
0:00:47.422,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's that special time

12
0:00:49.073,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when a parent and child can be totally absorbed together

13
0:00:52.898,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in mystical kingdoms, fantastical beasties

14
0:00:55.208,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or scruffy little ducks that turn out to be swans.

15
0:00:59.616,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Well, that's how it is for some children,

16
0:01:01.95,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but for other children,

17
0:01:03.894,000 --> 0:01:05,000
there isn't a parent around to read to them.

18
0:01:08.093,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I'd like to tell you about Sophie.

19
0:01:11.292,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Sophie's five years old and lives with her parents.

20
0:01:15.982,000 --> 0:01:17,000
One day, there's a bang at the door.

21
0:01:18.348,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Sophie hears lots of shouting; her mum's crying.

22
0:01:21.157,000 --> 0:01:24,000
She sees the police dragging her father away.

23
0:01:24.256,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Sophie's afraid. She starts crying, too.

24
0:01:27.574,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Weeks go by.

25
0:01:29.113,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Sophie doesn't know what's happened to her dad.

26
0:01:31.788,000 --> 0:01:33,000
When she asks her mum, her mum gets upset.

27
0:01:33.984,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So she stops asking.

28
0:01:37.307,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Sophie waits.

29
0:01:39.331,000 --> 0:01:4,000
She really misses her dad.

30
0:01:41.836,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Every day, she hurries home from school, in case he's come back.

31
0:01:46.042,000 --> 0:01:48,000
On many nights, she cries herself to sleep.

32
0:01:51.212,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Children at school start to tease her.

33
0:01:53.323,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They call her names.

34
0:01:55.3,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Somebody's mum has heard that Sophie's dad is in prison.

35
0:02:00.082,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Sophie pretends to be ill so she doesn't have to go to school.

36
0:02:03.749,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And her teacher can't understand why she's so far behind

37
0:02:06.779,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with her schoolwork.

38
0:02:10.18,000 --> 0:02:13,000
After what seems a long, long time to Sophie,

39
0:02:13.887,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a letter arrives.

40
0:02:15.403,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's from her dad.

41
0:02:16.815,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The writing is very messy.

42
0:02:19.204,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The letter makes her mum cry, but she reads a little out to Sophie.

43
0:02:23.95,000 --> 0:02:25,000
He says that he's OK and that he's missing them.

44
0:02:27.744,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's a short letter.

45
0:02:30.006,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Sophie says she'd like to go and see her dad, wherever he is.

46
0:02:33.432,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But her mum says it's too far away, and they can't afford the journey.

47
0:02:38.829,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Then one day the phone rings.

48
0:02:41.003,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"Sophie, come speak to daddy."

49
0:02:44.889,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Dad sounds different, far away.

50
0:02:48.571,000 --> 0:02:49,000
He says he can't talk for very long,

51
0:02:50.445,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and anyway, it's very noisy wherever he is.

52
0:02:53.476,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And Sophie doesn't know what to say to him.

53
0:02:58.631,000 --> 0:03:,000
Well, as stories go, that's not a very nice one.

54
0:03:01.416,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In the United Kingdom, 200,000 children

55
0:03:06.093,000 --> 0:03:1,000
experience the shame and isolation of a parent in prison.

56
0:03:11.117,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Two hundred thousand.

57
0:03:13.196,000 --> 0:03:15,000
That's more than the number of children each year

58
0:03:15.53,000 --> 0:03:17,000
who are affected by their parents divorcing.

59
0:03:18.307,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And it can affect the children of prisoners very deeply.

60
0:03:21.829,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There can be problems at school,

61
0:03:23.444,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and they're three times more likely to suffer from mental health issues.

62
0:03:28.932,000 --> 0:03:29,000
In so many ways,

63
0:03:30.458,000 --> 0:03:34,000
children are the unintended victims of their parents' crimes.

64
0:03:35.784,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In so many ways,

65
0:03:37.339,000 --> 0:03:41,000
children are the overlooked victims of their parents' crimes.

66
0:03:43.936,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Until last November, I was a serving prisoner,

67
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:48,000
imprisoned for fraud.

68
0:03:48.974,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I was dishonest, and I paid the penalty.

69
0:03:52.45,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Before that, I'd been a practicing solicitor for 30 years.

70
0:03:56.172,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I'd had a happy and stable upbringing,

71
0:03:58.911,000 --> 0:03:59,000
a good education,

72
0:04:00.133,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a happy marriage, which, I'm pleased to say, continues.

73
0:04:03.101,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I have two adult sons.

74
0:04:06.387,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When they were growing up, I did my best to be around for them

75
0:04:09.998,000 --> 0:04:1,000
as much as I could.

76
0:04:11.474,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I took a careful interest in what they did.

77
0:04:13.727,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I read to my boys every night,

78
0:04:16.704,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and ironically, our favorite story was "Burglar Bill."

79
0:04:21.543,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:25.21,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But when I got to prison, it soon became apparent

81
0:04:27.844,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that my background was very different to that of most of the prisoners.

82
0:04:32.505,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Few of the men that I met had had a decent education.

83
0:04:35.665,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Indeed, many associated education with humiliation and failure.

84
0:04:40.458,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I can tell you firsthand that prison is dehumanizing.

85
0:04:45.592,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Prisoners harden up, they shut down, they close in ...

86
0:04:49.863,000 --> 0:04:5,000
just to survive.

87
0:04:52.166,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And this can be devastating for families.

88
0:04:56.546,000 --> 0:05:,000
In fact, maintaining contact with your family from prison

89
0:05:00.748,000 --> 0:05:01,000
can be very difficult indeed.

90
0:05:03.613,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And if a child does get to see their parent in prison,

91
0:05:06.787,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they have to go through the same pat-down searches as the adults.

92
0:05:09.922,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They walk through the same detector frames,

93
0:05:12.71,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they're sniffed by the same sniffer dogs,

94
0:05:14.895,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and all because some children have been the unwitting carriers

95
0:05:18.323,000 --> 0:05:2,000
of drugs and mobile phones.

96
0:05:21.567,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And when they get through to see their parent,

97
0:05:23.762,000 --> 0:05:25,000
they may be tired from a long journey,

98
0:05:26.472,000 --> 0:05:28,000
shy, tongue-tied, even upset.

99
0:05:29.853,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And it isn't easy for the parents, who may not be getting along.

100
0:05:34.227,000 --> 0:05:35,000
For many reasons, not just these,

101
0:05:36.957,000 --> 0:05:4,000
over half of prisoners lose contact with their children and families.

102
0:05:41.942,000 --> 0:05:44,000
How can we help prisoners to stay in contact with their families?

103
0:05:46.574,000 --> 0:05:48,000
When I was a prisoner at Channings Wood Prison,

104
0:05:48.868,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I began working for a charity called Storybook Dads.

105
0:05:52.934,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Storybook Dads began in 2003,

106
0:05:55.654,000 --> 0:06:,000
when Sharon Berry, a civilian worker in a prison, realized just how much

107
0:06:00.915,000 --> 0:06:03,000
many prisoners wanted to stay in contact with their children.

108
0:06:04.694,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And so, armed with a few storybooks,

109
0:06:07.06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
she began to help prisoners to read and record stories

110
0:06:10.043,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to send home to their children.

111
0:06:12.468,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It wasn't a new idea. Few ideas like this are new.

112
0:06:16.611,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They're great ideas.

113
0:06:18.942,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But it was an instant success.

114
0:06:22.466,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You may wonder: How does the recording of the stories work in prison?

115
0:06:27.769,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Is it difficult for prisoners?

116
0:06:29.983,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Can it be challenging?

117
0:06:33.38,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, the process of choosing, reading and recording a story

118
0:06:38.018,000 --> 0:06:4,000
can be very challenging for prisoners.

119
0:06:42.09,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Prison is tough,

120
0:06:44.134,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and prisoners can't afford to show any signs of weakness or vulnerability.

121
0:06:50.234,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But this, this recording process,

122
0:06:53.273,000 --> 0:06:58,000
this can be uncomfortable, upsetting, sometimes all just a bit too much.

123
0:07:01.884,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And prisoners often cry.

124
0:07:04.741,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They cry because they regret missing out on their children's lives.

125
0:07:09.701,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They cry because they're ashamed that they've let their families down.

126
0:07:13.846,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They cry because they don't know how to go about reading to their children.

127
0:07:20.298,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But because when they come to us we offer a private space, one-to-one,

128
0:07:25.855,000 --> 0:07:28,000
prisoners don't need to be tough anymore,

129
0:07:28.951,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and they can use their vulnerability as a strength

130
0:07:31.951,000 --> 0:07:33,000
when contacting with their children.

131
0:07:35.977,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I remember one prisoner who came to record.

132
0:07:39.095,000 --> 0:07:42,000
He was a big, hard man with a reputation for being tough.

133
0:07:43.358,000 --> 0:07:45,000
He came along as implacable as ever.

134
0:07:45.723,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But when the door of the recording room closed behind him,

135
0:07:48.807,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that facade began to crumble.

136
0:07:50.909,000 --> 0:07:53,000
From his pocket, he took a screwed-up piece of paper

137
0:07:54.059,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and quietly began to read the words

138
0:07:55.753,000 --> 0:07:59,000
which he'd written as a message for his two little ones.

139
0:08:00.555,000 --> 0:08:01,000
His hands were shaking.

140
0:08:03.254,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And then, in a surprisingly quiet voice,

141
0:08:06.572,000 --> 0:08:09,000
he began to sing their favorite lullaby.

142
0:08:10.694,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You see, there wasn't much that he could do from behind bars

143
0:08:13.694,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to show his children that he missed and loved them.

144
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But he could do this.

145
0:08:20.758,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Once the recording is made,

146
0:08:22.75,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it's sent to the Storybook Dads production unit

147
0:08:27.29,000 --> 0:08:3,000
at Channings Wood Prison in Devon.

148
0:08:31.258,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And that's where I worked.

149
0:08:33.356,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I was trained, along with other prisoners,

150
0:08:35.818,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to edit and produce recordings sent in

151
0:08:38.494,000 --> 0:08:4,000
from prisons all over the United Kingdom.

152
0:08:42.775,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Using audio and video software,

153
0:08:46.847,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the recordings have the mistakes taken out

154
0:08:50.799,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and sound effects and music added in.

155
0:08:55.467,000 --> 0:09:,000
And the experience and skill which the prison editors gain

156
0:09:01.217,000 --> 0:09:03,000
helps them in their future employment.

157
0:09:06.31,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Once the recording is finalized,

158
0:09:08.826,000 --> 0:09:13,000
it's transferred to a CD or a DVD and sent out to the families

159
0:09:14.08,000 --> 0:09:18,000
so that the children can watch them whenever they feel the need.

160
0:09:20.026,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And they listen to these recordings and watch them a lot --

161
0:09:26.612,000 --> 0:09:29,000
at bedtime, in the car ...

162
0:09:29.922,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Some even take them to school to show their friends.

163
0:09:34.532,000 --> 0:09:35,000
These recordings,

164
0:09:36.151,000 --> 0:09:39,000
they show the children that they're loved and missed.

165
0:09:39.954,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And they show the prisoner

166
0:09:41.764,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that they can do something for their child, as a parent.

167
0:09:47.375,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Do you remember Sophie?

168
0:09:49.29,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Well, one day, just before Christmas, a parcel arrived,

169
0:09:53.77,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and this is what was in it.

170
0:09:56.115,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Let's listen to a little of it together.

171
0:09:58.369,000 --> 0:10:02,000
(Video) Santa: On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen!

172
0:10:02.649,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Charlie: That's his reindeer, isn't it?

173
0:10:04.578,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Santa: It is his reindeer, yeah.

174
0:10:06.253,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Up, up, higher and higher they flew,

175
0:10:09.061,000 --> 0:10:12,000
across land, across oceans they sped.

176
0:10:12.966,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Through the magical northern lights they passed --

177
0:10:15.934,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I'd love to see the northern lights, wouldn't you?

178
0:10:18.316,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Charlie: I figure they'd probably look a bit like that snowman's belly.

179
0:10:21.706,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Santa: They probably would, yeah.

180
0:10:23.684,000 --> 0:10:24,000
That's a cool snowman, isn't it?

181
0:10:25.38,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Charlie: It's very cool indeed, I love it.

182
0:10:27.772,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Santa: They visited all the children in the world

183
0:10:30.176,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and left presents for each and every one.

184
0:10:33.611,000 --> 0:10:36,000
In the blink of an eye, they were back in Frogsbottom Field.

185
0:10:37.274,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Charlie Laughs)

186
0:10:38.846,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Santa: You think that's well funny?

187
0:10:40.613,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Charlie: I want to live in Frogsbottom Field!

188
0:10:42.942,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Santa: Where do you live, in Frogsbottom Tree?

189
0:10:45.196,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Charlie: I don't, I live in this tree.

190
0:10:47.673,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I've made it all Christmasy-look.

191
0:10:49.768,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Santa: It's nice, that.

192
0:10:50.972,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You've done a good job, good job.

193
0:10:52.605,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Charlie: Thank you very much!

194
0:10:54.299,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:57.957,000 --> 0:11:,000
Alan Crickmore: Sophie and her mum listened to that three times,

196
0:11:01.022,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and they haven't laughed so much in a long time.

197
0:11:03.331,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They can see that he's all right, they can see that he loves them,

198
0:11:06.474,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and the next time he rings, Sophie's got plenty to talk about:

199
0:11:09.919,000 --> 0:11:1,000
"What does Charlie the Chimp eat?

200
0:11:11.87,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Will daddy do another story very soon?"

201
0:11:15.259,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Since it began in 2003, Storybook Dads has grown and grown.

202
0:11:22.298,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It now operates as Storybook Dads and Storybook Mums

203
0:11:26.079,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in more than 100 prisons in the United Kingdom.

204
0:11:29.506,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Ninety-eight percent of the prisoners who take part

205
0:11:33.389,000 --> 0:11:36,000
say that it's improved their relationship with their child.

206
0:11:37.538,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And since 2003,

207
0:11:40.308,000 --> 0:11:45,000
over 60,000 DVDs and CDs have been sent out

208
0:11:45.341,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to the children of prisoners.

209
0:11:50.398,000 --> 0:11:53,000
For Sophie's family and for thousands of families like them,

210
0:11:53.891,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Storybook Dads has been a lifeline.

211
0:11:57.735,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Some prisoners say that it's the first time

212
0:11:59.874,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that they've begun to build a relationship with their child.

213
0:12:03.815,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And some poor readers have been so inspired

214
0:12:06.239,000 --> 0:12:07,000
by what they've been able to achieve

215
0:12:08.098,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that they've gone to education classes to improve their own reading skills.

216
0:12:14.074,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Let's go back to the story of "The Ugly Duckling."

217
0:12:17.061,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But this time, I'd like to play you a recording made by a prisoner,

218
0:12:22.173,000 --> 0:12:25,000
because it encapsulates the power of what we do.

219
0:12:26.83,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The prisoner was an Irish Traveller who couldn't read.

220
0:12:31.196,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And he wanted to send a story home to his daughter for her birthday.

221
0:12:36.595,000 --> 0:12:38,000
With the help of a mentor and some clever editing,

222
0:12:39.484,000 --> 0:12:4,000
something magical happened.

223
0:12:42.484,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is an extract from the raw recording,

224
0:12:45.151,000 --> 0:12:49,000
where the prisoner is reading the story by repeating it, phrase at a time.

225
0:12:50.09,000 --> 0:12:51,000
(Audio) Mentor: He had nowhere to hide.

226
0:12:52.034,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Owen: He had nowhere to hide.

227
0:12:53.756,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Mentor: So one day, he ran away.

228
0:12:56.522,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Owen: Then one day, he ran away.

229
0:12:58.855,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Mentor: He ran until he came to the great marsh.

230
0:13:02.442,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Owen: He run until he come to the great marsh.

231
0:13:05.195,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Mentor: Where the wild ducks lived.

232
0:13:07.505,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Owen: Where the wild ducks lived.

233
0:13:11.108,000 --> 0:13:15,000
AC: And this is a recording -- an excerpt of the recording

234
0:13:15.855,000 --> 0:13:2,000
with the mentor's voice taken out and sound effects and music added in.

235
0:13:22.069,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Audio) Owen: He had nowhere to hide.

236
0:13:24.236,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Then one day, he run away.

237
0:13:26.133,000 --> 0:13:3,000
He run until he come to the great marsh where the wild ducks lived,

238
0:13:30.726,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and he laid in the rushes for two weeks.

239
0:13:33.297,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Music) (Ducks quack)

240
0:13:35.472,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Some wild ducks and geese come to look at him.

241
0:13:38.726,000 --> 0:13:41,000
"You're very ugly," they said, and they laughed at him.

242
0:13:41.886,000 --> 0:13:44,000
(Ducks quack)

243
0:13:48.429,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The ugly duckling ran away from the great marsh.

244
0:13:52.421,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Duck quacks)

245
0:13:56.087,000 --> 0:13:58,000
AC: And this is how he finished the story:

246
0:14:01.383,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Audio) Owen: He wasn't an ugly duckling at all.

247
0:14:03.883,000 --> 0:14:07,000
During the winter, he had grown into a beautiful white swan.

248
0:14:08.939,000 --> 0:14:12,000
The other swans looked at him and thought how beautiful he was.

249
0:14:13.485,000 --> 0:14:14,000
"Come with us," they said.

250
0:14:16.159,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And he did.

251
0:14:17.334,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Bird sounds)

252
0:14:24.34,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Well, Tiara, I hope you have enjoyed this story

253
0:14:27.967,000 --> 0:14:3,000
as much as I enjoyed reading this story to you.

254
0:14:32.009,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I cannot wait to be with you again and hold you in my arms.

255
0:14:36.731,000 --> 0:14:38,000
All my love, your daddy, Owen.

256
0:14:39.303,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Lots of love, I miss you with all my heart.

257
0:14:41.628,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Goodbye for now, my love. Bye bye.

258
0:14:44.371,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Music)

259
0:14:51.883,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Music ends)

260
0:14:54.264,000 --> 0:14:56,000
AC: When he listened to that recording in his cell

261
0:14:56.729,000 --> 0:14:58,000
before it was sent out to his daughter,

262
0:14:58.917,000 --> 0:14:59,000
he cried.

263
0:15:00.172,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And that's a pretty common reaction from prisoners,

264
0:15:02.637,000 --> 0:15:03,000
as they realize for the first time

265
0:15:04.469,000 --> 0:15:06,000
they've been able to do something for their child

266
0:15:06.801,000 --> 0:15:08,000
which they never thought they could.

267
0:15:09.784,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They've connected in the most fundamental way,

268
0:15:13.055,000 --> 0:15:15,000
through the medium of storytelling.

269
0:15:16.473,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And as for Sophie,

270
0:15:18.553,000 --> 0:15:19,000
she wants "The Gruffalo" next time.

271
0:15:20.55,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Laughter)

272
0:15:21.912,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Applause)

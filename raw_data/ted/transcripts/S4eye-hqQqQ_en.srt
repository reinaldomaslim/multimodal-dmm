1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is an icon of National Geographic,

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
with a parody of National Geographic,

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.

7
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is a jet landing at San Francisco, by Bruce Dale.

9
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He mounted a camera on the tail.

10
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.

11
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.

12
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I love this photograph because it reminds me

13
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.

14
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.

15
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth --

16
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
they're not very good swimmers --

17
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and we know what's happening to the ice.

18
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,

19
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
photographed by Chris Johns.

20
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.

21
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,

22
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a great portraitist.

23
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,

24
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
photographed by Nick Nichols.

25
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.

26
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff

27
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
happening on the dance floor.

28
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But, hey, at least it's hygienic.

29
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

30
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,

31
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
by David Doubilet.

32
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.

33
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,

34
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
photographed by Emory Kristof.

35
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Photography carries a power that holds up

36
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,

37
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because photographs emulate the way

38
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that our mind freezes a significant moment.

39
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Here's an example.

40
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son,

41
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and he was learning how to swim

42
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.

43
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide

44
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and started to be pulled out towards the jetty.

45
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I can stand here right now and see,

46
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
as I go tearing into the water after him,

47
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.

48
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I can see the rocks are over here.

49
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
There's a wave about to crash onto him.

50
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I can see his hands reaching out,

51
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I can see his face in terror,

52
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."

53
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I got him. The wave broke over us.

54
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We got back on shore; he was fine.

55
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We were a little bit rattled.

56
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called,

57
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is when all the elements came together to define

58
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.

59
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And this is what a photograph taps into

60
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.

61
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now I have to tell you,

62
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I was talking to Kyle last week about this,

63
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that I was going to tell this story.

64
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!

65
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I remember my image of you

66
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
was that you were up on the shore yelling at me."

67
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I thought I was a hero.

69
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So,

71
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
this represents -- this is a cross-sample of

72
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,

73
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
working at the very top of their craft --

74
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
except one.

75
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason

76
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in New Zealand last year,

77
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.

78
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Last year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,"

79
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.

80
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And it has become a wild success,

81
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
tapping into the enthusiast photography community.

82
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The quality of these amateur photographs

83
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
can, at times, be amazing.

84
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And seeing this reinforces, for me,

85
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that every one of us has at least one or two

86
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
great photographs in them.

87
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But to be a great photojournalist,

88
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you have to have more than just one or two

89
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
great photographs in you.

90
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You've got to be able to make them all the time.

91
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But even more importantly,

92
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you need to know how to create a visual narrative.

93
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You need to know how to tell a story.

94
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So I'm going to share with you some coverages

95
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.

96
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Photographer Nick Nichols went to document

97
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary

98
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in Chad, called Zakouma.

99
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The original intent was to travel there

100
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and bring back a classic story of diverse species,

101
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of an exotic locale.

102
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And that is what Nick did, up to a point.

103
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is a serval cat.

104
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
He's actually taking his own picture,

105
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
shot with what's called a camera trap.

106
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
There's an infrared beam that's going across,

107
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.

108
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
These are baboons at a watering hole.

109
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Nick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera

110
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
took thousands of pictures of this.

111
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures

112
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of the rear ends of baboons.

113
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
A lion having a late night snack --

115
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
notice he's got a broken tooth.

116
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.

117
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I love this little bit of water

118
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that comes off the back of his tail.

119
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But the centerpiece species of Zakouma are the elephants.

120
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.

121
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Here's a photograph shot in moonlight,

122
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
something that digital photography has made a big difference for.

123
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.

124
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,

125
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
collared the matriarch of the herd.

126
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They named her Annie,

127
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and they began tracking her movements.

128
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The herd was safe within the confines of the park,

129
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because of this dedicated group of park rangers.

130
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But once the annual rains began,

131
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.

132
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And that's when they ran into trouble.

133
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
For outside the safety of the park were poachers,

134
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.

135
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The matriarch that they were radio tracking,

136
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,

137
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
came to a halt outside the park.

138
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.

139
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And they only came for the ivory.

140
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is actually one of the rangers.

141
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,

142
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because they couldn't leave it there,

143
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because it's still valuable.

144
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But what Nick did was he brought back

145
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
a story that went beyond the old-school method

146
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?"

147
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.

148
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Instead of just knowledge of this park,

149
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
he created an understanding and an empathy

150
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues

151
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
surrounding human-wildlife conflicts.

152
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now let's go over to India.

153
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.

154
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman

155
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
touches upon in his new world population project.

156
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
For the first time in history,

157
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.

158
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And most of that growth is not in the cities,

159
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but in the slums that surround them.

160
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,

161
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
came to me and said,

162
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.

163
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world."

164
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget."

165
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So instead, what we did was

166
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result

167
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
in what we'd consider sort of a survey story --

168
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --

169
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we put Jonas into Dharavi,

170
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which is part of Mumbai, India,

171
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and let him stay there, and really get into

172
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the heart and soul of this really major part of the city.

173
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look

174
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
at the awful conditions that exist in such places.

175
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part

176
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of how the entire urban area functioned.

177
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
By staying tightly focused in one place,

178
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit

179
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that underlies this community.

180
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And he did it in a beautiful way.

181
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Sometimes, though, the only way to tell a story is with a sweeping picture.

182
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry

183
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and photojournalist Randy Olson

184
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to document the depletion of the world's fisheries.

185
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,

186
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but the photographs that Brian and Randy created

187
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
are among the best to capture both the human

188
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and natural devastation of overfishing.

189
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Here, in a photo by Brian,

190
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
a seemingly crucified shark is caught up

191
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in a gill net off of Baja.

192
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,

193
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the animals accidentally scooped up

194
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
while fishing for a specific species.

195
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But here, Brian captured a unique view

196
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
by positioning himself underneath the boat

197
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when they threw the waste overboard.

198
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And Brian then went on to even greater risk

199
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to get this never-before-made photograph

200
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.

201
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Back on land, Randy Olson photographed

202
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
a makeshift fish market in Africa,

203
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,

204
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the main parts having already been sent to Europe.

205
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.

206
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
As prime food sources are depleted,

207
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the harvest goes deeper into the oceans

208
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and brings in more such sources of protein.

209
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is called fishing down the food chain.

210
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But there are also glimmers of hope,

211
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,

212
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we don't really want to go

213
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and just look at all the problems.

214
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We also want to look for solutions.

215
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,

216
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
where commercial fishing had been banned --

217
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the result being that the overfished species have been restored,

218
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.

219
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Photography can also compel us to confront

220
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
issues that are potentially distressing and controversial.

221
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,

222
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
took a look at the sweep of the medical system

223
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.

224
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end

225
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and exits back home, on the other.

226
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Jim started in the battlefield.

227
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier

228
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.

229
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Here is in the field hospital.

230
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter

231
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.

232
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
From here, the more severely wounded are transported

233
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
back to Germany, where they meet up with their families

234
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
for the first time.

235
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,

236
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
such as here in Walter Reed.

237
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,

238
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
they exit the medical system and attempt

239
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to regain their pre-war lives.

240
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story

241
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.

242
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now, these stories are great examples

243
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of how photography can be used

244
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to address some of our most important topics.

245
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But there are also times when photographers

246
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,

247
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
just plain fun.

248
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica

249
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to shoot a story on leopard seals.

250
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered

251
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.

252
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been

253
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.

254
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant

255
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
about getting into the water.

256
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.

257
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You know of "The March of the Penguins."

258
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is sort of the munch of the penguins.

259
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

260
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out

261
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to see if the coast is clear.

262
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.

263
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But then Paul got in the water.

264
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And he said he was never really afraid of this.

265
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
Well, this one female came up to him.

266
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
She's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,

267
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but she's 12 feet long.

268
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So, she is pretty significant in size.

269
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And Paul said he was never really afraid,

270
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because she was more curious about him than threatened.

271
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This mouthing behavior, on the right,

272
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
was really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!"

273
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have."

274
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Laughter)

275
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.

276
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water

277
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that for some reason didn't seem to be interested

278
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in chasing penguins.

279
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,

280
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
alive, and put them in front of him.

281
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
She dropped them off, and then they would swim away.

282
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
She'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?"

283
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Go back and get them, and then bring them back

284
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and drop them in front of him.

285
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And she did this over the course of a couple of days,

286
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
until the point where she got so frustrated with him

287
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that she started putting them directly on top of his head.

288
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Laughter)

289
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.

290
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Laughter)

291
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured

292
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that he was never going to survive.

293
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This is her just puffing out, you know,

294
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
snorting out in disgust.

295
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Laughter)

296
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.

297
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Paul set out to photograph a relatively

298
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
mysterious and unknown creature,

299
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and came back with not just a collection of photographs,

300
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
but an amazing experience and a great story.

301
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It is these kinds of stories,

302
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial

303
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.

304
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I believe that photography can make a real connection to people,

305
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and can be employed as a positive agent

306
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
for understanding the challenges and opportunities

307
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
facing our world today.

308
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Thank you.

309
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Applause)

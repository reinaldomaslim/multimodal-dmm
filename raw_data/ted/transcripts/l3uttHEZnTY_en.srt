0:02:26.779,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Pep Rosenfeld: Folks, you've just met Claron McFadden.

5
0:02:29.811,000 --> 0:02:31,000
She is a world-class soprano singer

6
0:02:32.422,000 --> 0:02:33,000
who studied in Rochester, New York.

7
0:02:34.938,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Her celebrated operatic roles are numerous and varied.

8
0:02:38.649,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In August 2007, Claron was awarded the Amsterdam Prize for the Arts,

9
0:02:44.244,000 --> 0:02:45,000
winning praise for her brilliance,

10
0:02:46.083,000 --> 0:02:49,000
her amazing and extensively wide repertoire

11
0:02:49.513,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and her vivid stage personality.

12
0:02:51.704,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Please welcome Claron McFadden.

13
0:02:53.674,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Applause)

14
0:03:04.66,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Claron McFadden: The human voice:

15
0:03:07.334,000 --> 0:03:1,000
mysterious, spontaneous, primal.

16
0:03:13.053,000 --> 0:03:17,000
For me, the human voice is the vessel on which all emotions travel --

17
0:03:18.014,000 --> 0:03:19,000
except, perhaps, jealousy.

18
0:03:21.84,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And the breath,

19
0:03:23.339,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the breath is the captain of that vessel.

20
0:03:27.591,000 --> 0:03:28,000
A child is born,

21
0:03:30.558,000 --> 0:03:31,000
takes its first breath --

22
0:03:32.863,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Inhales)

23
0:03:38.01,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Whah!

24
0:03:40.531,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And we behold the wondrous beauty

25
0:03:44.954,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of vocal expression --

26
0:03:47.188,000 --> 0:03:49,000
mysterious, spontaneous

27
0:03:50.899,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and primal.

28
0:03:53.923,000 --> 0:03:56,000
A few years ago, I did a meditation retreat in Thailand.

29
0:03:57.089,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I wanted a place

30
0:03:59.279,000 --> 0:04:02,000
where I would have total silence and total solitude.

31
0:04:03.988,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I spent two weeks at this retreat

32
0:04:06.619,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in my own little hut --

33
0:04:08.357,000 --> 0:04:1,000
no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature,

34
0:04:12.214,000 --> 0:04:15,000
trying to find the essence of concentration,

35
0:04:15.777,000 --> 0:04:16,000
being in the moment.

36
0:04:17.937,000 --> 0:04:18,000
On my last day,

37
0:04:19.818,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the woman who looked after the place,

38
0:04:22.675,000 --> 0:04:24,000
she came and we spoke for a minute,

39
0:04:24.875,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and then she said to me,

40
0:04:27.581,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"Would you sing something for me?"

41
0:04:29.915,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And I thought, but this is a place of total quiet and silence.

42
0:04:33.216,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I can't make noise.

43
0:04:35.81,000 --> 0:04:37,000
She said, "Please, sing for me."

44
0:04:39.553,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So I closed my eyes,

45
0:04:42.18,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I took breath

46
0:04:45.1,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the first thing that came up and out

47
0:04:48.465,000 --> 0:04:49,000
was "Summertime,"

48
0:04:51.037,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Porgy and Bess.

49
0:04:52.259,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Singing) Summertime and the livin' is easy.

50
0:04:57.632,000 --> 0:05:,000
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.

51
0:05:00.798,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'.

52
0:05:04.807,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So hush little baby,

53
0:05:06.421,000 --> 0:05:08,000
don't you cry.

54
0:05:10.103,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And I opened my eyes,

55
0:05:12.473,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I saw that she had her eyes closed.

56
0:05:16.001,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And after a moment, she opened her eyes

57
0:05:18.128,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and she looked at me and she said,

58
0:05:21.025,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"It's like meditation."

59
0:05:23.765,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And in that moment I understood

60
0:05:26.011,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that everything I had gone to Thailand to look for,

61
0:05:29.447,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to search for,

62
0:05:31.057,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I had it already in my singing --

63
0:05:34.866,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the calm, but alertness,

64
0:05:38.66,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the focus, but awareness,

65
0:05:41.804,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and being totally in the moment.

66
0:05:46.295,000 --> 0:05:47,000
When you're totally in the moment --

67
0:05:48.065,000 --> 0:05:49,000
when I'm totally in the moment,

68
0:05:49.588,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the vessel of expression is open.

69
0:05:51.817,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The emotions can flow from me

70
0:05:54.413,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to you

71
0:05:55.61,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and back.

72
0:05:57.817,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's an extremely profound experience.

73
0:06:02.047,000 --> 0:06:04,000
There's a piece by a composer,

74
0:06:04.421,000 --> 0:06:06,000
an American composer called John Cage.

75
0:06:07.043,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's called "Aria."

76
0:06:08.647,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It was written for an amazing singer called Cathy Berberian.

77
0:06:13.752,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And the thing about this piece that's so special --

78
0:06:16.942,000 --> 0:06:17,000
if you see it behind me --

79
0:06:19.267,000 --> 0:06:21,000
it's not notated in any way.

80
0:06:22.669,000 --> 0:06:24,000
No notes, no flats, no sharps.

81
0:06:26.058,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But it's a kind of structure.

82
0:06:28.431,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And the singer, within this structure,

83
0:06:30.915,000 --> 0:06:34,000
has total freedom to be creative, spontaneous.

84
0:06:35.538,000 --> 0:06:36,000
For example,

85
0:06:37.832,000 --> 0:06:38,000
there are different colors

86
0:06:39.403,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and each color gets a different type of singing --

87
0:06:43.379,000 --> 0:06:46,000
pop, country and western, opera, jazz --

88
0:06:47.292,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and you just have to be consistent with that color.

89
0:06:51.61,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You see there are different lines.

90
0:06:53.998,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You choose in your own tempo in your own way

91
0:06:56.229,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to follow the line,

92
0:06:57.506,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but you must respect it,

93
0:06:59.726,000 --> 0:07:,000
more or less.

94
0:07:01.391,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And these little dots,

95
0:07:03.906,000 --> 0:07:06,000
these represent a sort of sound

96
0:07:08.459,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way

97
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
of expressing the voice.

98
0:07:13.491,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Using the body -- it could be sneezing,

99
0:07:15.576,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it could be coughing, animals --

100
0:07:17.179,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Audience member coughs)

101
0:07:18.798,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Exactly. (Laughter)

102
0:07:20.114,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Clapping, whatever.

103
0:07:23.138,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And there's different text.

104
0:07:25.129,000 --> 0:07:28,000
There's Armenian, Russian, French, English, Italian.

105
0:07:29.459,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So within this structure, one is free.

106
0:07:32.945,000 --> 0:07:34,000
To me, this piece is an ode to the voice,

107
0:07:36.992,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because it's mysterious, as we can see.

108
0:07:41.413,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's quite spontaneous.

109
0:07:45.811,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And it's primal.

110
0:07:47.765,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So I would like to share this piece with you,

111
0:07:49.979,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's "Aria," of John Cage.

112
0:07:59.528,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Singing in various languages)

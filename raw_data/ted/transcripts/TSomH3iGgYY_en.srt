1
0:00:12.987,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How many of you have had your doctor ask you about sex?

2
0:00:16.82,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Your mental health?

3
0:00:18.479,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Alcohol use?

4
0:00:19.772,000 --> 0:00:22,000
These questions are almost universal.

5
0:00:22.891,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But how many of you have had your doctor ask you about money?

6
0:00:27.461,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Most of us haven't.

7
0:00:29.609,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But that is strange, because compared to most high-income countries,

8
0:00:33.922,000 --> 0:00:37,000
child poverty is an epidemic in the United States.

9
0:00:38.122,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It creates conditions that may elevate stress hormone levels

10
0:00:42.216,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and impair brain development.

11
0:00:44.879,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Poor children in the US are one and a half times more likely to die

12
0:00:50.416,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and twice as likely to be hospitalized

13
0:00:53.002,000 --> 0:00:55,000
as their middle-class counterparts.

14
0:00:55.968,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So my colleague Dr. Michael Hole and I started asking moms about money.

15
0:01:03.123,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We knew we needed to reimagine what a doctor's visit looks like,

16
0:01:07.301,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to get kids out of poverty

17
0:01:08.943,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and to give them a fair shot at a healthy life.

18
0:01:13.195,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Our questions led to a surprising solution:

19
0:01:16.572,000 --> 0:01:17,000
tax credits.

20
0:01:17.939,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It turns out, the earned income tax credit, or EITC,

21
0:01:22.493,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is the best poverty prescription we have in the US.

22
0:01:26.671,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The average mom gets two to three thousand dollars a year from it.

23
0:01:31.06,000 --> 0:01:34,000
When families get it, moms and babies are healthier:

24
0:01:34.559,000 --> 0:01:35,000
fewer depressed moms,

25
0:01:36.456,000 --> 0:01:37,000
babies weighing more at birth.

26
0:01:38.9,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But one out of five families who could get it doesn't,

27
0:01:43.268,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and most who do lose of hundreds of dollars

28
0:01:46.953,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to the for-profit tax-preparation industry.

29
0:01:51.409,000 --> 0:01:54,000
One day, a mom asked us why we couldn't do her taxes

30
0:01:55.097,000 --> 0:01:56,000
while she waited for the doctor.

31
0:01:56.717,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:57.75,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We all know that purgatory. Why not make good use of that time?

33
0:02:02.018,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So we started StreetCred,

34
0:02:04.102,000 --> 0:02:09,000
an organization prescribing tax preparation in clinics serving kids.

35
0:02:09.674,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is a brand-new approach

36
0:02:11.753,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and one that left some questioning our sanity.

37
0:02:15.103,000 --> 0:02:17,000
After all, we're doctors, not accountants.

38
0:02:17.899,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But we have something accountants don't:

39
0:02:21.439,000 --> 0:02:23,000
access to families.

40
0:02:24.075,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Over 90 percent of kids in the US see a doctor at least once a year.

41
0:02:29.732,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Their parents trust us

42
0:02:31.196,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and will do anything to give them a better life.

43
0:02:36.207,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Doctors in every clinic around the country could be doing this work, too --

44
0:02:40.21,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it's simple, really.

45
0:02:42.126,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The hospital registers as a tax-preparation site,

46
0:02:44.879,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and everyone, from medical students to retirees,

47
0:02:48.639,000 --> 0:02:52,000
can volunteer as a tax preparer after passing an IRS exam.

48
0:02:53.905,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's not as hard as it sounds, I promise.

49
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I certainly never thought I would be doing other people's taxes,

50
0:02:59.79,000 --> 0:03:,000
but here I am.

51
0:03:01.823,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We're nearing the end of our third year.

52
0:03:05.077,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In the first two, we returned 1.6 million dollars

53
0:03:09.808,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to 750 families in Boston alone.

54
0:03:12.945,000 --> 0:03:13,000
This year --

55
0:03:14.155,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:19.106,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This year, we've expanded to nine sites in four states.

57
0:03:23.357,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Sixty-three percent of our families have never heard of the EITC.

58
0:03:28.968,000 --> 0:03:31,000
How can you claim something you haven't heard of?

59
0:03:32.17,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And half have never used free tax preparation.

60
0:03:35.769,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That two to three thousand dollars a year

61
0:03:38.368,000 --> 0:03:39,000
goes a long way.

62
0:03:40.259,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Take hunger.

63
0:03:41.984,000 --> 0:03:45,000
An adequately nutritious, low-cost diet for a mom and two young kids

64
0:03:46.586,000 --> 0:03:48,000
costs 477 dollars a month.

65
0:03:50.065,000 --> 0:03:54,000
With EITC money, that family can eat for five to six months.

66
0:03:54.83,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Or think about medical care.

67
0:03:56.962,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Twenty million children in the US lack access to care

68
0:04:00.969,000 --> 0:04:02,000
meeting modern pediatric standards.

69
0:04:04.122,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And yet, the average cost of that care is only 400 dollars per kid per year.

70
0:04:11.157,000 --> 0:04:14,000
EITC money can help fix this access problem.

71
0:04:15.755,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Perhaps most powerfully of all,

72
0:04:17.861,000 --> 0:04:18,000
this money gives moms hope.

73
0:04:20.051,000 --> 0:04:24,000
One mom used her refund for her son to study abroad in Spain.

74
0:04:25.133,000 --> 0:04:27,000
She was struggling to pay her rent,

75
0:04:27.513,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but she saw EITC money as his shot at a better future.

76
0:04:32.064,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We have an opportunity,

77
0:04:33.972,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as doctors and as citizens,

78
0:04:36.478,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to get to the root of this problem.

79
0:04:38.669,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We can reimagine health care

80
0:04:40.364,000 --> 0:04:43,000
as a place addressing the causes of poor health,

81
0:04:44.061,000 --> 0:04:45,000
be it infections

82
0:04:45.73,000 --> 0:04:46,000
or finances.

83
0:04:47.567,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Thank you.

84
0:04:48.802,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Applause)

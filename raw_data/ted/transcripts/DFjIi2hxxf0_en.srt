My name is Tom,

2
0:00:13.918,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and I've come here today to come clean

3
0:00:17.094,000 --> 0:00:2,000
about what I do for money.

4
0:00:20.551,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Basically, I use my mouth in strange ways

5
0:00:24.051,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in exchange for cash.

6
0:00:26.241,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:27.336,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I usually do this kind of thing in seedy downtown bars

8
0:00:30.535,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and on street corners,

9
0:00:32.158,000 --> 0:00:35,000
so this mightn't be the most appropriate setting,

10
0:00:35.254,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but I'd like to give you guys a bit of a demonstration

11
0:00:39.087,000 --> 0:00:42,000
about what I do.

12
0:00:45.685,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Beatboxing)

13
0:02:14.108,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And now, for my next number,

14
0:02:17.776,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I'd like to return to the classics.

15
0:02:22.31,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Applause)

16
0:02:24.38,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We're going to take it back,

17
0:02:26.767,000 --> 0:02:28,000
way back,

18
0:02:28.9,000 --> 0:02:31,000
back into time.

19
0:02:34.155,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Beatboxing: "Billie Jean")

20
0:02:53.987,000 --> 0:02:56,000

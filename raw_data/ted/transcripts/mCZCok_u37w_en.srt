1
0:00:13.862,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The world makes you something that you're not,

2
0:00:18.071,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but you know inside what you are,

3
0:00:20.972,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and that question burns in your heart:

4
0:00:23.852,000 --> 0:00:25,000
How will you become that?

5
0:00:26.846,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I may be somewhat unique in this,

6
0:00:29.212,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but I am not alone,

7
0:00:31.241,000 --> 0:00:34,000
not alone at all.

8
0:00:34.341,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So when I became a fashion model,

9
0:00:36.461,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream

10
0:00:38.161,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.

11
0:00:41.417,000 --> 0:00:45,000
My outside self finally matched my inner truth,

12
0:00:45.547,000 --> 0:00:47,000
my inner self.

13
0:00:47.925,000 --> 0:00:51,000
For complicated reasons which I'll get to later,

14
0:00:52.082,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when I look at this picture,

15
0:00:55.03,000 --> 0:00:57,000
at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,

16
0:00:57.574,000 --> 0:00:58,000
you've made it,

17
0:00:58.913,000 --> 0:01:,000
you have arrived.

18
0:01:01.734,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But this past October,

19
0:01:04.324,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I realized that I'm only just beginning.

20
0:01:08.982,000 --> 0:01:12,000
All of us are put in boxes by our family,

21
0:01:13.112,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by our religion,

22
0:01:14.782,000 --> 0:01:15,000
by our society,

23
0:01:16.726,000 --> 0:01:18,000
our moment in history,

24
0:01:19.099,000 --> 0:01:21,000
even our own bodies.

25
0:01:21.571,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Some people have the courage to break free,

26
0:01:24.347,000 --> 0:01:26,000
not to accept the limitations imposed by

27
0:01:26.786,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the color of their skin

28
0:01:28.506,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or by the beliefs of those that surround them.

29
0:01:32.293,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Those people are always the threat

30
0:01:34.085,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to the status quo,

31
0:01:35.309,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to what is considered acceptable.

32
0:01:39.804,000 --> 0:01:44,000
In my case, for the last nine years,

33
0:01:45.593,000 --> 0:01:46,000
some of my neighbors,

34
0:01:47.287,000 --> 0:01:5,000
some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,

35
0:01:50.291,000 --> 0:01:52,000
did not know about my history.

36
0:01:52.901,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.

37
0:01:56.657,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Here is mine.

38
0:02:00.282,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I was assigned boy at birth

39
0:02:03.095,000 --> 0:02:06,000
based on the appearance of my genitalia.

40
0:02:06.177,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I remember when I was five years old

41
0:02:08.095,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in the Philippines walking around our house,

42
0:02:10.575,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.

43
0:02:13.946,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And my mom asked me,

44
0:02:15.441,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?"

45
0:02:18.021,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."

46
0:02:23.219,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I knew then how to self-identify.

47
0:02:27.656,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Gender has always been considered a fact,

48
0:02:32.363,000 --> 0:02:33,000
immutable,

49
0:02:34.235,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but we now know it's actually more fluid,

50
0:02:37.862,000 --> 0:02:41,000
complex and mysterious.

51
0:02:41.877,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Because of my success, I never had the courage

52
0:02:44.29,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to share my story,

53
0:02:46.94,000 --> 0:02:48,000
not because I thought what I am is wrong,

54
0:02:49.553,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but because of how the world treats those of us

55
0:02:52.555,000 --> 0:02:55,000
who wish to break free.

56
0:02:55.757,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Every day,

57
0:02:57.495,000 --> 0:03:,000
I am so grateful because I am a woman.

58
0:03:01.431,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I have a mom and dad and family

59
0:03:04.907,000 --> 0:03:06,000
who accepted me for who I am.

60
0:03:07.752,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Many are not so fortunate.

61
0:03:12.631,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There's a long tradition in Asian culture

62
0:03:14.706,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.

63
0:03:18.284,000 --> 0:03:2,000
There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.

64
0:03:21.085,000 --> 0:03:25,000
There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.

65
0:03:25.351,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So when I was eight years old,

66
0:03:27.7,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating

67
0:03:30.31,000 --> 0:03:32,000
these mysteries.

68
0:03:32.428,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I was in front of the stage,

69
0:03:34.866,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman

70
0:03:37.977,000 --> 0:03:38,000
right in front of me,

71
0:03:39.137,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I remember that moment something hit me:

72
0:03:41.423,000 --> 0:03:44,000
That is the kind of woman I would like to be.

73
0:03:45.133,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So when I was 15 years old,

74
0:03:47.693,000 --> 0:03:48,000
still dressing as a boy,

75
0:03:49.11,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I met this woman named T.L.

76
0:03:51.524,000 --> 0:03:54,000
She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.

77
0:03:55.188,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That night she asked me,

78
0:03:56.87,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"

79
0:03:59.636,000 --> 0:04:01,000
She convinced me that if I joined

80
0:04:01.852,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that she would take care of the registration fee

81
0:04:05.175,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and the garments,

82
0:04:06.787,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and that night,

83
0:04:08.946,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I won best in swimsuit

84
0:04:11.026,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and best in long gown

85
0:04:12.54,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and placed second runner up

86
0:04:14.189,000 --> 0:04:17,000
among 40-plus candidates.

87
0:04:17.928,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That moment changed my life.

88
0:04:20.554,000 --> 0:04:21,000
All of a sudden, I was introduced

89
0:04:22.197,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to the world of beauty pageants.

90
0:04:25.066,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Not a lot of people could say that your first job

91
0:04:27.89,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is a pageant queen for transgender women,

92
0:04:29.702,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but I'll take it.

93
0:04:32.578,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined

94
0:04:34.871,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the most prestigious pageant

95
0:04:37.338,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally,

96
0:04:41.879,000 --> 0:04:44,000
or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field,

97
0:04:45.046,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and when it rains --

98
0:04:46.967,000 --> 0:04:48,000
it rains a lot in the Philippines --

99
0:04:49.714,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the organizers would have to move it

100
0:04:51.022,000 --> 0:04:55,000
inside someone's house.

101
0:04:55.097,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I also experienced the goodness of strangers,

102
0:04:57.374,000 --> 0:04:58,000
especially when we would travel

103
0:04:58.719,000 --> 0:05:,000
in remote provinces in the Philippines.

104
0:05:01.688,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But most importantly, I met

105
0:05:03.179,000 --> 0:05:06,000
some of my best friends in that community.

106
0:05:06.571,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In 2001,

107
0:05:08.997,000 --> 0:05:1,000
my mom, who had moved to San Francisco,

108
0:05:11.024,000 --> 0:05:14,000
called me and told me that my green card petition came through,

109
0:05:14.851,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that I could now move to the United States.

110
0:05:18.134,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I resisted it.

111
0:05:19.528,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.

112
0:05:21.597,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I'm here with my friends,

113
0:05:22.507,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."

114
0:05:26.041,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But then two weeks later she called me, she said,

115
0:05:29.138,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"Did you know that if you move to the United States

116
0:05:31.835,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you could change your name and gender marker?"

117
0:05:35.068,000 --> 0:05:38,000
That was all I needed to hear.

118
0:05:38.113,000 --> 0:05:39,000
My mom also told me to put two E's

119
0:05:39.949,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in the spelling of my name.

120
0:05:42.03,000 --> 0:05:44,000
She also came with me when I had my surgery

121
0:05:44.413,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in Thailand at 19 years old.

122
0:05:47.412,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand,

123
0:05:50.94,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they perform some of the most prestigious,

124
0:05:54.051,000 --> 0:05:58,000
safe and sophisticated surgery.

125
0:05:58.44,000 --> 0:05:59,000
At that time in the United States,

126
0:06:00.075,000 --> 0:06:01,000
you needed to have surgery

127
0:06:01.543,000 --> 0:06:04,000
before you could change your name and gender marker.

128
0:06:04.858,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,

129
0:06:09.094,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and I remember looking at my California driver's license

130
0:06:13.523,000 --> 0:06:14,000
with the name Geena

131
0:06:15.509,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and gender marker F.

132
0:06:17.913,000 --> 0:06:19,000
That was a powerful moment.

133
0:06:20.505,000 --> 0:06:21,000
For some people,

134
0:06:22.367,000 --> 0:06:23,000
their I.D. is their license to drive

135
0:06:24.294,000 --> 0:06:26,000
or even to get a drink,

136
0:06:26.741,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but for me, that was my license to live,

137
0:06:30.395,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to feel dignified.

138
0:06:32.937,000 --> 0:06:34,000
All of a sudden, my fears were minimized.

139
0:06:35.524,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I felt that I could conquer my dream

140
0:06:37.881,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and move to New York and be a model.

141
0:06:41.778,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Many are not so fortunate.

142
0:06:45.085,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.

143
0:06:48.536,000 --> 0:06:49,000
She's from New York, she's a young woman

144
0:06:50.504,000 --> 0:06:52,000
who was courageously living her truth,

145
0:06:53.024,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but hatred ended her life.

146
0:06:56.077,000 --> 0:06:58,000
For most of my community,

147
0:06:58.638,000 --> 0:07:,000
this is the reality in which we live.

148
0:07:01.57,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Our suicide rate is nine times higher

149
0:07:04.058,000 --> 0:07:06,000
than that of the general population.

150
0:07:06.994,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Every November 20,

151
0:07:08.961,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we have a global vigil

152
0:07:10.927,000 --> 0:07:13,000
for Transgender Day of Remembrance.

153
0:07:14.077,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I'm here at this stage

154
0:07:15.438,000 --> 0:07:17,000
because it's a long history of people who fought

155
0:07:18.287,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and stood up for injustice.

156
0:07:20.551,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.

157
0:07:26.533,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Today, this very moment,

158
0:07:28.797,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is my real coming out.

159
0:07:31.924,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I could no longer live my truth

160
0:07:34.487,000 --> 0:07:36,000
for and by myself.

161
0:07:37.318,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I want to do my best to help others

162
0:07:39.483,000 --> 0:07:43,000
live their truth without shame and terror.

163
0:07:44.236,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I am here, exposed,

164
0:07:48.819,000 --> 0:07:5,000
so that one day there will never be a need

165
0:07:51.261,000 --> 0:07:54,000
for a November 20 vigil.

166
0:07:55.132,000 --> 0:08:01,000
My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.

167
0:08:01.397,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Will you?

168
0:08:03.182,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Thank you very much.

169
0:08:05.156,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Applause)

170
0:08:08.113,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

171
0:08:14.368,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.

172
0:08:16.376,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I'm wondering what you would say,

173
0:08:18.213,000 --> 0:08:19,000
especially to parents,

174
0:08:20.086,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but in a more broad way, to friends,

175
0:08:22.043,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to family, to anyone who finds themselves

176
0:08:24.607,000 --> 0:08:26,000
encountering a child or a person

177
0:08:26.729,000 --> 0:08:27,000
who is struggling with and uncomfortable with

178
0:08:28.289,000 --> 0:08:29,000
a gender that's being assigned them,

179
0:08:30.178,000 --> 0:08:31,000
what might you say

180
0:08:32.019,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to the family members of that person

181
0:08:34.178,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to help them become good and caring and kind

182
0:08:36.957,000 --> 0:08:37,000
family members to them?

183
0:08:38.571,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Geena Rocero: Sure. Well, first, really, I'm so blessed.

184
0:08:40.623,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The support system, with my mom especially,

185
0:08:43.724,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and my family, that in itself

186
0:08:45.43,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is just so powerful.

187
0:08:47.691,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I remember every time I would coach

188
0:08:49.511,000 --> 0:08:51,000
young trans women, I would mentor them,

189
0:08:52.063,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and sometimes when they would call me

190
0:08:54.481,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and tell me that their parents can't accept it,

191
0:08:56.984,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,

192
0:08:58.79,000 --> 0:08:59,000
"Mom, can you call this woman?"

193
0:09:00.113,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so —

194
0:09:03.614,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But it's just, gender identity

195
0:09:07.128,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is in the core of our being, right?

196
0:09:09.5,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,

197
0:09:13.142,000 --> 0:09:14,000
so what I'm trying to do

198
0:09:15.017,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is to have this conversation that

199
0:09:17.488,000 --> 0:09:2,000
sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,

200
0:09:20.897,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and there should be a space

201
0:09:22.828,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that would allow people to self-identify,

202
0:09:25.523,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and that's a conversation that we should have

203
0:09:27.13,000 --> 0:09:3,000
with parents, with colleagues.

204
0:09:30.222,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The transgender movement,

205
0:09:31.597,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it's at the very beginning,

206
0:09:34.222,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to compare to how the gay movement started.

207
0:09:37.181,000 --> 0:09:39,000
There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.

208
0:09:39.731,000 --> 0:09:4,000
There should be an understanding.

209
0:09:41.336,000 --> 0:09:42,000
There should be a space of curiosity

210
0:09:43.295,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and asking questions,

211
0:09:45.869,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.

212
0:09:48.512,000 --> 0:09:5,000
KS: Thank you. That was so lovely. GR: Thank you.

213
0:09:50.759,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So since I was here last in '06,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we discovered that global climate change

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so we covered that fairly extensively

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in Skeptic magazine.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We investigate all kinds

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because the world's going to end in 2012.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Another update:

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You will recall I introduced you guys

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to the Quadro Tracker.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's like a water dowsing device.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And you walk around, and it points to things.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it'll point right to somebody.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This particular one that was given to me

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
finds golf balls,

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
especially if you're at a golf course

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and you check under enough bushes.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
this device, the ADE 651,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
was sold to the Iraqi government

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for 40,000 dollars apiece.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's just like this one, completely worthless,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
magnetic ion attraction,"

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
which translates to

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word --

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but it does absolutely nothing.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In this case, at trespass points,

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
allowing people to go through

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because your little tracker device said they were okay,

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
actually cost lives.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So there is a danger to pseudoscience,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in believing in this sort of thing.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So what I want to talk about today is belief.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I want to believe,

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and you do too.

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And in fact, I think my thesis here is that

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
belief is the natural state of things.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It is the default option. We just believe.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We believe all sorts of things.

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Belief is natural;

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's more difficult.

50
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's uncomfortable to not believe things.

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and the reason for that is because

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
we have a belief engine in our brains.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And sometimes A really is connected to B,

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and that's called association learning.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We find patterns, we make those connections,

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
whether it's Pavlov's dog here

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
associating the sound of the bell with the food,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or whether it's a Skinnerian rat,

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in which he's having an association

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
between his behavior and a reward for it,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and therefore he repeats the behavior.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
In fact, what Skinner discovered

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and he has to press one of these two keys,

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there --

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
if you just randomly assign rewards

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
such that there is no pattern,

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
they will figure out any kind of pattern.

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
they repeat that particular pattern.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
once clockwise and peck the key twice.

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And that's called superstition,

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and that, I'm afraid,

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we will always have with us.

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I call this process "patternicity" --

83
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns

84
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in both meaningful and meaningless noise.

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
A Type I error, or false positive,

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is believing a pattern is real

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
when it's not.

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Our second type of error is a false negative.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
A Type II error is not believing

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a pattern is real when it is.

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So let's do a thought experiment.

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You are a hominid three million years ago

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
walking on the plains of Africa.

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Your name is Lucy, okay?

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And you hear a rustle in the grass.

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Is it a dangerous predator,

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or is it just the wind?

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and it turns out it's just the wind,

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you've made an error in cognition,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
made a Type I error, false positive.

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But no harm. You just move away.

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and it turns out it's a dangerous predator,

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you're lunch.

109
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
You've just won a Darwin award.

110
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You've been taken out of the gene pool.

111
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now the problem here is that

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
patternicities will occur whenever the cost

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of making a Type I error

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is less than the cost of making a Type II error.

115
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is the only equation in the talk by the way.

116
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We have a pattern detection problem

117
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error

118
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is highly problematic,

119
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.

120
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So the default position

121
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is just: Believe all patterns are real --

122
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators

123
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and not just the wind.

124
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And so I think that we evolved ...

125
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,

126
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
our pattern-seeking brain processes,

127
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to always find meaningful patterns

128
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and infuse them with these sort of

129
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.

130
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So for example, what do you see here?

131
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It's a horse head, that's right.

132
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.

133
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That's a pattern.

134
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And is it really a horse?

135
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Or is it more like a frog?

136
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
See, our pattern detection device,

137
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex --

138
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
it's our little detection device there --

139
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
For example, what do you see here?

141
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Yes, of course, it's a cow.

142
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming --

143
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
once I prime the brain to see it,

144
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.

145
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And what do you see here?

146
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.

147
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.

148
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So when I go back without the prime,

149
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
your brain already has the model

150
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
so you can see it again.

151
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
What do you see here?

152
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.

153
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
How about here?

154
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Just shout out anything you see.

155
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
That's a good audience, Chris.

156
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.

157
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson

158
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
at U.T. Austin

159
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
on corporate environments

160
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control

161
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
makes people see illusory patterns.

162
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.

163
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control

164
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
are more likely to see something in this,

165
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which is allegedly patternless.

166
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
In other words, the propensity to find these patterns

167
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
goes up when there's a lack of control.

168
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious

169
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
when they're batting,

170
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but not so much when they're fielding.

171
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Because fielders are successful

172
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
90 to 95 percent of the time.

173
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.

174
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So their superstitions, their patternicities,

175
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
are all associated with feelings of lack of control

176
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and so forth.

177
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?

178
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Anybody see an object there?

179
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
There actually is something here,

180
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but it's degraded.

181
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
While you're thinking about that,

182
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,

183
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
a psychologist in England,

184
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
who showed subjects this degraded image

185
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and then ran a correlation between

186
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
their scores on an ESP test:

187
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
How much did they believe in the paranormal,

188
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
supernatural, angels and so forth.

189
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And those who scored high on the ESP scale,

190
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
tended to not only see

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
more patterns in the degraded images

192
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but incorrect patterns.

193
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Here is what you show subjects.

194
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent

195
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and then the one I showed you,

196
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
70 percent.

197
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
A similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist

198
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
named Peter Brugger,

199
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
who found significantly more meaningful patterns

200
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
were perceived on the right hemisphere,

201
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.

202
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So if you present subjects the images such

203
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,

204
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
then they're more likely to see patterns

205
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
than if you put it on the left hemisphere.

206
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Our right hemisphere appears to be

207
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
where a lot of this patternicity occurs.

208
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain

209
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to see where all this happens.

210
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,

211
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
gave subjects L-DOPA.

212
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,

213
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which is related to a decrease in dopamine.

214
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
L-DOPA increases dopamine.

215
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
An increase of dopamine caused

216
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
subjects to see more patterns

217
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
than those that did not receive the dopamine.

218
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So dopamine appears to be the drug

219
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
associated with patternicity.

220
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In fact, neuroleptic drugs

221
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,

222
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
things like paranoia, delusions

223
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and hallucinations,

224
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
these are patternicities.

225
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.

226
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if you give them drugs

227
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that are dopamine antagonists,

228
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
they go away.

229
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,

230
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and their tendency to see

231
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
patterns like that decreases.

232
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine

233
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
are dopamine agonists.

234
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
They increase the amount of dopamine.

235
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,

236
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
creativity, find more patterns.

237
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently

238
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
talk about how he thought he was much funnier

239
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.

240
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So perhaps more dopamine

241
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
is related to more creativity.

242
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Dopamine, I think, changes

243
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
our signal-to-noise ratio.

244
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
That is, how accurate we are

245
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
in finding patterns.

246
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.

247
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.

248
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.

249
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.

250
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.

252
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You think people are talking about you.

253
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply

254
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
labeled as madness.

255
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's a distinction perhaps we might make

256
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman

257
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and John Nash.

258
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
One sees maybe just the right number

259
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.

260
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.

261
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And we then call that schizophrenia.

262
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.

263
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And of course you all know exactly

264
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
what this is, right?

265
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And what pattern do you see here?

266
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,

267
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
causing you conflicting pattern detections.

268
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.

269
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
These are sandals.

270
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Pretty sexy feet, I must say.

271
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Maybe a little Photoshopped.

272
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And of course, the ambiguous figures

273
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that seem to flip-flop back and forth.

274
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It turns out what you're thinking about a lot

275
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
influences what you

276
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
tend to see.

277
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And you see the lamp here, I know.

278
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Because the lights on here.

279
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement

280
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.

281
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure

282
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is, of course, the dolphins, right?

283
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
You see a dolphin here,

284
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and there's a dolphin,

285
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and there's a dolphin.

286
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That's a dolphin tail there, guys.

287
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Laughter)

288
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
If we can give you conflicting data, again,

289
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.

290
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.

291
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And then we have to flip the image

292
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
for you to see that it's a set up.

293
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The impossible crate illusion.

294
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.

295
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that

296
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."

297
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'

298
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,

299
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
in which Jerry is standing inside

300
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the impossible crate.

301
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And he was kind enough to post this

302
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and give us the reveal.

303
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Of course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,

304
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.

305
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But even when I take it away,

306
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired

307
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to find those certain kinds of patterns.

308
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This is a fairly new one

309
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns

310
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of comparing this angle with that angle.

311
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
In fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.

312
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So what you're doing is comparing that angle

313
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
instead of with this one, but with that one.

314
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And so your brain is fooled.

315
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.

316
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Faces are easy to see

317
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
because we have an additional evolved

318
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
facial recognition software

319
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in our temporal lobes.

320
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Here's some faces on the side of a rock.

321
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.

322
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But anyway, the point is still made.

323
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now which one of these looks odd to you?

324
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?

325
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it

326
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
so it'll be the one on the right.

327
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And you are correct.

328
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.

329
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Now, they trade up the politicians every time.

330
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Well, why is this happening?

331
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Well, we know exactly where it happens,

332
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,

333
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

334
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And there's two types of cells that do this,

335
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that record facial features either globally,

336
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,

337
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
first look at the general face.

338
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So you recognize Obama immediately.

339
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And then you notice something quite

340
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.

341
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Especially when they're upside down,

342
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
you're engaging that general facial recognition software there.

343
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Now I said back in our little thought experiment,

344
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.

345
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?

346
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
What's the difference between those?

347
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Well, the wind is inanimate;

348
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the dangerous predator is an intentional agent.

349
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And I call this process agenticity.

350
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
That is the tendency to infuse patterns

351
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
with meaning, intention and agency,

352
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
often invisible beings from the top down.

353
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
This is an idea that we got

354
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,

355
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
who talked about taking the intentional stance.

356
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:

357
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
souls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,

358
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
aliens, intelligent designers,

359
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
government conspiracists

360
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and all manner of invisible agents

361
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
with power and intention, are believed

362
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to haunt our world and control our lives.

363
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I think it's the basis of animism

364
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and polytheism and monotheism.

365
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's the belief that aliens are somehow

366
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
more advanced than us, more moral than us,

367
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and the narratives always are

368
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.

369
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The intelligent designer's always portrayed

370
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
as this super intelligent, moral being

371
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that comes down to design life.

372
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Even the idea that government can rescue us --

373
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that's no longer the wave of the future,

374
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
but that is, I think, a type of agenticity:

375
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
projecting somebody up there,

376
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
big and powerful, will come rescue us.

377
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.

378
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,

379
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
whether it's the Illuminati

380
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
or the Bilderbergers.

381
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?

382
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Some patterns are real and some are not.

383
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?

384
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day --

385
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were.

386
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.

387
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.

388
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.

389
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So we can't just uniformly dismiss

390
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
all patterns like that.

391
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.

392
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Some conspiracies really are true.

393
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Explains a lot, maybe.

394
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.

395
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We did a whole issue on it.

396
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings

397
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
constitutes a conspiracy.

398
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.

399
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.

400
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Well, that's a whole other lecture.

401
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
You know how we know that 9/11

402
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
was not orchestrated by the Bush administration?

403
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Because it worked.

404
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
(Laughter)

405
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Applause)

406
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So we are natural-born dualists.

407
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Our agenticity process comes from

408
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.

409
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Because we can imagine, in essence,

410
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
continuing on.

411
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,

412
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,

413
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
near-death experiences,

414
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.

415
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness,

416
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
by accelerating in a centrifuge.

417
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.

418
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And the brain then senses

419
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that there's an out-of-body experience.

420
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
You can use -- which I did, went out and did --

421
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Michael Persinger's God Helmet,

422
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.

423
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience.

424
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So I'm going to end here with a short video clip

425
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that sort of brings all this together.

426
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It's just a minute and a half.

427
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.

428
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Go ahead and roll it.

429
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Narrator: This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions

430
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
for an advert for lip balm.

431
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Woman: We're hoping we can use part of this

432
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
in a national commercial, right?

433
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And this is test on some lip balms

434
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
that we have over here.

435
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And these are our models who are going to help us,

436
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Roger and Matt.

437
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And we have our own lip balm,

438
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and we have a leading brand.

439
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Would you have any problem

440
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
kissing our models to test it?

441
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Girl: No.

442
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Woman: You wouldn't? (Girl: No.) Woman: You'd think that was fine.

443
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Girl: That would be fine. (Woman: Okay.)

444
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
So this is a blind test.

445
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
I'm going to ask you to go ahead

446
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and put a blindfold on.

447
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.)

448
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.)

449
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Woman: It's completely blind now, right?

450
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Girl: Yes. (Woman: Okay.)

451
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test

452
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
is how it protects your lips,

453
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the texture, right,

454
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not.

455
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Girl: Okay. (Woman: Have you ever done a kissing test before?)

456
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Girl: No.

457
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Woman: Take a step here.

458
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.

459
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay?

460
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
(Music)

461
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
(Laughter)

462
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
(Laughter)

463
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Woman: Okay.

464
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And, Jennifer, how did that feel?

465
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Jennifer: Good.

466
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
(Laughter)

467
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Girl: Oh my God!

468
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
(Laughter)

469
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.

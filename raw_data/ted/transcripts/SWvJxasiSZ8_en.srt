1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is Revolution 2.0.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
No one was a hero. No one was a hero.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Because everyone was a hero.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Everyone has done something.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We all use Wikipedia.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
If you think of the concept of Wikipedia

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
where everyone is collaborating on content,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and at the end of the day

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you've built the largest encyclopedia in the world.

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
From just an idea that sounded crazy,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you have the largest encyclopedia in the world.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And in the Egyptian revolution,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the Revolution 2.0,

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
everyone has contributed something,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
small or big. They contributed something --

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to bring us

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
one of the most inspiring stories

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in the history of mankind

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
when it comes to revolutions.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It was actually really inspiring

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to see all these Egyptians completely changing.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
If you look at the scene,

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Egypt, for 30 years, had been in a downhill --

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
going into a downhill.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Everything was going bad.

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Everything was going wrong.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
We only ranked high when it comes to poverty,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
corruption,

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
lack of freedom of speech,

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
lack of political activism.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Those were the achievements

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
of our great regime.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Yet, nothing was happening.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And it's not because people were happy

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or people were not frustrated.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In fact, people were extremely frustrated.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But the reason why everyone was silent

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is what I call the psychological barrier of fear.

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Everyone was scared.

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Not everyone. There were actually a few brave Egyptians

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that I have to thank for being so brave --

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
going into protests as a couple of hundred,

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
getting beaten up and arrested.

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But in fact, the majority were scared.

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Everyone did not want really

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to get in trouble.

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
A dictator cannot live without the force.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They want to make people live in fear.

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And that psychological barrier of fear

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
had worked for so many years,

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and here comes the Internet,

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
technology, BlackBerry, SMS.

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's helping all of us to connect.

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Platforms like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
were helping us a lot

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
because it basically gave us the impression that, "Wow, I'm not alone.

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
There are a lot of people who are frustrated."

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
There are lots of people who are frustrated.

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There are lots of people who actually share the same dream.

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
There are lots of people who care about their freedom.

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They probably have the best life in the world.

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They are living in happiness. They are living in their villas.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They are happy. They don't have problems.

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But they are still feeling the pain of the Egyptian.

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
A lot of us, we're not really happy

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when we see a video of an Egyptian man

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
who's eating the trash

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
while others are stealing

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
billions of Egyptian pounds

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
from the wealth of the country.

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The Internet has played a great role,

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
helping these people to speak up their minds,

73
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to collaborate together, to start thinking together.

74
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It was an educational campaign.

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Khaled Saeed was killed

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in June 2010.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I still remember the photo.

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I still remember every single detail of that photo.

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The photo was horrible.

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
He was tortured,

81
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
brutally tortured to death.

82
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But then what was the answer of the regime?

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"He choked on a pile of hash" --

84
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that was their answer:

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
"He's a criminal.

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
He's someone who escaped from all these bad things."

87
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But people did not relate to this.

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
People did not believe this.

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Because of the Internet, the truth prevailed

90
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and everyone knew the truth.

91
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And everyone started to think that "this guy could be my brother."

92
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
He was a middle-class guy.

93
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
His photo was remembered by all of us.

94
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
A page was created.

95
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
An anonymous administrator

96
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
was basically inviting people to join the page,

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and there was no plan.

98
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"What are we going to do?" "I don't know."

99
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In a few days, tens of thousands of people there --

100
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
angry Egyptians

101
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
who were asking the ministry of interior affairs,

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
"Enough.

103
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Get those who killed this guy.

104
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
To just bring them to justice."

105
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But of course, they don't listen.

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It was an amazing story --

107
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
how everyone started feeling the ownership.

108
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Everyone was an owner in this page.

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
People started contributing ideas.

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
In fact, one of the most ridiculous ideas

111
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
was, "Hey, let's have a silent stand.

112
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Let's get people to go in the street,

113
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
face the sea, their back to the street,

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
dressed in black, standing up silently for one hour,

115
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
doing nothing and then just leaving,

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
going back home."

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
For some people, that was like, "Wow, silent stand.

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And next time it's going to be vibration."

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
People were making fun of the idea.

120
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But actually when people went to the street --

121
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the first time it was thousands of people

122
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in Alexandria --

123
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it felt like -- it was amazing. It was great

124
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because it connected people from the virtual world,

125
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
bringing them to the real world,

126
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
sharing the same dream,

127
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the same frustration, the same anger,

128
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the same desire for freedom.

129
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And they were doing this thing.

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But did the regime learn anything? Not really.

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They were actually attacking them.

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They were actually abusing them,

133
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
despite the fact of how peaceful these guys were --

134
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they were not even protesting.

135
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And things had developed

136
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
until the Tunisian revolution.

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This whole page was, again,

138
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
managed by the people.

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In fact, the anonymous admin job

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
was to collect ideas,

141
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
help people to vote on them

142
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and actually tell them what they are doing.

143
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
People were taking shots and photos;

144
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt;

145
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
people were suggesting ideas,

146
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they were actually voting on ideas,

147
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and then they were executing the ideas; people were creating videos.

148
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Everything was done by the people to the people,

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and that's the power of the Internet.

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
There was no leader.

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The leader was everyone on that page.

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The Tunisian experiment, as Amir was saying,

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
inspired all of us, showed us that there is a way.

154
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Yes we can. We can do it.

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We have the same problems;

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
we can just go in the streets.

157
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And when I saw the street on the 25th,

158
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I went back and said,

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"Egypt before the 25th

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is never going to be Egypt after the 25th.

161
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The revolution is happening.

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is not the end,

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
this is the beginning of the end."

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I was detained on the 27th night.

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Thank God I announced the locations and everything.

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But they detained me.

167
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And I'm not going to talk about my experience, because this is not about me.

168
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I was detained for 12 days,

169
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
blindfolded, handcuffed.

170
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I did not really hear anything. I did not know anything.

171
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I was not allowed to speak with anyone.

172
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And I went out.

173
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The next day I was in Tahrir.

174
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Seriously, with the amount of change I had noticed in this square,

175
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I thought it was 12 years.

176
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I never had in my mind

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to see this Egyptian,

178
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the amazing Egyptian.

179
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The fear is no longer fear.

180
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's actually strength -- it's power.

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
People were so empowered.

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It was amazing how everyone was so empowered

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and now asking for their rights.

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Completely opposite.

185
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Extremism became tolerance.

186
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Who would [have] imagined before the 25th,

187
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
if I tell you that hundreds of thousands of Christians are going to pray

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and tens of thousands of Muslims are going to protect them,

189
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and then hundreds of thousands of Muslims are going to pray

190
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and tens of thousands of Christians are going to protect them --

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
this is amazing.

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
All the stereotypes

193
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that the regime was trying to put on us

194
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
through their so-called propaganda, or mainstream media,

195
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
are proven wrong.

196
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This whole revolution showed us

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
how ugly such a regime was

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and how great and amazing

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the Egyptian man, the Egyptian woman,

200
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
how simple and amazing these people are

201
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
whenever they have a dream.

202
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
When I saw that,

203
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I went back and I wrote on Facebook.

204
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And that was a personal belief,

205
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
regardless of what's going on,

206
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
regardless of the details.

207
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I said that, "We are going to win.

208
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We are going to win because we don't understand politics.

209
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We're going to win because we don't play their dirty games.

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We're going to win because we don't have an agenda.

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We're going to win because the tears that come from our eyes

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
actually come from our hearts.

213
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We're going to win because we have dreams.

214
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We're going to win because we are willing to stand up for our dreams."

215
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And that's actually what happened. We won.

216
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And that's not because of anything,

217
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but because we believed in our dream.

218
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The winning here is not

219
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the whole details of what's going to happen in the political scene.

220
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The winning is the winning of the dignity

221
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of every single Egyptian.

222
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Actually, I had this taxi driver telling me,

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"Listen, I am breathing freedom.

224
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I feel that I have dignity

225
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that I have lost for so many years."

226
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
For me that's winning,

227
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
regardless of all the details.

228
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
My last word to you is a statement I believe in,

229
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which Egyptians have proven to be true,

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that the power of the people

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is much stronger than the people in power.

232
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Thanks a lot.

233
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and it's a time machine.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And everyone in this room has to get into it.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you cannot stay where you are.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or Twitter or "American Idol."

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I don't know.

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I understand that.

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's because possibilities on this planet,

18
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
they don't go back, they go forward.

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
by any measure that you wish to choose:

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
health, wealth,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
mobility, opportunity,

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
declining rates of disease ...

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There's never been a time like this.

26
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
My great-grandparents died, all of them,

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by the time they were 60.

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My parents are closing in on 80.

30
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So there better be

31
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a nine at the beginning of my death number.

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But it's not even about people like us,

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
because this is a bigger deal than that.

34
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
A kid born in New Delhi today

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
can expect to live as long as

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Think about that, it's an incredible fact.

38
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And why is it true?

39
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions

40
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
of people on this planet.

41
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It reshaped the demography of the globe

42
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in a way that no war ever has.

43
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's gone. It's vanished.

44
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We vanquished it. Puff.

45
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
In the rich world,

46
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago

47
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
no longer exist, hardly.

48
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Diphtheria, rubella, polio ...

49
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
does anyone even know what those things are?

50
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Vaccines, modern medicine,

51
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
our ability to feed billions of people,

52
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
those are triumphs of the scientific method.

53
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And to my mind, the scientific method --

54
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
trying stuff out,

55
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --

56
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.

57
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So that's the good news.

58
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Unfortunately, that's all the good news

59
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.

60
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And one of them is that

61
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
despite all our accomplishments,

62
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
a billion people go to bed hungry

63
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in this world every day.

64
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.

65
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And not only that, we've used our imagination

66
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to thoroughly trash this globe.

67
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Potable water, arable land,

68
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
rainforests, oil, gas:

69
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they're going away, and they're going away soon,

70
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,

71
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we're going away too.

72
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.

73
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I think it's clear that we can make food

74
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.

75
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I think we can power this world with energy

76
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that doesn't also destroy it.

77
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.

78
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
one of the things that keeps me up at night:

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And we've also never been in a position

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.

83
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in many fields,

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and yet I actually think we'd have to go back

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,

87
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to find a time when we battled progress,

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
when we fought about these things

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
People wrap themselves in their beliefs,

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.

92
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Not even the truth will set them free.

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But you know what you're not entitled to?

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And this took me awhile to figure out.

98
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
for The New Yorker. A little story.

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And I was amazed to find opposition:

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
opposition to what is, after all,

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the most effective public health measure in human history.

103
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I didn't know what to do,

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.

105
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And soon after that,

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Same thing, only bigger.

108
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
People were going crazy.

109
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I wrote a story about that too,

110
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and I couldn't understand why

111
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
people thought this was "Frankenfoods,"

112
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
why they thought moving molecules around

113
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
was trespassing on nature's ground.

115
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.

116
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I mean, I'm a journalist.

117
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.

118
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

119
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But these stories bothered me,

120
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.

121
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
weren't actually fanatics at all.

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.

124
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They were exactly like the people in this room.

125
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And it just disturbed me so much.

126
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.

127
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We're at a point in this world

128
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We talk about it ambivalently.

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"progress."

132
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We've lost faith in institutions,

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in authority,

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and sometimes in science itself,

136
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and there's no reason we shouldn't have.

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You can just say a few names

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and people will understand.

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,

140
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,

141
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
hanging chads.

142
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You know, you can choose your list.

143
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
There are questions and problems

144
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
with the people we used to believe were always right,

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so be skeptical.

146
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.

147
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Don't take anything for granted.

148
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But here's the thing: When you get proof,

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.

150
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the reason that I can say that is because

151
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we're now in an epidemic of fear

152
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
About 12 years ago, there was a story published,

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
a horrible story,

155
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that linked the epidemic of autism

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.

157
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Very scary.

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The data came back.

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The data came back from the United States, from England,

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from Sweden, from Canada,

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and it was all the same: no correlation,

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
no connection, none at all.

165
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because we believe anecdotes,

167
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we believe what we see, what we think we see,

168
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
what makes us feel real.

169
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We don't believe a bunch of documents

170
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
from a government official giving us data,

171
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and I do understand that, I think we all do.

172
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But you know what?

173
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
The result of that has been disastrous.

174
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Disastrous because here's a fact:

175
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The United States is one of the only countries in the world

176
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.

177
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
That is disgraceful,

178
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and we should be ashamed of ourselves.

179
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It's horrible.

180
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
What kind of a thing happened

181
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that we could do that?

182
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.

183
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Because, did anyone have measles here?

184
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?

185
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Doesn't happen very much.

186
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Doesn't happen in this country at all,

187
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.

188
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
That's a lot of death of measles --

189
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
20 an hour.

190
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,

191
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and people like Jenny McCarthy

192
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
can go around preaching messages

193
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
of fear and illiteracy from platforms

194
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."

195
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And they can do it because

196
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
they don't link causation and correlation.

197
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They don't understand that these things seem the same,

198
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but they're almost never the same.

199
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.

200
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.

201
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.

202
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.

203
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That guy in the middle, not so much.

204
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
His name is Paul Offit.

205
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.

206
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids

207
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
in the developing world every year.

208
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Pretty good, right?

209
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines

210
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and says how valuable they are

211
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and that people ought to just stop the whining.

212
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And he actually says it that way.

213
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So, Paul's a terrorist.

214
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
When Paul speaks in a public hearing,

215
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
he can't testify without armed guards.

216
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
He gets called at home

217
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because people like to tell him

218
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that they remember where his kids go to school.

219
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine.

220
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.

221
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You take them away, disease comes back,

222
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
horrible diseases. And that's happening.

223
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We have measles in this country now.

224
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids

225
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.

226
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And they're not just going to die of measles.

227
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
What about polio? Let's have that. Why not?

228
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said

229
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
she thought I was a little strident.

230
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
No one's ever said that before.

231
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,

232
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
no way.

233
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Fine.

234
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?

235
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.

236
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,

237
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.

238
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,

239
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and he's going to come to Long Beach,

240
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.

241
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,

242
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and we don't either because that's the way the world works.

243
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.

244
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.

245
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Everyone take their vitamins this morning?

246
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Echinacea, a little antioxidant

247
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to get you going.

248
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.

249
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,

250
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it doesn't matter how often

251
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we find out that they're useless.

252
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The data says it all the time.

253
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.

254
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

255
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?

256
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I'm totally with you.

257
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

258
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Dark urine. Dark.

259
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?

260
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.

261
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.

262
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.

263
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's cruel to millions of people.

264
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's absolutely astonishingly cold

265
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.

266
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So we run away from it, and where do we run?

267
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We leap into the arms of Big Placebo.

268
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

269
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.

270
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Applause)

271
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But, you know, it's really a serious thing

272
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because this stuff is crap,

273
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and we spend billions of dollars on it.

274
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And I have all sorts of little props here.

275
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
None of it ... ginkgo, fraud;

276
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
echinacea, fraud;

277
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
acai -- I don't even know what that is

278
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud.

279
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,

280
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.

281
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It makes them feel good."

282
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And you know what? You're wrong.

283
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Because I don't care

284
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
if it's the secretary of HHS

285
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence

286
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of my experts on mammograms,"

287
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient

288
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
with coffee enemas.

289
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
When you start down the road

290
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
where belief and magic replace evidence and science,

291
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
you end up in a place you don't want to be.

292
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.

293
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
He killed 400,000 of his people

294
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
by insisting that beetroot,

295
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
garlic and lemon oil

296
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs

297
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we know can slow the course of AIDS.

298
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths

299
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in a country that has been plagued

300
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
worse than any other by this disease.

301
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Please, don't tell me

302
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
there are no consequences to these things.

303
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
There are. There always are.

304
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Now, the most mindless epidemic

305
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
we're in the middle of right now

306
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is this absurd battle

307
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
between proponents of genetically engineered food

308
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and the organic elite.

309
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.

310
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's a debate about words, about metaphors.

311
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's ideology, it's not science.

312
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice,

313
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
every sprig of parsley,

314
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
every Brussels sprout

315
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
has been modified by man.

316
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.

317
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
There wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter)

318
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.

319
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We made it over the last 11,000 years.

320
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.

321
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
We got rid of the stuff that didn't.

322
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now we can do it in a more precise way --

323
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and there are risks, absolutely --

324
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice,

325
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and that stuff can help millions of people,

326
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
millions of people, prolong their lives.

327
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
You don't want to do that?

328
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I have to say, I don't understand it.

329
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We object to genetically engineered food.

330
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Why do we do that?

331
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Well, the things I constantly hear are:

332
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Too many chemicals,

333
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
pesticides, hormones,

334
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
monoculture, we don't want giant fields

335
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
of the same thing, that's wrong.

336
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We don't companies patenting life.

337
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We don't want companies owning seeds.

338
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And you know what my response to all of that is?

339
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.

340
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's true, we've got a huge food problem,

341
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but this isn't science.

342
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
This has nothing to do with science.

343
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.

344
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
You know science isn't a company.

345
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It's not a country.

346
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It's not even an idea; it's a process.

347
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,

348
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but the idea that we should not allow

349
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
science to do its job

350
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
because we're afraid,

351
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
is really very deadening,

352
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
and it's preventing millions of people

353
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
from prospering.

354
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
You know, in the next 50 years

355
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,

356
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
70 percent.

357
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.

358
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Disgraceful. Disgraceful.

359
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.

360
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And why? Genetically engineered food.

361
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We don't want to encourage people

362
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.

363
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Cassava's something that half a billion people eat.

364
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's kind of like a potato.

365
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.

366
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,

367
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and scientists are engineering

368
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
all of that into it right now.

369
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.

370
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
They wouldn't starve, and you know what?

371
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,

372
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
but it would be nice.

373
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And all I can say about this is:

374
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Why are we fighting it?

375
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?

376
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Because we don't want to move genes around?

377
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.

378
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,

379
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
our insistence on having bigger food,

380
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
better food, singular food.

381
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
This isn't about Rice Krispies,

382
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
this is about keeping people alive,

383
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and it's about time we started to understand what that meant.

384
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Because, you know something?

385
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,

386
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:

387
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
high-tech colonialism.

388
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.

389
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
It's selfish, it's ugly,

390
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
it's beneath us,

391
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and we really have to stop it.

392
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So after this amazingly fun conversation,

393
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Laughter)

394
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this

395
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
ridiculous time machine and go forward?"

396
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.

397
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
It's stuck in the present right now,

398
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
but we have an amazing opportunity.

399
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We can set that time machine on anything we want.

400
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We can move it where we want to move it,

401
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and we're going to move it where we want to move it.

402
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We have to have these conversations and we have to think,

403
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,

404
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
we're going to be happy we do.

405
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I know that we can,

406
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and as far as I'm concerned,

407
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
that's something the world needs right now.

408
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
(Applause)

409
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you.

410
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Thank you.

411
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Thank you. Thank you.

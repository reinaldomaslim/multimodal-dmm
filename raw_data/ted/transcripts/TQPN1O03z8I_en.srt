1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's a simple idea about nature.

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I want to say a word for nature

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals,

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world

8
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and to the other species on whom we depend.

9
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,

10
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.

11
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's not my idea, other people have hit on it,

12
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but I've tried to take it to some new places.

13
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Let me tell you where I got it.

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use,

15
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.

16
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes,

17
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
it was the first week of May --

18
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom;

19
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
they're just white clouds above.

20
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was here, planting my chunks,

21
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
cutting up potatoes and planting it,

22
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the bees were working on this tree;

23
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.

24
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And one of the things I really like about gardening

25
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is that it doesn't take all your concentration,

26
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking --

27
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.

28
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden,

29
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
working alongside that bumblebee,

30
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?

31
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
How was our role in this garden similar and different?

32
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common:

33
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another,

34
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view --

35
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
thought we were calling the shots.

36
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant --

37
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was --

38
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country,

39
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
brought it, and I was planting it.

40
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,

41
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom,

42
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave."

43
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are;

44
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.

45
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.

46
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But that day, it occurred to me:

47
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?

48
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Because, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge,

49
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but we know better.

50
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower

51
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.

52
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?

53
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits --

54
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
color, scent, flavor, pattern -- that has lured that bee in.

55
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar,

56
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and also picking up some powder on its leg,

57
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and going off to the next blossom.

58
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The bee is not calling the shots.

59
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And I realized then, I wasn't either.

60
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I had been seduced by that potato and not another

61
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.

62
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen

63
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?"

64
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology,

65
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but as a co-evolutionary development

66
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us,

67
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.

68
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The competition of grasses, right?

69
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And suddenly everything looked different.

70
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.

71
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I had thought always -- and in fact, had written this in my first book;

72
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
this was a book about gardening --

73
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that lawns were nature under culture's boot,

74
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that they were totalitarian landscapes,

75
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species

76
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and never letting it set seed or die or have sex.

77
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And that's what the lawn was.

78
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.

79
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,

80
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
who they compete with for sunlight."

81
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,

82
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which in New England happens very, very quickly.

83
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So I started looking at things this way

84
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."

85
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower

86
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees --

87
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry --

88
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?

89
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,

90
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.

91
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?

92
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit --

93
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
is what does it get us?

94
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,

95
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?

96
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?

97
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,

98
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
rather than its destruction?

99
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I would submit that this idea does this.

100
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way,

101
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
besides some entertaining insights about human desire.

102
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
As an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view

103
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
helps us deal with this weird anomaly,

104
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history --

105
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...

106
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Ugh. Mini-Me. (Laughter)

107
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,

108
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we figured out we are just one species among many;

109
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;

110
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we are acted upon as well as acting;

111
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.

112
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;

113
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
none of us really believes this.

114
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes --

115
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;

116
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that the world is divided into subjects and objects;

117
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that there is nature on one side, culture on another.

118
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,

119
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
you realize that the real literary conceit is that --

120
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is the idea that nature is opposed to culture,

121
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
the idea that consciousness is everything --

122
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and that's another very important thing it does.

123
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Looking at the world from other species' points of view

124
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.

125
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You suddenly realize that consciousness --

126
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
which we value and we consider

127
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the crowning achievement of nature,

128
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.

129
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.

130
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But, you know, there's a comedian who said,

131
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
"Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?

132
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Well, consciousness."

133
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools

134
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and they're just as interesting.

135
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'll give you two examples, also from the garden:

136
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?

137
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world

138
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and summons another species of mite

139
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.

140
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language,

141
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
they have biochemistry.

142
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.

143
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Their complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,

144
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.

145
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes

146
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and we came out with only 23,000.

147
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Just to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.

148
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So who's the more sophisticated species?

149
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Well, we're all equally sophisticated.

150
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We've been evolving just as long,

151
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
just along different paths.

152
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.

153
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller,

154
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually

155
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
help us think ecologically.

156
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Now, the other use of this is practical.

157
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And I'm going to take you to a farm right now,

158
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system

159
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.

160
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,

161
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause)

162
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.

163
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Laughter)

164
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year

165
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and there will be that much more habitat

166
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.

167
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So it helped me understand industrial agriculture,

168
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
which of course is a Cartesian system.

169
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will

170
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories

171
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it

172
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
or the fuel or whatever we want.

173
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Let me take you to a very different kind of farm.

174
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.

175
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I went looking for a farm where these ideas

176
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,

177
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.

178
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm,

179
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature

180
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.

181
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And that is this:

182
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the farm is called Polyface, which means ...

183
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,

184
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.

185
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this,

186
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...

187
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
what else does he have?

188
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
All the six different species -- rabbits, actually --

189
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are all performing ecological services for one another,

190
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other

191
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and they take care of pests for one another.

192
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,

193
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,

194
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.

195
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?

196
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;

197
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
this is a different way to think about nature

198
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,

199
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,

200
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.

201
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So, one day, cattle in a pen.

202
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:

203
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
relatively new, hooked to a car battery;

204
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.

205
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Cows graze one day. They move, OK?

206
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
They graze everything down, intensive grazing.

207
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
He waits three days,

208
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.

209
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption --

210
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards --

211
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but it houses 350 chickens.

212
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,

213
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank --

214
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
clucking, gossiping as chickens will --

215
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and they make a beeline for the cow patties.

216
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And what they're doing is very interesting:

217
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
they're digging through the cow patties

218
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
for the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.

219
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And the reason he's waited three days

220
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch

221
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and he'll have a huge fly problem.

222
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can

223
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
because they are the chickens' favorite form of protein.

224
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance

225
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs,

226
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and in the process they're spreading the manure out.

227
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Very useful second ecosystem service.

228
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And third, while they're in this paddock

229
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
they are, of course, defecating madly

230
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.

231
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They then move out to the next one,

232
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.

233
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And within four or five weeks, he can do it again.

234
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,

235
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
like the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.

236
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Now, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.

237
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So, it's a very productive system.

238
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres

239
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
he gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs;

240
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits --

241
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
an immense amount of food.

242
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?"

243
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...

244
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
again, give each species what it wants,

245
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.

246
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Put that in play.

247
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
But look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.

248
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
What happens to the grass when you do this?

249
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
When a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height,

250
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and it immediately does something very interesting.

251
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,

252
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and plants need to keep the root mass

253
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.

254
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;

255
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.

256
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And the species in the soil go to work

257
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
basically chewing through those roots, decomposing them --

258
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria -- and the result is new soil.

259
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
This is how soil is created.

260
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It's created from the bottom up.

261
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
This is how the prairies were built,

262
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
the relationship between bison and grasses.

263
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And what I realized when I understood this --

264
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer,

265
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer,

266
0:15:55.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
because grass is really the keystone species of such a system --

267
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads,

268
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.

269
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
More for us, less for nature.

270
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season

271
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
there is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity.

272
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.

273
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
There are a lot of farmers doing this today.

274
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
This is well beyond organic agriculture,

275
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:39,000
which is still a Cartesian system, more or less.

276
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,

277
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea

278
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
-- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,

279
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time --

280
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that we can take the food we need from the Earth

281
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and actually heal the Earth in the process.

282
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
This is a way to reanimate the world,

283
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and that's what's so exciting about this perspective.

284
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones,

285
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas

286
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
are something to be very hopeful about.

287
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Thank you very much.

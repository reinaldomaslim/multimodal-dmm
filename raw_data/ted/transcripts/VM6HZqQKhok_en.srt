1
0:00:13.223,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My journey away from violent extremism began 22 years ago,

2
0:00:18.212,000 --> 0:00:19,000
when I denounced racism

3
0:00:20.183,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and left the American white supremacist skinhead movement

4
0:00:22.991,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that I had helped build.

5
0:00:24.707,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Cheers and applause)

6
0:00:30.78,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I was just 22 years old at the time,

7
0:00:33.389,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but I had already spent eight years, from the time I was 14 years old,

8
0:00:37.466,000 --> 0:00:39,000
as one of the earliest and youngest members

9
0:00:39.704,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and an eventual leader within America's most violent hate movement.

10
0:00:44.881,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But I wasn't born into hate;

11
0:00:47.683,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in fact, it was quite the opposite.

12
0:00:52.067,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I had a relatively normal childhood.

13
0:00:55.771,000 --> 0:00:56,000
My parents are Italian immigrants

14
0:00:57.493,000 --> 0:01:,000
who came to the United States in the mid-1960s

15
0:01:00.607,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and settled on the South Side of Chicago,

16
0:01:03.32,000 --> 0:01:04,000
where they eventually met,

17
0:01:05.307,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and opened a small beauty shop.

18
0:01:08.639,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Right after I was born, things got a little bit more difficult.

19
0:01:11.658,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They struggled to survive with raising a young family and a new business,

20
0:01:16.374,000 --> 0:01:18,000
often working seven days a week,

21
0:01:19.259,000 --> 0:01:2,000
14 hours a day,

22
0:01:21.081,000 --> 0:01:24,000
taking on second and third jobs just to earn a meager living.

23
0:01:25.21,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And quality time with my parents was pretty nonexistent.

24
0:01:29.176,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Even though I knew they loved me very much,

25
0:01:32.216,000 --> 0:01:34,000
growing up, I felt abandoned.

26
0:01:35.297,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I was lonely, and I started to withdraw,

27
0:01:39.196,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and then I started to resent my parents and become very angry.

28
0:01:44.943,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And as I was growing up, through my teenage years,

29
0:01:47.53,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I started to act out to try and get attention from my parents.

30
0:01:53.032,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And one day, when I was 14,

31
0:01:55.59,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I was standing in an alley, and I was smoking a joint,

32
0:01:59.791,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and a man who was twice my age, with a shaved head and tall black boots,

33
0:02:05.47,000 --> 0:02:06,000
came up to me,

34
0:02:07.295,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and he snatched the joint from my lips.

35
0:02:10.893,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Then he put his hand on my shoulder and he looked me in the eyes,

36
0:02:14.834,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and he said,

37
0:02:16.933,000 --> 0:02:19,000
"That's what the communists and the Jews want you to do

38
0:02:19.976,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to keep you docile."

39
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I was 14 years old,

40
0:02:24.536,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'd been trading baseball cards and watching "Happy Days" --

41
0:02:27.434,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I didn't really know what a Jew was.

42
0:02:29.232,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:31.026,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's true.

44
0:02:32.201,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And the only communist that I knew was the bad Russian guy

45
0:02:36.2,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in my favorite Rocky movie.

46
0:02:38.092,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:40.747,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And since I'm here baring my soul with you,

48
0:02:43.002,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I can reveal that I did not even know what the word "docile" meant.

49
0:02:47.018,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:48.843,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Dead serious.

51
0:02:50.95,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But it was as if this man in this alley had offered me a lifeline.

52
0:02:55.435,000 --> 0:02:59,000
For 14 years, I'd felt marginalized and bullied.

53
0:03:00.247,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I had low self-esteem.

54
0:03:02.632,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And frankly, I didn't know who I was, where I belonged,

55
0:03:06.452,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or what my purpose was.

56
0:03:08.481,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I was lost.

57
0:03:10.43,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And overnight, because this man had pulled me in,

58
0:03:14.546,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and I had grabbed onto that lifeline with every fiber of my being,

59
0:03:19.901,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I had gone from "Joanie Loves Chachi"

60
0:03:24.264,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to full-blown Nazi.

61
0:03:26.826,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Overnight.

62
0:03:29.626,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I started to listen to the rhetoric

63
0:03:32.797,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and believe it.

64
0:03:34.518,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I started to watch very closely as the leaders of this organization

65
0:03:38.904,000 --> 0:03:43,000
would target vulnerable young people who felt marginalized

66
0:03:44.083,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and then draw them in with promises of paradise

67
0:03:48.657,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that were broken.

68
0:03:51.691,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then I started to recruit myself.

69
0:03:55.099,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I started to do that by making white-power music.

70
0:04:00.299,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And soon, I became the leader of that infamous organization

71
0:04:05.588,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that was led by that man in that alley

72
0:04:08.24,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who recruited me that day,

73
0:04:10.013,000 --> 0:04:14,000
who was America's first neo-Nazi skinhead and who had radicalized me.

74
0:04:15.452,000 --> 0:04:17,000
For the next eight years,

75
0:04:17.756,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I believed the lies that I had been fed.

76
0:04:21.292,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And though I saw no evidence of it whatsoever,

77
0:04:24.672,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I didn't hesitate to blame every Jewish person in the world

78
0:04:28.919,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for what I thought was a white, European genocide

79
0:04:33.076,000 --> 0:04:37,000
being promoted by them through a multiculturalist agenda.

80
0:04:38.553,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I blamed people of color

81
0:04:40.575,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for the crime and violence and the drugs in the city,

82
0:04:45.737,000 --> 0:04:48,000
completely neglecting the fact that I was committing acts of violence

83
0:04:49.652,000 --> 0:04:5,000
on a daily basis,

84
0:04:51.558,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and that in many cases,

85
0:04:53.254,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it was white supremacists who were funneling drugs

86
0:04:56.248,000 --> 0:04:57,000
into the inner cities.

87
0:04:58.967,000 --> 0:05:,000
And I blamed immigrants

88
0:05:01.287,000 --> 0:05:04,000
for taking jobs from white Americans,

89
0:05:04.827,000 --> 0:05:08,000
completely neglecting the fact that my parents were hardworking immigrants

90
0:05:09.822,000 --> 0:05:11,000
who struggled to survive,

91
0:05:13.01,000 --> 0:05:15,000
despite not getting help from anybody else.

92
0:05:17.846,000 --> 0:05:18,000
For the next eight years,

93
0:05:20.339,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I saw friends die,

94
0:05:23.096,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I saw others go to prison and inflict untold pain

95
0:05:27.237,000 --> 0:05:3,000
on countless victims and their families' lives.

96
0:05:31.566,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I heard horrific stories from young women in the movement,

97
0:05:35.138,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who'd been brutally raped by the very men they were conditioned to trust,

98
0:05:41.957,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I myself committed acts of violence against people,

99
0:05:45.139,000 --> 0:05:47,000
solely for the color of their skin,

100
0:05:47.691,000 --> 0:05:48,000
who they loved,

101
0:05:49.052,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or the god that they prayed to.

102
0:05:53.315,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I stockpiled weapons for what I thought was an upcoming race war.

103
0:05:57.746,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I went to six high schools;

104
0:05:59.189,000 --> 0:06:,000
I was kicked out of four of them,

105
0:06:00.89,000 --> 0:06:01,000
one of them, twice.

106
0:06:03.641,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And 25 years ago, I wrote and performed racist music

107
0:06:10.044,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that found its way to the internet decades later

108
0:06:12.738,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and partially inspired a young white nationalist

109
0:06:16.051,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to walk into a sacred Charleston, South Carolina, church

110
0:06:20.576,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and senselessly massacre nine innocent people.

111
0:06:28.278,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But then my life changed.

112
0:06:31.721,000 --> 0:06:35,000
At 19 years old, I met a girl who was not in the movement,

113
0:06:35.849,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who didn't have a racist bone in her body,

114
0:06:39.708,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I fell in love with her.

115
0:06:42.279,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And at 19, we got married,

116
0:06:44.92,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and we had our first son.

117
0:06:48.425,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And when I held my son in my arms in the delivery room that day,

118
0:06:52.784,000 --> 0:06:56,000
not only did I reconnect with some of the innocence that I had lost

119
0:06:57.304,000 --> 0:06:58,000
at 14 years old,

120
0:06:59.716,000 --> 0:07:,000
but it also began to challenge

121
0:07:01.673,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the very important things that drew me to the movement to begin with:

122
0:07:05.906,000 --> 0:07:07,000
identity, community and purpose --

123
0:07:08.4,000 --> 0:07:11,000
things that I had been struggling with as a young boy.

124
0:07:11.938,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And now, I struggled with the concept of who I was again.

125
0:07:17.13,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger,

126
0:07:22.674,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or was I a caring father and husband?

127
0:07:26.932,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Was my community the one that I had manufactured around me

128
0:07:30.612,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to boost my own ego,

129
0:07:32.982,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because I felt self-hatred for myself and I wanted to project it onto others,

130
0:07:38.597,000 --> 0:07:42,000
or was it the one that I had physically given life to?

131
0:07:43.918,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Was my purpose to scorch the earth

132
0:07:48.134,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or was it to make it a better place for my family?

133
0:07:52.903,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And suddenly, like a ton of bricks hit me,

134
0:07:57.101,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I became very confused with who I'd been for the last eight years.

135
0:08:04.026,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And if only I'd been brave enough to walk away at that moment,

136
0:08:07.374,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to understand what the struggle was that was happening inside of me,

137
0:08:13.715,000 --> 0:08:16,000
then maybe tragedy could have been averted.

138
0:08:17.916,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Instead, I did compromise.

139
0:08:19.859,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I took myself off the streets for the benefit of my family,

140
0:08:23.228,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because I was nervous that maybe I could go to jail or end up dead,

141
0:08:27.228,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and they would have to fend for themselves.

142
0:08:30.086,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So I stepped back as a leader,

143
0:08:31.692,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and instead I opened a record store

144
0:08:35.092,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that I was going to sell white-power music in, of course,

145
0:08:39.267,000 --> 0:08:41,000
because I was importing it in from Europe.

146
0:08:42.409,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But I knew that if I was just a racist store selling racist music

147
0:08:46.569,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the community would not allow me to be there.

148
0:08:49.615,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So I decided I was going to also stock the shelves with other music,

149
0:08:54.288,000 --> 0:08:56,000
like punk rock and heavy metal

150
0:08:56.768,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and hip-hop.

151
0:08:58.925,000 --> 0:09:,000
And while the white-power music that I was selling

152
0:09:01.48,000 --> 0:09:03,000
was 75 percent of my gross revenue,

153
0:09:03.915,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because people were driving in from all over the country to buy it

154
0:09:07.257,000 --> 0:09:09,000
from the only store that was selling it,

155
0:09:10.435,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I also had customers come in to buy the other music.

156
0:09:15.222,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And eventually, they started to talk to me.

157
0:09:19.387,000 --> 0:09:23,000
One day, a young black teen came in,

158
0:09:23.866,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and he was visibly upset.

159
0:09:27.076,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And I decided to ask him what was wrong.

160
0:09:30.213,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And he told me that his mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

161
0:09:35.166,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And suddenly, this young black teenager,

162
0:09:38.716,000 --> 0:09:42,000
who I'd never had a meaningful conversation or interaction with,

163
0:09:43.305,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I was able to connect with,

164
0:09:45.048,000 --> 0:09:49,000
because my own mother had been diagnosed with breast cancer,

165
0:09:49.077,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and I could feel his pain.

166
0:09:52.712,000 --> 0:09:55,000
On another occasion, a gay couple came in with their son,

167
0:09:56.476,000 --> 0:10:,000
and it was undeniable to me that they loved their son

168
0:10:01.417,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in the same profound ways that I loved mine.

169
0:10:06.233,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And suddenly, I couldn't rationalize or justify the prejudice

170
0:10:11.101,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that I had in my head.

171
0:10:13.869,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I decided to pull the white-power music from the inventory

172
0:10:16.705,000 --> 0:10:19,000
when I became too embarrassed to sell it in front of my new friends.

173
0:10:20.929,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And of course, the store couldn't sustain itself,

174
0:10:23.308,000 --> 0:10:24,000
so I had to close it.

175
0:10:25.343,000 --> 0:10:29,000
At that same time, I lost nearly everything in my life.

176
0:10:30.484,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I used it as an opportunity to walk away

177
0:10:33.012,000 --> 0:10:35,000
from the movement that I'd been a part of for eight years,

178
0:10:35.894,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the only identity, community and purpose that I'd really known for most of my life.

179
0:10:40.949,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So I had nobody.

180
0:10:43.731,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I lost my livelihood because I closed the store.

181
0:10:46.351,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I didn't have a great relationship with my parents, even though they tried.

182
0:10:50.891,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And my wife and children left me,

183
0:10:52.912,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because I hadn't left the movement and disengaged quickly enough.

184
0:10:58.04,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And suddenly,

185
0:11:01.117,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I didn't know who I was again,

186
0:11:03.072,000 --> 0:11:04,000
or where I fit in

187
0:11:05.044,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or what my purpose was supposed to be.

188
0:11:08.034,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I was miserable inside,

189
0:11:10.959,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and I often woke up in the morning

190
0:11:13.938,000 --> 0:11:14,000
wishing that I hadn't.

191
0:11:17.59,000 --> 0:11:18,000
About five years in,

192
0:11:19.354,000 --> 0:11:22,000
one of the few friends that I had was concerned about my well-being,

193
0:11:23.224,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and she came to me and she said,

194
0:11:25.131,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"You need to do something, because I don't want to see you die."

195
0:11:29.982,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And she suggested that I go apply for a job where she worked,

196
0:11:33.634,000 --> 0:11:34,000
at a company called IBM.

197
0:11:37.158,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Yeah, I thought she was crazy, too.

198
0:11:39.235,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

199
0:11:40.944,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Here I was, a closeted ex-Nazi covered in hate tattoos.

200
0:11:45.543,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I didn't go to college.

201
0:11:46.799,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I'd been kicked out of multiple high schools multiple times.

202
0:11:52.071,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I didn't even own a computer.

203
0:11:55.384,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But I went in,

204
0:11:56.664,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and somehow, miraculously, I got the job.

205
0:12:01.636,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I was thrilled.

206
0:12:04.218,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And then I became terrified to learn

207
0:12:06.879,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that they'd actually be putting me back at my old high school,

208
0:12:10.464,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the same one I got kicked out of twice,

209
0:12:13.892,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to install their computers.

210
0:12:16.483,000 --> 0:12:19,000
This was a high school where I had committed acts of violence

211
0:12:20.014,000 --> 0:12:22,000
against students, against faculty;

212
0:12:22.49,000 --> 0:12:26,000
where I had protested out in front of the school for equal rights for whites

213
0:12:26.654,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria

214
0:12:29.757,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to try and demand a white student union.

215
0:12:34.039,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And of course, as karma would have it,

216
0:12:37.289,000 --> 0:12:38,000
within the first couple of hours,

217
0:12:39.676,000 --> 0:12:42,000
who walks right by me but Mr. Johnny Holmes,

218
0:12:43.622,000 --> 0:12:46,000
the tough black security guard I had gotten in a fistfight with,

219
0:12:48.016,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that got me kicked out the second time

220
0:12:50.08,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and led out in handcuffs from the school.

221
0:12:53.763,000 --> 0:12:54,000
He didn't recognize me,

222
0:12:56.251,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but I saw him,

223
0:12:58.404,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and I didn't know what to do.

224
0:12:59.83,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I was frozen; I was this grown man now, years out of the movement,

225
0:13:03.497,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and I was sweating and I was trembling.

226
0:13:06.533,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But I decided I had to do something.

227
0:13:09.902,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And I decided I needed to suffer under the weight of my past,

228
0:13:13.725,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because for five years I had tried to outrun it.

229
0:13:17.105,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I'd tried to make new friends and cover my tattoos with long sleeves,

230
0:13:20.433,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and I wouldn't admit it

231
0:13:21.624,000 --> 0:13:22,000
because I was afraid of being judged

232
0:13:23.47,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the same way I had judged other people.

233
0:13:26.862,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Well, I decided I was going to chase Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot --

234
0:13:30.87,000 --> 0:13:32,000
probably not the smartest decision that I made.

235
0:13:33.397,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Laughter)

236
0:13:34.692,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But when I found him, he was getting into his car,

237
0:13:37.23,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and I tapped him on the shoulder.

238
0:13:39.227,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And when he turned around and he recognized me,

239
0:13:42.407,000 --> 0:13:44,000
he took a step back because he was afraid.

240
0:13:46.907,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And I didn't know what to say.

241
0:13:50.088,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Finally, the words came out of my mouth, and all I could think to say was,

242
0:13:54.152,000 --> 0:13:55,000
"I'm sorry."

243
0:13:56.096,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And he embraced me,

244
0:13:58.391,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and he forgave me.

245
0:14:01.877,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And he encouraged me to forgive myself.

246
0:14:06.073,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He recognized that it wasn't the story of some broken go-nowhere kid

247
0:14:12.187,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who was going to just join a gang and go to prison.

248
0:14:15.227,000 --> 0:14:19,000
He knew that this was the story of every young person who was vulnerable,

249
0:14:19.774,000 --> 0:14:21,000
who was searching for identity, community and purpose,

250
0:14:22.606,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and then hit a wall

251
0:14:24.036,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and was unable to find it

252
0:14:25.782,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and went down a dark path.

253
0:14:29.482,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And he made me promise one thing,

254
0:14:31.599,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that I would tell my story to whoever would listen.

255
0:14:34.851,000 --> 0:14:35,000
That was 18 years ago,

256
0:14:36.457,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I've been doing it ever since.

257
0:14:38.737,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Applause)

258
0:14:49.309,000 --> 0:14:5,000
You might be asking yourself right now:

259
0:14:51.301,000 --> 0:14:54,000
How does a good kid from a hardworking immigrant family

260
0:14:54.347,000 --> 0:14:56,000
end up going down such a dark path?

261
0:14:57.214,000 --> 0:14:59,000
One word: potholes.

262
0:15:00.508,000 --> 0:15:01,000
That's right. Potholes.

263
0:15:02.25,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I had a lot of potholes when I was kid.

264
0:15:05.582,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We all had them --

265
0:15:07.151,000 --> 0:15:09,000
you know, the things in life that we hit

266
0:15:10.045,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that invariably just kind of nudge us off our path,

267
0:15:12.995,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and if they remain unresolved

268
0:15:15.442,000 --> 0:15:16,000
or untreated

269
0:15:17.697,000 --> 0:15:18,000
or not dealt with,

270
0:15:19.792,000 --> 0:15:22,000
sometimes we can get dangerously lost down pretty dark corridors.

271
0:15:24.228,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Potholes can be things like trauma,

272
0:15:26.435,000 --> 0:15:28,000
abuse, unemployment,

273
0:15:29.667,000 --> 0:15:3,000
neglect,

274
0:15:31.652,000 --> 0:15:33,000
untreated mental health conditions,

275
0:15:33.868,000 --> 0:15:34,000
even privilege.

276
0:15:35.942,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And if we hit enough potholes on our journey in life,

277
0:15:39.696,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and we don't have the resources or the help to navigate around them

278
0:15:43.46,000 --> 0:15:44,000
or to pull us out,

279
0:15:46.184,000 --> 0:15:49,000
well, sometimes good people end up doing bad things.

280
0:15:52.026,000 --> 0:15:55,000
One such person who had potholes is Darrell.

281
0:15:55.189,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Darrell is from upstate New York.

282
0:15:57.495,000 --> 0:15:59,000
He had read my memoir,

283
0:15:59.644,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and he was really upset about the ending.

284
0:16:02.365,000 --> 0:16:03,000
You see, I'd gotten out of the movement

285
0:16:04.295,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and he was still in.

286
0:16:05.749,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And he emailed me and he said,

287
0:16:09.48,000 --> 0:16:11,000
"I didn't really like the way that turned out."

288
0:16:11.842,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And I said, "Well, I'm sorry."

289
0:16:13.58,000 --> 0:16:14,000
(Laughter)

290
0:16:15.233,000 --> 0:16:17,000
"But if you want to talk about it, we could certainly do that."

291
0:16:18.248,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And after a couple of weeks of going back and forth with Darrell,

292
0:16:21.49,000 --> 0:16:26,000
I learned he was a 31-year-old military veteran who had been injured

293
0:16:26.594,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and was really angry about not being able to go to Afghanistan

294
0:16:30.357,000 --> 0:16:31,000
to kill Muslims.

295
0:16:32.741,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And one day on the phone,

296
0:16:34.09,000 --> 0:16:38,000
he told me that he had seen a Muslim man in the park praying,

297
0:16:38.303,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and that all he wanted to do was kick him in the face.

298
0:16:43.377,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I flew to Buffalo the next day,

299
0:16:45.968,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and I sat down with Darrell,

300
0:16:48.515,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and I asked him,

301
0:16:50.343,000 --> 0:16:53,000
"Have you ever met a Muslim person before?"

302
0:16:54.168,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And he said, "No!

303
0:16:55.738,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Why the hell would I want to do that?

304
0:16:57.593,000 --> 0:16:59,000
They're evil. I don't want anything to do with them."

305
0:17:01.067,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I said, "OK."

306
0:17:02.521,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So I excused myself, and I went into the bathroom

307
0:17:04.967,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and I took my phone out in the bathroom,

308
0:17:07.225,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and I Googled the local mosque,

309
0:17:09.977,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and I called them very quietly from the bathroom,

310
0:17:12.288,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and I said, "Excuse me, imam, I need a favor.

311
0:17:16.27,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I have a Christian man

312
0:17:17.445,000 --> 0:17:19,000
who would really love to learn more about your religion."

313
0:17:20.275,000 --> 0:17:22,000
(Laughter)

314
0:17:22.984,000 --> 0:17:23,000
"Do you mind if we stop by?"

315
0:17:26.278,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Well, it took some convincing for Darrell to go,

316
0:17:29.016,000 --> 0:17:31,000
but finally we got there,

317
0:17:31.042,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and when I knocked on the door,

318
0:17:32.572,000 --> 0:17:35,000
the imam said he only had 15 minutes left for us,

319
0:17:35.686,000 --> 0:17:37,000
because he was preparing for a prayer service.

320
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I said, "We'll take it."

321
0:17:40.252,000 --> 0:17:41,000
We went in,

322
0:17:41.434,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and two and a half hours later, we came out after hugging and crying

323
0:17:46.641,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and, very strangely, bonding over Chuck Norris for some reason.

324
0:17:50.637,000 --> 0:17:51,000
(Laughter)

325
0:17:51.711,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I don't know what it was about that,

326
0:17:53.667,000 --> 0:17:54,000
but that's what happened.

327
0:17:56.459,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And I'm happy to say now that Darrell and the imam,

328
0:17:59.583,000 --> 0:18:01,000
you can often find them at the local falafel stand,

329
0:18:02.043,000 --> 0:18:03,000
having lunch together.

330
0:18:03.682,000 --> 0:18:06,000
(Applause)

331
0:18:12.418,000 --> 0:18:14,000
You see, it's our disconnection from each other.

332
0:18:14.983,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Hatred is born of ignorance.

333
0:18:17.25,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Fear is its father, and isolation is its mother.

334
0:18:21.353,000 --> 0:18:24,000
When we don't understand something, we tend to be afraid of it,

335
0:18:25.354,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and if we keep ourselves from it,

336
0:18:27.097,000 --> 0:18:3,000
that fear grows, and sometimes, it turns into hatred.

337
0:18:31.12,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Since I've left the movement, I've helped over a hundred people

338
0:18:34.143,000 --> 0:18:37,000
disengage from extremist movements, from white supremacist groups --

339
0:18:37.485,000 --> 0:18:4,000
(Applause)

340
0:18:46.278,000 --> 0:18:47,000
to even jihadist groups.

341
0:18:47.828,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And the way I do that is not by arguing with them,

342
0:18:52.409,000 --> 0:18:53,000
not by debating them,

343
0:18:53.95,000 --> 0:18:55,000
not by even telling them they're wrong,

344
0:18:56.263,000 --> 0:18:58,000
even though, boy, I want to sometimes.

345
0:18:58.52,000 --> 0:18:59,000
I don't do that.

346
0:19:00.334,000 --> 0:19:02,000
Instead, I don't push them away.

347
0:19:02.886,000 --> 0:19:03,000
I draw them in closer,

348
0:19:05.22,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and I listen very closely for their potholes,

349
0:19:10.345,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and then I begin to fill them in.

350
0:19:12.657,000 --> 0:19:14,000
I try to make people more resilient,

351
0:19:14.937,000 --> 0:19:15,000
more self-confident,

352
0:19:16.841,000 --> 0:19:2,000
more able to have skills to compete in the marketplace

353
0:19:20.894,000 --> 0:19:22,000
so that they don't have to blame the other,

354
0:19:24.764,000 --> 0:19:25,000
the other that they've never met.

355
0:19:27.758,000 --> 0:19:3,000
I'd like to just leave you with one last thing before I go.

356
0:19:32.915,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Of all the people I've worked with, they will all tell you the same thing.

357
0:19:36.462,000 --> 0:19:39,000
One, they became extremists

358
0:19:40.078,000 --> 0:19:43,000
because they wanted to belong, not because of ideology or dogma.

359
0:19:44.787,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And second, what brought them out

360
0:19:48.29,000 --> 0:19:49,000
was receiving compassion

361
0:19:50.216,000 --> 0:19:52,000
from the people they least deserved it from,

362
0:19:53.247,000 --> 0:19:54,000
when they least deserved it.

363
0:19:54.924,000 --> 0:19:56,000
(Applause)

364
0:19:57.045,000 --> 0:19:59,000
So I would like to leave you with a challenge:

365
0:19:59.801,000 --> 0:20:02,000
go out there today, tomorrow -- hopefully every day --

366
0:20:04.052,000 --> 0:20:08,000
find somebody that you think is undeserving of your compassion

367
0:20:08.748,000 --> 0:20:09,000
and give it to them,

368
0:20:10.694,000 --> 0:20:11,000
because I guarantee you,

369
0:20:12.107,000 --> 0:20:13,000
they're the ones who need it the most.

370
0:20:14.554,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Thank you very much.

371
0:20:15.89,000 --> 0:20:16,000
(Applause)

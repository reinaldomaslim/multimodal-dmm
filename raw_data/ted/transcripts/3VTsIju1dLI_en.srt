1
0:00:13.397,000 --> 0:00:15,000
First of all, thank you for your attention.

2
0:00:16.881,000 --> 0:00:19,000
There's nothing quite like being in a room full of people like this,

3
0:00:20.111,000 --> 0:00:23,000
where all of you are giving your attention to me.

4
0:00:23.165,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a powerful feeling, to get attention.

5
0:00:28.204,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm an actor, so I'm a bit of an expert on, well, nothing, really.

6
0:00:33.391,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:34.566,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But I do know what it feels like to get attention --

8
0:00:37.054,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I've been lucky in my life

9
0:00:38.373,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to get a lot more than my fair share of attention.

10
0:00:40.807,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I'm grateful for that,

11
0:00:42.53,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because like I said, it's a powerful feeling.

12
0:00:46.95,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But there's another powerful feeling

13
0:00:49.264,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that I've also been lucky to experience a lot as an actor.

14
0:00:52.653,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And it's funny, it's sort of the opposite feeling,

15
0:00:55.034,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because it doesn't come from getting attention.

16
0:00:57.549,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It comes from paying attention.

17
0:01:00.831,000 --> 0:01:01,000
When I'm acting,

18
0:01:02.625,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I get so focused that I'm only paying attention to one thing.

19
0:01:07.045,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Like when I'm on set and we're about to shoot

20
0:01:10.379,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and the first AD calls out "Rolling!"

21
0:01:13.053,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And then I hear "speed," "marker," "set,"

22
0:01:15.458,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and then the director calls "Action!"

23
0:01:18.053,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I've heard that sequence so many times,

24
0:01:20.081,000 --> 0:01:23,000
like, it's become this Pavlovian magic spell for me.

25
0:01:23.735,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"Rolling," "speed," "marker," "set" and "action."

26
0:01:27.377,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Something happens to me, I can't even help it.

27
0:01:30.465,000 --> 0:01:31,000
My attention ...

28
0:01:33.389,000 --> 0:01:34,000
narrows.

29
0:01:34.572,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And everything else in the world,

30
0:01:36.564,000 --> 0:01:41,000
anything else that might be bothering me or might grab my attention,

31
0:01:42.361,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it all goes away, and I'm just ... there.

32
0:01:48.347,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And that feeling, that is what I love,

33
0:01:52.578,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that, to me, is creativity.

34
0:01:53.949,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And that's the biggest reason I'm so grateful that I get to be an actor.

35
0:01:58.276,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So, there's these two powerful feelings.

36
0:02:01.843,000 --> 0:02:04,000
There's getting attention and paying attention.

37
0:02:06.137,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Of course, in the last decade or so,

38
0:02:07.939,000 --> 0:02:09,000
new technology has allowed more and more people

39
0:02:10.18,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to have this powerful feeling of getting attention.

40
0:02:14.228,000 --> 0:02:16,000
For any kind of creative expression, not just acting.

41
0:02:16.736,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It could be writing or photography or drawing, music -- everything.

42
0:02:20.35,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The channels of distribution have been democratized,

43
0:02:23.874,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that's a good thing.

44
0:02:27.43,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But I do think there's an unintended consequence

45
0:02:30.215,000 --> 0:02:35,000
for anybody on the planet with an urge to be creative --

46
0:02:35.35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
myself included, because I'm not immune to this.

47
0:02:39.284,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I think that our creativity

48
0:02:42.347,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is becoming more and more of a means to an end --

49
0:02:47.371,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and that end is to get attention.

50
0:02:51.561,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And so I feel compelled to speak up

51
0:02:53.316,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because in my experience,

52
0:02:56.069,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the more I go after that powerful feeling of paying attention,

53
0:02:59.49,000 --> 0:03:,000
the happier I am.

54
0:03:01.688,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But the more I go after the powerful feeling of getting attention,

55
0:03:06.752,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the unhappier I am.

56
0:03:08.331,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(One person claps)

57
0:03:09.513,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And -- thanks.

58
0:03:11.63,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:13.604,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Applause)

60
0:03:18.257,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So this is something that goes way back for me.

61
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I think the first time I can remember using my acting to get attention,

62
0:03:26.292,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I was eight years old at summer camp.

63
0:03:28.95,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I'd been going on auditions for about a year by then,

64
0:03:31.649,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and I'd been lucky to get some small parts

65
0:03:33.974,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in TV shows and commercials,

66
0:03:35.792,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and I bragged about it a lot, that summer at camp.

67
0:03:40.663,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And at first, it worked.

68
0:03:42.942,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The other kids gave me a bunch of extra attention,

69
0:03:45.673,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because I had been on "Family Ties."

70
0:03:48.506,000 --> 0:03:49,000
That's a picture of me on "Family Ties."

71
0:03:50.457,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:51.504,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Then, the tide turned --

73
0:03:52.99,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I think I took it too far with the bragging.

74
0:03:55.085,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And then, the other kids started to make fun of me.

75
0:03:59.676,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I remember there was this one girl I had a crush on, Rocky.

76
0:04:04.517,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Her name was Rachel, she went by Rocky.

77
0:04:07.045,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And she was beautiful, and she could sing,

78
0:04:09.711,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I was smitten with her, and I was standing there, bragging.

79
0:04:13.72,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And she turned to me and she called me a show-off.

80
0:04:16.641,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Which I 100 percent deserved.

81
0:04:19.149,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But you know, it still really hurt.

82
0:04:22.056,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And ever since that summer,

83
0:04:24.191,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I've had a certain hesitance to seek attention for my acting.

84
0:04:29.517,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Sometimes, people would ask me,

85
0:04:31.305,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Wait a minute, if you don't like the attention,

86
0:04:33.583,000 --> 0:04:34,000
then why are you an actor?"

87
0:04:34.9,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And I'd be like,

88
0:04:36.097,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"Because that's not what acting's about, man, it's about the art."

89
0:04:39.296,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And they'd be like, "OK, OK, dude."

90
0:04:41.006,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:43.038,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And then Twitter came out.

92
0:04:45.125,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And I got totally hooked on it, just like everybody else,

93
0:04:47.824,000 --> 0:04:48,000
which made me into a complete hypocrite.

94
0:04:49.792,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Because at that point,

95
0:04:50.991,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I was absolutely using my acting to get attention.

96
0:04:53.594,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I mean, what, did I think I was just getting all these followers

97
0:04:56.966,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because of my brilliant tweets?

98
0:04:59.625,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I actually did think that -- I was like --

99
0:05:01.704,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:02.736,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"They don't just like me because they saw me in 'Batman,'

101
0:05:05.505,000 --> 0:05:07,000
they like what I have to say, I've got a way with words."

102
0:05:08.299,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:09.982,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And then in no time at all,

104
0:05:11.307,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it started having an impact on my dearly beloved creative process.

105
0:05:16.504,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It still does.

106
0:05:17.701,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I try not to let it.

107
0:05:19.257,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But you know, I'd be sitting there, like, reading a script.

108
0:05:23.306,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And instead of thinking,

109
0:05:25.146,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"How can I personally identify with this character?"

110
0:05:27.646,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Or "How is the audience going to relate to this story?"

111
0:05:30.591,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I'm like, "What are people going to say about this movie on Twitter?"

112
0:05:33.884,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And "What will I say back

113
0:05:35.176,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that will be good and snarky enough to get a lot of retweets,

114
0:05:38.141,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but not too harsh,

115
0:05:39.327,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because people love to get offended, and I don't want to get canceled?"

116
0:05:42.747,000 --> 0:05:44,000
These are the thoughts that enter my mind

117
0:05:44.78,000 --> 0:05:47,000
when I'm supposed to be reading a script, trying to be an artist.

118
0:05:47.866,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And I'm not here to tell you

119
0:05:49.308,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that technology is the enemy of creativity.

120
0:05:51.701,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I don't think that.

121
0:05:52.892,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I think tech is just a tool.

122
0:05:54.28,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It has the potential to foster unprecedented human creativity.

123
0:05:58.228,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Like, I even started an online community called HITRECORD,

124
0:06:01.867,000 --> 0:06:02,000
where people all over the world

125
0:06:03.411,000 --> 0:06:05,000
collaborate on all kinds of creative projects,

126
0:06:05.589,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so I don't think that social media or smartphones or any technology

127
0:06:10.825,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is problematic in and of itself.

128
0:06:14.62,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But ...

129
0:06:16.705,000 --> 0:06:18,000
if we're going to talk about the perils of creativity

130
0:06:19.41,000 --> 0:06:21,000
becoming a means to get attention,

131
0:06:21.751,000 --> 0:06:25,000
then we have to talk about the attention-driven business model

132
0:06:26.116,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of today's big social media companies, right?

133
0:06:28.253,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Applause)

134
0:06:31.348,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This will be familiar territory for some of you,

135
0:06:33.617,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but it's a really relevant question here:

136
0:06:35.626,000 --> 0:06:36,000
How does a social media platform

137
0:06:37.244,000 --> 0:06:39,000
like, for example, Instagram, make money?

138
0:06:40.649,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's not selling a photo-sharing service --

139
0:06:42.763,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that part's free.

140
0:06:43.96,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So what is it selling?

141
0:06:45.159,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It's selling attention.

142
0:06:46.341,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It's selling the attention of its users to advertisers.

143
0:06:48.989,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And there's a lot of discussion right now

144
0:06:50.966,000 --> 0:06:53,000
about how much attention we're all giving to things like Instagram,

145
0:06:54.706,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but my question is:

146
0:06:55.974,000 --> 0:06:57,000
How is Instagram getting so much attention?

147
0:06:59.934,000 --> 0:07:,000
We get it for them.

148
0:07:02.141,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Anytime somebody posts on Instagram,

149
0:07:05.101,000 --> 0:07:07,000
they get a certain amount of attention from their followers,

150
0:07:07.943,000 --> 0:07:09,000
whether they have a few followers or a few million followers.

151
0:07:10.831,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And the more attention you're able to get,

152
0:07:13.927,000 --> 0:07:15,000
the more attention Instagram is able to sell.

153
0:07:16.74,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So it's in Instagram's interest

154
0:07:19.065,000 --> 0:07:21,000
for you to get as much attention as possible.

155
0:07:22.256,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And so it trains you to want that attention,

156
0:07:25.682,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to crave it, to feel stressed out when you're not getting enough of it.

157
0:07:30.457,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Instagram gets its users addicted

158
0:07:34.005,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to the powerful feeling of getting attention.

159
0:07:38.053,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And I know we all joke, like, "Oh my God, I'm so addicted to my phone,"

160
0:07:41.499,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but this is a real addiction.

161
0:07:43.292,000 --> 0:07:44,000
There's a whole science to it.

162
0:07:44.783,000 --> 0:07:46,000
If you're curious, I recommend the work of Jaron Lanier,

163
0:07:47.505,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Tristan Harris, Nir Eyal.

164
0:07:50.513,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But here's what I can tell you.

165
0:07:52.712,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Being addicted to getting attention

166
0:07:55.466,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is just like being addicted to anything else.

167
0:07:58.028,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's never enough.

168
0:07:59.845,000 --> 0:08:,000
You start out and you're thinking,

169
0:08:01.608,000 --> 0:08:05,000
"If only I had 1,000 followers, that would feel amazing."

170
0:08:05.705,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But then you're like, "Well, once I get to 10,000 followers,"

171
0:08:09.109,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and, "Once I get to 100 --

172
0:08:11.42,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Once I get to a million followers, then I'll feel amazing."

173
0:08:18.389,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I have 4.2 million followers on Twitter --

174
0:08:21.436,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it's never made me feel amazing.

175
0:08:23.365,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I'm not going to tell you how many I have on Instagram,

176
0:08:26.001,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because I feel genuine shame about how low the number is,

177
0:08:29.314,000 --> 0:08:31,000
because I joined Instagram after "Batman" came out.

178
0:08:32.306,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:35.798,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And I search other actors,

180
0:08:37.064,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and I see that their number is higher than mine,

181
0:08:39.347,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and it makes me feel terrible about myself.

182
0:08:42.45,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Because the follower count

183
0:08:44.625,000 --> 0:08:46,000
makes everybody feel terrible about themselves.

184
0:08:47.046,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That feeling of inadequacy is what drives you to post,

185
0:08:50.188,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so you can get more attention,

186
0:08:51.736,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and then that attention that you get is what these companies sell,

187
0:08:54.885,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that's how they make their money.

188
0:08:58.067,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So there is no amount of attention you can get

189
0:09:01.702,000 --> 0:09:03,000
where you feel like you've arrived,

190
0:09:04.002,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and you're like, "Ah, I'm good now."

191
0:09:07.992,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And of course, there are a lot of actors who are more famous than I am,

192
0:09:11.738,000 --> 0:09:12,000
have more followers than I do,

193
0:09:13.253,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but I bet you they would tell you the same thing.

194
0:09:15.625,000 --> 0:09:19,000
If your creativity is driven by a desire to get attention,

195
0:09:20.577,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you're never going to be creatively fulfilled.

196
0:09:25.123,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But I do have some good news.

197
0:09:28.457,000 --> 0:09:31,000
There is this other powerful feeling.

198
0:09:32.29,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Something else you can do with your attention

199
0:09:34.474,000 --> 0:09:36,000
besides letting a giant tech company control it and sell it.

200
0:09:38.347,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is that feeling I was talking about,

201
0:09:40.331,000 --> 0:09:41,000
why I love acting so much --

202
0:09:41.742,000 --> 0:09:44,000
it's being able to pay attention to just one thing.

203
0:09:47.331,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Turns out there's actually some science behind this too.

204
0:09:50.369,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Psychologists and neuroscientists --

205
0:09:52.195,000 --> 0:09:54,000
they study a phenomenon they call flow,

206
0:09:54.639,000 --> 0:09:56,000
which is this thing that happens in the human brain

207
0:09:57.068,000 --> 0:09:59,000
when someone pays attention to just one thing,

208
0:09:59.25,000 --> 0:10:,000
like something creative,

209
0:10:00.784,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and manages not to get distracted by anything else.

210
0:10:04.958,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And some say the more regularly you do this, the happier you'll be.

211
0:10:10.498,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Now I'm not a psychologist or a neuroscientist.

212
0:10:13.554,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But I can tell you, for me, that is very true.

213
0:10:17.498,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's not always easy, it's hard.

214
0:10:19.593,000 --> 0:10:21,000
To really pay attention like this takes practice,

215
0:10:22.315,000 --> 0:10:23,000
everybody does it their own way.

216
0:10:23.903,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But if there's one thing I can share

217
0:10:25.82,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that I think helps me focus and really pay attention, it's this:

218
0:10:30.958,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I try not to see other creative people as my competitors.

219
0:10:36.121,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I try to find collaborators.

220
0:10:38.224,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Like, if I'm acting in a scene,

221
0:10:40.827,000 --> 0:10:43,000
if I start seeing the other actors as my competitors, and I'm like,

222
0:10:43.994,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"God, they're going to get more attention than I am,

223
0:10:46.487,000 --> 0:10:49,000
people are going to be talking about their performance more than mine" --

224
0:10:49.968,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I've lost my focus.

225
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And I'm probably going to suck in that scene.

226
0:10:53.474,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But when I see the other actors as collaborators,

227
0:10:57.403,000 --> 0:11:,000
then it becomes almost easy to focus,

228
0:11:01.177,000 --> 0:11:03,000
because I'm just paying attention to them.

229
0:11:04.641,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And I don't have to think about what I'm doing --

230
0:11:06.963,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I react to what they're doing,

231
0:11:08.43,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they react to what I'm doing,

232
0:11:09.87,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and we can kind of keep each other in it together.

233
0:11:12.522,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But I don't want you to think it's only actors on a set

234
0:11:15.19,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that can collaborate in this way.

235
0:11:16.826,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I could be in whatever kind of creative situation.

236
0:11:19.256,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It could be professional, could be just for fun.

237
0:11:22.636,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I could be collaborating with people I'm not even in the same room with.

238
0:11:26.525,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In fact, some of my favorite things I've ever made,

239
0:11:29.021,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I made with people that I never physically met.

240
0:11:31.316,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And by the way,

241
0:11:32.506,000 --> 0:11:34,000
this, to me, is the beauty of the internet.

242
0:11:35.487,000 --> 0:11:38,000
If we could just stop competing for attention,

243
0:11:38.665,000 --> 0:11:41,000
then the internet becomes a great place to find collaborators.

244
0:11:43.411,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And once I'm collaborating with other people,

245
0:11:48.061,000 --> 0:11:5,000
whether they're on set, or online, wherever,

246
0:11:51.553,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that makes it so much easier for me to find that flow,

247
0:11:54.926,000 --> 0:11:56,000
because we're all just paying attention

248
0:11:57.323,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to the one thing that we're making together.

249
0:12:00.104,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And I fell like I'm part of something larger than myself,

250
0:12:03.807,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and we all sort of shield each other

251
0:12:06.1,000 --> 0:12:09,000
from anything else that might otherwise grab our attention,

252
0:12:09.466,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and we can all just be there.

253
0:12:15.763,000 --> 0:12:17,000
At least that's what works for me.

254
0:12:19.486,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Sometimes.

255
0:12:20.795,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Sometimes -- it doesn't always work.

256
0:12:22.546,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Sometimes, I still totally get wrapped up in that addictive cycle

257
0:12:25.688,000 --> 0:12:26,000
of wanting to get attention.

258
0:12:27.118,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I mean, like, even right now,

259
0:12:29.045,000 --> 0:12:33,000
can I honestly say there's not some part of me here who's like,

260
0:12:33.074,000 --> 0:12:35,000
"Hey, everybody, look at me, I'm giving a TED Talk!"

261
0:12:35.947,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Laughter)

262
0:12:37.217,000 --> 0:12:39,000
There is -- there's, you know, some part.

263
0:12:40.629,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But I can also honestly say

264
0:12:42.47,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that this whole creative process of writing and giving this talk,

265
0:12:45.919,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it's been a huge opportunity for me to focus

266
0:12:48.557,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and really pay attention to something I care a lot about.

267
0:12:52.802,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So regardless of how much attention I do or don't get as a result,

268
0:12:58.421,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I'm happy I did it.

269
0:13:00.236,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And I'm grateful to all of you for letting me.

270
0:13:04.593,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So thank you, that's it,

271
0:13:06.635,000 --> 0:13:08,000
you can give your attention to someone else now.

272
0:13:08.921,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Thanks again.

273
0:13:10.095,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Applause)

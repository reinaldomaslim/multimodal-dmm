1
0:00:12.724,000 --> 0:00:14,000
If there's any power in design,

2
0:00:15.428,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that's the power of synthesis.

3
0:00:17.771,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The more complex the problem,

4
0:00:19.466,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the more the need for simplicity.

5
0:00:21.967,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So allow me to share three cases

6
0:00:24.304,000 --> 0:00:25,000
where we tried to apply

7
0:00:26.114,000 --> 0:00:29,000
design's power of synthesis.

8
0:00:29.117,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Let's start with the global challenge of urbanization.

9
0:00:33.218,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's a fact that people are moving towards cities.

10
0:00:36.896,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and even if counterintuitive, it's good news.

11
0:00:40.361,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Evidence shows that people are better off in cities.

12
0:00:44.444,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But there's a problem that I would call

13
0:00:46.593,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the "3S" menace:

14
0:00:48.899,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The scale, speed, and scarcity of means

15
0:00:51.632,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with which we will have to respond to this phenomenon

16
0:00:54.827,000 --> 0:00:56,000
has no precedence in history.

17
0:00:57.465,000 --> 0:00:58,000
For you to have an idea,

18
0:00:58.654,000 --> 0:01:01,000
out of the three billion people living in cities today,

19
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:04,000
one billion are under the line of poverty.

20
0:01:05.271,000 --> 0:01:08,000
By 2030, out of the five billion people

21
0:01:09.21,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that will be living in cities,

22
0:01:11.48,000 --> 0:01:14,000
two billion are going to be under the line of poverty.

23
0:01:14.837,000 --> 0:01:18,000
That means that we will have to build

24
0:01:21.605,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a one million-person city per week

25
0:01:30.114,000 --> 0:01:35,000
with 10,000 dollars per family

26
0:01:35.672,000 --> 0:01:36,000
during the next 15 years.

27
0:01:37.482,000 --> 0:01:39,000
A one million-person city per week

28
0:01:40.206,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with 10,000 dollars per family.

29
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
If we don't solve this equation,

30
0:01:43.995,000 --> 0:01:45,000
it is not that people will stop coming to cities.

31
0:01:46.043,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They will come anyhow,

32
0:01:47.952,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but they will live in slums, favelas

33
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and informal settlements.

34
0:01:52.368,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So what to do? Well, an answer may come

35
0:01:55.246,000 --> 0:01:59,000
from favelas and slums themselves.

36
0:01:59.84,000 --> 0:02:02,000
A clue could be in this question we were asked

37
0:02:03.433,000 --> 0:02:04,000
10 years ago.

38
0:02:04.89,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We were asked to accommodate 100 families

39
0:02:08.521,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that had been occupying illegally

40
0:02:10.939,000 --> 0:02:12,000
half a hectare in the center

41
0:02:13.234,000 --> 0:02:15,000
of the city of Iquique in the north of Chile

42
0:02:16.134,000 --> 0:02:18,000
using a $10,000 subsidy

43
0:02:19.062,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with which we had to buy the land,

44
0:02:22.176,000 --> 0:02:23,000
provide the infrastructure,

45
0:02:23.909,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and build the houses that, in the best of the cases,

46
0:02:27.23,000 --> 0:02:3,000
would be of around 40 square meters.

47
0:02:30.894,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And by the way, they said,

48
0:02:33.099,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the cost of the land,

49
0:02:34.75,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because it's in the center of the city,

50
0:02:36.806,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is three times more

51
0:02:38.55,000 --> 0:02:41,000
than what social housing can normally afford.

52
0:02:42.108,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Due to the difficulty of the question,

53
0:02:44.334,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we decided to include the families

54
0:02:46.516,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in the process of understanding the constraints,

55
0:02:50.612,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and we started a participatory design process,

56
0:02:53.193,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and testing what was available there in the market.

57
0:02:56.84,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Detached houses,

58
0:02:58.538,000 --> 0:03:,000
30 families could be accommodated.

59
0:03:01.494,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Row houses, 60 families.

60
0:03:05.456,000 --> 0:03:08,000
["100 families"] The only way to accommodate all of them

61
0:03:08.598,000 --> 0:03:1,000
was by building in height,

62
0:03:10.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and they threatened us

63
0:03:12.552,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to go on a hunger strike

64
0:03:14.86,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if we even dared to offer this

65
0:03:17.158,000 --> 0:03:18,000
as a solution,

66
0:03:18.584,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because they could not make the tiny apartments

67
0:03:21.655,000 --> 0:03:22,000
expand.

68
0:03:23.109,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So the conclusion with the families —

69
0:03:25.798,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and this is important, not our conclusion —

70
0:03:27.676,000 --> 0:03:29,000
with the families, was that we had a problem.

71
0:03:30.207,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We had to innovate.

72
0:03:31.945,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So what did we do?

73
0:03:35.72,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Well, a middle-class family

74
0:03:39.619,000 --> 0:03:41,000
lives reasonably well

75
0:03:42.499,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in around 80 square meters,

76
0:03:44.85,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but when there's no money,

77
0:03:46.522,000 --> 0:03:47,000
what the market does

78
0:03:47.864,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is to reduce the size of the house

79
0:03:52.122,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to 40 square meters.

80
0:03:54.971,000 --> 0:03:55,000
What we said was,

81
0:03:56.719,000 --> 0:03:58,000
what if,

82
0:04:00.845,000 --> 0:04:04,000
instead of thinking of 40 square meters

83
0:04:05.378,000 --> 0:04:07,000
as a small house,

84
0:04:08.059,000 --> 0:04:1,000
why don't we consider it

85
0:04:10.385,000 --> 0:04:12,000
half of a good one?

86
0:04:13.191,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When you rephrase the problem

87
0:04:14.958,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as half of a good house

88
0:04:17.664,000 --> 0:04:18,000
instead of a small one,

89
0:04:19.299,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the key question is, which half do we do?

90
0:04:22.508,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And we thought we had to do with public money

91
0:04:25.21,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the half that families won't be able to do individually.

92
0:04:30.619,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We identified five design conditions

93
0:04:33.147,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that belonged to the hard half of a house,

94
0:04:35.505,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and we went back to the families to do two things:

95
0:04:38.601,000 --> 0:04:41,000
join forces and split tasks.

96
0:04:42.6,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Our design was something in between

97
0:04:45.584,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a building and a house.

98
0:04:48.265,000 --> 0:04:5,000
As a building, it could pay

99
0:04:50.357,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for expensive, well-located land,

100
0:04:53.349,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and as a house, it could expand.

101
0:04:56.97,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If, in the process of not being expelled

102
0:04:59.554,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to the periphery while getting a house,

103
0:05:01.92,000 --> 0:05:03,000
families kept their network and their jobs,

104
0:05:04.733,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we knew that the expansion would begin right away.

105
0:05:08.98,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So we went from this initial social housing

106
0:05:13.536,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to a middle-class unit achieved by families themselves

107
0:05:17.93,000 --> 0:05:19,000
within a couple of weeks.

108
0:05:20.666,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This was our first project

109
0:05:22.439,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in Iquique 10 years ago.

110
0:05:24.766,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is our last project in Chile.

111
0:05:28.243,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Different designs, same principle:

112
0:05:31.194,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You provide the frame,

113
0:05:32.76,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and from then on, families take over.

114
0:05:36.598,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So the purpose of design,

115
0:05:40.698,000 --> 0:05:43,000
trying to understand and trying to give an answer

116
0:05:43.708,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to the "3S" menace,

117
0:05:45.36,000 --> 0:05:46,000
scale, speed, and scarcity,

118
0:05:46.826,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is to channel people's own building capacity.

119
0:05:50.309,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We won't solve the one million people per week equation

120
0:05:54.714,000 --> 0:05:58,000
unless we use people's own power for building.

121
0:05:59.399,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So, with the right design,

122
0:06:01.634,000 --> 0:06:04,000
slums and favelas may not be the problem

123
0:06:05.035,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but actually the only possible solution.

124
0:06:08.784,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The second case is how design can contribute

125
0:06:11.819,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to sustainability.

126
0:06:13.871,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In 2012, we entered the competition

127
0:06:16.264,000 --> 0:06:18,000
for the Angelini Innovation Center,

128
0:06:18.83,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the aim was to build

129
0:06:20.842,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the right environment for knowledge creation.

130
0:06:25.176,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It is accepted that for such an aim,

131
0:06:27.66,000 --> 0:06:28,000
knowledge creation,

132
0:06:29.196,000 --> 0:06:31,000
interaction among people, face-to-face contact,

133
0:06:31.783,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it's important, and we agreed on that.

134
0:06:33.98,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But for us, the question of the right environment

135
0:06:37.556,000 --> 0:06:39,000
was a very literal question.

136
0:06:39.722,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We wanted to have a working space

137
0:06:41.842,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with the right light, with the right temperature,

138
0:06:44.595,000 --> 0:06:45,000
with the right air.

139
0:06:46.477,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So we asked ourselves:

140
0:06:48.555,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Does the typical office building

141
0:06:51.145,000 --> 0:06:53,000
help us in that sense?

142
0:06:53.256,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Well, how does that building look, typically?

143
0:06:56.87,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's a collection of floors,

144
0:06:59.454,000 --> 0:07:,000
one on top of each other,

145
0:07:01.361,000 --> 0:07:04,000
with a core in the center

146
0:07:04.401,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with elevators, stairs, pipes, wires, everything,

147
0:07:09.09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and then a glass skin on the outside

148
0:07:12.677,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that, due to direct sun radiation,

149
0:07:16.553,000 --> 0:07:21,000
creates a huge greenhouse effect inside.

150
0:07:21.761,000 --> 0:07:22,000
In addition to that, let's say a guy

151
0:07:23.695,000 --> 0:07:24,000
working on the seventh floor

152
0:07:25.431,000 --> 0:07:27,000
goes every single day through the third floor,

153
0:07:28.142,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but has no idea what the guy on that floor

154
0:07:31.18,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is working on.

155
0:07:32.909,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So we thought, well, maybe we have to turn this scheme

156
0:07:36.305,000 --> 0:07:37,000
inside out.

157
0:07:38.106,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And what we did was,

158
0:07:39.928,000 --> 0:07:43,000
let's have an open atrium,

159
0:07:44.11,000 --> 0:07:45,000
a hollowed core,

160
0:07:45.999,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the same collection of floors,

161
0:07:47.613,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but have the walls and the mass in the perimeter,

162
0:07:52.053,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so that when the sun hits,

163
0:07:56.317,000 --> 0:08:02,000
it's not impacting directly glass, but a wall.

164
0:08:02.444,000 --> 0:08:04,000
When you have an open atrium inside,

165
0:08:05.181,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you are able to see what others are doing

166
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
from within the building, and you have

167
0:08:09.181,000 --> 0:08:11,000
a better way to control light,

168
0:08:11.38,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and when you place the mass and the walls

169
0:08:14.783,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in the perimeter,

170
0:08:16.439,000 --> 0:08:19,000
then you are preventing direct sun radiation.

171
0:08:19.872,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You may also open those windows

172
0:08:21.792,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and get cross-ventilation.

173
0:08:24.688,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We just made those openings

174
0:08:27.623,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of such a scale that they could work

175
0:08:29.715,000 --> 0:08:31,000
as elevated squares,

176
0:08:31.728,000 --> 0:08:32,000
outdoor spaces throughout

177
0:08:33.472,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the entire height of the building.

178
0:08:37.135,000 --> 0:08:38,000
None of this is rocket science.

179
0:08:38.984,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You don't require sophisticated programming.

180
0:08:41.683,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's not about technology.

181
0:08:43.416,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is just archaic, primitive common sense,

182
0:08:48.838,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and by using common sense,

183
0:08:50.806,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we went from 120 kilowatts

184
0:08:53.787,000 --> 0:08:55,000
per square meter per year,

185
0:08:56.127,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which is the typical energy consumption

186
0:08:58.298,000 --> 0:08:59,000
for cooling a glass tower,

187
0:09:00.29,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year.

188
0:09:04.62,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So with the right design,

189
0:09:06.897,000 --> 0:09:08,000
sustainability is nothing but the rigorous use

190
0:09:09.441,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of common sense.

191
0:09:13.174,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Last case I would like to share is how design

192
0:09:16.147,000 --> 0:09:18,000
can provide more comprehensive answers

193
0:09:18.442,000 --> 0:09:2,000
against natural disasters.

194
0:09:20.83,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You may know that Chile, in 2010,

195
0:09:23.895,000 --> 0:09:26,000
was hit by an 8.8 Richter scale

196
0:09:27.7,000 --> 0:09:29,000
earthquake and tsunami,

197
0:09:29.823,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and we were called to work

198
0:09:31.698,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in the reconstruction of the Constitución,

199
0:09:33.94,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in the southern part of the country.

200
0:09:35.85,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We were given 100 days, three months,

201
0:09:39.347,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to design almost everything,

202
0:09:41.263,000 --> 0:09:43,000
from public buildings to public space,

203
0:09:43.58,000 --> 0:09:45,000
street grid, transportation, housing,

204
0:09:45.67,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and mainly how to protect the city

205
0:09:48.424,000 --> 0:09:5,000
against future tsunamis.

206
0:09:50.679,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This was new in Chilean urban design,

207
0:09:53.829,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and there were in the air a couple of alternatives.

208
0:09:57.202,000 --> 0:09:58,000
First one:

209
0:09:58.454,000 --> 0:10:,000
Forbid installation on ground zero.

210
0:10:01.103,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Thirty million dollars spent mainly

211
0:10:03.14,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in land expropriation.

212
0:10:05.524,000 --> 0:10:08,000
This is exactly what's being discussed in Japan nowadays,

213
0:10:08.786,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and if you have a disciplined population

214
0:10:10.833,000 --> 0:10:12,000
like the Japanese, this may work,

215
0:10:13.173,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but we know that in Chile,

216
0:10:14.658,000 --> 0:10:17,000
this land is going to be occupied illegally anyhow,

217
0:10:18.471,000 --> 0:10:22,000
so this alternative was unrealistic and undesirable.

218
0:10:22.543,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Second alternative: build a big wall,

219
0:10:25.936,000 --> 0:10:27,000
heavy infrastructure to resist

220
0:10:28.253,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the energy of the waves.

221
0:10:30.195,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This alternative was conveniently lobbied

222
0:10:32.314,000 --> 0:10:33,000
by big building companies,

223
0:10:33.675,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because it meant 42 million dollars in contracts,

224
0:10:37.882,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and was also politically preferred,

225
0:10:40.235,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because it required no land expropriation.

226
0:10:44.227,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But Japan proved that trying to resist

227
0:10:46.977,000 --> 0:10:49,000
the force of nature is useless.

228
0:10:50.29,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So this alternative was irresponsible.

229
0:10:53.653,000 --> 0:10:55,000
As in the housing process,

230
0:10:55.747,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we had to include the community

231
0:10:57.624,000 --> 0:11:,000
in the way of finding a solution for this,

232
0:11:00.972,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and we started a participatory design process.

233
0:11:04.145,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Video) [In Spanish] Loudspeaker: What kind of city do you want?

234
0:11:06.416,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Vote for Constitución.

235
0:11:07.958,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Go to the Open House and express your options.

236
0:11:10.263,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Participate!

237
0:11:12.436,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Fisherman: I am a fisherman.

238
0:11:14.51,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Twenty-five fishermen work for me.

239
0:11:16.619,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Where should I take them? To the forest?

240
0:11:18.958,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Man: So why can't we have a concrete defense?

241
0:11:22.343,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Done well, of course.

242
0:11:24.251,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Man 2: I am the history of Constitución.

243
0:11:26.141,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And you come here to tell me that I cannot keep on living here?

244
0:11:30.101,000 --> 0:11:32,000
My whole family has lived here,

245
0:11:32.299,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I raised my children here,

246
0:11:33.771,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and my children will also raise their children here.

247
0:11:35.856,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and my grandchildren and everyone else will.

248
0:11:38.364,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But why are you imposing this on me?

249
0:11:40.89,000 --> 0:11:41,000
You! You are imposing this on me!

250
0:11:42.767,000 --> 0:11:43,000
In danger zone I am not authorized to build.

251
0:11:44.558,000 --> 0:11:45,000
He himself is saying that.

252
0:11:46.145,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Man 3: No, no, no, Nieves...

253
0:11:50.94,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Alejandro Aravena: I don't know if you were able

254
0:11:53.228,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to read the subtitles, but you can tell

255
0:11:55.513,000 --> 0:11:56,000
from the body language

256
0:11:57.157,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that participatory design

257
0:11:58.435,000 --> 0:12:,000
is not a hippie, romantic,

258
0:12:00.759,000 --> 0:12:03,000
let's-all-dream-together-about- the-future-of-the-city

259
0:12:04.01,000 --> 0:12:06,000
kind of thing.

260
0:12:06.077,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It is actually — (Applause)

261
0:12:09.57,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It is actually not even with the families

262
0:12:11.97,000 --> 0:12:14,000
trying to find the right answer.

263
0:12:15.016,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It is mainly trying to identify with precision

264
0:12:17.829,000 --> 0:12:19,000
what is the right question.

265
0:12:19.9,000 --> 0:12:21,000
There is nothing worse than answering well

266
0:12:21.987,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the wrong question.

267
0:12:24.091,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So it was pretty obvious after this process

268
0:12:27.41,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that, well, we chicken out here

269
0:12:30.941,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and go away because it's too tense,

270
0:12:33.517,000 --> 0:12:35,000
or we go even further in asking,

271
0:12:35.543,000 --> 0:12:36,000
what else is bothering you?

272
0:12:36.938,000 --> 0:12:37,000
What other problems do you have

273
0:12:38.691,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and you want us to take care of now that the city

274
0:12:41.273,000 --> 0:12:45,000
will have to be rethought from scratch?

275
0:12:45.595,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And what they said was,

276
0:12:47.791,000 --> 0:12:49,000
look, fine to protect the city against future tsunamis,

277
0:12:50.577,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we really appreciate, but the next one is going to come in, what, 20 years?

278
0:12:55.334,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But every single year, we have problems

279
0:12:57.427,000 --> 0:12:59,000
of flooding due to rain.

280
0:13:00.29,000 --> 0:13:02,000
In addition, we are in the middle

281
0:13:02.49,000 --> 0:13:03,000
of the forest region of the country,

282
0:13:04.289,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and our public space sucks.

283
0:13:07.109,000 --> 0:13:1,000
It's poor and it's scarce.

284
0:13:10.9,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And the origin of the city, our identity,

285
0:13:13.484,000 --> 0:13:15,000
is not really connected to the buildings that fell,

286
0:13:16.37,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it is connected to the river,

287
0:13:17.984,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but the river cannot be accessed publicly,

288
0:13:20.798,000 --> 0:13:23,000
because its shores are privately owned.

289
0:13:24.5,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So we thought that we had to produce a third alternative,

290
0:13:29.303,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and our approach was against geographical threats,

291
0:13:33.847,000 --> 0:13:36,000
have geographical answers.

292
0:13:37.467,000 --> 0:13:4,000
What if, in between the city

293
0:13:43.6,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and the sea

294
0:13:48.59,000 --> 0:13:51,000
we have a forest,

295
0:13:51.768,000 --> 0:13:53,000
a forest that doesn't try to resist

296
0:13:54.354,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the energy of nature,

297
0:13:56.212,000 --> 0:14:,000
but dissipates it by introducing friction?

298
0:14:00.271,000 --> 0:14:03,000
A forest that may be able to laminate the water

299
0:14:04.164,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and prevent the flooding?

300
0:14:06.515,000 --> 0:14:11,000
That may pay the historical debt of public space,

301
0:14:11.599,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and that may provide, finally,

302
0:14:14.242,000 --> 0:14:16,000
democratic access to the river.

303
0:14:16.66,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So as a conclusion of the participatory design,

304
0:14:19.601,000 --> 0:14:22,000
the alternative was validated politically and socially,

305
0:14:22.604,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but there was still the problem of the cost:

306
0:14:25.715,000 --> 0:14:28,000
48 million dollars.

307
0:14:28.919,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So what we did was a survey

308
0:14:31.323,000 --> 0:14:33,000
in the public investment system,

309
0:14:33.875,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and found out that there were three ministries

310
0:14:36.19,000 --> 0:14:39,000
with three projects in the exact same place,

311
0:14:39.333,000 --> 0:14:41,000
not knowing of the existence of the other projects.

312
0:14:42.297,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The sum of them: 52 million dollars.

313
0:14:46.634,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So design's power of synthesis

314
0:14:49.31,000 --> 0:14:51,000
is trying to make a more efficient use

315
0:14:51.426,000 --> 0:14:53,000
of the scarcest resource in cities,

316
0:14:54.283,000 --> 0:14:57,000
which is not money but coordination.

317
0:14:57.696,000 --> 0:14:59,000
By doing so, we were able to save

318
0:15:00.478,000 --> 0:15:02,000
four million dollars, and that is why the forest

319
0:15:03.32,000 --> 0:15:06,000
is today under construction.

320
0:15:06.9,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

321
0:15:09.516,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So be it the force of self construction,

322
0:15:13.14,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the force of common sense,

323
0:15:16.245,000 --> 0:15:19,000
or the force of nature, all these forces

324
0:15:19.35,000 --> 0:15:22,000
need to be translated into form,

325
0:15:22.781,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and what that form is modeling and shaping

326
0:15:26.447,000 --> 0:15:29,000
is not cement, bricks, or wood.

327
0:15:29.677,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It is life itself.

328
0:15:31.922,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Design's power of synthesis

329
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
is just an attempt to put

330
0:15:36.68,000 --> 0:15:39,000
at the innermost core of architecture

331
0:15:40.312,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the force of life.

332
0:15:42.18,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Thank you so much.

333
0:15:44.969,000 --> 0:15:47,000

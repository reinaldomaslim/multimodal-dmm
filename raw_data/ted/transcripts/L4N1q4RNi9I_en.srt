1
0:00:13.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We're at a critical moment.

2
0:00:16.6,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Our leaders,

3
0:00:17.88,000 --> 0:00:19,000
some of our great institutions

4
0:00:19.96,000 --> 0:00:2,000
are failing us.

5
0:00:22.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Why?

6
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In some cases, it's because they're bad

7
0:00:26.56,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or unethical,

8
0:00:28.76,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but often, they've taken us to the wrong objectives.

9
0:00:33.36,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And this is unacceptable.

10
0:00:38.48,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This has to stop.

11
0:00:40.8,000 --> 0:00:42,000
How are we going to correct these wrongs?

12
0:00:44.2,000 --> 0:00:46,000
How are we going to choose the right course?

13
0:00:47.24,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's not going to be easy.

14
0:00:49.84,000 --> 0:00:51,000
For years, I've worked with talented teams

15
0:00:52.64,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and they've chosen the right objectives and the wrong objectives.

16
0:00:55.76,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Many have succeeded, others of them have failed.

17
0:00:58.4,000 --> 0:01:,000
And today I'm going to share with you

18
0:01:00.64,000 --> 0:01:02,000
what really makes a difference --

19
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that's what's crucial,

20
0:01:05.4,000 --> 0:01:06,000
how and why

21
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:08,000
they set meaningful and audacious goals,

22
0:01:09.52,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the right goals for the right reasons.

23
0:01:13.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Let's go back to 1975.

24
0:01:15.92,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Yep, this is me.

25
0:01:17.56,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I've got a lot to learn, I'm a computer engineer,

26
0:01:19.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I've got long hair,

27
0:01:21.2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but I'm working under Andy Grove,

28
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:28,000
who's been called the greatest manager of his or any other era.

29
0:01:28.52,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Andy was a superb leader and also a teacher,

30
0:01:32.52,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and he said to me, "John, it almost doesn't matter what you know.

31
0:01:36.72,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Execution is what matters the most."

32
0:01:39.8,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And so Andy invented a system called "Objectives and Key Results."

33
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It kind of rolls off the tongue, doesn't it?

34
0:01:47.36,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And it's all about excellent execution.

35
0:01:51.24,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So here's a classic video from the 1970s

36
0:01:54.24,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of professor Andy Grove.

37
0:01:56.8,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases of the management by objective systems

38
0:02:00.52,000 --> 0:02:03,000
are the objectives and the key results, and they match the two purposes.

39
0:02:04.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The objective is the direction.

40
0:02:07.56,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The key results have to be measured,

41
0:02:09.32,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but at the end you can look and without any argument say,

42
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:14,000
"Did I do that, or did I not do that?" Yes. No. Simple.

43
0:02:14.84,000 --> 0:02:15,000
John Doerr: That's Andy.

44
0:02:16.28,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Yes. No. Simple.

45
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Objectives and Key Results,

46
0:02:21.759,000 --> 0:02:23,000
or OKRs,

47
0:02:23.92,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are a simple goal-setting system

48
0:02:26.44,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and they work for organizations, they work for teams,

49
0:02:29.36,000 --> 0:02:3,000
they even work for individuals.

50
0:02:31.76,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The objectives are what you want to have accomplished.

51
0:02:34.8,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The key results are how I'm going to get that done.

52
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Objectives. Key results.

53
0:02:40.28,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What and how.

54
0:02:43.24,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But here's the truth:

55
0:02:45.4,000 --> 0:02:47,000
many of us are setting goals wrong,

56
0:02:47.6,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and most of us are not setting goals at all.

57
0:02:50.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
A lot of organizations set objectives and meet them.

58
0:02:53.12,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They ship their sales, they introduce their new products,

59
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
they make their numbers,

60
0:02:57.68,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but they lack a sense of purpose to inspire their teams.

61
0:03:02.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So how do you set these goals the right way?

62
0:03:05.4,000 --> 0:03:08,000
First, you must answer the question, "Why?"

63
0:03:09.88,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Why?

64
0:03:11.12,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Because truly transformational teams

65
0:03:13.88,000 --> 0:03:18,000
combine their ambitions to their passion and to their purpose,

66
0:03:19.08,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and they develop a clear and compelling sense of why.

67
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I want to tell you a story.

68
0:03:25.52,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I work with a remarkable entrepreneur.

69
0:03:27.52,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Her name is Jini Kim.

70
0:03:29.44,000 --> 0:03:3,000
She runs a company called Nuna.

71
0:03:32.08,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Nuna is a health care data company.

72
0:03:35.8,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And when Nuna was founded,

73
0:03:37.64,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they used data to serve the health needs of lots of workers at large companies.

74
0:03:43.08,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And then two years into the company's life,

75
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the federal government issued a proposal

76
0:03:48.04,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to build the first ever cloud database for Medicaid.

77
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, you'll remember that Medicaid is that program

78
0:03:54.56,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that serves 70 million Americans,

79
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
our poor, our children

80
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:,000
and people with disabilities.

81
0:04:02.92,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Nuna at the time was just 15 people

82
0:04:06.24,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and this database had to be built in one year,

83
0:04:08.92,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and they had a whole set of commitments that they had to honor,

84
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and frankly, they weren't going to make very much money on the project.

85
0:04:17.12,000 --> 0:04:19,000
This was a bet-your-company moment,

86
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and Jini seized it.

87
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:23,000
She jumped at the opportunity. She did not flinch.

88
0:04:25.8,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Why?

89
0:04:27.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Well, it's a personal why.

90
0:04:29.72,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism.

91
0:04:34.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And when he was seven,

92
0:04:36.32,000 --> 0:04:38,000
he had his first grand mal seizure

93
0:04:38.6,000 --> 0:04:39,000
at Disneyland.

94
0:04:39.84,000 --> 0:04:41,000
He fell to the ground. He stopped breathing.

95
0:04:42.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Jini's parents are Korean immigrants.

96
0:04:45.04,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They came to the country with limited resources

97
0:04:48.44,000 --> 0:04:49,000
speaking little English,

98
0:04:50.32,000 --> 0:04:53,000
so it was up to Jini to enroll her family in Medicaid.

99
0:04:54.12,000 --> 0:04:55,000
She was nine years old.

100
0:04:58.24,000 --> 0:05:01,000
That moment defined her mission,

101
0:05:01.4,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and that mission became her company,

102
0:05:04.12,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and that company bid on, won and delivered on that contract.

103
0:05:08.32,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Here's Jini to tell you why.

104
0:05:10.84,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid saved my family from bankruptcy,

105
0:05:13.68,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and today it provides for Kimong's health and for millions of others.

106
0:05:17.92,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid.

107
0:05:20.4,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Every row of data is a life

108
0:05:22.24,000 --> 0:05:24,000
whose story deserves to be told with dignity.

109
0:05:25.24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
JD: And Jini's story tells us

110
0:05:27.72,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that a compelling sense of why can be the launchpad for our objectives.

111
0:05:32.72,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Remember, that's what we want to have accomplished.

112
0:05:35.92,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And objectives are significant,

113
0:05:38.56,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they're action-oriented,

114
0:05:40.48,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they are inspiring,

115
0:05:43.36,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and they're a kind of vaccine against fuzzy thinking.

116
0:05:46.64,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You think a rockstar

117
0:05:48.08,000 --> 0:05:51,000
would be an unlikely user of Objectives and Key Results,

118
0:05:51.64,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but for years, Bono has used OKRs

119
0:05:54.48,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to wage a global war against poverty and disease,

120
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and his ONE organization has focused on two really gorgeous,

121
0:06:03.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
audacious objectives.

122
0:06:04.88,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The first is debt relief

123
0:06:07.2,000 --> 0:06:09,000
for the poorest countries in the world.

124
0:06:09.96,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The next is universal access to anti-HIV drugs.

125
0:06:14.92,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, why are these good objectives?

126
0:06:16.92,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Let's go back to our checklist.

127
0:06:18.96,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes.

128
0:06:22.36,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Action-oriented? Yes.

129
0:06:24.2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Inspirational?

130
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Well, let's just listen to Bono.

131
0:06:28.52,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Video) Bono: So you're passionate?

132
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:31,000
How passionate?

133
0:06:31.48,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What actions does your passion lead you to do?

134
0:06:34.52,000 --> 0:06:37,000
If the heart doesn't find a perfect rhyme with the head,

135
0:06:37.68,000 --> 0:06:39,000
then your passion means nothing.

136
0:06:39.92,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The OKR framework cultivates the madness,

137
0:06:43.48,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the chemistry contained inside it.

138
0:06:45.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It gives us an environment for risk,

139
0:06:48.04,000 --> 0:06:49,000
for trust,

140
0:06:49.28,000 --> 0:06:51,000
where failing is not a fireable offense.

141
0:06:51.68,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And when you have that sort of structure and environment

142
0:06:54.324,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and the right people,

143
0:06:56.08,000 --> 0:06:58,000
magic is around the corner.

144
0:07:00.88,000 --> 0:07:01,000
JD: I love that.

145
0:07:02.12,000 --> 0:07:04,000
OKRs cultivate the madness,

146
0:07:04.52,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and magic is right around the corner.

147
0:07:07.28,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is perfect.

148
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So with Jini we've covered the whys,

149
0:07:13.08,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with Bono the whats of goal-setting.

150
0:07:15.92,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Let's turn our attention to the hows.

151
0:07:18.48,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Remember, the hows are the key results.

152
0:07:20.72,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That's how we meet our objectives.

153
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And good results are specific and time-bound.

154
0:07:25.68,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They're aggressive but realistic.

155
0:07:27.68,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They're measurable, and they're verifiable.

156
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Those are good key results.

157
0:07:32.32,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In 1999, I introduced OKRs to Google's cofounders,

158
0:07:37.28,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Larry and Sergey.

159
0:07:38.56,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Here they are, 24 years old in their garage.

160
0:07:41.92,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And Sergey enthusiastically said he'd adopt them.

161
0:07:45.8,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Well, not quite.

162
0:07:48.12,000 --> 0:07:49,000
What he really said was,

163
0:07:49.92,000 --> 0:07:51,000
"We don't have any other way to manage this company,

164
0:07:52.4,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so we'll give it a go."

165
0:07:53.68,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:54.92,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And I took that as a kind of endorsement.

167
0:07:58.28,000 --> 0:08:,000
But every quarter since then,

168
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:04,000
every Googler has written down her objectives and her key results.

169
0:08:06.04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They've graded them,

170
0:08:07.28,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they've published them for everyone to see.

171
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And these are not used for bonuses or for promotions.

172
0:08:13.4,000 --> 0:08:14,000
They're set aside.

173
0:08:14.72,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They're used for a higher purpose,

174
0:08:16.48,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and that's to get collective commitment

175
0:08:18.6,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to truly stretch goals.

176
0:08:21.48,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai, took on an objective

177
0:08:26.48,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which was to build the next generation client platform

178
0:08:29.8,000 --> 0:08:3,000
for the future of web applications --

179
0:08:32.6,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in other words, build the best browser.

180
0:08:36.04,000 --> 0:08:39,000
He was very thoughtful about how he chose his key results.

181
0:08:39.92,000 --> 0:08:4,000
How do you measure the best browser?

182
0:08:41.68,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It could be ad clicks or engagement.

183
0:08:43.8,000 --> 0:08:46,000
No. He said: numbers of users,

184
0:08:47.48,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because users are going to decide

185
0:08:49.559,000 --> 0:08:51,000
if Chrome is a great browser or not.

186
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So he had this one three-year-long objective:

187
0:08:55.6,000 --> 0:08:56,000
build the best browser.

188
0:08:56.88,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And then every year he stuck to the same key results,

189
0:08:59.88,000 --> 0:09:,000
numbers of users, but he upped the ante.

190
0:09:01.84,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In the first year, his goal was 20 million users

191
0:09:04.12,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and he missed it.

192
0:09:05.68,000 --> 0:09:06,000
He got less than 10.

193
0:09:06.96,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Second year, he raised the bar to 50 million.

194
0:09:09.8,000 --> 0:09:11,000
He got to 37 million users.

195
0:09:11.96,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Somewhat better.

196
0:09:13.76,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In the third year,

197
0:09:16.08,000 --> 0:09:18,000
he upped the ante once more to a hundred million.

198
0:09:18.96,000 --> 0:09:2,000
He launched an aggressive marketing campaign,

199
0:09:21.44,000 --> 0:09:24,000
broader distribution, improved the technology, and kaboom!

200
0:09:24.92,000 --> 0:09:26,000
He got 111 million users.

201
0:09:28.6,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Here's why I like this story,

202
0:09:30.48,000 --> 0:09:31,000
not so much for the happy ending,

203
0:09:32.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but it shows someone carefully choosing the right objective

204
0:09:36.36,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and then sticking to it year after year after year.

205
0:09:40.2,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's a perfect story for a nerd like me.

206
0:09:44.04,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Now, I think of OKRs as transparent vessels

207
0:09:47.84,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that are made from the whats and hows of our ambitions.

208
0:09:52.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
What really matters is the why that we pour into those vessels.

209
0:09:58.2,000 --> 0:09:59,000
That's why we do our work.

210
0:10:00.64,000 --> 0:10:01,000
OKRs are not a silver bullet.

211
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
They're not going to be a substitute for a strong culture

212
0:10:06.04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
or for stronger leadership,

213
0:10:07.96,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but when those fundamentals are in place, they can take you to the mountaintop.

214
0:10:12.92,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I want you to think about your life for a moment.

215
0:10:16.68,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Do you have the right metrics?

216
0:10:19.36,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Take time to write down your values,

217
0:10:23.6,000 --> 0:10:26,000
your objectives and your key results.

218
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Do it today.

219
0:10:29.2,000 --> 0:10:31,000
If you'd like some feedback on them, you can send them to me.

220
0:10:32.12,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I'm john@whatmatters.com.

221
0:10:35.72,000 --> 0:10:38,000
If we think of the world-changing goals

222
0:10:38.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono,

223
0:10:43.12,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of Google,

224
0:10:44.84,000 --> 0:10:45,000
they're remarkable:

225
0:10:46.12,000 --> 0:10:47,000
ubiquitous computing,

226
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
affordable health care, high-quality for everyone,

227
0:10:51.6,000 --> 0:10:52,000
ending global poverty,

228
0:10:53.28,000 --> 0:10:54,000
access to all the world's information.

229
0:10:55.84,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Here's the deal:

230
0:10:57.36,000 --> 0:11:01,000
every one of those goals is powered today by OKRs.

231
0:11:03.28,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Now, I've been called the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs

232
0:11:06.24,000 --> 0:11:09,000
for spreading the good gospel according to Andy Grove,

233
0:11:09.56,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but I want you to join me in this movement.

234
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Let's fight for what it is that really matters,

235
0:11:15.76,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because we can take OKRs beyond our businesses.

236
0:11:19.28,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We can take them to our families,

237
0:11:21.24,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to our schools,

238
0:11:22.52,000 --> 0:11:23,000
even to our governments.

239
0:11:24.88,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We can hold those governments accountable.

240
0:11:26.92,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We can transform those informations.

241
0:11:28.659,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We can get back on the right track

242
0:11:34.8,000 --> 0:11:4,000
if we can and do measure what really matters.

243
0:11:42.28,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Thank you.

244
0:11:43.52,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.771,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When we're designing new products,

2
0:00:15.042,000 --> 0:00:16,000
services or businesses,

3
0:00:17.056,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the only time you'll know if they're any good,

4
0:00:19.598,000 --> 0:00:2,000
if the designs are good,

5
0:00:21.32,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is to see how they're used in the real world, in context.

6
0:00:26.761,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm reminded of that every time I walk past Highbury Fields

7
0:00:30.719,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in north London.

8
0:00:32.183,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's absolutely beautiful.

9
0:00:33.525,000 --> 0:00:34,000
There's a big open green space.

10
0:00:35.246,000 --> 0:00:37,000
There's Georgian buildings around the side.

11
0:00:37.838,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But then there's this mud trap that cuts across the middle.

12
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
People clearly don't want to walk all the way around the edge.

13
0:00:45.196,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Instead, they want to take the shortcut,

14
0:00:47.356,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and that shortcut is self-reinforcing.

15
0:00:50.866,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, this shortcut is called a desire path,

16
0:00:54.186,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and it's often the path of least resistance.

17
0:00:56.71,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I find them fascinating,

18
0:00:58.067,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because they're often the point where design and user experience diverge.

19
0:01:04.164,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now at this point, I should apologize,

20
0:01:06.041,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because you guys are going to start seeing these everywhere.

21
0:01:08.937,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But today, I'm going to pick three I find interesting

22
0:01:11.623,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and share what actually it reminds me

23
0:01:13.758,000 --> 0:01:15,000
about launching new products and services.

24
0:01:17.137,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The first is in the capital city of Brazil -- Brasilia.

25
0:01:21.203,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And it reminds me that sometimes,

26
0:01:23.365,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you have to just focus on designing for a real need

27
0:01:26.517,000 --> 0:01:27,000
at low friction.

28
0:01:28.251,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, Brasilia is fascinating.

29
0:01:29.788,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It was designed by Niemeyer in the '50s.

30
0:01:32.954,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It was the golden age of flying,

31
0:01:35.186,000 --> 0:01:38,000
so he laid it out like a plane, as you can see there.

32
0:01:38.474,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Slightly worryingly,

33
0:01:39.663,000 --> 0:01:42,000
he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit.

34
0:01:43.435,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia,

35
0:01:45.906,000 --> 0:01:47,000
just where the point is there,

36
0:01:48.092,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you see it's littered with desire paths.

37
0:01:50.973,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They're absolutely everywhere.

38
0:01:53.07,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now, they thought that they had future-proofed this design.

39
0:01:55.964,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They thought in the future we wouldn't need to walk anywhere --

40
0:01:59.003,000 --> 0:02:,000
we'd be able to drive --

41
0:02:00.575,000 --> 0:02:02,000
so there was little need for walkways or pavements.

42
0:02:04.358,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But as you can see, there's a real need.

43
0:02:07.564,000 --> 0:02:08,000
These are very dangerous desire paths.

44
0:02:09.41,000 --> 0:02:11,000
If we just pick one, in the middle,

45
0:02:11.471,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you can see it crosses 15 lanes of traffic.

46
0:02:14.902,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It won't surprise you guys

47
0:02:16.682,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that Brasilia has five times the pedestrian accident rate

48
0:02:20.246,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of your average US city.

49
0:02:22.968,000 --> 0:02:23,000
People are resourceful.

50
0:02:24.479,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They'll always find the low-friction route

51
0:02:27.537,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to save money, save time.

52
0:02:30.493,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Not all these desire paths are dangerous,

53
0:02:32.5,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I was reminded flying here when I was in Heathrow.

54
0:02:35.917,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Many of us get frustrated when we're confronted

55
0:02:38.461,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with the obligatory walk through duty-free.

56
0:02:43.024,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It was amazing to me

57
0:02:44.199,000 --> 0:02:48,000
how many people refused to take the long, meandering path to the left,

58
0:02:48.358,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and just cut through to the right,

59
0:02:50.459,000 --> 0:02:51,000
cut through the desire path.

60
0:02:52.813,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The question that's interesting is:

61
0:02:54.545,000 --> 0:02:57,000
What do designers think when they see our behavior here?

62
0:02:58.198,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Do they think we're stupid?

63
0:03:00.013,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Do they think we're lazy?

64
0:03:02.405,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Or do they accept that this is the only truth?

65
0:03:04.981,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is their product.

66
0:03:07.134,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We're effectively co-designing their product.

67
0:03:10.54,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So our job is to design for real needs at low friction,

68
0:03:15.49,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because if you don't, the customer will, anyway.

69
0:03:19.238,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The second desire path I wanted to share

70
0:03:21.482,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is at the University of California.

71
0:03:23.758,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And it reminds me

72
0:03:24.934,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that sometimes the best way to come up with a great design

73
0:03:28.116,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is just to launch it.

74
0:03:30.864,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, university campuses are fantastic for spotting desire paths.

75
0:03:34.762,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I think it's because students are always late and they're pretty smart.

76
0:03:38.124,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So they're dashing to lectures.

77
0:03:39.63,000 --> 0:03:41,000
They'll always find the shortcut.

78
0:03:42.436,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And the designers here knew that.

79
0:03:44.53,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So they built the buildings

80
0:03:46.527,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and then they waited a few months for the paths to form.

81
0:03:49.83,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They then paved them.

82
0:03:51.378,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:52.441,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Incredibly smart approach.

84
0:03:54.719,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In fact, often, just launching the straw man of a service

85
0:03:57.866,000 --> 0:03:59,000
can teach you what people really want.

86
0:04:00.667,000 --> 0:04:04,000
For example, Ayr Muir in Boston knew he wanted to open a restaurant.

87
0:04:04.885,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But where should it be?

88
0:04:06.675,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What should the menu be?

89
0:04:08.661,000 --> 0:04:09,000
He launched a service,

90
0:04:10.174,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in this case a food truck,

91
0:04:11.884,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and he changed the location each day.

92
0:04:14.283,000 --> 0:04:17,000
He'd write a different menu on the side in a whiteboard marker

93
0:04:17.851,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to figure out what people wanted.

94
0:04:20.218,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He now has a chain of restaurants.

95
0:04:22.661,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So it can be incredibly efficient

96
0:04:24.716,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to launch something to spot the desire paths.

97
0:04:28.232,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The third and final desire path I wanted to share with you

98
0:04:31.338,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is the UNIH.

99
0:04:33.594,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It reminds me that the world's in flux,

100
0:04:35.907,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and we have to respond to those changes.

101
0:04:38.77,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So as you'll guess, this is a hospital.

102
0:04:41.337,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I've marked for you on the left the Oncology Department.

103
0:04:44.735,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The patients would usually stay in the hotels down on the bottom right.

104
0:04:50.03,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This was a patient-centered organization,

105
0:04:52.267,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so they laid on cars for their patients.

106
0:04:55.871,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But what they realized when they started offering chemotherapy

107
0:04:59.287,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is the patients rarely wanted to get in cars.

108
0:05:02.088,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They were too nauseous, so they'd walk back to their hotels.

109
0:05:06.014,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This desire path that you see diagonally, formed.

110
0:05:09.616,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The patients even called it "The Chemo Trail."

111
0:05:12.93,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, when the hospital saw this originally,

112
0:05:15.023,000 --> 0:05:17,000
they tried to lay turf back over it, ignore it.

113
0:05:18.744,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But after a while, they realized it was an important need

114
0:05:21.884,000 --> 0:05:22,000
they were meeting for their patients,

115
0:05:23.685,000 --> 0:05:24,000
so they paved it.

116
0:05:25.017,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I think our job is often to pave these emerging desire paths.

117
0:05:28.89,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If we look back at the one in North London again,

118
0:05:32.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that desire path hasn't always been there.

119
0:05:34.856,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The reason it sprung up

120
0:05:36.396,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is people were traveling to the mighty Arsenal Football Club stadium

121
0:05:40.518,000 --> 0:05:41,000
on game days,

122
0:05:41.693,000 --> 0:05:43,000
from the Underground station you see on the bottom right.

123
0:05:44.805,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So you see the desire path.

124
0:05:46.128,000 --> 0:05:48,000
If we just wind the clock back a few years,

125
0:05:48.966,000 --> 0:05:5,000
when the stadium was being constructed,

126
0:05:51.187,000 --> 0:05:52,000
there is no desire path.

127
0:05:53.797,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So our job is to watch for these desire paths emerging,

128
0:05:58.567,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and, where appropriate, pave them,

129
0:06:00.975,000 --> 0:06:01,000
as someone did here.

130
0:06:03.191,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Someone installed a barrier,

131
0:06:06.076,000 --> 0:06:09,000
people started walking across and round the bottom as you see,

132
0:06:09.32,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and they paved it.

133
0:06:10.542,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:12.146,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But I think this is a wonderful reminder as well,

135
0:06:14.558,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that, actually, the world is in flux.

136
0:06:16.434,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's constantly changing,

137
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because if you look at the top of this image,

138
0:06:19.936,000 --> 0:06:2,000
there's another desire path forming.

139
0:06:23.413,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So these three desire paths remind me

140
0:06:25.967,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we need to design for real human needs.

141
0:06:29.579,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I think empathy for what your customers want

142
0:06:32.086,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is probably the biggest leading indicator of business success.

143
0:06:36.315,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Design for real needs

144
0:06:38.013,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and design them in low friction,

145
0:06:41.155,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because if you don't offer them in low friction,

146
0:06:43.814,000 --> 0:06:45,000
someone else will, often the customer.

147
0:06:46.875,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Secondly, often the best way to learn what people really want

148
0:06:51.059,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is to launch your service.

149
0:06:52.947,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The answer is rarely inside the building.

150
0:06:55.751,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Get out there and see what people really want.

151
0:06:58.706,000 --> 0:07:,000
And finally, in part because of technology,

152
0:07:01.173,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the world is incredibly flux at the moment.

153
0:07:04.01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's changing constantly.

154
0:07:05.993,000 --> 0:07:08,000
These desire paths are going to spring up faster than ever.

155
0:07:09.73,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Our job is to pick the appropriate ones

156
0:07:12.701,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and pave over them.

157
0:07:14.572,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Thank you very much.

158
0:07:15.747,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Applause)

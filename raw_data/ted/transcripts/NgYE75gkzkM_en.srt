1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
One of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper

5
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in New York City.

6
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And it cost about 500 dollars to start it,

7
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today.

8
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
By 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing

9
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
-- starting what was experienced as a mass--circulation daily paper

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
-- would come to cost two and a half million dollars.

11
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
10,000, two and a half million, 15 years.

12
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.

13
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And that's what I want to talk about today,

14
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and how that relates to the emergence of social production.

15
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement

16
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation

17
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital,

18
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
just like any other industrial organization --

19
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of

20
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
things that this industrial model could produce.

21
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, the term "information society," "information economy,"

22
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after

23
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening

24
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
today, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.

25
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's just been industrial,

26
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money

27
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph,

28
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.

29
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned,

30
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored

31
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years.

32
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, let me tell you a different story. Around June 2002,

33
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the world of supercomputers had a bombshell.

34
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer --

35
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the NEC Earth Simulator -- taking the primary from the U.S.,

36
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and about two years later -- this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point

37
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
operations per second that the computer's capable of running --

38
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.

39
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period,

40
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
there's another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home.

41
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Four and a half million users around the world, contributing their

42
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
leftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working,

43
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create

44
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data

45
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
coming from radio telescopes.

46
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way

47
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become

48
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required

49
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
-- but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens,

50
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies,

51
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
has one of these, or something rather like it -- a computer.

52
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network.

53
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of

54
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical

55
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture,

56
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.

57
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution,

58
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the most important means, the most important components of the core

59
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy

60
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
-- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else,

61
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've

62
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation

63
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
capacity in the hands of the entire population,

64
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience

65
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
-- the other major experience, the other major input --

66
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long --

67
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is not something that's the same or fungible among people.

68
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours

69
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit

70
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances.

71
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical input

72
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
into production as we hold this machine.

73
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
What's the effect of this? So, the story that most people know

74
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is the story of free or open source software.

75
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This is market share of Apache Web server

76
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
-- one of the critical applications in Web-based communications.

77
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In 1995, two groups of people said,

78
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"Wow, this is really important, the Web! We need a much better Web server!"

79
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided,

80
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
you know, we really need this, we should write one,

81
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and what are we going to do with what --

82
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it.

83
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The other was Microsoft.

84
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now, if I told you that 10 years later, the motley crew of people, who didn't control

85
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
anything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the market

86
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and was the red line, it would be amazing! Right?

87
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile

88
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right?

89
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent,

90
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical application

91
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
on which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in

92
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue --

93
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net.

94
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Software has done this in a way that's been very visible, because

95
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web.

96
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars

97
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four

98
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components,

99
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface,

100
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
will actually spend five minutes here,

101
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
10 minutes there, clicking. After six months,

102
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a

103
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
faster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote,

104
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,"

105
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average.

106
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now, if you have a little girl, and she goes and writes to

107
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
-- well, not so little, medium little -- tries to do research on Barbie.

108
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And she'll come to Encarta, one of the main online encyclopedias.

109
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition,

110
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
including, "manufacturers" -- plural -- "now more commonly produce

111
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
ethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly better

112
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com,

113
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter)

114
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
On the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article

115
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
-- and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here --

116
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written,

117
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
including the controversies over body image and commercialization,

118
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc.

119
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Another portion is not only how content is produced, but how relevance is produced.

120
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look -- originally, not anymore

121
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
-- we hire people to look at websites and tell you --

122
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
if they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000

123
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project,

124
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about,

125
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers,

126
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred

127
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
fully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output,

128
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social

129
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and psychological motivations to do something interesting.

130
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation

131
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing --

132
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole,

133
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank.

134
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people saying

135
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you,

136
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
people out there on the Web, for whatever reason -- vanity, pleasure --

137
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
produced links, and tied to each other. We're going to count those, and count them up.

138
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly,

139
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object,

140
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic

141
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
market-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list.

142
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So, all of that is in the creation of content, of relevance, basic human expression.

143
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials

144
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
-- our PCs -- we share them together. We also see this in wireless.

145
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in an

146
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
area, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property.

147
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated

148
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices,

149
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this

150
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle:

151
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages;

152
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours.

153
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some

154
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
places in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.

155
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system.

156
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day,

157
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.

158
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to

159
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
be robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files,

160
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years.

161
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It would take millions. But of course, what I'm describing is P2P file sharing.

162
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Right? We always think of it as stealing music, but fundamentally,

163
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system, where people,

164
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
for very obvious reasons, are willing to share their bandwidth and their

165
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
storage to create something.

166
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional

167
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which

168
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
you could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based;

169
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
they could be decentralized, or centralized.

170
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The price system was a market-based and decentralized system.

171
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them,

172
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
you had firms, if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governments

173
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market.

174
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production,

175
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself.

176
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
That was, in fact, economic.

177
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system

178
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
of social sharing and exchange.

179
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other,

180
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
as social beings. We do it all the time.

181
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact.

182
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
What characterizes them is decentralized authority.

183
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system.

184
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
May I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share,

185
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
if they want to, by themselves or with others,

186
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
because property is one mechanism of coordination.

187
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But it's not the only one.

188
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Instead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use

189
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
property and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are

190
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
interesting problems; who's available and good for something;

191
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
motivation structures -- remember, money isn't always the best motivator.

192
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends,

193
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you don't increase the probability of being invited back.

194
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex. (Laughter)

195
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It also requires certain new organizational approaches.

196
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And in particular, what we've seen is task organization.

197
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
You have to hire people who know what they're doing.

198
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time.

199
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Now, take the same problem,

200
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
chunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.

201
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Five minutes, instead of watching TV?

202
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.

203
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more

204
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
involved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.

205
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So, a new social phenomenon is emerging.

206
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.

207
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry;

208
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft;

209
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms;

210
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias.

211
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses.

212
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging,

213
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers.

214
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Instead of building well-behaved appliances

215
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
-- things that you know what they'll do in advance --

216
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values,

217
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
a new set of things people value.

218
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You build platforms for self-expression and collaboration.

219
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project,

220
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model.

221
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense

222
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
build it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right?

223
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
You have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings.

224
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
That'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone.

225
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary

226
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
-- that's what Google does, essentially.

227
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
That's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well.

228
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
So, social production is a real fact, not a fad.

229
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
It is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet.

230
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever

231
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficient

232
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
because of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person,

233
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast.

234
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
But -- and this is the dark lining -- it is threatened by

235
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
-- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems.

236
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision,

237
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical.

238
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other,

239
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced.

240
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be

241
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes,

242
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model,

243
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.

244
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:12.48,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Over our lifetimes,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
we've all contributed to climate change.

3
0:00:17.92,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Actions, choices and behaviors

4
0:00:21.48,000 --> 0:00:24,000
will have led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

5
0:00:26.12,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I think that that's quite a powerful thought.

6
0:00:29.2,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But it does have the potential to make us feel guilty

7
0:00:32.64,000 --> 0:00:34,000
when we think about decisions we might have made

8
0:00:35.44,000 --> 0:00:37,000
around where to travel to,

9
0:00:37.96,000 --> 0:00:39,000
how often and how,

10
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:42,000
about the energy that we choose to use

11
0:00:43.32,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in our homes or in our workplaces,

12
0:00:46.48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
or quite simply the lifestyles that we lead and enjoy.

13
0:00:51.8,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But we can also turn that thought on its head,

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and think that if we've had such a profound

15
0:00:57.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but a negative impact on our climate already,

16
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:06,000
then we have an opportunity to influence the amount of future climate change

17
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that we will need to adapt to.

18
0:01:09.32,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So we have a choice.

19
0:01:10.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We can either choose to start to take climate change seriously,

20
0:01:15.24,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and significantly cut and mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions,

21
0:01:19.92,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and then we will have to adapt to less of the climate change impacts in future.

22
0:01:25.12,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Alternatively, we can continue to really ignore the climate change problem.

23
0:01:30.72,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But if we do that, we are also choosing

24
0:01:33.36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to adapt to very much more powerful climate impacts in future.

25
0:01:38.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And not only that.

26
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:42,000
As people who live in countries with high per capita emissions,

27
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we're making that choice on behalf of others as well.

28
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But the choice that we don't have

29
0:01:49.12,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is a no climate change future.

30
0:01:53.28,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Over the last two decades,

31
0:01:55.28,000 --> 0:01:58,000
our government negotiators and policymakers have been coming together

32
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
to discuss climate change,

33
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they've been focused on avoiding a two-degree centigrade warming

34
0:02:05.88,000 --> 0:02:06,000
above pre-industrial levels.

35
0:02:08.52,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That's the temperature that's associated with dangerous impacts

36
0:02:12.12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
across a range of different indicators,

37
0:02:15.12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to humans and to the environment.

38
0:02:17.76,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So two degrees centigrade constitutes dangerous climate change.

39
0:02:22.544,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But dangerous climate change can be subjective.

40
0:02:24.76,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So if we think about an extreme weather event

41
0:02:27.08,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that might happen in some part of the world,

42
0:02:29.44,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and if that happens in a part of the world where there is good infrastructure,

43
0:02:33.44,000 --> 0:02:35,000
where there are people that are well-insured and so on,

44
0:02:36.52,000 --> 0:02:39,000
then that impact can be disruptive.

45
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It can cause upset, it could cause cost.

46
0:02:43.44,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It could even cause some deaths.

47
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But if that exact same weather event happens in a part of the world

48
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:51,000
where there is poor infrastructure,

49
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or where people are not well-insured,

50
0:02:53.4,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or they're not having good support networks,

51
0:02:55.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
then that same climate change impact could be devastating.

52
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It could cause a significant loss of home,

53
0:03:03.88,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but it could also cause significant amounts of death.

54
0:03:07.8,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So this is a graph of the CO2 emissions at the left-hand side

55
0:03:11.8,000 --> 0:03:12,000
from fossil fuel and industry,

56
0:03:13.64,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and time from before the Industrial Revolution

57
0:03:16.64,000 --> 0:03:17,000
out towards the present day.

58
0:03:18.84,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And what's immediately striking about this

59
0:03:21.32,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is that emissions have been growing exponentially.

60
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
If we focus in on a shorter period of time from 1950,

61
0:03:29.4,000 --> 0:03:32,000
we have established in 1988

62
0:03:32.52,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,

63
0:03:35.92,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the Rio Earth Summit in 1992,

64
0:03:39.32,000 --> 0:03:43,000
then rolling on a few years, in 2009 we had the Copenhagen Accord,

65
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
where it established avoiding a two-degree temperature rise

66
0:03:48.48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in keeping with the science and on the basis of equity.

67
0:03:52.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And then in 2012, we had the Rio+20 event.

68
0:03:56.64,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And all the way through, during all of these meetings

69
0:03:59.48,000 --> 0:04:,000
and many others as well,

70
0:04:01.44,000 --> 0:04:03,000
emissions have continued to rise.

71
0:04:04.92,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And if we focus on our historical emission trend in recent years,

72
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and we put that together with our understanding

73
0:04:12.4,000 --> 0:04:14,000
of the direction of travel in our global economy,

74
0:04:15.28,000 --> 0:04:16,000
then we are much more on track

75
0:04:17.04,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for a four-degree centigrade global warming

76
0:04:20.44,000 --> 0:04:23,000
than we are for the two-degree centigrade.

77
0:04:24.4,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, let's just pause for a moment

78
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and think about this four-degree global average temperature.

79
0:04:30.6,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Most of our planet is actually made up of the sea.

80
0:04:34.56,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, because the sea has a greater thermal inertia than the land,

81
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the average temperatures over land are actually going to be higher

82
0:04:41.68,000 --> 0:04:42,000
than they are over the sea.

83
0:04:43.64,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The second thing is that we as human beings don't experience

84
0:04:47.28,000 --> 0:04:48,000
global average temperatures.

85
0:04:49.2,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We experience hot days, cold days,

86
0:04:52.04,000 --> 0:04:54,000
rainy days, especially if you live in Manchester like me.

87
0:04:55.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So now put yourself in a city center.

88
0:04:58.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Imagine somewhere in the world:

89
0:05:00.08,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Mumbai, Beijing, New York, London.

90
0:05:03.48,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's the hottest day that you've ever experienced.

91
0:05:07.04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
There's sun beating down,

92
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:1,000
there's concrete and glass all around you.

93
0:05:11.64,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now imagine that same day --

94
0:05:13.84,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but it's six, eight, maybe 10 to 12 degrees warmer

95
0:05:18.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
on that day during that heat wave.

96
0:05:20.92,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That's the kind of thing we're going to experience

97
0:05:23.278,000 --> 0:05:27,000
under a four-degree global average temperature scenario.

98
0:05:27.96,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And the problem with these extremes,

99
0:05:29.76,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and not just the temperature extremes,

100
0:05:31.6,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but also the extremes in terms of storms and other climate impacts,

101
0:05:35.68,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is our infrastructure is just not set up to deal with these sorts of events.

102
0:05:40.52,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So our roads and our rail networks

103
0:05:42.44,000 --> 0:05:44,000
have been designed to last for a long time

104
0:05:44.64,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and withstand only certain amounts of impacts

105
0:05:47.32,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in different parts of the world.

106
0:05:48.96,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And this is going to be extremely challenged.

107
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Our power stations are expected to be cooled by water

108
0:05:54.8,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to a certain temperature to remain effective and resilient.

109
0:05:58.88,000 --> 0:06:,000
And our buildings are designed to be comfortable

110
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
within a particular temperature range.

111
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And this is all going to be significantly challenged

112
0:06:06.56,000 --> 0:06:08,000
under a four-degree-type scenario.

113
0:06:08.84,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Our infrastructure has not been designed to cope with this.

114
0:06:14.44,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So if we go back, also thinking about four degrees,

115
0:06:18.32,000 --> 0:06:19,000
it's not just the direct impacts,

116
0:06:20.32,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but also some indirect impacts.

117
0:06:22.64,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So if we take food security, for example.

118
0:06:25.92,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Maize and wheat yields

119
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in some parts of the world

120
0:06:29.84,000 --> 0:06:31,000
are expected to be up to 40 percent lower

121
0:06:33.2,000 --> 0:06:35,000
under a four-degree scenario,

122
0:06:35.24,000 --> 0:06:37,000
rice up to 30 percent lower.

123
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This will be absolutely devastating for global food security.

124
0:06:42.68,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So all in all, the kinds of impacts anticipated

125
0:06:45.64,000 --> 0:06:47,000
under this four-degree centigrade scenario

126
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:53,000
are going to be incompatible with global organized living.

127
0:06:55.84,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So back to our trajectories and our graphs of four degrees and two degrees.

128
0:07:00.96,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Is it reasonable still to focus on the two-degree path?

129
0:07:04.92,000 --> 0:07:06,000
There are quite a lot of my colleagues and other scientists

130
0:07:07.76,000 --> 0:07:1,000
who would say that it's now too late to avoid a two-degree warming.

131
0:07:11.857,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But I would just like to draw on my own research

132
0:07:14.12,000 --> 0:07:17,000
on energy systems, on food systems,

133
0:07:17.2,000 --> 0:07:18,000
aviation and also shipping,

134
0:07:19.6,000 --> 0:07:23,000
just to say that I think there is still a small fighting chance

135
0:07:23.68,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of avoiding this two-degree dangerous climate change.

136
0:07:27.32,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But we really need to get to grips with the numbers

137
0:07:29.725,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to work out how to do it.

138
0:07:31.84,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So if you focus in on this trajectory and these graphs,

139
0:07:35.08,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the yellow circle there highlights that the departure

140
0:07:38.08,000 --> 0:07:4,000
from the red four-degree pathway

141
0:07:40.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to the two-degree green pathway is immediate.

142
0:07:45.04,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And that's because of cumulative emissions,

143
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or the carbon budget.

144
0:07:49.64,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So in other words, because of the lights and the projectors

145
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that are on in this room right now,

146
0:07:55.04,000 --> 0:07:56,000
the CO2 that is going into our atmosphere

147
0:07:57.017,000 --> 0:07:59,000
as a result of that electricity consumption

148
0:07:59.68,000 --> 0:08:,000
lasts a very long time.

149
0:08:01.2,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Some of it will be in our atmosphere for a century, maybe much longer.

150
0:08:05.24,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It will accumulate, and greenhouse gases tend to be cumulative.

151
0:08:09.76,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And that tells us something about these trajectories.

152
0:08:12.6,000 --> 0:08:16,000
First of all, it tells us that it's the area under these curves that matter,

153
0:08:16.64,000 --> 0:08:18,000
not where we reach at a particular date in future.

154
0:08:19.64,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And that's important, because it doesn't matter

155
0:08:21.855,000 --> 0:08:23,000
if we come up with some amazing whiz-bang technology

156
0:08:24.68,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to sort out our energy problem on the last day of 2049,

157
0:08:28.56,000 --> 0:08:3,000
just in the nick of time to sort things out.

158
0:08:30.88,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Because in the meantime, emissions will have accumulated.

159
0:08:34.72,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So if we continue on this red, four-degree centigrade scenario pathway,

160
0:08:40.32,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the longer we continue on it,

161
0:08:42.24,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that will need to be made up for in later years

162
0:08:45.64,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to keep the same carbon budget, to keep the same area under the curve,

163
0:08:49.96,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which means that that trajectory, the red one there, becomes steeper.

164
0:08:54.08,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So in other words, if we don't reduce emissions in the short to medium term,

165
0:08:57.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
then we'll have to make more significant year-on-year emission reductions.

166
0:09:02.6,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system.

167
0:09:06.2,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But if we don't start to cut emissions in the short to medium term,

168
0:09:10.12,000 --> 0:09:12,000
then we will have to do that even sooner.

169
0:09:13.08,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So this poses really big challenges for us.

170
0:09:18.08,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The other thing it does is tells us something about energy policy.

171
0:09:21.76,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If you live in a part of the world where per capita emissions are already high,

172
0:09:25.72,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it points us towards reducing energy demand.

173
0:09:29.8,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And that's because with all the will in the world,

174
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the large-scale engineering infrastructure

175
0:09:34.72,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that we need to roll out rapidly

176
0:09:36.88,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to decarbonize the supply side of our energy system

177
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is just simply not going to happen in time.

178
0:09:42.68,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So it doesn't matter whether we choose nuclear power

179
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
or carbon capture and storage,

180
0:09:47.04,000 --> 0:09:49,000
upscale our biofuel production,

181
0:09:49.4,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or go for a much bigger roll-out of wind turbines and wave turbines.

182
0:09:53.64,000 --> 0:09:54,000
All of that will take time.

183
0:09:55.72,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So because it's the area under the curve that matters,

184
0:09:58.28,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we need to focus on energy efficiency,

185
0:10:00.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but also on energy conservation -- in other words, using less energy.

186
0:10:05.2,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And if we do that, that also means

187
0:10:07.44,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that as we continue to roll out the supply-side technology,

188
0:10:11.381,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we will have less of a job to do if we've actually managed

189
0:10:14.12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to reduce our energy consumption,

190
0:10:16.44,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because we will then need less infrastructure on the supply side.

191
0:10:21.72,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Another issue that we really need to grapple with

192
0:10:24.32,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is the issue of well-being and equity.

193
0:10:27.96,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There are many parts of the world where the standard of living needs to rise.

194
0:10:33.44,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Bbut with energy systems currently reliant on fossil fuel,

195
0:10:38.2,000 --> 0:10:4,000
as those economies grow so will emissions.

196
0:10:41.32,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And now, if we're all constrained by the same amount of carbon budget,

197
0:10:44.92,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that means that if some parts of the world's emissions are needing to rise,

198
0:10:48.48,000 --> 0:10:51,000
then other parts of the world's emissions need to reduce.

199
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So that poses very significant challenges for wealthy nations.

200
0:10:57.92,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Because according to our research,

201
0:11:00.705,000 --> 0:11:03,000
if you're in a country where per capita emissions are really high --

202
0:11:03.92,000 --> 0:11:06,000
so North America, Europe, Australia --

203
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:1,000
emissions reductions of the order of 10 percent per year,

204
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and starting immediately, will be required for a good chance

205
0:11:15.24,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of avoiding the two-degree target.

206
0:11:18.12,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Let me just put that into context.

207
0:11:19.92,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The economist Nicholas Stern

208
0:11:21.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
said that emission reductions of more than one percent per year

209
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
had only ever been associated with economic recession or upheaval.

210
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So this poses huge challenges for the issue of economic growth,

211
0:11:37.36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
because if we have our high carbon infrastructure in place,

212
0:11:41.28,000 --> 0:11:43,000
it means that if our economies grow,

213
0:11:44.04,000 --> 0:11:45,000
then so do our emissions.

214
0:11:46.24,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So I'd just like to take a quote from a paper

215
0:11:48.36,000 --> 0:11:51,000
by myself and Kevin Anderson back in 2011

216
0:11:52.24,000 --> 0:11:57,000
where we said that to avoid the two-degree framing of dangerous climate change,

217
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:02,000
economic growth needs to be exchanged at least temporarily

218
0:12:02.24,000 --> 0:12:06,000
for a period of planned austerity in wealthy nations.

219
0:12:08.36,000 --> 0:12:11,000
This is a really difficult message to take,

220
0:12:12.2,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because what it suggests is that we really need to do things differently.

221
0:12:17.44,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This is not about just incremental change.

222
0:12:21.96,000 --> 0:12:25,000
This is about doing things differently, about whole system change,

223
0:12:26.28,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and sometimes it's about doing less things.

224
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And this applies to all of us,

225
0:12:32.44,000 --> 0:12:34,000
whatever sphere of influence we have.

226
0:12:35.04,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So it could be from writing to our local politician

227
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to talking to our boss at work or being the boss at work,

228
0:12:41.68,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or talking with our friends and family, or, quite simply, changing our lifestyles.

229
0:12:47.28,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Because we really need to make significant change.

230
0:12:50.92,000 --> 0:12:54,000
At the moment, we're choosing a four-degree scenario.

231
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
If we really want to avoid the two-degree scenario,

232
0:12:58.52,000 --> 0:13:01,000
there really is no time like the present to act.

233
0:13:02.12,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Thank you.

234
0:13:03.36,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Applause)

235
0:13:12.827,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Bruno Giussani: Alice, basically what you're saying,

236
0:13:15.28,000 --> 0:13:18,000
the talk is, unless wealthy nations start cutting 10 percent per year

237
0:13:18.76,000 --> 0:13:22,000
the emissions now, this year, not in 2020 or '25,

238
0:13:23.64,000 --> 0:13:26,000
we are going to go straight to the four-plus-degree scenario.

239
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I am wondering what's your take on the cut by 70 percent for 2070.

240
0:13:31.92,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Alice Bows-Larkin: Yeah, it's just nowhere near enough to avoid two degrees.

241
0:13:35.52,000 --> 0:13:36,000
One of the things that often --

242
0:13:37.028,000 --> 0:13:4,000
when there are these modeling studies that look at what we need to do,

243
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:44,000
is they tend to hugely overestimate how quickly other countries in the world

244
0:13:45.12,000 --> 0:13:46,000
can start to reduce emissions.

245
0:13:46.72,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So they make kind of heroic assumptions about that.

246
0:13:50.08,000 --> 0:13:52,000
The more we do that, because it's the cumulative emissions,

247
0:13:52.866,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the short-term stuff that really matters.

248
0:13:54.832,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So it does make a huge difference.

249
0:13:56.491,000 --> 0:13:57,000
If a big country like China, for example,

250
0:13:58.48,000 --> 0:14:,000
continues to grow even for just a few extra years,

251
0:14:00.92,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that will make a big difference to when we need to decarbonize.

252
0:14:03.96,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So I don't think we can even say when it will be,

253
0:14:06.48,000 --> 0:14:08,000
because it all depends on what we have to do in the short term.

254
0:14:09.464,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But I think we've just got huge scope, and we don't pull those levers

255
0:14:12.76,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that allow us to reduce the energy demand, which is a shame.

256
0:14:15.998,000 --> 0:14:17,000
BG: Alice, thank you for coming to TED and sharing this data.

257
0:14:18.88,000 --> 0:14:19,000
ABL: Thank you.

258
0:14:20.12,000 --> 0:14:21,000

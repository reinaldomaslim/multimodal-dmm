1
0:00:13.48,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Strap yourselves in,

2
0:00:15.4,000 --> 0:00:16,000
we're going to Mars.

3
0:00:17.4,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Not just a few astronauts --

4
0:00:19.52,000 --> 0:00:22,000
thousands of people are going to colonize Mars.

5
0:00:22.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And I am telling you that they're going to do this soon.

6
0:00:26.64,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Some of you will end up working on projects on Mars,

7
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I guarantee that some of your children will end up living there.

8
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
That probably sounds preposterous,

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
so I'm going to share with you how and when that will happen.

10
0:00:39.76,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But first I want to discuss the obvious question:

11
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Why the heck should we do this?

12
0:00:45.64,000 --> 0:00:46,000
12 years ago,

13
0:00:46.88,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I gave a TED talk on 10 ways the world could end suddenly.

14
0:00:50.72,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We are incredibly vulnerable to the whims of our own galaxy.

15
0:00:55.52,000 --> 0:00:58,000
A single, large asteroid could take us out forever.

16
0:00:59.12,000 --> 0:01:02,000
To survive we have to reach beyond the home planet.

17
0:01:02.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Think what a tragedy it would be

18
0:01:04.84,000 --> 0:01:07,000
if all that humans have accomplished were suddenly obliterated.

19
0:01:08.72,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And there's another reason we should go:

20
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:12,000
exploration is in our DNA.

21
0:01:13.72,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Two million years ago humans evolved in Africa

22
0:01:17.2,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and then slowly but surely spread out across the entire planet

23
0:01:22.04,000 --> 0:01:25,000
by reaching into the wilderness that was beyond their horizons.

24
0:01:25.56,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This stuff is inside us.

25
0:01:27.84,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And they prospered doing that.

26
0:01:30.24,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Some of the greatest advances in civilization and technology

27
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
came because we explored.

28
0:01:37.08,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Yes, we could do a lot of good

29
0:01:38.56,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with the money it will take to establish a thriving colony on Mars.

30
0:01:42.88,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And yes we should all be taking far better care of our own home planet.

31
0:01:48.12,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And yes, I worry we could screw up Mars the way we've screwed up Earth.

32
0:01:54.32,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But think for a moment,

33
0:01:55.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
what we had when John F. Kennedy told us we would put a human on the moon.

34
0:02:00.92,000 --> 0:02:03,000
He excited an entire generation to dream.

35
0:02:05.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Think how inspired we will be to see a landing on Mars.

36
0:02:08.36,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Perhaps then we will look back at Earth

37
0:02:11.12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and see that that is one people instead of many

38
0:02:14.52,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and perhaps then we will look back at Earth,

39
0:02:17.08,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as we struggle to survive on Mars,

40
0:02:19.52,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and realize how precious the home planet is.

41
0:02:23.52,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So let me tell you about the extraordinary adventure we're about to undertake.

42
0:02:29.04,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But first,

43
0:02:30.32,000 --> 0:02:32,000
a few fascinating facts about where we're going.

44
0:02:34.04,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This picture actually represents the true size of Mars compared to Earth.

45
0:02:38.44,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Mars is not our sister planet.

46
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It's far less than half the size of the Earth,

47
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and yet despite the fact that it's smaller,

48
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the surface area of Mars that you can stand on

49
0:02:47.92,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is equivalent to the surface area of the Earth that you can stand on,

50
0:02:51.88,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because the Earth is mostly covered by water.

51
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The atmosphere on Mars is really thin --

52
0:02:57.32,000 --> 0:02:59,000
100 times thinner than on Earth --

53
0:02:59.92,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and it's not breathable, it's 96 percent carbon dioxide.

54
0:03:04.76,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's really cold there.

55
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The average temperature is minus 81 degrees,

56
0:03:09.4,000 --> 0:03:12,000
although there is quite a range of temperature.

57
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
A day on Mars is about as long as a day on Earth,

58
0:03:15.92,000 --> 0:03:16,000
plus about 39 minutes.

59
0:03:18.44,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Seasons and years on Mars are twice as long as they are on Earth.

60
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And for anybody who wants to strap on some wings and go flying one day,

61
0:03:28.68,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Mars has a lot less gravity than on Earth,

62
0:03:31.52,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and it's the kind of place

63
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:34,000
where you can jump over your car instead of walk around it.

64
0:03:36.12,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, as you can see, Mars isn't exactly Earth-like,

65
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but it's by far the most livable other place in our entire solar system.

66
0:03:45.36,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Here's the problem.

67
0:03:46.88,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Mars is a long way away,

68
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:53,000
a thousand times farther away from us than our own moon.

69
0:03:54.56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The Moon is 250,000 miles away

70
0:03:58.36,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and it took Apollo astronauts three days to get there.

71
0:04:02.72,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Mars is 250 million miles away

72
0:04:05.88,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and it will take us eight months to get there --

73
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
240 days.

74
0:04:10.08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And that's only if we launch on a very specific day,

75
0:04:12.68,000 --> 0:04:13,000
at a very specific time,

76
0:04:14.44,000 --> 0:04:15,000
once every two years,

77
0:04:16.44,000 --> 0:04:19,000
when Mars and the Earth are aligned just so,

78
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so the distance that the rocket would have to travel will be the shortest.

79
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
240 days is a long time to spend trapped with your colleagues in a tin can.

80
0:04:30.8,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And meanwhile, our track record of getting to Mars is lousy.

81
0:04:34.88,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We and the Russians, the Europeans, the Japanese,

82
0:04:37.72,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the Chinese and the Indians,

83
0:04:39.08,000 --> 0:04:41,000
have actually sent 44 rockets there,

84
0:04:41.68,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the vast majority of them have either missed or crashed.

85
0:04:45.24,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Only about a third of the missions to Mars have been successful.

86
0:04:49.76,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And we don't at the moment have a rocket big enough to get there anyway.

87
0:04:55.08,000 --> 0:04:57,000
We once had that rocket, the Saturn V.

88
0:04:57.2,000 --> 0:04:59,000
A couple of Saturn Vs would have gotten us there.

89
0:04:59.84,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It was the most magnificent machine ever built by humans,

90
0:05:03.32,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and it was the rocket that took us to the Moon.

91
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But the last Saturn V was used in 1973 to launch the Skylab space station,

92
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and we decided to do something called the shuttle

93
0:05:14.28,000 --> 0:05:17,000
instead of continuing on to Mars after we landed on the Moon.

94
0:05:18.68,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The biggest rocket we have now

95
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is only half big enough to get us anything to Mars.

96
0:05:24.2,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So getting to Mars is not going to be easy

97
0:05:27.24,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and that brings up a really interesting question ...

98
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:35,000
how soon will the first humans actually land here?

99
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now, some pundits think if we got there by 2050,

100
0:05:41.52,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that'd be a pretty good achievement.

101
0:05:43.84,000 --> 0:05:48,000
These days, NASA seems to be saying that it can get humans to Mars by 2040.

102
0:05:50.28,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Maybe they can.

103
0:05:52.6,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I believe that they can get human beings into Mars orbit by 2035.

104
0:05:57.72,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But frankly,

105
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I don't think they're going to bother in 2035 to send a rocket to Mars,

106
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because we will already be there.

107
0:06:05.76,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We're going to land on Mars in 2027.

108
0:06:10.28,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And the reason is

109
0:06:11.52,000 --> 0:06:13,000
this man is determined to make that happen.

110
0:06:13.6,000 --> 0:06:18,000
His name is Elon Musk, he's the CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX.

111
0:06:19.92,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now, he actually told me that we would land on Mars by 2025,

112
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but Elon Musk is more optimistic than I am --

113
0:06:27.92,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and that's going a ways --

114
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:31,000
so I'm giving him a couple of years of slack.

115
0:06:32.96,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Still ...

116
0:06:34.4,000 --> 0:06:35,000
you've got to ask yourself,

117
0:06:35.76,000 --> 0:06:38,000
can this guy really do this by 2025 or 2027?

118
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Well, let's put a decade with Elon Musk into a little perspective.

119
0:06:45.2,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Where was this 10 years ago?

120
0:06:47.36,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That's the Tesla electric automobile.

121
0:06:49.64,000 --> 0:06:52,000
In 2005, a lot of people in the automobile industry were saying,

122
0:06:53.32,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we would not have a decent electric car for 50 years.

123
0:07:00.28,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And where was that?

124
0:07:02.12,000 --> 0:07:05,000
That is SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket,

125
0:07:05.32,000 --> 0:07:09,000
lifting six tons of supplies to the International Space Station.

126
0:07:09.72,000 --> 0:07:1,000
10 years ago,

127
0:07:10.96,000 --> 0:07:14,000
SpaceX had not launched anything, or fired a rocket to anywhere.

128
0:07:16.6,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So I think it's a pretty good bet

129
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that the person who is revolutionizing the automobile industry

130
0:07:22.24,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in less than 10 years

131
0:07:23.48,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and the person who created an entire rocket company in less than 10 years

132
0:07:29.32,000 --> 0:07:31,000
will get us to Mars by 2027.

133
0:07:32.76,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, you need to know this:

134
0:07:35.76,000 --> 0:07:38,000
governments and robots no longer control this game.

135
0:07:40.04,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Private companies are leaping into space

136
0:07:42.44,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they will be happy to take you to Mars.

137
0:07:45.8,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And that raises a really big question.

138
0:07:49.4,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Can we actually live there?

139
0:07:52.68,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now, NASA may not be able to get us there until 2040,

140
0:07:56.88,000 --> 0:07:58,000
or we may get there a long time before NASA,

141
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but NASA has taken a huge responsibility in figuring out how we can live on Mars.

142
0:08:04.88,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Let's look at the problem this way.

143
0:08:06.92,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Here's what you need to live on Earth:

144
0:08:08.8,000 --> 0:08:11,000
food, water, shelter and clothing.

145
0:08:12.24,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And here's what you need to live on Mars:

146
0:08:14.76,000 --> 0:08:16,000
all of the above, plus oxygen.

147
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So let's look at the most important thing on this list first.

148
0:08:22.28,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Water is the basis of all life as we know it,

149
0:08:25.32,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and it's far too heavy for us to carry water from the Earth to Mars to live,

150
0:08:29.92,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so we have to find water if our life is going to succeed on Mars.

151
0:08:35.84,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And if you look at Mars, it looks really dry,

152
0:08:38.36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
it looks like the entire planet is a desert.

153
0:08:41.2,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But it turns out that it's not.

154
0:08:43.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The soil alone on Mars contains up to 60 percent water.

155
0:08:48.48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And a number of orbiters that we still have flying around Mars have shown us --

156
0:08:53.44,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and by the way, that's a real photograph --

157
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
that lots of craters on Mars have a sheet of water ice in them.

158
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's not a bad place to start a colony.

159
0:09:03.855,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, here's a view of a little dig the Phoenix Lander did in 2008,

160
0:09:08.04,000 --> 0:09:11,000
showing that just below the surface of the soil is ice --

161
0:09:11.6,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that white stuff is ice.

162
0:09:13.88,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In the second picture,

163
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
which is four days later than the first picture,

164
0:09:17.44,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you can see that some of it is evaporating.

165
0:09:20.04,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Orbiters also tell us

166
0:09:21.44,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that there are huge amounts of underground water on Mars

167
0:09:24.88,000 --> 0:09:26,000
as well as glaciers.

168
0:09:26.96,000 --> 0:09:3,000
In fact, if only the water ice at the poles on Mars melted,

169
0:09:31.24,000 --> 0:09:33,000
most of the planet would be under 30 feet of water.

170
0:09:34.96,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So there's plenty of water there,

171
0:09:37.08,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but most of it's ice, most of it's underground,

172
0:09:39.64,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it takes a lot of energy to get it and a lot of human labor.

173
0:09:44.04,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This is a device cooked up at the University of Washington

174
0:09:46.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
back in 1998.

175
0:09:48.84,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's basically a low-tech dehumidifier.

176
0:09:51.92,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And it turns out the Mars atmosphere is often 100 percent humid.

177
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:,000
So this device can extract all the water that humans will need

178
0:10:00.4,000 --> 0:10:02,000
simply from the atmosphere on Mars.

179
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Next we have to worry about what we will breathe.

180
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Frankly, I was really shocked

181
0:10:09.08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to find out that NASA has this problem worked out.

182
0:10:12.28,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This is a scientist at MIT named Michael Hecht.

183
0:10:16.12,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And he's developed this machine, Moxie.

184
0:10:18.64,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I love this thing.

185
0:10:19.88,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's a reverse fuel cell, essentially,

186
0:10:22.48,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that sucks in the Martian atmosphere and pumps out oxygen.

187
0:10:26.28,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And you have to remember that CO2 --

188
0:10:28.28,000 --> 0:10:31,000
carbon dioxide, which is 96 percent of Mars' atmosphere --

189
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
CO2 is basically 78 percent oxygen.

190
0:10:35.92,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Now, the next big rover that NASA sends to Mars in 2020

191
0:10:40.28,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is going to have one of these devices aboard,

192
0:10:42.52,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and it will be able to produce enough oxygen

193
0:10:45.24,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to keep one person alive indefinitely.

194
0:10:47.96,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But the secret to this --

195
0:10:50.12,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and that's just for testing --

196
0:10:51.84,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the secret to this is that this thing was designed from the get-go

197
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to be scalable by a factor of 100.

198
0:10:58.84,000 --> 0:11:,000
Next, what will we eat?

199
0:11:01.08,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Well, we'll use hydroponics to grow food,

200
0:11:04.04,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but we're not going to be able to grow

201
0:11:05.92,000 --> 0:11:07,000
more than 15 to 20 percent of our food there,

202
0:11:08.08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
at least not until water is running on the surface of Mars

203
0:11:11.6,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and we actually have the probability and the capability of planting crops.

204
0:11:16.68,000 --> 0:11:17,000
In the meantime,

205
0:11:17.96,000 --> 0:11:19,000
most of our food will arrive from Earth,

206
0:11:20.08,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and it will be dried.

207
0:11:22.48,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And then we need some shelter.

208
0:11:25.12,000 --> 0:11:28,000
At first we can use inflatable, pressurized buildings

209
0:11:28.76,000 --> 0:11:3,000
as well as the landers themselves.

210
0:11:31.04,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But this really only works during the daytime.

211
0:11:34.04,000 --> 0:11:39,000
There is too much solar radiation and too much radiation from cosmic rays.

212
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So we really have to go underground.

213
0:11:41.36,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now, it turns out that the soil on Mars,

214
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:46,000
by and large, is perfect for making bricks.

215
0:11:47.08,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And NASA has figured this one out, too.

216
0:11:49.32,000 --> 0:11:51,000
They're going to throw some polymer plastic into the bricks,

217
0:11:52.2,000 --> 0:11:53,000
shove them in a microwave oven,

218
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and then you will be able to build buildings with really thick walls.

219
0:11:57.28,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Or we may choose to live underground in caves or in lava tubes,

220
0:12:03.28,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of which there are plenty.

221
0:12:06.04,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And finally there's clothing.

222
0:12:08.12,000 --> 0:12:11,000
On Earth we have miles of atmosphere piled up on us,

223
0:12:11.36,000 --> 0:12:14,000
which creates 15 pounds of pressure on our bodies at all times,

224
0:12:14.68,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and we're constantly pushing out against that.

225
0:12:16.847,000 --> 0:12:18,000
On Mars there's hardly any atmospheric pressure.

226
0:12:20.72,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So Dava Newman,

227
0:12:22.64,000 --> 0:12:23,000
a scientist at MIT,

228
0:12:24.12,000 --> 0:12:27,000
has created this sleek space suit.

229
0:12:27.2,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It will keep us together,

230
0:12:28.72,000 --> 0:12:3,000
block radiation and keep us warm.

231
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So let's think about this for a minute.

232
0:12:34.08,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Food, shelter, clothing, water, oxygen ...

233
0:12:37.96,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we can do this.

234
0:12:39.6,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We really can.

235
0:12:41.72,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But it's still a little complicated and a little difficult.

236
0:12:45.8,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So that leads to the next big --

237
0:12:48.64,000 --> 0:12:49,000
really big step --

238
0:12:50.24,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in living the good life on Mars.

239
0:12:52.08,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And that's terraforming the planet:

240
0:12:54.6,000 --> 0:12:55,000
making it more like Earth,

241
0:12:56.48,000 --> 0:12:58,000
reengineering an entire planet.

242
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
That sounds like a lot of hubris,

243
0:13:02.04,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but the truth is

244
0:13:03.28,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that the technology to do everything I'm about to tell you already exists.

245
0:13:08.2,000 --> 0:13:09,000
First we've got to warm it up.

246
0:13:10.4,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Mars is incredibly cold because it has a very thin atmosphere.

247
0:13:15.12,000 --> 0:13:19,000
The answer lies here, at the south pole and at the north pole of Mars,

248
0:13:19.48,000 --> 0:13:2,000
both of which are covered

249
0:13:20.76,000 --> 0:13:23,000
with an incredible amount of frozen carbon dioxide --

250
0:13:23.96,000 --> 0:13:24,000
dry ice.

251
0:13:25.44,000 --> 0:13:26,000
If we heat it up,

252
0:13:26.8,000 --> 0:13:28,000
it sublimes directly into the atmosphere

253
0:13:29.4,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and thickens the atmosphere the same way it does on Earth.

254
0:13:32.24,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And as we know,

255
0:13:33.48,000 --> 0:13:36,000
CO2 is an incredibly potent greenhouse gas.

256
0:13:37.84,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Now, my favorite way of doing this is to erect a very, very large solar sail

257
0:13:43.8,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and focus it --

258
0:13:45.04,000 --> 0:13:46,000
it essentially serves as a mirror --

259
0:13:46.8,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and focus it on the south pole of Mars at first.

260
0:13:49.2,000 --> 0:13:53,000
As the planet spins, it will heat up all that dry ice, sublime it,

261
0:13:53.24,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and it will go into the atmosphere.

262
0:13:55.52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It actually won't take long

263
0:13:57.04,000 --> 0:13:59,000
for the temperature on Mars to start rising,

264
0:13:59.32,000 --> 0:14:01,000
probably less than 20 years.

265
0:14:02.56,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Right now,

266
0:14:03.8,000 --> 0:14:04,000
on a perfect day at the equator,

267
0:14:05.8,000 --> 0:14:07,000
in the middle of summer on Mars,

268
0:14:07.92,000 --> 0:14:09,000
temperatures can actually reach 70 degrees,

269
0:14:10.4,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but then they go down to minus 100 at night.

270
0:14:12.84,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

271
0:14:14.44,000 --> 0:14:17,000
What we're shooting for is a runaway greenhouse effect:

272
0:14:18.8,000 --> 0:14:21,000
enough temperature rise to see a lot of that ice on Mars --

273
0:14:22.64,000 --> 0:14:24,000
especially the ice in the ground -- melt.

274
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Then we get some real magic.

275
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
As the atmosphere gets thicker, everything gets better.

276
0:14:31.2,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We get more protection from radiation,

277
0:14:33.84,000 --> 0:14:36,000
more atmosphere makes us warmer, makes the planet warmer,

278
0:14:36.96,000 --> 0:14:37,000
so we get running water

279
0:14:38.68,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and that makes crops possible.

280
0:14:40.92,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Then more water vapor goes into the air, forming yet another potent greenhouse gas.

281
0:14:45.92,000 --> 0:14:48,000
It will rain and it will snow on Mars.

282
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And a thicker atmosphere will create enough pressure

283
0:14:53.44,000 --> 0:14:55,000
so that we can throw away those space suits.

284
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We only need about five pounds of pressure to survive.

285
0:14:59.4,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Eventually, Mars will be made to feel a lot like British Columbia.

286
0:15:06.04,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We'll still be left with the complicated problem

287
0:15:08.4,000 --> 0:15:09,000
of making the atmosphere breathable,

288
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and frankly that could take 1,000 years to accomplish.

289
0:15:13.8,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But humans are amazingly smart and incredibly adaptable.

290
0:15:17.96,000 --> 0:15:21,000
There is no telling what our future technology will be able to accomplish

291
0:15:22.96,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and no telling what we can do with our own bodies.

292
0:15:25.75,000 --> 0:15:27,000
In biology right now,

293
0:15:28.28,000 --> 0:15:33,000
we are on the very verge of being able to control our own genetics,

294
0:15:33.52,000 --> 0:15:35,000
what the genes in our own bodies are doing,

295
0:15:36.08,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and certainly,

296
0:15:38.24,000 --> 0:15:39,000
eventually, our own evolution.

297
0:15:40.92,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We could end up with a species of human being on Earth

298
0:15:44.56,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that is slightly different from the species of human beings on Mars.

299
0:15:50.28,000 --> 0:15:52,000
But what would you do there? How would you live?

300
0:15:52.56,000 --> 0:15:54,000
It's going to be the same as it is on Earth.

301
0:15:55.56,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Somebody's going to start a restaurant,

302
0:15:57.84,000 --> 0:15:59,000
somebody's going to build an iron foundry.

303
0:16:00.8,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Someone will make documentary movies of Mars

304
0:16:03.08,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and sell them on Earth.

305
0:16:06.56,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Some idiot will start a reality TV show.

306
0:16:09.6,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Laughter)

307
0:16:11.68,000 --> 0:16:13,000
There will be software companies,

308
0:16:13.96,000 --> 0:16:15,000
there will be hotels, there will be bars.

309
0:16:17.76,000 --> 0:16:18,000
This much is certain:

310
0:16:19.2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
it will be the most disruptive event in our lifetimes,

311
0:16:23.44,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and I think it will be the most inspiring.

312
0:16:26.8,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Ask any 10-year-old girl if she wants to go to Mars.

313
0:16:30.88,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Children who are now in elementary school are going to choose to live there.

314
0:16:36.28,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Remember when we landed humans on the Moon?

315
0:16:39.32,000 --> 0:16:41,000
When that happened, people looked at each other and said,

316
0:16:42.12,000 --> 0:16:44,000
"If we can do this, we can do anything."

317
0:16:45.76,000 --> 0:16:49,000
What are they going to think when we actually form a colony on Mars?

318
0:16:50.92,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Most importantly,

319
0:16:52.32,000 --> 0:16:55,000
it will make us a spacefaring species.

320
0:16:55.72,000 --> 0:17:,000
And that means humans will survive no matter what happens on Earth.

321
0:17:01.2,000 --> 0:17:04,000
We will never be the last of our kind.

322
0:17:04.32,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Thank you.

323
0:17:05.56,000 --> 0:17:08,000

1
0:00:12.752,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm a scientist,

2
0:00:14.952,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I'm a big fan of Star Trek,

3
0:00:18.064,000 --> 0:00:2,000
especially of Mr. Spock.

4
0:00:21.781,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Mr. Spock is a scientist as well,

5
0:00:23.831,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and at the same time, he's the first [officer]

6
0:00:26.012,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of the starship Enterprise,

7
0:00:29.004,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and during the adventures of the Enterprise crew,

8
0:00:32.148,000 --> 0:00:34,000
he and his colleagues are dealing a lot

9
0:00:34.298,000 --> 0:00:38,000
with the presence or absence of Mr. Spock's emotions.

10
0:00:39.924,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Mr. Spock is half-human and half-Vulcan,

11
0:00:43.655,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and Vulcans are an alien race

12
0:00:46.337,000 --> 0:00:48,000
who learn to control and suppress their feelings

13
0:00:49.076,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and to act purely out of logic.

14
0:00:51.995,000 --> 0:00:53,000
As Mr. Spock is only half-Vulcan,

15
0:00:54.734,000 --> 0:00:59,000
he sees himself constantly in conflict in between logic and emotions,

16
0:01:00.315,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and as he's part of a team,

17
0:01:02.363,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the whole crew is struggling with,

18
0:01:05.267,000 --> 0:01:06,000
is analyzing,

19
0:01:07.062,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and is making fun of this conflict.

20
0:01:09.566,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And also the fans of Star Trek watch with amusement

21
0:01:12.497,000 --> 0:01:14,000
this seemingly contradictory behavior.

22
0:01:15.155,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They find it quite fascinating.

23
0:01:19.362,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And the matter is a golden thread

24
0:01:21.052,000 --> 0:01:24,000
through the whole Star Trek series and movies from the '60s until today.

25
0:01:25.091,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And that's actually what I want to talk about today:

26
0:01:27.94,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the role of emotions in science.

27
0:01:31.353,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We tend to think that science is all about facts and logic

28
0:01:35.72,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and human feelings are often neglected or considered an obstacle to get rid of.

29
0:01:40.989,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I would like to suggest that emotions are as important in science

30
0:01:45.324,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as they are in any other part of our lives.

31
0:01:48.195,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Science is made by humans,

32
0:01:50.402,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and as human beings,

33
0:01:52.131,000 --> 0:01:55,000
even if we try hard, we cannot get rid of our emotions.

34
0:01:56.704,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So instead of fighting them,

35
0:01:58.907,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I believe that even in science, we should make use of our feelings,

36
0:02:02.479,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because for breakthroughs and innovation,

37
0:02:04.709,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they are equally important as facts and logic.

38
0:02:09.256,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I will come back to Mr. Spock,

39
0:02:11.24,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but first let me share my experience on the role of emotions in science,

40
0:02:16.416,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and one story in particular kept me thinking about it

41
0:02:19.329,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for the last couple of years.

42
0:02:21.94,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I'm working in research on organic light-emitting diodes,

43
0:02:26.219,000 --> 0:02:27,000
so-called OLEDs.

44
0:02:28.233,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is how you might know them,

45
0:02:30.262,000 --> 0:02:32,000
as new generation of displays.

46
0:02:33.262,000 --> 0:02:37,000
OLEDs are more and more used in smartphone displays and TV screens.

47
0:02:37.611,000 --> 0:02:41,000
They make them appear bright, truly colorful and bendable.

48
0:02:43.963,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is how they look like

49
0:02:45.238,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the research lab of my physicist colleagues.

50
0:02:48.979,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And this is what I, as a chemist,

51
0:02:51.194,000 --> 0:02:53,000
have in mind when I think about them.

52
0:02:53.662,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I've loved it ever since I started to work on it.

53
0:02:57.415,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So I didn't really like the news

54
0:02:59.635,000 --> 0:03:01,000
when the company I had been working for --

55
0:03:01.977,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that was my previous employer --

56
0:03:04.203,000 --> 0:03:06,000
announced that they wanted to stop OLED research.

57
0:03:08.159,000 --> 0:03:1,000
At the time, the management had reasons for this decision,

58
0:03:11.114,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and the company handled it very well, actually.

59
0:03:13.556,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Nobody lost their jobs,

60
0:03:15.36,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and everybody was rewarded for their performed work.

61
0:03:19.043,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What I want to show you today

62
0:03:20.481,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is what happened with my scientist colleagues and me

63
0:03:23.427,000 --> 0:03:25,000
during the time in between the announcement

64
0:03:26.188,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and the last working day on our project.

65
0:03:29.067,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Consider it a small case study on emotions in science.

66
0:03:34.454,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In 2015, our research team had grown to more than 80 people,

67
0:03:39.255,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and even after the announcement that our project was discontinued,

68
0:03:42.748,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we could not stop working from one day to another.

69
0:03:45.759,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It took several months to bring all activities to a sound end

70
0:03:49.714,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and to find new jobs within the company for everyone.

71
0:03:53.088,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Here's what happened.

72
0:03:54.445,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Even though we knew that we were working on a project

73
0:03:57.116,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that was to be stopped,

74
0:03:59.136,000 --> 0:04:02,000
during those months our output hit the roof.

75
0:04:03.377,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We were actually working on two different OLED projects:

76
0:04:06.781,000 --> 0:04:09,000
first, the development of materials for blue-shining OLEDs,

77
0:04:10.798,000 --> 0:04:12,000
which had started in 2001;

78
0:04:13.458,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and second, materials for green OLEDs, which had started in 2014.

79
0:04:19.155,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And the results I show you here concern the green OLED project.

80
0:04:23.297,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In the graph, you can see how the lifetime,

81
0:04:26.053,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which is a crucial measure for the durability of our devices,

82
0:04:29.864,000 --> 0:04:3,000
developed over time.

83
0:04:32.677,000 --> 0:04:36,000
In 2015, just half a year into the project,

84
0:04:36.772,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we were told to scale down,

85
0:04:39.202,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to stop working on the project as soon as possible

86
0:04:42.401,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and to start over in other jobs.

87
0:04:44.987,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Nevertheless, from this time on,

88
0:04:47.552,000 --> 0:04:5,000
our results continued to improve rapidly.

89
0:04:52.097,000 --> 0:04:53,000
How did that happen?

90
0:04:55.07,000 --> 0:04:59,000
After the announcement, pretty quickly, colleagues started leaving the team,

91
0:04:59.357,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and soon, we were left in a small group,

92
0:05:01.817,000 --> 0:05:04,000
all pretty much sharing the same attitude of,

93
0:05:04.885,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"I'm going to be the last person leaving the ship."

94
0:05:08.41,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What I mean is,

95
0:05:09.906,000 --> 0:05:13,000
while the number of scientists working on the project was decreasing,

96
0:05:13.959,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the dedication of people remaining grew dramatically.

97
0:05:19.054,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And also, a new and more intense team spirit formed.

98
0:05:23.543,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We all shared the same passion for our work,

99
0:05:26.794,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we all were sad that it was about to end,

100
0:05:30.095,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and we all wanted to show that we could turn our ideas into reality.

101
0:05:34.647,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We felt that we belonged to something bigger.

102
0:05:38.79,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And furthermore,

103
0:05:40.393,000 --> 0:05:43,000
our project was less and less in the focus of the management,

104
0:05:44.109,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because they started to think about new projects,

105
0:05:46.84,000 --> 0:05:47,000
restructuring and so on.

106
0:05:49.434,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This resulted in additional freedom

107
0:05:52.181,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and the possibility to take a few things into our own hands.

108
0:05:57.001,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Of course, more freedom also means more responsibility,

109
0:06:01.771,000 --> 0:06:04,000
which we were happy to take, because we believed in our work.

110
0:06:05.989,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We felt empowered.

111
0:06:08.589,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And these three pillars --

112
0:06:10.409,000 --> 0:06:14,000
dedication, belonging and empowerment --

113
0:06:15.261,000 --> 0:06:18,000
worked together in a kind of self-reinforcing cycle,

114
0:06:18.73,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the closer we got to shutdown,

115
0:06:20.903,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the better our output became.

116
0:06:23.241,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we were working with such personal engagement

117
0:06:25.821,000 --> 0:06:27,000
on a project already sentenced to death

118
0:06:28.131,000 --> 0:06:31,000
because we felt connected to something meaningful.

119
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Of course, it was also a hard and sometimes frustrating time,

120
0:06:38.425,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but we were sitting together in the lab,

121
0:06:40.465,000 --> 0:06:42,000
or occasionally in the café,

122
0:06:42.569,000 --> 0:06:45,000
sharing our sadness about the end of our project

123
0:06:45.95,000 --> 0:06:47,000
as well as the joy in our work.

124
0:06:48.505,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So overall, we had a very intense and mesmerizingly exciting time.

125
0:06:54.466,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And the lifetime we finally obtained for our materials

126
0:06:58.394,000 --> 0:07:01,000
was on one level with already commercialized materials

127
0:07:01.957,000 --> 0:07:03,000
for green OLEDs at the time,

128
0:07:04.098,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and we achieved this within just one year.

129
0:07:07.431,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And those results helped our employer

130
0:07:10.503,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to sell the patents for real value.

131
0:07:14.923,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, let me tell you the same story

132
0:07:18.133,000 --> 0:07:21,000
with different characters and a slightly different operation.

133
0:07:22.341,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The story is part of Star Trek.

134
0:07:24.602,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And sorry for those of you who haven't seen the movies,

135
0:07:27.239,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but I need to introduce a spoiler here.

136
0:07:30.643,000 --> 0:07:34,000
After Mr. Spock sacrificed himself to save the starship Enterprise

137
0:07:35.355,000 --> 0:07:37,000
at the end of Star Trek II,

138
0:07:37.679,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Captain Kirk and his core team

139
0:07:39.27,000 --> 0:07:43,000
were determined to hunt through the universe to search for Spock,

140
0:07:43.497,000 --> 0:07:45,000
even though they could see only very little chance

141
0:07:46.105,000 --> 0:07:47,000
in finding him alive.

142
0:07:48.393,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And Starfleet Command did not give them permission

143
0:07:51.218,000 --> 0:07:53,000
nor a starship to do so,

144
0:07:53.351,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so they took it very passionately into their own hands

145
0:07:56.796,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to travel out to find Spock.

146
0:07:59.657,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And after dealing with great challenges, they eventually found Spock,

147
0:08:03.599,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and he happily and gratefully joined the team again.

148
0:08:08.235,000 --> 0:08:11,000
He could feel the dedication and the connection of his team

149
0:08:11.807,000 --> 0:08:14,000
towards their project, which was to save him

150
0:08:15.275,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and to hold the crew together.

151
0:08:18.172,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And over the years, over the episodes of the saga,

152
0:08:22.112,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Mr. Spock came to realize

153
0:08:23.724,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that the combination of both logic and emotions

154
0:08:28.767,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is crucial for facing challenges and exploring new worlds,

155
0:08:33.592,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and there was no contradiction anymore.

156
0:08:37.151,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So the storyline here for both our OLED story and Star Trek

157
0:08:42.238,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is actually the basic setting for a lot of breakthrough stories,

158
0:08:45.461,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in and out of science.

159
0:08:48.279,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The main characters are all part of a great team.

160
0:08:52.915,000 --> 0:08:56,000
All team members show a huge dedication towards reaching their goal.

161
0:08:58.71,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They strive to seize all the freedom they can get,

162
0:09:02.171,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and they take the responsibility they need to take.

163
0:09:07.299,000 --> 0:09:1,000
During the time our OLED project was nearing the end,

164
0:09:10.641,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I received one piece of advice several times.

165
0:09:15.218,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"Don't take it to your heart.

166
0:09:17.591,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You can work on something else."

167
0:09:20.456,000 --> 0:09:21,000
If I had followed it,

168
0:09:21.973,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it would have saved me several depressed evenings

169
0:09:25.687,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and many tears,

170
0:09:28.095,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but at the same time,

171
0:09:29.532,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I would have failed to gain a great deal in personal development and happiness.

172
0:09:36.375,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And as the same is true for my colleagues and our whole project,

173
0:09:39.734,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we would have achieved far less.

174
0:09:42.614,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So of course, science should be based on facts and logic.

175
0:09:47.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
When I say we should use our emotions in science,

176
0:09:51.196,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I do not suggest we should use feelings instead of facts.

177
0:09:55.321,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But I say we should not be afraid of using our feelings

178
0:09:58.683,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to implement and to catalyze fact-based science and innovation.

179
0:10:03.229,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Emotions and logic do not oppose each other.

180
0:10:06.967,000 --> 0:10:08,000
They complement each other,

181
0:10:09.1,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and they reinforce each other.

182
0:10:12.317,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The feeling of being dedicated to something meaningful,

183
0:10:16.601,000 --> 0:10:19,000
of belonging to something bigger

184
0:10:19.79,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and of being empowered

185
0:10:21.784,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is crucial for creativity and innovation.

186
0:10:26.063,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Whatever you are working on,

187
0:10:28.643,000 --> 0:10:29,000
make sure that it matters,

188
0:10:31.254,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and take it to your heart as much as you like.

189
0:10:34.642,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Thank you.

190
0:10:35.817,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.24,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Pat Mitchell: So I was thinking about female friendship a lot,

2
0:00:15.8,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and by the way, these two women,

3
0:00:18.08,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm very honored to say,

4
0:00:19.48,000 --> 0:00:21,000
have been my friends for a very long time, too.

5
0:00:22.44,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Jane Fonda: Yes we have.

6
0:00:23.68,000 --> 0:00:26,000
PM: And one of the things that I read about female friendship

7
0:00:27.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is something that Cervantes said.

8
0:00:28.84,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He said, "You can tell a lot about someone,"

9
0:00:32.24,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in this case a woman,

10
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"by the company that she keeps."

11
0:00:35.92,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So let's start with --

12
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:41,000
JF: We're in big trouble.

14
0:00:41.96,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Lily Tomlin: Hand me one of those waters,

15
0:00:43.96,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I'm extremely dry.

16
0:00:45.2,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:54,000
JF: You're taking up our time.

18
0:00:55.64,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We have a very limited --

19
0:00:56.96,000 --> 0:00:58,000
LT: Just being with her sucks the life out of me.

20
0:00:59.32,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:02.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
JF: You ain't seen nothing yet.

22
0:01:03.88,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Anyway -- sorry.

23
0:01:05.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
PM: So tell me, what do you look for in a friend?

24
0:01:09.52,000 --> 0:01:11,000
LT: I look for someone who has a sense of fun,

25
0:01:12.12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
who's audacious,

26
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:18,000
who's forthcoming, who has politics,

27
0:01:18.6,000 --> 0:01:22,000
who has even a small scrap of passion for the planet,

28
0:01:23.48,000 --> 0:01:25,000
someone who's decent, has a sense of justice

29
0:01:26.12,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and who thinks I'm worthwhile.

30
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:30.24,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Applause)

32
0:01:34.76,000 --> 0:01:36,000
JF: You know, I was thinking this morning,

33
0:01:36.8,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I don't even know what I would do without my women friends.

34
0:01:39.64,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I mean it's, "I have my friends, therefore I am."

35
0:01:42.68,000 --> 0:01:43,000
LT: (Laughter)

36
0:01:43.92,000 --> 0:01:44,000
JF: No, it's true.

37
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I exist because I have my women friends. They --

38
0:01:48.32,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You're one of them.

39
0:01:49.56,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I don't know about you. But anyway --

40
0:01:51.346,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:52.52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You know, they make me stronger, they make me smarter,

42
0:01:55.12,000 --> 0:01:56,000
they make me braver.

43
0:01:56.72,000 --> 0:02:,000
They tap me on the shoulder when I might be in need of course-correcting.

44
0:02:01.52,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And most of them are a good deal younger than me, too.

45
0:02:04.24,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You know? I mean, it's nice -- LT: Thank you.

46
0:02:06.92,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:09.4,000 --> 0:02:12,000
JF: No, I do, I include you in that, because listen, you know --

48
0:02:12.48,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it's nice to have somebody still around to play with and learn from

49
0:02:15.68,000 --> 0:02:16,000
when you're getting toward the end.

50
0:02:17.6,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I'm approaching -- I'll be there sooner than you.

51
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
LT: No, I'm glad to have you parallel aging alongside me.

52
0:02:22.639,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:24.72,000 --> 0:02:25,000
JF: I'm showing you the way.

54
0:02:26.24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:27.48,000 --> 0:02:28,000
LT: Well, you are and you have.

56
0:02:29.4,000 --> 0:02:3,000
PM: Well, as we grow older,

57
0:02:30.76,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and as we go through different kinds of life's journeys,

58
0:02:33.64,000 --> 0:02:36,000
what do you do to keep your friendships vital and alive?

59
0:02:38.12,000 --> 0:02:39,000
LT: Well you have to use a lot of --

60
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:41,000
JF: She doesn't invite me over much, I'll tell you that.

61
0:02:42.56,000 --> 0:02:44,000
LT: I have to use a lot of social media --

62
0:02:44.6,000 --> 0:02:45,000
You be quiet now. And so --

63
0:02:46.12,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:48.44,000 --> 0:02:51,000
LT: And I look through my emails, I look through my texts

65
0:02:51.48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to find my friends,

66
0:02:52.72,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so I can answer them as quickly as possible,

67
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because I know they need my counsel.

68
0:02:57.28,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:00.08,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They need my support,

70
0:03:01.36,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because most of my friends are writers, or activists, or actors,

71
0:03:04.48,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and you're all three ...

72
0:03:05.8,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and a long string of other descriptive phrases,

73
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and I want to get to you as soon as possible,

74
0:03:13.76,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I want you to know that I'm there for you.

75
0:03:15.84,000 --> 0:03:16,000
JF: Do you do emojis?

76
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
LT: Oh ... JF: No?

77
0:03:19.08,000 --> 0:03:21,000
LT: That's embarrassing. JF: I'm really into emojis.

78
0:03:21.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
LT: No, I spell out my --

79
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I spell out my words of happiness and congratulations,

80
0:03:27.8,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and sadness.

81
0:03:29.48,000 --> 0:03:3,000
JF: You spell it right out --

82
0:03:30.92,000 --> 0:03:31,000
LT: I spell it, every letter.

83
0:03:32.325,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:33.92,000 --> 0:03:34,000
JF: Such a purist.

85
0:03:35.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You know, as I've gotten older,

86
0:03:37.08,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I've understood more the importance of friendships,

87
0:03:40.32,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and so, I really make an effort

88
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to reach out and make play dates -- not let too much time go by.

89
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I read a lot

90
0:03:48.08,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so, as Lily knows all too well,

91
0:03:50.04,000 --> 0:03:52,000
my books that I like, I send to my friends.

92
0:03:52.12,000 --> 0:03:53,000
LT: When we knew we would be here today

93
0:03:54.08,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you sent me a lot of books about women, female friendships,

94
0:03:56.92,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I was so surprised to see how many books,

95
0:04:00.48,000 --> 0:04:02,000
how much research has been done recently --

96
0:04:02.84,000 --> 0:04:04,000
JF: And were you grateful? LT: I was grateful.

97
0:04:05.36,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:10.4,000 --> 0:04:11,000
PM: And --

99
0:04:11.64,000 --> 0:04:14,000
LT: Wait, no, it's really important because this is another example

100
0:04:14.84,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of how women are overlooked, put aside, marginalized.

101
0:04:18.24,000 --> 0:04:2,000
There's been very little research done on us,

102
0:04:21.04,000 --> 0:04:22,000
even though we volunteered lots of times.

103
0:04:23.04,000 --> 0:04:24,000
JF: That's for sure.

104
0:04:24.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:26.96,000 --> 0:04:29,000
LT: This is really exciting, and you all will be interested in this.

106
0:04:30.2,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The Harvard Medical School study has shown

107
0:04:32.92,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that women who have close female friendships

108
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
are less likely to develop impairments --

109
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:42,000
physical impairments as they age,

110
0:04:42.96,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they are likely to be seen to be living much more vital, exciting --

111
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:49,000
JF: And longer --

112
0:04:49.72,000 --> 0:04:5,000
LT: Joyful lives.

113
0:04:50.96,000 --> 0:04:51,000
JF: We live five years longer than men.

114
0:04:52.88,000 --> 0:04:54,000
LT: I think I'd trade the years for joy.

115
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

116
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:05:,000
LT: But the most important part is they found --

117
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the results were so exciting and so conclusive --

118
0:05:04.88,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the researchers found

119
0:05:06.8,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that not having close female friends is detrimental to your health,

120
0:05:12.56,000 --> 0:05:14,000
as much as smoking or being overweight.

121
0:05:15.56,000 --> 0:05:16,000
JF: And there's something else, too --

122
0:05:17.44,000 --> 0:05:18,000
LT: I've said my part, so ...

123
0:05:18.88,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:19.92,000 --> 0:05:22,000
JF: OK, well, listen to my part, because there's an additional thing.

125
0:05:23.6,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Because they only -- for years, decades --

126
0:05:25.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they only researched men when they were trying to understand stress,

127
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:34,000
only very recently have they researched what happens to women when we're stressed,

128
0:05:34.6,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and it turns out that when we're stressed -- women,

129
0:05:38.96,000 --> 0:05:41,000
our bodies get flooded by oxytocin.

130
0:05:42.2,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Which is a feel-good, calming, stress-reducing hormone.

131
0:05:45.72,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Which is also increased when we're with our women friends.

132
0:05:50.8,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And I do think that's one reason why we live longer.

133
0:05:54.2,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And I feel so bad for men because they don't have that.

134
0:05:56.84,000 --> 0:06:,000
Testosterone in men diminishes the effects of oxytocin.

135
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:04,000
LT: Well, when you and I and Dolly made "9 to 5" ...

136
0:06:04.32,000 --> 0:06:05,000
JF: Oh --

137
0:06:05.56,000 --> 0:06:07,000
LT: We laughed, we did, we laughed so much,

138
0:06:07.64,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we found we had so much in common and we're so different.

139
0:06:10.36,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Here she is, like Hollywood royalty,

140
0:06:12.099,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I'm like a tough kid from Detroit,

141
0:06:14.2,000 --> 0:06:18,000
[Dolly's] a Southern kid from a poor town in Tennessee,

142
0:06:18.92,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and we found we were so in sync as women,

143
0:06:22.36,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and we must have --

144
0:06:23.6,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we laughed -- we must have added at least a decade onto our lifespans.

145
0:06:29.76,000 --> 0:06:31,000
JF: I think -- we sure crossed our legs a lot.

146
0:06:32.56,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:34.56,000 --> 0:06:36,000
If you know what I mean.

148
0:06:37.2,000 --> 0:06:39,000
LT: I think we all know what you mean.

149
0:06:39.4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:41.44,000 --> 0:06:43,000
PM: You're adding decades to our lives right now.

151
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So among the books that Jane sent us both to read on female friendship

152
0:06:49.12,000 --> 0:06:52,000
was one by a woman we admire greatly, Sister Joan Chittister,

153
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
who said about female friendship

154
0:06:55.12,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that women friends are not just a social act,

155
0:06:59.4,000 --> 0:07:,000
they're a spiritual act.

156
0:07:01.32,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Do you think of your friends as spiritual?

157
0:07:03.56,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Do they add something spiritual to your lives?

158
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
LT: Spiritual -- I absolutely think that.

159
0:07:10.04,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Because -- especially people you've known a long time,

160
0:07:13.12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
people you've spent time with --

161
0:07:14.72,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I can see the spiritual essence inside them,

162
0:07:17.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the tenderness, the vulnerability.

163
0:07:22.44,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There's actually kind of a love, an element of love in the relationship.

164
0:07:26.64,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I just see deeply into your soul.

165
0:07:30.32,000 --> 0:07:31,000
PM: Do you think that, Jane --

166
0:07:31.8,000 --> 0:07:32,000
LT: But I have special powers.

167
0:07:34.12,000 --> 0:07:35,000
JF: Well, there's all kinds of friends.

168
0:07:36.04,000 --> 0:07:38,000
There's business friends, and party friends,

169
0:07:38.6,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I've got a lot of those.

170
0:07:40.04,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:42.04,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But the oxytocin-producing friendships have ...

172
0:07:47.32,000 --> 0:07:51,000
They feel spiritual because it's a heart opening, right?

173
0:07:51.84,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You know, we go deep. And --

174
0:07:54.84,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I find that I shed tears a lot with my intimate friends.

175
0:08:01.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Not because I'm sad but because I'm so touched and inspired by them.

176
0:08:06.36,000 --> 0:08:08,000
LT: And you know one of you is going to go soon.

177
0:08:09.12,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

178
0:08:14.52,000 --> 0:08:18,000
PM: Well, two of us are sitting here, Lily, which one are you talking about?

179
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:20.4,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I always think, when women talk about their friendships,

181
0:08:23.24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that men always look a little mystified.

182
0:08:26.52,000 --> 0:08:28,000
What are the differences, in your opinion,

183
0:08:29.08,000 --> 0:08:31,000
between men friendships and women friendships?

184
0:08:32.08,000 --> 0:08:33,000
JF: There's a lot of difference,

185
0:08:34.08,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and I think we have to have a lot of empathy for men --

186
0:08:37.04,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

187
0:08:38.76,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that they don't have what we have.

188
0:08:43.04,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Which I think may be why they die sooner.

189
0:08:45.6,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

190
0:08:47.159,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I have a lot of compassion for men,

191
0:08:49.88,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because women, no kidding, we --

192
0:08:53.52,000 --> 0:08:58,000
women's relationships, our friendships are full disclosure, we go deep.

193
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
They're revelatory.

194
0:09:01.76,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We risk vulnerability -- this is something men don't do.

195
0:09:06.12,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I mean how many times have I asked you, "Am I doing OK?"

196
0:09:09.68,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"Did I really screw up there?"

197
0:09:11.96,000 --> 0:09:12,000
PM: You're doing great.

198
0:09:13.36,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

199
0:09:14.48,000 --> 0:09:17,000
JF: But I mean, we ask questions like that

200
0:09:17.64,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of our women friends,

201
0:09:18.88,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and men don't.

202
0:09:20.92,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You know, people describe women's relationships as face-to-face,

203
0:09:24.84,000 --> 0:09:27,000
whereas men's friendships are more side-by-side.

204
0:09:27.88,000 --> 0:09:3,000
LT: I mean most of the time men don't want to reveal their emotions,

205
0:09:31.64,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they want to bury deeper feelings.

206
0:09:33.36,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I mean, that's the general, conventional thought.

207
0:09:36.4,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They would rather go off in their man cave and watch a game or hit golf balls,

208
0:09:40.96,000 --> 0:09:44,000
or talk about sports, or hunting, or cars or have sex.

209
0:09:45.6,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I mean, it's just the kind of -- it's a more manly behavior.

210
0:09:48.88,000 --> 0:09:5,000
JF: You meant -- LT: They talk about sex.

211
0:09:51.2,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I meant they might have sex

212
0:09:52.92,000 --> 0:09:54,000
if they could get somebody in their man cave to --

213
0:09:55.32,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Laughter)

214
0:09:58.36,000 --> 0:10:01,000
JF: You know something, though, that I find very interesting --

215
0:10:01.6,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and again, psychologists didn't know this until relatively recently --

216
0:10:06.2,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is that men are born every bit as relational as women are.

217
0:10:09.96,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If you look at films of newborn baby boys and girls,

218
0:10:13.6,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you'll see the baby boys just like the girls,

219
0:10:15.72,000 --> 0:10:17,000
gazing into their mother's eyes,

220
0:10:18.08,000 --> 0:10:22,000
you know, needing that relational exchange of energy.

221
0:10:22.28,000 --> 0:10:27,000
When the mother looks away, they could see the dismay on the child,

222
0:10:27.6,000 --> 0:10:28,000
even the boy would cry.

223
0:10:28.88,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They need relationship.

224
0:10:30.76,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So the question is why, as they grow older, does that change?

225
0:10:34.76,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And the answer is patriarchal culture,

226
0:10:37.12,000 --> 0:10:39,000
which says to boys and young men

227
0:10:40.12,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that to be needing of relationship, to be emotional with someone is girly.

228
0:10:45.4,000 --> 0:10:5,000
That a real man doesn't ask directions or express a need,

229
0:10:51.08,000 --> 0:10:53,000
they don't go to doctors if they feel bad.

230
0:10:53.4,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They don't ask for help.

231
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:56,000
There's a quote that I really like,

232
0:10:56.72,000 --> 0:11:,000
"Men fear that becoming 'we' will erase his 'I'."

233
0:11:01.48,000 --> 0:11:02,000
You know, his sense of self.

234
0:11:03.2,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Whereas women's sense of self has always been kind of porous.

235
0:11:07.72,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But our "we" is our saving grace,

236
0:11:11.56,000 --> 0:11:13,000
it's what makes us strong.

237
0:11:14.04,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's not that we're better than men,

238
0:11:15.8,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we just don't have our masculinity to prove.

239
0:11:18.44,000 --> 0:11:19,000
LT: And, well --

240
0:11:19.68,000 --> 0:11:2,000
JF: That's a Gloria Steinem quote.

241
0:11:21.36,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So we can express our humanity -- LT: I know who Gloria Steinem is.

242
0:11:24.76,000 --> 0:11:26,000
JF: I know you know who she is, but I think it's a --

243
0:11:27.261,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Laughter)

244
0:11:29.32,000 --> 0:11:3,000
No, but it's a great quote, I think.

245
0:11:31.2,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We're not better than men, we just don't have our masculinity to prove.

246
0:11:35.48,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And that's really important.

247
0:11:36.88,000 --> 0:11:38,000
LT: But men are so inculcated in the culture

248
0:11:39.48,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to be comfortable in the patriarchy.

249
0:11:42.64,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And we've got to make something different happen.

250
0:11:45.6,000 --> 0:11:49,000
JF: Women's friendships are like a renewable source of power.

251
0:11:49.8,000 --> 0:11:51,000
LT: Well, that's what's exciting about this subject.

252
0:11:52.28,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It's because our friendships --

253
0:11:53.84,000 --> 0:11:57,000
female friendships are just a hop to our sisterhood,

254
0:11:58.48,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and sisterhood can be a very powerful force,

255
0:12:01.92,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to give the world --

256
0:12:03.36,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to make it what it should be --

257
0:12:05.2,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the things that humans desperately need.

258
0:12:08.84,000 --> 0:12:09,000
PM: It is why we're talking about it,

259
0:12:10.68,000 --> 0:12:11,000
because women's friendships are,

260
0:12:12.4,000 --> 0:12:13,000
as you said, Jane,

261
0:12:13.64,000 --> 0:12:14,000
a renewable source of power.

262
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So how do we use that power?

263
0:12:17.76,000 --> 0:12:2,000
JF: Well, women are the fastest growing demographic in the world,

264
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
especially older women.

265
0:12:22.4,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And if we harness our power, we can change the world.

266
0:12:26.48,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And guess what? We need to.

267
0:12:28.04,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Applause)

268
0:12:30.2,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And we need to do it soon.

269
0:12:31.52,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And one of the things that we need to do --

270
0:12:34.04,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and we can do it as women --

271
0:12:35.6,000 --> 0:12:38,000
for one thing, we kind of set the consumer standards.

272
0:12:38.72,000 --> 0:12:4,000
We need to consume less.

273
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We in the Western world need to consume less

274
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and when we buy things, we need to buy things that are made locally,

275
0:12:47.4,000 --> 0:12:5,000
when we buy food, we need to buy food that's grown locally.

276
0:12:50.52,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We are the ones that need to get off the grid.

277
0:12:53.76,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We need to make ourselves independent from fossil fuels.

278
0:12:59.52,000 --> 0:13:,000
And the fossil fuel companies --

279
0:13:01.52,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the Exxons and the Shell Oils and those bad guys --

280
0:13:04.68,000 --> 0:13:05,000
cause they are --

281
0:13:05.92,000 --> 0:13:08,000
are going to tell us that we can't do it without going back to the Stone Age.

282
0:13:09.8,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You know, that the alternatives just aren't quite there yet,

283
0:13:12.68,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and that's not true.

284
0:13:14.04,000 --> 0:13:16,000
There are countries in the world right now

285
0:13:16.12,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that are living mostly on renewable energy and doing just fine.

286
0:13:19.48,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And they tell us that if we do wean ourselves from fossil fuel

287
0:13:23.64,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that we're going to be back in the Stone Age,

288
0:13:25.8,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and in fact, if we begin to use renewable energy,

289
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and not drill in the Arctic, and not drill --

290
0:13:32.19,000 --> 0:13:33,000
LT: Oh, boy.

291
0:13:33.38,000 --> 0:13:35,000
JF: And not drill in the Alberta tar sands --

292
0:13:35.52,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Right.

293
0:13:36.76,000 --> 0:13:37,000
That we will be --

294
0:13:38.04,000 --> 0:13:41,000
there will be more democracy and more jobs and more well-being,

295
0:13:41.44,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and it's women that are going to lead the way.

296
0:13:43.68,000 --> 0:13:47,000
LT: Maybe we have the momentum to start a third-wave feminist movement

297
0:13:48.08,000 --> 0:13:5,000
with our sisterhood around the world,

298
0:13:50.68,000 --> 0:13:53,000
with women we don't see, women we may never meet,

299
0:13:53.88,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but we join together that way,

300
0:13:56.4,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because --

301
0:13:57.64,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Aristotle said --

302
0:13:59.92,000 --> 0:14:,000
most people --

303
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
people would die without male friendships.

304
0:14:04.08,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And the operative word here was "male."

305
0:14:07.36,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Because they thought that friendships should be between equals

306
0:14:10.32,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and women were not considered equal --

307
0:14:12.56,000 --> 0:14:14,000
JF: They didn't think we had souls even, the Greeks.

308
0:14:15.04,000 --> 0:14:18,000
LT: No, exactly. That shows you just how limited Aristotle was.

309
0:14:18.92,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Laughter)

310
0:14:21.52,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And wait, no, here's the best part.

311
0:14:23.44,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It's like, you know, men do need women now.

312
0:14:27.08,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The planet needs women.

313
0:14:29.24,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The US Constitution needs women.

314
0:14:31.72,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We are not even in the Constitution.

315
0:14:34.52,000 --> 0:14:36,000
JF: You're talking about the Equal Rights Amendment.

316
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:38,000
LT: Right.

317
0:14:38.182,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Justice Ginsberg said something like --

318
0:14:43.92,000 --> 0:14:46,000
every constitution that's been written since the end of World War II

319
0:14:47.52,000 --> 0:14:51,000
included a provision that made women citizens of equal stature,

320
0:14:52.52,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but ours does not.

321
0:14:54.24,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So that would be a good place to start.

322
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Very, very mild --

323
0:14:58.24,000 --> 0:14:59,000
JF: Right.

324
0:14:59.48,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Applause)

325
0:15:02.2,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And gender equality, it's like a tide,

326
0:15:04.88,000 --> 0:15:05,000
it would lift all boats, not just women.

327
0:15:06.84,000 --> 0:15:08,000
PM: Needing new role models on how to do that.

328
0:15:09.4,000 --> 0:15:1,000
How to be friends,

329
0:15:10.84,000 --> 0:15:12,000
how to think about our power in different ways,

330
0:15:13.76,000 --> 0:15:14,000
as consumers,

331
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:16,000
as citizens of the world,

332
0:15:16.68,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and this is what makes Jane and Lily

333
0:15:19.12,000 --> 0:15:21,000
a role model of how women can be friends --

334
0:15:21.88,000 --> 0:15:22,000
for a very long time,

335
0:15:23.52,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and even if they occasionally disagree.

336
0:15:25.96,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Thank you.

337
0:15:28.36,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you both.

338
0:15:29.6,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Applause)

339
0:15:30.84,000 --> 0:15:31,000
JF: Thanks.

340
0:15:35.56,000 --> 0:15:36,000
LT: Thank you.

341
0:15:36.8,000 --> 0:15:37,000
JF: Thank you.

342
0:15:38.053,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Applause)

[This talk contains mature content]

2
0:00:16.68,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My mother called this summer to stage an intervention.

3
0:00:22.52,000 --> 0:00:27,000
She'd come across a few snippets of my memoir,

4
0:00:28.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which wasn't even out yet,

5
0:00:30.28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and she was concerned.

6
0:00:33.04,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It wasn't the sex.

7
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:36.56,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It was the language that disturbed her.

9
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:41,000
For example:

10
0:00:43.76,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"I have been so many things

11
0:00:45.84,000 --> 0:00:46,000
along my curious journey:

12
0:00:48.52,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a poor boy, a nigger,

13
0:00:51.28,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a Yale man, a Harvard man,

14
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:56,000
a faggot, a Christian,

15
0:00:56.76,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a crack baby, alleged,

16
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:01:,000
the spawn of Satan, the Second Coming,

17
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Casey."

18
0:01:03.64,000 --> 0:01:04,000
That's just page six.

19
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So you may understand my mother's worry.

21
0:01:10.84,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But she wanted only to make one small change.

22
0:01:15.88,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So she called, and she began,

23
0:01:19.52,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"Hey, you are a man.

24
0:01:23.88,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You're not a faggot, you're not a punk,

25
0:01:26.6,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and let me tell you the difference.

26
0:01:28.32,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You are prominent. You are intelligent.

27
0:01:30.92,000 --> 0:01:31,000
You dress well. You know how to speak.

28
0:01:32.92,000 --> 0:01:33,000
People like you.

29
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You don't walk around doing your hand like a punk.

30
0:01:37.44,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You're not a vagabond on the street.

31
0:01:39.8,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You are an upstanding person

32
0:01:42.32,000 --> 0:01:43,000
who just happens to be gay.

33
0:01:44.92,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Don't put yourself over there

34
0:01:47.68,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when you are over here."

35
0:01:51.48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
She thought she'd done me a favor,

36
0:01:54.44,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and in a way, she had.

37
0:01:56.92,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Her call clarified what I am trying to do with my life

38
0:02:03.28,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and in my work as a writer,

39
0:02:05.92,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which is to send one simple message:

40
0:02:09.56,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the way we're taught to live has got to change.

41
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I learned this the hard way.

42
0:02:16.24,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I was born not on the wrong side of the tracks,

43
0:02:18.48,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but on the wrong side of a whole river,

44
0:02:20.479,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the Trinity, down in Oak Cliff, Texas.

45
0:02:23.68,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I was raised there in part by my grandmother

46
0:02:26.12,000 --> 0:02:27,000
who worked as a domestic,

47
0:02:27.44,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and by my sister,

48
0:02:29.56,000 --> 0:02:32,000
who adopted me a few years after our mother,

49
0:02:33.12,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who struggled with mental illness,

50
0:02:35.12,000 --> 0:02:36,000
disappeared.

51
0:02:36.96,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And it was that disappearance,

52
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that began when I was 13 and lasted for five years,

53
0:02:42.52,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that shaped the person I became,

54
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the person I later had to unbecome.

55
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Before she left, my mother had been my human hiding place.

56
0:02:53.44,000 --> 0:02:57,000
She was the only other person who seemed as strange as me,

57
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
beautifully strange,

58
0:02:59.44,000 --> 0:03:02,000
some mix of Blanche DuBois from "A Streetcar Named Desire"

59
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and a 1980s Whitney Houston.

60
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:08.2,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'm not saying she was perfect,

62
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:13,000
just that I sure benefited from her imperfections.

63
0:03:14.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And maybe that's what magic is, after all:

64
0:03:16.8,000 --> 0:03:17,000
a useful mistake.

65
0:03:19.28,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So when she began to disappear for days at a time,

66
0:03:22.08,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I turned to some magic of my own.

67
0:03:24.08,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It struck me, as from above,

68
0:03:26.24,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that I could conjure up my mother just by walking perfectly

69
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:33,000
from my elementary school at the top of a steep hill

70
0:03:33.6,000 --> 0:03:35,000
all the way down to my grandmother's house,

71
0:03:36.6,000 --> 0:03:4,000
placing one foot, and one foot only, in each sidewalk square.

72
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I couldn't let any part of any foot touch the line between the square,

73
0:03:45.28,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I couldn't skip a square,

74
0:03:46.64,000 --> 0:03:49,000
all the way to the last square at the last blade of grass

75
0:03:49.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that separated our lawn from our driveway.

76
0:03:53.48,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I bullshit you not, it worked --

77
0:03:56.76,000 --> 0:03:57,000
just once though.

78
0:03:58.96,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But if my perfect walk could not bring my mother back,

79
0:04:02.92,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I found that this approach had other uses.

80
0:04:07.24,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I found that everyone else in charge around me

81
0:04:09.44,000 --> 0:04:11,000
loved nothing more than perfection,

82
0:04:12.4,000 --> 0:04:14,000
obedience, submission.

83
0:04:15.2,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Or at least if I submitted, they wouldn't bother me too much.

84
0:04:18.12,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So I took a bargain

85
0:04:20.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that I'd later see in a prison, a Stasi prison in Berlin,

86
0:04:25.24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
on a sign that read,

87
0:04:26.72,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"He who adapts can live tolerably."

88
0:04:31.04,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It was a bargain that helped ensure

89
0:04:32.959,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I had a place to stay and food to eat;

90
0:04:37.12,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a bargain that won me praise of teachers and kin, strangers;

91
0:04:41.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
a bargain that paid off big time, it seemed,

92
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:47,000
when one day at 17, a man from Yale showed up at my high school to recruit me

93
0:04:48.24,000 --> 0:04:49,000
for Yale's football team.

94
0:04:50.24,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It felt as out of the blue to me then as it may to you now.

95
0:04:53.8,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The Yale man said -- everybody said --

96
0:04:57.12,000 --> 0:05:,000
that this was the best thing that could ever happen to me,

97
0:05:00.64,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the best thing that could happen to the whole community.

98
0:05:03.32,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"Take this ticket, boy," they told me.

99
0:05:06.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I was not so sure.

100
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Yale seemed another world entire:

101
0:05:11.76,000 --> 0:05:14,000
a cold, foreign, hostile place.

102
0:05:16.36,000 --> 0:05:17,000
On the first day of my recruiting visit,

103
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I texted my sister an excuse for not going.

104
0:05:20.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"These people are so weird."

105
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
She replied, "You'll fit right in."

106
0:05:26.12,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I took the ticket

108
0:05:31.92,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and worked damn hard to fit right in.

109
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:38,000
When my freshman advisor warned me not to wear my fitted hats on campus ...

110
0:05:38.44,000 --> 0:05:41,000
"You're at Yale now. You don't have to do that anymore," she said.

111
0:05:43.28,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I figured, this was just one of the small prices

112
0:05:46.2,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that must be paid to make it.

113
0:05:49.28,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I paid them all, or tried,

114
0:05:52.2,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and sure enough they seemed to pay me back:

115
0:05:54.96,000 --> 0:05:57,000
made me a leader on the varsity football team;

116
0:05:58.32,000 --> 0:06:,000
got me into a not-so-secret society

117
0:06:00.76,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and a job on Wall Street, and later in Washington.

118
0:06:03.32,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Things were going so well that I figured naturally

119
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I should be President of the United States.

120
0:06:09.4,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But since I was only 24

122
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and since even presidents have to start somewhere,

123
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I settled instead on a run for Congress.

124
0:06:21.24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now, this was in the afterglow of that great 2008 election:

125
0:06:25.64,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the election during which a serious, moderate senator stressed,

126
0:06:30.8,000 --> 0:06:33,000
"The message you've got to send more than any other message

127
0:06:34.68,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is that Barack Obama is just like us."

128
0:06:38.52,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They sent that message so well

129
0:06:40.48,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that their campaign became the gold standard of modern politics,

130
0:06:43.68,000 --> 0:06:46,000
if not modern life, which also seems to demand

131
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that we each do whatever it takes to be able to say at the end of our days

132
0:06:51.88,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with peace and satisfaction, "I was just like everybody else."

133
0:06:56.44,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And this would be my message, too.

134
0:07:00.48,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So one night, I made one final call to my prospective campaign manager.

135
0:07:07.32,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We'd do the things it'd take to win, but first he had one question:

136
0:07:13.12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"Is there anything I need to know?"

137
0:07:16.24,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I held the phone and finally said,

138
0:07:19.64,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Well, you should probably know I'm gay."

139
0:07:23.92,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Silence.

140
0:07:26.56,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"Hmm. I see," he nearly whispered,

141
0:07:30.4,000 --> 0:07:33,000
as if he'd found a shiny penny or a dead baby bird.

142
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"I'm glad you told me," he continued.

144
0:07:38.08,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"You definitely didn't make my job any easier.

145
0:07:40.28,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I mean, you are in Texas.

146
0:07:42.08,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But it's not impossible, not impossible.

147
0:07:46.2,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But Casey, let me ask you something:

148
0:07:49.08,000 --> 0:07:54,000
How are you going to feel when somebody, say, at a rally, calls you a faggot?

149
0:07:55.52,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And let's be real, OK?

150
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:08:,000
You do understand that somebody might want to physically harm you.

151
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I just want to know:

152
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Are you really ready for this?"

153
0:08:07.72,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I wasn't.

154
0:08:09.48,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And I could not understand --

155
0:08:12.52,000 --> 0:08:14,000
could hardly breathe

156
0:08:15.4,000 --> 0:08:17,000
or think, or say a word.

157
0:08:19.4,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But to be clear: the boy that I was at that time

158
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
would have leapt at the chance to be harmed,

159
0:08:24.64,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to sacrifice everything, even life, for a cause.

160
0:08:28.84,000 --> 0:08:3,000
There was something shocking, though --

161
0:08:31.56,000 --> 0:08:33,000
not that there should have been, but there was --

162
0:08:34.32,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in the notion that he might be harmed for nothing more than being himself,

163
0:08:39.28,000 --> 0:08:41,000
which he had not even tried to do in the first place.

164
0:08:42.64,000 --> 0:08:45,000
All that he -- all that I --

165
0:08:45.679,000 --> 0:08:49,000
had tried to do and be was what I thought was asked of me.

166
0:08:50.08,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I was prominent for a 24-year-old:

167
0:08:53.64,000 --> 0:08:57,000
intelligent, I spoke well, dressed decent; I was an upstanding citizen.

168
0:08:59.04,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But the bargain I had accepted could not save me after all,

169
0:09:04.96,000 --> 0:09:05,000
nor can it save you.

170
0:09:07.6,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You may have already learned this lesson,

171
0:09:09.6,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or you will, regardless of your sexuality.

172
0:09:13.84,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The queer receives a concentrated dose, no doubt,

173
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but repression is a bitter pill that's offered to us all.

174
0:09:23.64,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We're taught to hide so many parts of who we are and what we've been through:

175
0:09:27.32,000 --> 0:09:29,000
our love, our pain, for some, our faith.

176
0:09:31.24,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So while coming out to the world can be hard,

177
0:09:34.76,000 --> 0:09:38,000
coming in to all the raw, strange magic of ourselves can be much harder.

178
0:09:39.2,000 --> 0:09:42,000
As Miles Davis said, "It takes a long time to sound like yourself."

179
0:09:44.32,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That surely was the case for me.

180
0:09:47.24,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I had my private revelation that night at 24,

181
0:09:49.84,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but mostly went on with my life.

182
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I went on to Harvard Business School, started a successful nonprofit,

183
0:09:56.24,000 --> 0:09:58,000
wound up on the cover of a magazine, on the stage at TED.

184
0:09:59.2,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

185
0:10:00.88,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I had achieved, by my late 20s,

186
0:10:02.48,000 --> 0:10:04,000
about everything a kid is supposed to achieve.

187
0:10:06.36,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But I was real cracked up:

188
0:10:09.44,000 --> 0:10:13,000
not exactly having a nervous breakdown, but not too far off,

189
0:10:13.68,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and awful sad either way.

190
0:10:16.28,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I had never thought of being a writer,

191
0:10:19.08,000 --> 0:10:22,000
didn't even read, in earnest, until I was nearly 23.

192
0:10:23.64,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But the book business is about the only industry

193
0:10:25.92,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that will pay you to investigate your own problems, so --

194
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So I decided to give it a try,

196
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to trace those cracks with words.

197
0:10:42.64,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, what came out on the page was about as strange as I felt at that time,

198
0:10:46.92,000 --> 0:10:48,000
which alarmed some people at first.

199
0:10:49.8,000 --> 0:10:51,000
A respected writer called to stage his own intervention

200
0:10:52.64,000 --> 0:10:55,000
after reading a few early chapters,

201
0:10:55.72,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and he began, much like my mother,

202
0:10:59.48,000 --> 0:11:01,000
"Hey, listen.

203
0:11:02.8,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You've been hired to write an autobiography.

204
0:11:05.2,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's a straightforward exercise.

205
0:11:07.08,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's got a beginning, middle and end,

206
0:11:08.92,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and is grounded in the facts of your life.

207
0:11:11.44,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And by the way, there's a great tradition of autobiography in this country,

208
0:11:15.04,000 --> 0:11:2,000
led by people on the margins of society who write to assert their existence.

209
0:11:20.12,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Go buy some of those books and learn from them.

210
0:11:23.56,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You're going in the wrong direction."

211
0:11:27.68,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But I no longer believed what we are taught --

212
0:11:31.2,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that the right direction is the safe direction.

213
0:11:33.68,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I no longer believed what we are taught --

214
0:11:35.88,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that queer lives or black lives or poor lives are marginal lives.

215
0:11:39.4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I believed what Kendrick Lamar says on "Section.80.":

216
0:11:43.64,000 --> 0:11:46,000
"I'm not on the outside looking in.

217
0:11:46.96,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I'm not on the inside looking out.

218
0:11:48.92,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I'm in the dead fucking center looking around."

219
0:11:51.36,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:52.84,000 --> 0:11:53,000
That was the place

221
0:11:54.84,000 --> 0:11:56,000
from which I hoped to work,

222
0:11:57.04,000 --> 0:12:,000
headed in the only direction worth going, the direction of myself,

223
0:12:00.52,000 --> 0:12:03,000
trying to help us all refuse the awful bargains

224
0:12:04.4,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we've been taught to take.

225
0:12:06.68,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We're taught to turn ourselves

226
0:12:08.88,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and our work into little nuggets that are easily digestible;

227
0:12:12.96,000 --> 0:12:15,000
taught to mutilate ourselves so that we make sense to others,

228
0:12:16.36,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to be a stranger to ourselves so the right people might befriend us

229
0:12:19.96,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and the right schools might accept us, and the right jobs might hire us,

230
0:12:23.4,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and the right parties might invite us,

231
0:12:25.28,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and, someday, the right God might invite us to the right heaven

232
0:12:28.48,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and close his pearly gates behind us,

233
0:12:30.48,000 --> 0:12:32,000
so we can bow down to Him forever and ever.

234
0:12:33.04,000 --> 0:12:35,000
These are the rewards, they say,

235
0:12:35.48,000 --> 0:12:36,000
for our obedience:

236
0:12:37.64,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to be a well-liked holy nugget,

237
0:12:40.6,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to be dead.

238
0:12:42.64,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And I say in return, "No, thank you."

239
0:12:47.48,000 --> 0:12:49,000
To the world and to my mother.

240
0:12:51.52,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Well, to tell you the truth,

241
0:12:52.92,000 --> 0:12:54,000
all I said was, "OK, Mom, I'll talk to you later."

242
0:12:55.32,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Laughter)

243
0:12:56.64,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But in my mind, I said, "No, thank you."

244
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I cannot accept her bargain either.

245
0:13:04.28,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Nor should you.

246
0:13:06.36,000 --> 0:13:1,000
It would be easy for many of us in rooms like this

247
0:13:10.84,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to see ourselves as safe,

248
0:13:13.76,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to keep ourselves over here.

249
0:13:17.52,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We speak well, we dress decent,

250
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:23,000
we're intelligent, people like us, or act like they do.

251
0:13:25.44,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But instead, I say that we should remember Lot's wife.

252
0:13:31.2,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Jesus of Nazareth said it first to his disciples:

253
0:13:34.4,000 --> 0:13:36,000
"Remember Lot's wife."

254
0:13:38.24,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Lot, in case you haven't read the Bible recently,

255
0:13:41.64,000 --> 0:13:44,000
was a man who set his family down in Sodom,

256
0:13:44.92,000 --> 0:13:48,000
in the midst of a wicked society that God decided he had to destroy.

257
0:13:50.28,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But God, being cruel, yet still a sap in part,

258
0:13:53.04,000 --> 0:13:57,000
rushed two angels out to Sodom to warn Lot to gather up his folks

259
0:13:57.36,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and get out of Dodge.

260
0:13:59.48,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Lot heard the angel's warning, but delayed.

261
0:14:02.8,000 --> 0:14:05,000
They didn't have all day to wait, so they grabbed Lot's hands

262
0:14:06.08,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and his two daughters' hands, and his wife's hands,

263
0:14:08.96,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and hurried them out of Sodom.

264
0:14:11.04,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And the angels shout,

265
0:14:12.64,000 --> 0:14:15,000
"Escape to the mountain. Whatever you do, don't look back,"

266
0:14:16.2,000 --> 0:14:19,000
just as God starts raining down fire on Sodom and Gomorrah.

267
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I can't figure out how Gomorrah got dragged into this.

268
0:14:22.8,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But Lot and his folks are running,

269
0:14:25.8,000 --> 0:14:26,000
fleeing all that destruction,

270
0:14:27.48,000 --> 0:14:29,000
kicking up dust while the Lord rains down death,

271
0:14:30.48,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and then, for some reason, Lot's wife looks back.

272
0:14:36.92,000 --> 0:14:38,000
God turns her into a pillar of salt.

273
0:14:40.6,000 --> 0:14:43,000
"Remember Lot's wife," Jesus says.

274
0:14:45.92,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But I've got a question:

275
0:14:48.6,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Why does she look back?

276
0:14:51.52,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Does she look back because she didn't want to miss the mayhem,

277
0:14:55.32,000 --> 0:14:57,000
wanted one last glimpse of a city on fire?

278
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Does she look back because she wanted to be sure that her people

279
0:15:02.2,000 --> 0:15:04,000
were far enough from danger to breathe a little easy?

280
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I'm so nosy and selfish sometimes, those likely would have been my reasons

281
0:15:08.84,000 --> 0:15:09,000
if I'd been in her shoes.

282
0:15:11.24,000 --> 0:15:16,000
But what if something else was going on with this woman, Lot's wife?

283
0:15:18.08,000 --> 0:15:23,000
What if she could not bear the thought of leaving those people

284
0:15:23.56,000 --> 0:15:25,000
all alone to burn alive,

285
0:15:26.2,000 --> 0:15:27,000
even for righteousness's sake?

286
0:15:28.88,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Isn't that possible?

287
0:15:31.36,000 --> 0:15:36,000
If it is, then this backward glance of a disobedient woman

288
0:15:36.56,000 --> 0:15:38,000
may not be a cautionary tale after all.

289
0:15:38.96,000 --> 0:15:41,000
It may be the bravest act in all the Bible,

290
0:15:42.28,000 --> 0:15:44,000
even braver than the act that holds the whole Book together,

291
0:15:45.24,000 --> 0:15:46,000
the crucifixion.

292
0:15:47.08,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We are told that up on Calvary, on an old rugged cross,

293
0:15:52.2,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Jesus gave his life to save everybody:

294
0:15:54.12,000 --> 0:15:56,000
billions and billions of strangers for all time to come.

295
0:15:57.84,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It's a nice thing to do.

296
0:15:59.72,000 --> 0:16:,000
It made him famous, that's for sure.

297
0:16:01.48,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Laughter)

298
0:16:03.32,000 --> 0:16:05,000
But Lot's wife was killed,

299
0:16:06.04,000 --> 0:16:08,000
turned into a pillar of salt,

300
0:16:08.64,000 --> 0:16:12,000
all because she could not turn her back on her friends,

301
0:16:13.44,000 --> 0:16:15,000
the wicked men of Sodom,

302
0:16:16.36,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and nobody even wrote the woman's name down.

303
0:16:20.88,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Oh, to have the courage of Lot's wife.

304
0:16:25.04,000 --> 0:16:28,000
That's the kind of courage we need today.

305
0:16:28.68,000 --> 0:16:31,000
The courage to put ourselves over there.

306
0:16:32.12,000 --> 0:16:35,000
The courage that says that either all of us have to be faggots,

307
0:16:35.4,000 --> 0:16:39,000
or none of us can be faggots, for any of us to be free.

308
0:16:39.8,000 --> 0:16:43,000
The courage to stand with other vagabonds in the street,

309
0:16:44.24,000 --> 0:16:46,000
with all the wretched of the earth,

310
0:16:46.64,000 --> 0:16:48,000
to form an army of the least of these,

311
0:16:49.48,000 --> 0:16:53,000
with the faith that from the naked crust of all we are,

312
0:16:53.84,000 --> 0:16:55,000
we can build a better world.

313
0:16:56.92,000 --> 0:16:57,000
Thank you.

314
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Applause)

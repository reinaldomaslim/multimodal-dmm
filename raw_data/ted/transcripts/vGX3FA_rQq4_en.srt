1
0:00:12.685,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Back home, my friends call me nicknames,

2
0:00:15.755,000 --> 0:00:17,000
such as "The Giant Clam Girl,"

3
0:00:18.012,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"Clam Queen,"

4
0:00:19.319,000 --> 0:00:21,000
or, "The Mother of Clams."

5
0:00:21.579,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:22.954,000 --> 0:00:24,000
This is because every time I see them,

7
0:00:25.233,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I talk nonstop about giant clams all day,

8
0:00:28.518,000 --> 0:00:29,000
every day.

9
0:00:30.774,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Giant clams are these massive and colorful shelled marine animals,

10
0:00:34.62,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the largest of its kind.

11
0:00:36.777,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Just look at this shell.

12
0:00:40.142,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The biggest recorded individual was four-and-a-half-feet long

13
0:00:43.337,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and weighed about 550 pounds.

14
0:00:45.735,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That is almost as heavy as three baby elephants.

15
0:00:50.266,000 --> 0:00:54,000
South Pacific legends once described giant clams as man-eaters

16
0:00:54.707,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that would lie in wait on the seabed to trap unsuspecting divers.

17
0:00:59.191,000 --> 0:01:02,000
A story goes that a diver had lost his legs

18
0:01:02.413,000 --> 0:01:04,000
while trying to retrieve a pearl from a giant clam.

19
0:01:05.895,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I thought, "Really?"

20
0:01:08.258,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So out of curiosity,

21
0:01:09.946,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I did an experiment using myself as bait.

22
0:01:13.013,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:14.929,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I carefully placed my hand into the clam's mouth and waited.

24
0:01:19.064,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Hmm ...

25
0:01:20.355,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I still have my hand.

26
0:01:22.731,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It seems that these gentle giants would rather retreat

27
0:01:25.475,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and protect their fleshy bodies

28
0:01:27.08,000 --> 0:01:28,000
than feed on me.

29
0:01:28.315,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So much for those killer clam myths!

30
0:01:31.778,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Unfortunately, the reality is,

31
0:01:34.494,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we are the giant clams' biggest threat.

32
0:01:37.855,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Considered a delicacy throughout the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans,

33
0:01:42.065,000 --> 0:01:44,000
giant clams have been traditionally fished as seafood.

34
0:01:45.614,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Fishermen are particularly interested in their adductor muscles,

35
0:01:49.178,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which are organs that hold the two shells together like a hinge.

36
0:01:53.536,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Just for their muscles,

37
0:01:54.972,000 --> 0:01:56,000
giant clams were almost hunted to extinction

38
0:01:57.335,000 --> 0:01:59,000
between the 1960s and 1980s.

39
0:02:01.037,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Clamshells are also popular in the ornamental trade

40
0:02:04.581,000 --> 0:02:05,000
as jewelry and for display.

41
0:02:07.115,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In the South China Sea,

42
0:02:08.881,000 --> 0:02:11,000
fishermen went out of their way to collect fossilized clamshells

43
0:02:12.807,000 --> 0:02:14,000
by digging through large areas of coral reefs.

44
0:02:15.811,000 --> 0:02:2,000
These were later carved and sold as so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China.

45
0:02:21.757,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Giant clams, dead or alive, are not safe from us.

46
0:02:25.445,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's a "clamity!"

47
0:02:27.245,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:32.518,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Applause)

49
0:02:37.593,000 --> 0:02:4,000
With the spotlight on more charismatic marine animals

50
0:02:41.243,000 --> 0:02:43,000
such as the whales and coral reefs,

51
0:02:43.433,000 --> 0:02:46,000
it is easy to forget that other marine life needs our help, too.

52
0:02:47.552,000 --> 0:02:51,000
My fascination with giant clams got me started on conservation research

53
0:02:52.495,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to fill in the knowledge gaps on their ecology and behavior.

54
0:02:56.292,000 --> 0:02:59,000
One of the discoveries that we made was that giant clams could walk

55
0:02:59.708,000 --> 0:03:,000
across the seafloor.

56
0:03:02.172,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Yes, you heard me right:

57
0:03:03.718,000 --> 0:03:04,000
they can walk.

58
0:03:05.355,000 --> 0:03:06,000
To find out,

59
0:03:06.572,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we placed numerous baby clams on a grid.

60
0:03:08.829,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now watch what happens over 24 hours.

61
0:03:16.892,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We think that walking is important for getting away from predators

62
0:03:20.678,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and finding mates for breeding.

63
0:03:22.69,000 --> 0:03:26,000
While it can hard to imagine any movement in these enormous animals,

64
0:03:26.767,000 --> 0:03:29,000
giant clams up to 400 pounds can still walk,

65
0:03:30.275,000 --> 0:03:31,000
they just move slower.

66
0:03:33.348,000 --> 0:03:37,000
During my PhD, I discovered more secrets about the giant clams.

67
0:03:37.759,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But there was something missing in my work.

68
0:03:41.823,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I found myself asking,

69
0:03:43.796,000 --> 0:03:46,000
"Why should people care about conserving giant clams?" --

70
0:03:47.279,000 --> 0:03:48,000
other than myself, of course.

71
0:03:50.753,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:55.713,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It turns out that giant clams have a giant impact on coral reefs.

73
0:04:00.314,000 --> 0:04:03,000
These multitasking clams are reef builders,

74
0:04:03.697,000 --> 0:04:04,000
food factories,

75
0:04:05.496,000 --> 0:04:07,000
shelters for shrimps and crabs

76
0:04:07.867,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and water filters,

77
0:04:09.093,000 --> 0:04:1,000
all rolled into one.

78
0:04:10.966,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In a nutshell,

79
0:04:12.387,000 --> 0:04:14,000
giant clams play a major contributing role

80
0:04:14.78,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as residents of their own reef home,

81
0:04:17.131,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and just having them around keeps the reef healthy.

82
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And because they can live up to 100 years old,

83
0:04:24.135,000 --> 0:04:27,000
giant clams make vital indicators of coral reef health.

84
0:04:28.087,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So when giant clams start to disappear from coral reefs,

85
0:04:31.777,000 --> 0:04:32,000
their absence can serve as an alarm bell

86
0:04:33.798,000 --> 0:04:35,000
for scientists to start paying attention,

87
0:04:36.106,000 --> 0:04:38,000
similar to the canary in a coal mine.

88
0:04:38.958,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But giant clams are endangered.

89
0:04:41.675,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The largest clam in the world is facing the threat of extinction,

90
0:04:45.185,000 --> 0:04:49,000
with more than 50 percent of the wild population severely depleted.

91
0:04:50.423,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the ecological benefits of having giant clams on coral reefs

92
0:04:54.251,000 --> 0:04:58,000
are likely to continue only if populations are healthy,

93
0:04:58.786,000 --> 0:05:,000
making their conservation paramount.

94
0:05:01.79,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So I stand here today to give a voice to the giant clams,

95
0:05:05.441,000 --> 0:05:08,000
because I care a whole lot for these amazing animals,

96
0:05:08.472,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and they deserve to be cared for.

97
0:05:11.423,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It is time for the giant clams to step out of their shells,

98
0:05:15.003,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and show the world that they, too, can be the heroes of the oceans.

99
0:05:19.174,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Thank you very much.

100
0:05:20.413,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Applause)

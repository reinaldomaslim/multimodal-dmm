1
0:00:13.126,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Over the past 10 years,

2
0:00:14.445,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've been researching the way people organize and visualize information.

3
0:00:19.786,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I've noticed an interesting shift.

4
0:00:22.166,000 --> 0:00:23,000
For a long period of time,

5
0:00:23.91,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we believed in a natural ranking order in the world around us,

6
0:00:28.362,000 --> 0:00:32,000
also known as the great chain of being, or "Scala naturae" in Latin,

7
0:00:33.131,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a top-down structure that normally starts with God at the very top,

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
followed by angels, noblemen,

9
0:00:39.759,000 --> 0:00:42,000
common people, animals, and so on.

10
0:00:43.999,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This idea was actually based on Aristotle's ontology,

11
0:00:48.298,000 --> 0:00:52,000
which classified all things known to man in a set of opposing categories,

12
0:00:52.766,000 --> 0:00:53,000
like the ones you see behind me.

13
0:00:56.687,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But over time, interestingly enough,

14
0:00:59.458,000 --> 0:01:03,000
this concept adopted the branching schema of a tree

15
0:01:03.628,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in what became known as the Porphyrian tree,

16
0:01:06.525,000 --> 0:01:09,000
also considered to be the oldest tree of knowledge.

17
0:01:11.238,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The branching scheme of the tree was, in fact,

18
0:01:13.436,000 --> 0:01:15,000
such a powerful metaphor for conveying information

19
0:01:16.409,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that it became, over time, an important communication tool

20
0:01:19.703,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to map a variety of systems of knowledge.

21
0:01:22.648,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We can see trees being used to map morality,

22
0:01:25.755,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with the popular tree of virtues and tree of vices,

23
0:01:28.628,000 --> 0:01:31,000
as you can see here, with these beautiful illustrations from medieval Europe.

24
0:01:32.825,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We can see trees being used to map consanguinity,

25
0:01:35.937,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the various blood ties between people.

26
0:01:39.11,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We can also see trees being used to map genealogy,

27
0:01:42.23,000 --> 0:01:44,000
perhaps the most famous archetype of the tree diagram.

28
0:01:45.064,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I think many of you in the audience have probably seen family trees.

29
0:01:48.404,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Many of you probably even have your own family trees drawn in such a way.

30
0:01:53.158,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We can see trees even mapping systems of law,

31
0:01:56.093,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the various decrees and rulings of kings and rulers.

32
0:02:01.785,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And finally, of course, also a very popular scientific metaphor,

33
0:02:05.567,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we can see trees being used to map all species known to man.

34
0:02:11.177,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And trees ultimately became such a powerful visual metaphor

35
0:02:15.107,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because in many ways, they really embody this human desire

36
0:02:17.999,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for order, for balance, for unity, for symmetry.

37
0:02:21.999,000 --> 0:02:25,000
However, nowadays we are really facing new complex, intricate challenges

38
0:02:26.346,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that cannot be understood by simply employing a simple tree diagram.

39
0:02:32.037,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And a new metaphor is currently emerging,

40
0:02:35.303,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and it's currently replacing the tree

41
0:02:37.477,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in visualizing various systems of knowledge.

42
0:02:40.064,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's really providing us with a new lens to understand the world around us.

43
0:02:45.495,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And this new metaphor is the metaphor of the network.

44
0:02:49.511,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And we can see this shift from trees into networks

45
0:02:52.846,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in many domains of knowledge.

46
0:02:54.51,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We can see this shift in the way we try to understand the brain.

47
0:03:00.453,000 --> 0:03:02,000
While before, we used to think of the brain

48
0:03:02.515,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as a modular, centralized organ,

49
0:03:04.53,000 --> 0:03:08,000
where a given area was responsible for a set of actions and behaviors,

50
0:03:08.592,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the more we know about the brain,

51
0:03:10.355,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the more we think of it as a large music symphony,

52
0:03:13.665,000 --> 0:03:15,000
played by hundreds and thousands of instruments.

53
0:03:16.299,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This is a beautiful snapshot created by the Blue Brain Project,

54
0:03:19.999,000 --> 0:03:23,000
where you can see 10,000 neurons and 30 million connections.

55
0:03:24.736,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And this is only mapping 10 percent of a mammalian neocortex.

56
0:03:30.815,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We can also see this shift in the way we try to conceive of human knowledge.

57
0:03:36.062,000 --> 0:03:39,000
These are some remarkable trees of knowledge, or trees of science,

58
0:03:39.234,000 --> 0:03:41,000
by Spanish scholar Ramon Llull.

59
0:03:41.999,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And Llull was actually the precursor,

60
0:03:43.833,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the very first one who created the metaphor of science as a tree,

61
0:03:47.571,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a metaphor we use every single day, when we say,

62
0:03:50.563,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Biology is a branch of science,"

63
0:03:52.252,000 --> 0:03:53,000
when we say,

64
0:03:53.429,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"Genetics is a branch of science."

65
0:03:56.283,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But perhaps the most beautiful of all trees of knowledge, at least for me,

66
0:03:59.902,000 --> 0:04:03,000
was created for the French encyclopedia by Diderot and d'Alembert in 1751.

67
0:04:04.378,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This was really the bastion of the French Enlightenment,

68
0:04:07.037,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and this gorgeous illustration was featured as a table of contents

69
0:04:10.886,000 --> 0:04:11,000
for the encyclopedia.

70
0:04:12.481,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And it actually maps out all domains of knowledge

71
0:04:16.692,000 --> 0:04:18,000
as separate branches of a tree.

72
0:04:19.866,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But knowledge is much more intricate than this.

73
0:04:22.794,000 --> 0:04:26,000
These are two maps of Wikipedia showing the inter-linkage of articles --

74
0:04:27.458,000 --> 0:04:3,000
related to history on the left, and mathematics on the right.

75
0:04:31.966,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And I think by looking at these maps

76
0:04:33.729,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and other ones that have been created of Wikipedia --

77
0:04:36.297,000 --> 0:04:39,000
arguably one of the largest rhizomatic structures ever created by man --

78
0:04:39.713,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we can really understand how human knowledge is much more intricate

79
0:04:43.559,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and interdependent, just like a network.

80
0:04:47.455,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We can also see this interesting shift

81
0:04:49.642,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in the way we map social ties between people.

82
0:04:53.524,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This is the typical organization chart.

83
0:04:55.843,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I'm assuming many of you have seen a similar chart as well,

84
0:04:58.661,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in your own corporations, or others.

85
0:05:00.431,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It's a top-down structure

86
0:05:01.94,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that normally starts with the CEO at the very top,

87
0:05:04.825,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and where you can drill down all the way to the individual workmen on the bottom.

88
0:05:09.634,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But humans sometimes are, well, actually, all humans are unique in their own way,

89
0:05:14.506,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and sometimes you really don't play well under this really rigid structure.

90
0:05:20.711,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I think the Internet is really changing this paradigm quite a lot.

91
0:05:23.845,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is a fantastic map of online social collaboration

92
0:05:27.234,000 --> 0:05:28,000
between Perl developers.

93
0:05:28.887,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Perl is a famous programming language,

94
0:05:30.999,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and here, you can see how different programmers

95
0:05:33.746,000 --> 0:05:36,000
are actually exchanging files, and working together on a given project.

96
0:05:37.597,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And here, you can notice that this is a completely decentralized process --

97
0:05:41.799,000 --> 0:05:43,000
there's no leader in this organization,

98
0:05:43.979,000 --> 0:05:44,000
it's a network.

99
0:05:46.337,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We can also see this interesting shift when we look at terrorism.

100
0:05:51.613,000 --> 0:05:54,000
One of the main challenges of understanding terrorism nowadays

101
0:05:54.741,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is that we are dealing with decentralized, independent cells,

102
0:05:58.495,000 --> 0:06:,000
where there's no leader leading the whole process.

103
0:06:02.518,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And here, you can actually see how visualization is being used.

104
0:06:05.84,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The diagram that you see behind me

105
0:06:07.521,000 --> 0:06:1,000
shows all the terrorists involved in the Madrid attack in 2004.

106
0:06:11.942,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And what they did here is, they actually segmented the network

107
0:06:14.893,000 --> 0:06:15,000
into three different years,

108
0:06:16.416,000 --> 0:06:19,000
represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me.

109
0:06:19.482,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And the blue lines tie together

110
0:06:21.475,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the people that were present in that network year after year.

111
0:06:25.117,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So even though there's no leader per se,

112
0:06:27.169,000 --> 0:06:3,000
these people are probably the most influential ones in that organization,

113
0:06:30.828,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the ones that know more about the past,

114
0:06:32.86,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the future plans and goals of this particular cell.

115
0:06:37.232,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We can also see this shift from trees into networks

116
0:06:40.262,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in the way we classify and organize species.

117
0:06:45.245,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The image on the right is the only illustration

118
0:06:48.098,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that Darwin included in "The Origin of Species,"

119
0:06:51.234,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which Darwin called the "Tree of Life."

120
0:06:54.098,000 --> 0:06:56,000
There's actually a letter from Darwin to the publisher,

121
0:06:57.007,000 --> 0:06:59,000
expanding on the importance of this particular diagram.

122
0:06:59.687,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It was critical for Darwin's theory of evolution.

123
0:07:03.408,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But recently, scientists discovered that overlaying this tree of life

124
0:07:06.999,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is a dense network of bacteria,

125
0:07:09.458,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and these bacteria are actually tying together

126
0:07:11.643,000 --> 0:07:13,000
species that were completely separated before,

127
0:07:13.839,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to what scientists are now calling not the tree of life,

128
0:07:16.943,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but the web of life, the network of life.

129
0:07:21.489,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And finally, we can really see this shift, again,

130
0:07:24.027,000 --> 0:07:26,000
when we look at ecosystems around our planet.

131
0:07:27.599,000 --> 0:07:3,000
No more do we have these simplified predator-versus-prey diagrams

132
0:07:30.789,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we have all learned at school.

133
0:07:33.201,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This is a much more accurate depiction of an ecosystem.

134
0:07:36.214,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is a diagram created by Professor David Lavigne,

135
0:07:39.142,000 --> 0:07:42,000
mapping close to 100 species that interact with the codfish

136
0:07:42.666,000 --> 0:07:44,000
off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada.

137
0:07:46.244,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And I think here, we can really understand the intricate and interdependent nature

138
0:07:50.205,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of most ecosystems that abound on our planet.

139
0:07:54.442,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But even though recent, this metaphor of the network,

140
0:07:58.11,000 --> 0:08:01,000
is really already adopting various shapes and forms,

141
0:08:01.237,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and it's almost becoming a growing visual taxonomy.

142
0:08:03.724,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's almost becoming the syntax of a new language.

143
0:08:06.395,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And this is one aspect that truly fascinates me.

144
0:08:09.678,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And these are actually 15 different typologies

145
0:08:12.235,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I've been collecting over time,

146
0:08:14.394,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and it really shows the immense visual diversity of this new metaphor.

147
0:08:19.001,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And here is an example.

148
0:08:20.818,000 --> 0:08:23,000
On the very top band, you have radial convergence,

149
0:08:24.775,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a visualization model that has become really popular over the last five years.

150
0:08:29.198,000 --> 0:08:33,000
At the top left, the very first project is a gene network,

151
0:08:33.576,000 --> 0:08:37,000
followed by a network of IP addresses -- machines, servers --

152
0:08:37.609,000 --> 0:08:39,000
followed by a network of Facebook friends.

153
0:08:41.24,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You probably couldn't find more disparate topics,

154
0:08:43.772,000 --> 0:08:46,000
yet they are using the same metaphor, the same visual model,

155
0:08:47.59,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to map the never-ending complexities of its own subject.

156
0:08:52.545,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And here are a few more examples of the many I've been collecting,

157
0:08:55.693,000 --> 0:08:57,000
of this growing visual taxonomy of networks.

158
0:09:00.248,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But networks are not just a scientific metaphor.

159
0:09:04.192,000 --> 0:09:09,000
As designers, researchers, and scientists try to map a variety of complex systems,

160
0:09:09.757,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they are in many ways influencing traditional art fields,

161
0:09:12.594,000 --> 0:09:13,000
like painting and sculpture,

162
0:09:14.02,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and influencing many different artists.

163
0:09:16.718,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And perhaps because networks have this huge aesthetical force to them --

164
0:09:20.784,000 --> 0:09:21,000
they're immensely gorgeous --

165
0:09:22.766,000 --> 0:09:24,000
they are really becoming a cultural meme,

166
0:09:24.846,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and driving a new art movement, which I've called "networkism."

167
0:09:30.544,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And we can see this influence in this movement in a variety of ways.

168
0:09:33.776,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is just one of many examples,

169
0:09:35.593,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where you can see this influence from science into art.

170
0:09:38.342,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The example on your left side is IP-mapping,

171
0:09:41.237,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a computer-generated map of IP addresses; again -- servers, machines.

172
0:09:45.253,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And on your right side,

173
0:09:46.482,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you have "Transient Structures and Unstable Networks" by Sharon Molloy,

174
0:09:51.124,000 --> 0:09:53,000
using oil and enamel on canvas.

175
0:09:53.87,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And here are a few more paintings by Sharon Molloy,

176
0:09:56.999,000 --> 0:09:57,000
some gorgeous, intricate paintings.

177
0:10:00.375,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And here's another example of that interesting cross-pollination

178
0:10:03.705,000 --> 0:10:04,000
between science and art.

179
0:10:05.475,000 --> 0:10:07,000
On your left side, you have "Operation Smile."

180
0:10:08.164,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It is a computer-generated map of a social network.

181
0:10:11.077,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And on your right side, you have "Field 4," by Emma McNally,

182
0:10:14.827,000 --> 0:10:16,000
using only graphite on paper.

183
0:10:17.374,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Emma McNally is one of the main leaders of this movement,

184
0:10:20.915,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and she creates these striking, imaginary landscapes,

185
0:10:23.508,000 --> 0:10:27,000
where you can really notice the influence from traditional network visualization.

186
0:10:30.324,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But networkism doesn't happen only in two dimensions.

187
0:10:33.355,000 --> 0:10:35,000
This is perhaps one of my favorite projects

188
0:10:35.657,000 --> 0:10:36,000
of this new movement.

189
0:10:37.086,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And I think the title really says it all -- it's called:

190
0:10:39.744,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"Galaxies Forming Along Filaments,

191
0:10:41.935,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Like Droplets Along the Strands of a Spider's Web."

192
0:10:46.616,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I just find this particular project to be immensely powerful.

193
0:10:49.72,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It was created by Tomás Saraceno,

194
0:10:51.704,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and he occupies these large spaces,

195
0:10:54.426,000 --> 0:10:57,000
creates these massive installations using only elastic ropes.

196
0:10:57.792,000 --> 0:11:,000
As you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes,

197
0:11:01.633,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the entire network kind of shifts, almost like a real organic network would.

198
0:11:07.414,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And here's yet another example

199
0:11:09.47,000 --> 0:11:11,000
of networkism taken to a whole different level.

200
0:11:12.303,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This was created by Japanese artist Chiharu Shiota

201
0:11:15.54,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in a piece called "In Silence."

202
0:11:17.834,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And Chiharu, like Tomás Saraceno, fills these rooms with this dense network,

203
0:11:23.213,000 --> 0:11:26,000
this dense web of elastic ropes and black wool and thread,

204
0:11:26.999,000 --> 0:11:28,000
sometimes including objects, as you can see here,

205
0:11:29.782,000 --> 0:11:32,000
sometimes even including people, in many of her installations.

206
0:11:35.374,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But networks are also not just a new trend,

207
0:11:38.089,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and it's too easy for us to dismiss it as such.

208
0:11:41.029,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Networks really embody notions of decentralization,

209
0:11:44.66,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of interconnectedness, of interdependence.

210
0:11:48.303,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And this new way of thinking is critical

211
0:11:50.803,000 --> 0:11:53,000
for us to solve many of the complex problems we are facing nowadays,

212
0:11:54.557,000 --> 0:11:55,000
from decoding the human brain,

213
0:11:56.422,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to understanding the vast universe out there.

214
0:11:59.746,000 --> 0:12:03,000
On your left side, you have a snapshot of a neural network of a mouse --

215
0:12:04.259,000 --> 0:12:06,000
very similar to our own at this particular scale.

216
0:12:07.5,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And on your right side, you have the Millennium Simulation.

217
0:12:10.49,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It was the largest and most realistic simulation

218
0:12:13.262,000 --> 0:12:14,000
of the growth of cosmic structure.

219
0:12:15.49,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It was able to recreate the history of 20 million galaxies

220
0:12:20.03,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in approximately 25 terabytes of output.

221
0:12:24.081,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And coincidentally or not,

222
0:12:25.518,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I just find this particular comparison

223
0:12:27.415,000 --> 0:12:29,000
between the smallest scale of knowledge -- the brain --

224
0:12:30.142,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and the largest scale of knowledge -- the universe itself --

225
0:12:32.995,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to be really quite striking and fascinating.

226
0:12:35.807,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Because as Bruce Mau once said,

227
0:12:38.465,000 --> 0:12:4,000
"When everything is connected to everything else,

228
0:12:40.901,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for better or for worse, everything matters."

229
0:12:43.322,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Thank you so much.

230
0:12:44.497,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Applause)

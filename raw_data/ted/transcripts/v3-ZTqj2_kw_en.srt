0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Gabriel García Márquez is one of my favorite writers,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for his storytelling,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but even more, I think,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for the beauty and precision of his prose.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And whether it's the opening line from "One Hundred Years of Solitude"

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or the fantastical stream of consciousness

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in "Autumn of the Patriarch,"

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
where the words rush by,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
page after page of unpunctuated imagery

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
sweeping the reader along

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
like some wild river

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
twisting through a primal South American jungle,

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
reading Márquez is a visceral experience.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Which struck me as particularly remarkable

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
during one session with the novel

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
when I realized that I was being swept along

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
on this remarkable, vivid journey

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in translation.

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now I was a comparative literature major in college,

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which is like an English major,

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
only instead of being stuck studying Chaucer for three months,

22
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
we got to read great literature in translation

23
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
from around the world.

24
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And as great as these books were,

25
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you could always tell

26
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that you were getting close to the full effect.

27
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But not so with Márquez

28
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who once praised his translator's versions

29
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
as being better than his own,

30
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which is an astonishing compliment.

31
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So when I heard that the translator, Gregory Rabassa,

32
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
had written his own book on the subject,

33
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I couldn't wait to read it.

34
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's called apropos of the Italian adage

35
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that I lifted from his forward,

36
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"If This Be Treason."

37
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And it's a charming read.

38
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's highly recommended for anyone who's interested

39
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in the translator's art.

40
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But the reason that I mention it

41
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is that early on, Rabassa offers

42
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
this elegantly simple insight:

43
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"Every act of communication

44
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is an act of translation."

45
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now maybe that's been obvious to all of you for a long time,

46
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but for me,

47
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
as often as I'd encountered

48
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that exact difficulty on a daily basis,

49
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I had never seen the inherent challenge of communication

50
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in so crystalline a light.

51
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Ever since I can remember

52
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
thinking consciously about such things,

53
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
communication has been my central passion.

54
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Even as a child,

55
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I remember thinking that what I really wanted most in life

56
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
was to be able to understand everything

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and then to communicate it to everyone else.

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So no ego problems.

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's funny, my wife, Daisy,

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
whose family is littered with schizophrenics --

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and I mean littered with them --

62
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
once said to me, "Chris, I already have a brother who thinks he's God.

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I don't need a husband who wants to be."

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Anyway, as I plunged through my 20s

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
ever more aware of how unobtainable

67
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the first part of my childhood ambition was,

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it was that second part,

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
being able to successfully communicate to others

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
whatever knowledge I was gaining,

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
where the futility of my quest really set in.

72
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Time after time,

73
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
whenever I set out to share some great truth

74
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
with a soon-to-be grateful recipient,

75
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
it had the opposite effect.

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Interestingly, when your opening line of communication is,

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"Hey, listen up,

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because I'm about to drop some serious knowledge on you,"

79
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it's amazing how quickly you'll discover

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
both ice and the firing squad.

81
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Finally, after about 10 years

82
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of alienating friends and strangers alike,

83
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I finally got it,

84
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a new personal truth all my own,

85
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that if I was going to ever communicate well with other people

86
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the ideas that I was gaining,

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I'd better find a different way of going about it.

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And that's when I discovered comedy.

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now comedy travels along a distinct wavelength

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from other forms of language.

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
If I had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum,

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'd say it falls somewhere

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
between poetry and lies.

94
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I'm not talking about all comedy here,

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because, clearly, there's plenty of humor

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that colors safely within the lines of what we already think and feel.

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
What I want to talk about

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is the unique ability that the best comedy and satire has

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
at circumventing our ingrained perspectives --

100
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
comedy as the philosopher's stone.

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It takes the base metal of our conventional wisdom

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and transforms it through ridicule

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
into a different way of seeing

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and ultimately being in the world.

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Because that's what I take

106
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
from the theme of this conference: Gained in Translation.

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That it's about communication

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that doesn't just produce greater understanding

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
within the individual,

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but leads to real change.

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Which in my experience means communication

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that manages to speak to and expand

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
our concept of self-interest.

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now I'm big on speaking to people's self-interest

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because we're all wired for that.

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's part of our survival package,

117
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and that's why it's become so important for us,

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and that's why we're always listening at that level.

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And also because that's where,

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
in terms of our own self-interest,

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we finally begin to grasp

122
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
our ability to respond, our responsibility

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to the rest of the world.

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Now as to what I mean by the best comedy and satire,

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I mean work that comes first and foremost

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
from a place of honesty and integrity.

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now if you think back

128
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
on Tina Fey's impersonations on Saturday Night Live

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
of the newly nominated vice presidential candidate

130
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Sarah Palin,

131
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
they were devastating.

132
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Fey demonstrated far more effectively than any political pundit

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the candidate's fundamental lack of seriousness,

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
cementing an impression

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that the majority of the American public still holds today.

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And the key detail of this

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is that Fey's scripts weren't written by her

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and they weren't written by the SNL writers.

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They were lifted verbatim

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
from Palin's own remarks.

141
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Here was a Palin impersonator

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
quoting Palin word for word.

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now that's honesty and integrity,

145
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and it's also why Fey's performances

146
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
left such a lasting impression.

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
On the other side of the political spectrum,

148
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the first time that I heard Rush Limbaugh

149
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
refer to presidential hopeful John Edwards as the Breck girl

150
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I knew that he'd made a direct hit.

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now it's not often that I'm going to associate

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the words honesty and integrity with Limbaugh,

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but it's really hard to argue with that punchline.

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The description perfectly captured

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Edwards' personal vanity.

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And guess what?

157
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That ended up being the exact personality trait

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that was at the core of the scandal that ended his political career.

159
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now The Daily Show with John Stewart

160
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is by far the most --

161
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Applause)

162
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it's by far the most well-documented example

164
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
of the effectiveness of this kind of comedy.

165
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Survey after survey,

166
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
from Pew Research to the Annenberg Center for Public Policy,

167
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
has found that Daily Show viewers are better informed about current events

168
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
than the viewers of all major network and cable news shows.

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Applause)

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Now whether this says more

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
about the conflict between integrity and profitability

172
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of corporate journalism

173
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
than it does about the attentiveness of Stewart's viewers,

174
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the larger point remains

175
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that Stewart's material

176
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is always grounded in a commitment to the facts --

177
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
not because his intent is to inform. It's not.

178
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
His intent is to be funny.

179
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It just so happens that Stewart's brand of funny

180
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
doesn't work unless the facts are true.

181
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And the result is great comedy

182
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that's also an information delivery system

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that scores markedly higher in both credibility and retention

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
than the professional news media.

185
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now this is doubly ironic

186
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
when you consider that what gives comedy its edge

187
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
at reaching around people's walls

188
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is the way that it uses deliberate misdirection.

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
A great piece of comedy is a verbal magic trick,

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
where you think it's going over here

191
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and then all of a sudden you're transported over here.

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And there's this mental delight

193
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that's followed by the physical response of laughter,

194
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
which, not coincidentally,

195
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
releases endorphins in the brain.

196
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And just like that, you've been seduced

197
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
into a different way of looking at something

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because the endorphins have brought down your defenses.

199
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is the exact opposite

200
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of the way that anger and fear and panic,

201
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
all of the flight-or-fight responses, operate.

202
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Flight-or-fight releases adrenalin,

203
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which throws our walls up sky-high.

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And the comedy comes along,

205
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
dealing with a lot of the same areas

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
where our defenses are the strongest --

207
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
race, religion, politics, sexuality --

208
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
only by approaching them through humor instead of adrenalin,

209
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we get endorphins

210
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and the alchemy of laughter turns our walls into windows,

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
revealing a fresh and unexpected point of view.

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now let me give you an example from my act.

213
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I have some material

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
about the so-called radical gay agenda,

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which starts off by asking,

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
how radical is the gay agenda?

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Because from what I can tell, the three things gay Americans seem to want most

218
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
are to join the military, get married and start a family.

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

220
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Three things I've tried to avoid my entire life.

221
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

222
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Have at it you radical bastards. The field is yours.

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

224
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And that's followed by these lines

225
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
about gay adoption:

226
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
What is the problem with gay adoption?

227
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Why is this remotely controversial?

228
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
If you have a baby and you think that baby's gay,

229
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
you should be allowed to put it up for adoption.

230
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

231
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You have given birth to an abomination.

232
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Remove it from your household.

233
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now by taking the biblical epithet "abomination"

234
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and attaching it to the ultimate image of innocence, a baby,

235
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
this joke short circuits the emotional wiring

236
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
behind the debate

237
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and it leaves the audience with the opportunity, through their laughter,

238
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to question its validity.

239
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Misdirection isn't the only trick

240
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that comedy has up its sleeve.

241
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Economy of language

242
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
is another real strong suit of great comedy.

243
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
There are few phrases

244
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that pack a more concentrated dose of subject and symbol

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
than the perfect punchline.

246
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Bill Hicks -- and if you don't know his work,

247
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
you should really Google him --

248
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Hicks had a routine

249
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
about getting into one of those childhood bragging contests on the playground,

250
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
where finally the other kid says to him,

251
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
"Huh? Well my dad can beat up your dad,"

252
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to which Hicks replies,

253
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
"Really? How soon?"

254
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Laughter)

255
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
That's an entire childhood

256
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in three words.

257
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

258
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Not to mention what it reveals

259
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
about the adult who's speaking them.

260
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And one last powerful attribute

261
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that comedy has as communication

262
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is that it's inherently viral.

263
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
People can't wait

264
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to pass along that new great joke.

265
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And this isn't some new phenomenon of our wired world.

266
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Comedy has been crossing country

267
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
with remarkable speed

268
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
way before the Internet, social media,

269
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
even cable TV.

270
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Back in 1980

271
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
when comedian Richard Pryor accidentally set himself on fire

272
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
during a freebasing accident,

273
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I was in Los Angeles the day after it happened

274
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and then I was in Washington D.C. two days after that.

275
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And I heard the exact same punchline on both coasts --

276
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
something about the Ignited Negro College Fund.

277
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Clearly, it didn't come out of a Tonight Show monologue.

278
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And my guess here -- and I have no research on this --

279
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
is that if you really were to look back at it and if you could research it,

280
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
you'd find out that comedy

281
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is the second oldest viral profession.

282
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
First there were drums

283
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and then knock-knock jokes.

284
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Laughter)

285
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But it's when you put all of these elements together --

286
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
when you get the viral appeal of a great joke

287
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
with a powerful punchline

288
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that's crafted from honesty and integrity,

289
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
it can have a real world impact

290
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
at changing a conversation.

291
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Now I have a close friend, Joel Pett,

292
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who's the editorial cartoonist

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
for the Lexington Herald-Leader.

294
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And he used to be the USA Today Monday morning guy.

295
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I was visiting with Joel

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the weekend before the Copenhagen conference on climate change opened

297
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in December of 2009.

298
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And Joel was explaining to me

299
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that, because USA Today

300
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
was one of America's four papers of record,

301
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference,

302
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
which meant that, if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon

303
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
on Monday, the opening day of the conference,

304
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
it could get passed around

305
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
at the highest level among actual decision-makers.

306
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So we started talking about climate change.

307
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And it turned out that Joel and I

308
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
were both bothered by the same thing,

309
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
which was how so much of the debate

310
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
was still focused on the science

311
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and how complete it was or wasn't,

312
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which, to both of us,

313
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
seems somewhat intentionally off point.

314
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Because first of all, there's this false premise

315
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that such a thing as complete science exists.

316
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Now Governor Perry of my newly-adopted state of Texas

317
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
was pushing this same line this past summer

318
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
at the beginning of his oops-fated campaign

319
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
for the Republican presidential nomination,

320
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
proclaiming over and over that the science wasn't complete

321
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
at the same time that 250

322
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
out of 254 counties in the state of Texas

323
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
were on fire.

324
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And Perry's policy solution

325
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
was to ask the people of Texas

326
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to pray for rain.

327
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Personally, I was praying for four more fires

328
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
so we could finally complete the damn science.

329
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Laughter)

330
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But back in 2009,

331
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
the question Joel and I kept turning over and over

332
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
was why this late in the game

333
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
so much energy was being spent talking about the science

334
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
when the policies necessary to address climate change

335
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
were unequivocally beneficial for humanity in the long run

336
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
regardless of the science.

337
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So we tossed it back and forth until Joel came up with this.

338
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Cartoon: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"

339
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Laughter)

340
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You've got to love that idea.

341
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

342
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
How about that? How about we create a better world for nothing?

343
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Not for God, not for country, not for profit --

344
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
just as a basic metric for global decision-making.

345
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And this cartoon hit the bull's eye.

346
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Shortly after the conference was over,

347
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Joel got a request for a signed copy

348
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
from the head of the EPA in Washington

349
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
whose wall it now hangs on.

350
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And not long after that, he got another request for a copy

351
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
from the head of the EPA in California

352
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
who used it as part of her presentation

353
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
at an international conference on climate change

354
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
in Sacramento last year.

355
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And it didn't stop there.

356
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
To date, Joel's gotten requests from over 40 environmental groups,

357
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
in the United States, Canada and Europe.

358
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And earlier this year,

359
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
he got a request from the Green Party in Australia

360
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
who used it in their campaign

361
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
where it became part of the debate

362
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that resulted in the Australian parliament

363
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
adopting the most rigorous carbon tax regime

364
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
of any country in the world.

365
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Applause)

366
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
That is a lot of punch

367
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
for 14 words.

368
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So my suggestion to those of you out here

369
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
who are seriously focused on creating a better world

370
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
is to take a little bit of time each day

371
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and practice thinking funny,

372
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
because you might just find the question that you've been looking for.

373
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Thank you.

374
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Applause)

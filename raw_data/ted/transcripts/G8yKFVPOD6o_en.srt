0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you.

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:32,000
William Kamkwamba: Thanks.

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this?

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:41,000
WK: This is my home. This is where I live.

5
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
CA: Where? What country?

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala.

7
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now?

8
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now.

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that?

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
WK: I wanted to make a windmill.

11
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:57,000
CA: A windmill?

12
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:58,000
WK: Yeah.

13
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
CA: What, to power -- for lighting and stuff?

14
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
WK: Yeah.

15
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that?

16
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library,

17
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I read a book that would -- "Using Energy,"

18
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I get information about doing the mill.

19
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I tried, and I made it.

20
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
CA: So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book.

22
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
WK: Ah, no. I just --

23
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
CA: What happened?

24
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book,

25
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it has got four -- ah -- three blades,

26
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and mine has got four blades.

27
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
CA: The book had three, yours had four.

28
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:52,000
WK: Yeah.

29
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
CA: And you made it out of what?

30
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:59,000
WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power.

31
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:,000
CA: OK.

32
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:01,000
WK: Yeah.

33
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better?

34
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
WK: Yeah. I test.

35
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?

36
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What materials did you use?

37
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:16,000
WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls --

38
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide?

39
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
WK: Yeah. The windmill.

40
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked?

41
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:3,000
WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates.

42
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:31,000
CA: How much electricity?

43
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
WK: 12 watts.

44
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights?

45
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
WK: Four bulbs and two radios.

46
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
CA: Wow.

47
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:42,000
WK: Yeah.

48
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Applause) CA: Next slide --

49
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so who's that?

50
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
WK: This is my parents, holding the radio.

51
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time --

52
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
what did they make of this? They were impressed?

53
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
WK: Yeah.

54
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this?

55
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
WK: Um --

56
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one?

57
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
WK: Yeah, I want to build another one --

58
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to pump water and irrigation for crops.

59
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
CA: So this one would have to be bigger?

60
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:24,000
WK: Yeah.

61
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
CA: How big?

62
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:3,000
WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts.

63
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:35,000
CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village?

64
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
WK: Yeah.

65
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:4,000
CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED

66
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to get people who might be able to help in some way

67
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to realize this dream?

68
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah.

69
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
CA: And as you think of your life going forward,

70
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you're 19 now,

71
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:,000
do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?

72
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:05,000
WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy.

73
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:09,000
CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference.

74
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Thank you so much for coming.

75
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
WK: Thank you.

76
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Applause)

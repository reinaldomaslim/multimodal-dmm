0:00:16.42,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Two weeks ago,

3
0:00:17.82,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I was sitting at the kitchen table with my wife Katya,

4
0:00:23.22,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and we were talking about what I was going to talk about today.

5
0:00:28.3,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We have an 11-year-old son; his name is Lincoln.

6
0:00:30.98,000 --> 0:00:33,000
He was sitting at the same table, doing his math homework.

7
0:00:35.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And during a pause in my conversation with Katya,

8
0:00:39.1,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I looked over at Lincoln

9
0:00:40.86,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I was suddenly thunderstruck

10
0:00:44.9,000 --> 0:00:46,000
by a recollection of a client of mine.

11
0:00:48.34,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My client was a guy named Will.

12
0:00:51.14,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He was from North Texas.

13
0:00:54.18,000 --> 0:00:55,000
He never knew his father very well,

14
0:00:55.94,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him.

15
0:01:01.78,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And so, he was destined to be raised by a single mom,

16
0:01:05.98,000 --> 0:01:06,000
which might have been all right

17
0:01:07.481,000 --> 0:01:11,000
except that this particular single mom was a paranoid schizophrenic,

18
0:01:13.1,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and when Will was five years old,

19
0:01:16.06,000 --> 0:01:18,000
she tried to kill him with a butcher knife.

20
0:01:19.54,000 --> 0:01:24,000
She was taken away by authorities and placed in a psychiatric hospital,

21
0:01:24.62,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and so for the next several years Will lived with his older brother,

22
0:01:27.9,000 --> 0:01:3,000
until he committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart.

23
0:01:32.34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And after that Will bounced around from one family member to another,

24
0:01:37.18,000 --> 0:01:4,000
until, by the time he was nine years old, he was essentially living on his own.

25
0:01:42.22,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That morning that I was sitting with Katya and Lincoln,

26
0:01:44.86,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I looked at my son, and I realized that when my client, Will, was his age,

27
0:01:52.74,000 --> 0:01:54,000
he'd been living by himself for two years.

28
0:01:56.9,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Will eventually joined a gang

29
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and committed a number of very serious crimes,

30
0:02:03.66,000 --> 0:02:05,000
including, most seriously of all,

31
0:02:07.02,000 --> 0:02:08,000
a horrible, tragic murder.

32
0:02:10.7,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And Will was ultimately executed as punishment for that crime.

33
0:02:17.86,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But I don't want to talk today about the morality of capital punishment.

34
0:02:23.739,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I certainly think that my client shouldn't have been executed,

35
0:02:27.62,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but what I would like to do today instead

36
0:02:30.54,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is talk about the death penalty in a way I've never done before,

37
0:02:35.62,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in a way that is entirely noncontroversial.

38
0:02:40.86,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I think that's possible,

39
0:02:42.54,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because there is a corner of the death penalty debate --

40
0:02:46.78,000 --> 0:02:48,000
maybe the most important corner --

41
0:02:49.1,000 --> 0:02:51,000
where everybody agrees,

42
0:02:51.86,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where the most ardent death penalty supporters

43
0:02:56.14,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and the most vociferous abolitionists are on exactly the same page.

44
0:03:02.78,000 --> 0:03:04,000
That's the corner I want to explore.

45
0:03:06.5,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Before I do that, though, I want to spend a couple of minutes

46
0:03:09.42,000 --> 0:03:12,000
telling you how a death penalty case unfolds,

47
0:03:13.02,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and then I want to tell you two lessons

48
0:03:15.22,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that I have learned over the last 20 years as a death penalty lawyer

49
0:03:20.3,000 --> 0:03:23,000
from watching well more than a hundred cases unfold in this way.

50
0:03:25.94,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You can think of a death penalty case as a story that has four chapters.

51
0:03:31.22,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The first chapter of every case is exactly the same, and it is tragic.

52
0:03:36.3,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It begins with the murder of an innocent human being,

53
0:03:40.22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and it's followed by a trial

54
0:03:41.98,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where the murderer is convicted and sent to death row,

55
0:03:44.98,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and that death sentence is ultimately upheld by the state appellate court.

56
0:03:49.9,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The second chapter consists of a complicated legal proceeding

57
0:03:52.82,000 --> 0:03:54,000
known as a state habeas corpus appeal.

58
0:03:56.46,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The third chapter is an even more complicated legal proceeding

59
0:03:59.42,000 --> 0:04:01,000
known as a federal habeas corpus proceeding.

60
0:04:01.94,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And the fourth chapter is one where a variety of things can happen.

61
0:04:05.78,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The lawyers might file a clemency petition,

62
0:04:08.3,000 --> 0:04:1,000
they might initiate even more complex litigation,

63
0:04:10.82,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or they might not do anything at all.

64
0:04:13.3,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But that fourth chapter always ends with an execution.

65
0:04:18.22,000 --> 0:04:22,000
When I started representing death row inmates more than 20 years ago,

66
0:04:22.38,000 --> 0:04:24,000
people on death row did not have a right to a lawyer

67
0:04:25.06,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in either the second or the fourth chapter of this story.

68
0:04:28.74,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They were on their own.

69
0:04:30.38,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s

70
0:04:32.82,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that they acquired a right to a lawyer during the third chapter of the story.

71
0:04:37.7,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So what all of these death row inmates had to do was rely on volunteer lawyers

72
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to handle their legal proceedings.

73
0:04:45.62,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The problem is that there were way more guys on death row

74
0:04:49.02,000 --> 0:04:5,000
than there were lawyers

75
0:04:50.3,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who had both the interest and the expertise to work on these cases.

76
0:04:54.06,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And so inevitably,

77
0:04:55.744,000 --> 0:04:58,000
lawyers drifted to cases that were already in chapter four --

78
0:04:59.7,000 --> 0:05:,000
that makes sense, of course.

79
0:05:01.1,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Those are the cases that are most urgent;

80
0:05:03.1,000 --> 0:05:05,000
those are the guys who are closest to being executed.

81
0:05:05.608,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Some of these lawyers were successful;

82
0:05:07.449,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they managed to get new trials for their clients.

83
0:05:09.78,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Others of them managed to extend the lives of their clients,

84
0:05:12.66,000 --> 0:05:14,000
sometimes by years, sometimes by months.

85
0:05:15.58,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But the one thing that didn't happen

86
0:05:18.02,000 --> 0:05:21,000
was that there was never a serious and sustained decline

87
0:05:21.98,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in the number of annual executions in Texas.

88
0:05:24.78,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In fact, as you can see from this graph,

89
0:05:26.74,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from the time that the Texas execution apparatus got efficient

90
0:05:30.14,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in the mid- to late 1990s,

91
0:05:32.22,000 --> 0:05:33,000
there have only been a couple of years

92
0:05:34.054,000 --> 0:05:37,000
where the number of annual executions dipped below 20.

93
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:4,000
In a typical year in Texas,

94
0:05:40.22,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we're averaging about two people a month.

95
0:05:44.14,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In some years in Texas, we've executed close to 40 people,

96
0:05:48.34,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and this number has never significantly declined over the last 15 years.

97
0:05:53.38,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And yet, at the same time that we continue to execute

98
0:05:56.78,000 --> 0:05:58,000
about the same number of people every year,

99
0:05:59.06,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the number of people who we're sentencing to death on an annual basis

100
0:06:02.94,000 --> 0:06:03,000
has dropped rather steeply.

101
0:06:05.22,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So we have this paradox,

102
0:06:07.18,000 --> 0:06:11,000
which is that the number of annual executions has remained high

103
0:06:11.42,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but the number of new death sentences has gone down.

104
0:06:15.46,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Why is that?

105
0:06:16.86,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It can't be attributed to a decline in the murder rate,

106
0:06:19.74,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because the murder rate has not declined nearly so steeply

107
0:06:23.34,000 --> 0:06:25,000
as the red line on that graph has gone down.

108
0:06:26.34,000 --> 0:06:28,000
What has happened instead

109
0:06:28.7,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is that juries have started to sentence more and more people to prison

110
0:06:33.02,000 --> 0:06:36,000
for the rest of their lives without the possibility of parole,

111
0:06:36.34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
rather than sending them to the execution chamber.

112
0:06:40.14,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Why has that happened?

113
0:06:41.82,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It hasn't happened because of a dissolution

114
0:06:44.98,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of popular support for the death penalty.

115
0:06:47.18,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Death penalty opponents take great solace in the fact

116
0:06:50.06,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that death penalty support in Texas is at an all-time low.

117
0:06:54.54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Do you know what all-time low in Texas means?

118
0:06:56.7,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It means that it's in the low 60 percent.

119
0:06:58.94,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now, that's really good compared to the mid-1980s,

120
0:07:01.74,000 --> 0:07:03,000
when it was in excess of 80 percent,

121
0:07:04.42,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but we can't explain the decline in death sentences

122
0:07:07.34,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and the affinity for life without the possibility of parole

123
0:07:10.58,000 --> 0:07:12,000
by an erosion of support for the death penalty,

124
0:07:12.98,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because people still support the death penalty.

125
0:07:15.22,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What's happened to cause this phenomenon?

126
0:07:18.58,000 --> 0:07:22,000
What's happened is that lawyers who represent death row inmates

127
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
have shifted their focus to earlier and earlier chapters

128
0:07:26.86,000 --> 0:07:27,000
of the death penalty story.

129
0:07:28.82,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So 25 years ago, they focused on chapter four.

130
0:07:32.18,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And they went from chapter four 25 years ago

131
0:07:34.54,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to chapter three in the late 1980s.

132
0:07:37.54,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And they went from chapter three in the late 1980s

133
0:07:40.06,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to chapter two in the mid-1990s.

134
0:07:42.5,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And beginning in the mid- to late 1990s,

135
0:07:44.58,000 --> 0:07:46,000
they began to focus on chapter one of the story.

136
0:07:47.58,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, you might think that this decline in death sentences

137
0:07:50.5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and the increase in the number of life sentences

138
0:07:52.78,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is a good thing or a bad thing.

139
0:07:54.3,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I don't want to have a conversation about that today.

140
0:07:56.82,000 --> 0:07:59,000
All that I want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened

141
0:08:00.1,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is because death penalty lawyers have understood

142
0:08:03.1,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that the earlier you intervene in a case,

143
0:08:05.887,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the greater the likelihood that you're going to save your client's life.

144
0:08:09.78,000 --> 0:08:1,000
That's the first thing I've learned.

145
0:08:11.7,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Here's the second thing I learned:

146
0:08:13.82,000 --> 0:08:16,000
My client Will was not the exception to the rule;

147
0:08:18.42,000 --> 0:08:2,000
he was the rule.

148
0:08:21.46,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I sometimes say, if you tell me the name of a death row inmate --

149
0:08:25.06,000 --> 0:08:26,000
doesn't matter what state he's in,

150
0:08:26.74,000 --> 0:08:28,000
doesn't matter if I've ever met him before --

151
0:08:28.9,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'll write his biography for you.

152
0:08:31.3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And eight out of 10 times,

153
0:08:33.7,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the details of that biography will be more or less accurate.

154
0:08:38.34,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And the reason for that is that 80 percent of the people on death row

155
0:08:42.02,000 --> 0:08:46,000
are people who came from the same sort of dysfunctional family that Will did.

156
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Eighty percent of the people on death row

157
0:08:48.46,000 --> 0:08:51,000
are people who had exposure to the juvenile justice system.

158
0:08:53.299,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That's the second lesson that I've learned.

159
0:08:56.58,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now we're right on the cusp of that corner

160
0:09:00.54,000 --> 0:09:01,000
where everybody's going to agree.

161
0:09:03.5,000 --> 0:09:04,000
People in this room might disagree

162
0:09:05.3,000 --> 0:09:07,000
about whether Will should have been executed,

163
0:09:07.98,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but I think everybody would agree

164
0:09:10.34,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that the best possible version of his story

165
0:09:13.98,000 --> 0:09:17,000
would be a story where no murder ever occurs.

166
0:09:19.74,000 --> 0:09:2,000
How do we do that?

167
0:09:21.78,000 --> 0:09:25,000
When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago,

168
0:09:26.54,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it was a big, gnarly problem.

169
0:09:28.86,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And he was learning how, when you have a big old gnarly problem,

170
0:09:32.34,000 --> 0:09:35,000
sometimes the solution is to slice it into smaller problems.

171
0:09:36.3,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That's what we do for most problems --

172
0:09:38.18,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in math, in physics, even in social policy --

173
0:09:40.34,000 --> 0:09:42,000
we slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.

174
0:09:43.66,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But every once in a while, as Dwight Eisenhower said,

175
0:09:47.42,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger.

176
0:09:52.82,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The way we solve this problem

177
0:09:55.22,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is to make the issue of the death penalty bigger.

178
0:09:59.06,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We have to say, all right.

179
0:10:01.42,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We have these four chapters of a death penalty story,

180
0:10:06.18,000 --> 0:10:09,000
but what happens before that story begins?

181
0:10:10.78,000 --> 0:10:13,000
How can we intervene in the life of a murderer

182
0:10:14.66,000 --> 0:10:16,000
before he's a murderer?

183
0:10:17.5,000 --> 0:10:22,000
What options do we have to nudge that person off of the path

184
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that is going to lead to a result that everybody --

185
0:10:26.66,000 --> 0:10:28,000
death penalty supporters and death penalty opponents --

186
0:10:29.46,000 --> 0:10:32,000
still think is a bad result:

187
0:10:32.62,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the murder of an innocent human being?

188
0:10:37.5,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You know, sometimes people say that something isn't rocket science.

189
0:10:43.1,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And by that, what they mean is rocket science is really complicated

190
0:10:46.42,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and this problem that we're talking about now is really simple.

191
0:10:49.94,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Well that's rocket science;

192
0:10:51.38,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that's the mathematical expression for the thrust created by a rocket.

193
0:10:57.3,000 --> 0:11:,000
What we're talking about today is just as complicated.

194
0:11:01.74,000 --> 0:11:05,000
What we're talking about today is also rocket science.

195
0:11:07.06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
My client Will and 80 percent of the people on death row

196
0:11:12.06,000 --> 0:11:14,000
had five chapters in their lives

197
0:11:15.06,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that came before the four chapters of the death penalty story.

198
0:11:19.3,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I think of these five chapters as points of intervention,

199
0:11:22.98,000 --> 0:11:23,000
places in their lives

200
0:11:24.66,000 --> 0:11:27,000
when our society could've intervened in their lives

201
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and nudged them off of the path that they were on

202
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that created a consequence that we all --

203
0:11:33.9,000 --> 0:11:35,000
death penalty supporters or death penalty opponents --

204
0:11:36.82,000 --> 0:11:37,000
say was a bad result.

205
0:11:39.1,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Now, during each of these five chapters:

206
0:11:41.78,000 --> 0:11:42,000
when his mother was pregnant with him;

207
0:11:43.74,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in his early childhood years;

208
0:11:45.82,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when he was in elementary school;

209
0:11:47.42,000 --> 0:11:49,000
when he was in middle school and then high school;

210
0:11:49.786,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and when he was in the juvenile justice system --

211
0:11:52.102,000 --> 0:11:53,000
during each of those five chapters,

212
0:11:53.801,000 --> 0:11:56,000
there were a wide variety of things that society could have done.

213
0:11:56.88,000 --> 0:11:57,000
In fact, if we just imagine

214
0:11:58.5,000 --> 0:12:,000
that there are five different modes of intervention,

215
0:12:01.22,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the way that society could intervene in each of those five chapters,

216
0:12:05.46,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and we could mix and match them any way we want,

217
0:12:07.74,000 --> 0:12:11,000
there are 3,000 -- more than 3,000 -- possible strategies

218
0:12:11.78,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that we could embrace

219
0:12:13.1,000 --> 0:12:17,000
in order to nudge kids like Will off of the path that they're on.

220
0:12:18.42,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So I'm not standing here today with the solution.

221
0:12:22.34,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But the fact that we still have a lot to learn,

222
0:12:26.78,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that doesn't mean that we don't know a lot already.

223
0:12:30.3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We know from experience in other states

224
0:12:33.1,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that there are a wide variety of modes of intervention

225
0:12:36.9,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that we could be using in Texas,

226
0:12:38.54,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and in every other state that isn't using them,

227
0:12:41.34,000 --> 0:12:44,000
in order to prevent a consequence that we all agree is bad.

228
0:12:45.66,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I'll just mention a few.

229
0:12:48.22,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I won't talk today about reforming the legal system.

230
0:12:52.22,000 --> 0:12:53,000
That's probably a topic

231
0:12:53.5,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that is best reserved for a room full of lawyers and judges.

232
0:12:56.98,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Instead, let me talk about a couple of modes of intervention

233
0:13:00.98,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that we can all help accomplish,

234
0:13:03.1,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because they are modes of intervention that will come about

235
0:13:05.886,000 --> 0:13:09,000
when legislators and policymakers, when taxpayers and citizens,

236
0:13:09.98,000 --> 0:13:11,000
agree that that's what we ought to be doing

237
0:13:12.06,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and that's how we ought to be spending our money.

238
0:13:14.42,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We could be providing early childhood care

239
0:13:17.46,000 --> 0:13:21,000
for economically disadvantaged and otherwise troubled kids,

240
0:13:22.5,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and we could be doing it for free.

241
0:13:25.02,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And we could be nudging kids like Will off of the path that we're on.

242
0:13:29.22,000 --> 0:13:32,000
There are other states that do that, but we don't.

243
0:13:32.86,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We could be providing special schools,

244
0:13:35.46,000 --> 0:13:37,000
at both the high school level and the middle school level,

245
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but even in K-5,

246
0:13:40.42,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that target economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids,

247
0:13:43.42,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and particularly kids who have had exposure to the juvenile justice system.

248
0:13:47.9,000 --> 0:13:49,000
There are a handful of states that do that;

249
0:13:50.06,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Texas doesn't.

250
0:13:52.18,000 --> 0:13:56,000
There's one other thing we can be doing -- well, there are a bunch of other things --

251
0:13:56.22,000 --> 0:13:58,000
there's one other thing that I'm going to mention,

252
0:13:58.58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and this is going to be the only controversial thing that I say today.

253
0:14:01.89,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We could be intervening much more aggressively

254
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
into dangerously dysfunctional homes,

255
0:14:08.46,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and getting kids out of them

256
0:14:10.42,000 --> 0:14:13,000
before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them.

257
0:14:15.86,000 --> 0:14:18,000
If we're going to do that, we need a place to put them.

258
0:14:19.82,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Even if we do all of those things,

259
0:14:21.5,000 --> 0:14:23,000
some kids are going to fall through the cracks

260
0:14:23.7,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and they're going to end up in that last chapter

261
0:14:25.98,000 --> 0:14:26,000
before the murder story begins,

262
0:14:27.54,000 --> 0:14:29,000
they're going to end up in the juvenile justice system.

263
0:14:30.18,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And even if that happens, it's not yet too late.

264
0:14:33.86,000 --> 0:14:35,000
There's still time to nudge them,

265
0:14:36.66,000 --> 0:14:39,000
if we think about nudging them rather than just punishing them.

266
0:14:40.66,000 --> 0:14:42,000
There are two professors in the Northeast --

267
0:14:42.78,000 --> 0:14:43,000
one at Yale and one at Maryland --

268
0:14:44.46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
they set up a school that is attached to a juvenile prison.

269
0:14:49.14,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And the kids are in prison, but they go to school

270
0:14:51.5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
from eight in the morning until four in the afternoon.

271
0:14:54.1,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Now, it was logistically difficult.

272
0:14:55.82,000 --> 0:14:58,000
They had to recruit teachers who wanted to teach inside a prison,

273
0:14:59.1,000 --> 0:15:,000
they had to establish strict separation

274
0:15:00.982,000 --> 0:15:03,000
between the people who work at the school and the prison authorities,

275
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and most dauntingly of all,

276
0:15:05.62,000 --> 0:15:07,000
they needed to invent a new curriculum because you know what?

277
0:15:08.54,000 --> 0:15:11,000
People don't come into and out of prison on a semester basis.

278
0:15:11.63,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(Laughter)

279
0:15:13.42,000 --> 0:15:15,000
But they did all those things.

280
0:15:16.5,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Now, what do all of these things have in common?

281
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
What all of these things have in common is that they cost money.

282
0:15:25.58,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Some of the people in the room might be old enough

283
0:15:27.98,000 --> 0:15:31,000
to remember the guy on the old oil filter commercial.

284
0:15:32.42,000 --> 0:15:37,000
He used to say, "Well, you can pay me now or you can pay me later."

285
0:15:39.3,000 --> 0:15:42,000
What we're doing in the death penalty system

286
0:15:43.86,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is we're paying later.

287
0:15:47.14,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But the thing is that for every 15,000 dollars

288
0:15:51.06,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that we spend intervening

289
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
in the lives of economically and otherwise disadvantaged kids

290
0:15:57.02,000 --> 0:15:58,000
in those earlier chapters,

291
0:15:58.34,000 --> 0:16:02,000
we save 80,000 dollars in crime-related costs down the road.

292
0:16:03.06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Even if you don't agree that there's a moral imperative that we do it,

293
0:16:09.62,000 --> 0:16:11,000
it just makes economic sense.

294
0:16:13.46,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I want to tell you about the last conversation that I had with Will.

295
0:16:17.58,000 --> 0:16:21,000
It was the day that he was going to be executed,

296
0:16:22.94,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and we were just talking.

297
0:16:25.38,000 --> 0:16:27,000
There was nothing left to do in his case.

298
0:16:28.54,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And we were talking about his life.

299
0:16:31.02,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And he was talking first about his dad, who he hardly knew, who had died,

300
0:16:35.62,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and then about his mom, who he did know, who was still alive.

301
0:16:41.14,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And I said to him,

302
0:16:43.86,000 --> 0:16:44,000
"I know the story.

303
0:16:45.86,000 --> 0:16:46,000
I've read the records.

304
0:16:47.78,000 --> 0:16:48,000
I know that she tried to kill you."

305
0:16:50.18,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I said, "But I've always wondered

306
0:16:51.82,000 --> 0:16:53,000
whether you really actually remember that."

307
0:16:54.82,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I said, "I don't remember anything from when I was five years old.

308
0:16:58.86,000 --> 0:17:,000
Maybe you just remember somebody telling you."

309
0:17:01.66,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And he looked at me and he leaned forward,

310
0:17:04.06,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and he said, "Professor," --

311
0:17:05.46,000 --> 0:17:07,000
he'd known me for 12 years, he still called me Professor.

312
0:17:08.18,000 --> 0:17:11,000
He said, "Professor, I don't mean any disrespect by this,

313
0:17:11.22,000 --> 0:17:13,000
but when your mama picks up a butcher knife

314
0:17:13.7,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that looks bigger than you are,

315
0:17:16.1,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and chases you through the house screaming she's going to kill you,

316
0:17:19.9,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and you have to lock yourself in the bathroom

317
0:17:22.22,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and lean against the door

318
0:17:23.5,000 --> 0:17:25,000
and holler for help until the police get there,"

319
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
he looked at me and he said,

320
0:17:29.22,000 --> 0:17:31,000
"that's something you don't forget."

321
0:17:32.74,000 --> 0:17:34,000
I hope there's one thing you all won't forget:

322
0:17:35.46,000 --> 0:17:37,000
In between the time you arrived here this morning

323
0:17:37.82,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and the time we break for lunch,

324
0:17:39.42,000 --> 0:17:42,000
there are going to be four homicides in the United States.

325
0:17:42.9,000 --> 0:17:45,000
We're going to devote enormous social resources

326
0:17:46.1,000 --> 0:17:48,000
to punishing the people who commit those crimes,

327
0:17:48.38,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and that's appropriate

328
0:17:49.62,000 --> 0:17:51,000
because we should punish people who do bad things.

329
0:17:52.02,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But three of those crimes are preventable.

330
0:17:55.14,000 --> 0:17:58,000
If we make the picture bigger

331
0:17:58.42,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and devote our attention to the earlier chapters,

332
0:18:02.62,000 --> 0:18:05,000
then we're never going to write the first sentence

333
0:18:06.1,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that begins the death penalty story.

334
0:18:08.94,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Thank you.

335
0:18:10.18,000 --> 0:18:11,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I do want to test this question we're all interested in:

3
0:00:15.8,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Does extinction have to be forever?

4
0:00:18.84,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about.

5
0:00:21.56,000 --> 0:00:22,000
One is the Thylacine Project.

6
0:00:23.4,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The other one is the Lazarus Project,

7
0:00:25.186,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and that's focused on the gastric-brooding frog.

8
0:00:27.92,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And it would be a fair question to ask,

9
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:31,000
why have we focused on these two animals?

10
0:00:32.12,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own.

11
0:00:37.52,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We've lost a whole family.

12
0:00:39.12,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That's a big chunk of the global genome gone.

13
0:00:41.76,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'd like it back.

14
0:00:43.36,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The second reason is that we killed these things.

15
0:00:47.72,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In the case of the thylacine, regrettably, we shot every one that we saw.

16
0:00:52.68,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We slaughtered them.

17
0:00:54.6,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In the case of the gastric-brooding frog, we may have "fungicided" it to death.

18
0:00:59.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world

19
0:01:02.44,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that's called the chytrid fungus,

20
0:01:04.08,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it's nailing frogs all over the world.

21
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We think that's probably what got this frog,

22
0:01:08.392,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and humans are spreading this fungus.

23
0:01:10.8,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And this introduces a very important ethical point,

24
0:01:13.68,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I think you will have heard this many times

25
0:01:15.92,000 --> 0:01:16,000
when this topic comes up.

26
0:01:17.56,000 --> 0:01:18,000
What I think is important

27
0:01:19.32,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is that, if it's clear that we exterminated these species,

28
0:01:22.92,000 --> 0:01:25,000
then I think we not only have a moral obligation

29
0:01:26.36,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to see what we can do about it,

30
0:01:27.861,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something, if we can.

31
0:01:32.72,000 --> 0:01:34,000
OK. Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project.

32
0:01:35.6,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's a frog. And you think, frog.

33
0:01:38.48,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Yeah, but this was not just any frog.

34
0:01:41.88,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Unlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water

35
0:01:44.68,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and goes away and wishes its froglets well,

36
0:01:47.36,000 --> 0:01:5,000
this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs,

37
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
swallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food,

38
0:01:54.68,000 --> 0:01:58,000
didn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus.

39
0:01:59.2,000 --> 0:02:02,000
In the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles,

40
0:02:02.56,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and in the stomach, the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs,

41
0:02:06.44,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and they grew in the stomach

42
0:02:08.12,000 --> 0:02:12,000
until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart.

43
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It has a little cough and a hiccup, and out comes sprays of little frogs.

44
0:02:16.24,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now, when biologists saw this, they were agog.

45
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They thought, this is incredible.

46
0:02:20.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
No animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this,

47
0:02:24.8,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to change one organ in the body into another.

48
0:02:26.96,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well.

49
0:02:30.8,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If we could understand

50
0:02:32.04,000 --> 0:02:35,000
how that frog is managing the way its tummy works,

51
0:02:35.36,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is there information here that we need to understand

52
0:02:37.84,000 --> 0:02:4,000
or could usefully use to help ourselves?

53
0:02:41.2,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Now, I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach,

54
0:02:44.56,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but I am suggesting it's possible

55
0:02:46.2,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut.

56
0:02:48.88,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And just as everybody got excited about it, bang!

57
0:02:51.72,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It was extinct.

58
0:02:54.12,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I called up my friend,

59
0:02:55.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide.

60
0:02:58.005,000 --> 0:03:02,000
He was the last person who had this frog, a colony of these things, in his lab.

61
0:03:02.4,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And I said, "Mike, by any chance --" This was 30 or 40 years ago.

62
0:03:05.472,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog?"

63
0:03:09.24,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And he thought about it,

64
0:03:10.48,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and he went to his deep freezer, minus 20 degrees centigrade,

65
0:03:14.32,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and he poured through everything in the freezer,

66
0:03:16.6,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs.

67
0:03:20.92,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This was very exciting,

68
0:03:22.2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work,

69
0:03:25.56,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it,

70
0:03:29.52,000 --> 0:03:32,000
cryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen.

71
0:03:33.2,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands,

72
0:03:35.96,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the same thing happens in a cell.

73
0:03:37.8,000 --> 0:03:41,000
If you freeze tissues, the water expands, damages or bursts the cell walls.

74
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Well, we looked at the tissue under the microscope.

75
0:03:44.64,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It actually didn't look bad. The cell walls looked intact.

76
0:03:47.4,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So we thought, let's give it a go.

77
0:03:49.48,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation.

78
0:03:53.76,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We took the eggs of a related species, a living frog,

79
0:03:57.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg.

80
0:04:00.28,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.

81
0:04:02.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog

82
0:04:07.48,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and we inserted those nuclei into that egg.

83
0:04:10.6,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, by rights, this is kind of like a cloning project,

84
0:04:14.08,000 --> 0:04:15,000
like what produced Dolly,

85
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but it's actually very different,

86
0:04:16.96,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells.

87
0:04:19.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
That was a miracle, but it was workable.

88
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:25,000
What we're trying to do is take a dead nucleus from an extinct species

89
0:04:25.76,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and put it into a completely different species and expect that to work.

90
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Well, we had no real reason to expect it would,

91
0:04:31.48,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these.

92
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And just last February, the last time we did these trials,

93
0:04:37.6,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I saw a miracle starting to happen.

94
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:44,000
What we found was most of these eggs didn't work,

95
0:04:44.36,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but then suddenly, one of them began to divide.

96
0:04:47.36,000 --> 0:04:48,000
That was so exciting.

97
0:04:48.76,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And then the egg divided again. And then again.

98
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And pretty soon, we had early-stage embryos

99
0:04:54.72,000 --> 0:04:56,000
with hundreds of cells forming those.

100
0:04:57.52,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We even DNA-tested some of these cells,

101
0:05:00.32,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and the DNA of the extinct frog is in those cells.

102
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So we're very excited. This is not a tadpole. It's not a frog.

103
0:05:07.68,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But it's a long way along the journey

104
0:05:10.44,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to producing, or bringing back, an extinct species.

105
0:05:13.28,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And this is news.

106
0:05:14.52,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We haven't announced this publicly before.

107
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We're excited.

108
0:05:18.24,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We've got to get past this point.

109
0:05:19.88,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We now want this ball of cells to start to gastrulate,

110
0:05:22.428,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to turn in so that it will produce the other tissues.

111
0:05:25.08,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It'll go on and produce a tadpole and then a frog.

112
0:05:28.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Watch this space.

113
0:05:30.04,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I think we're going to have this frog hopping

114
0:05:32.257,000 --> 0:05:33,000
glad to be back in the world again.

115
0:05:34.72,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

116
0:05:36.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Thank you.

117
0:05:37.79,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Applause)

118
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We haven't done it yet, but keep the applause ready.

119
0:05:43.08,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The second project I want to talk to you about is the Thylacine Project.

120
0:05:47.08,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The thylacine looks a bit, to most people, like a dog,

121
0:05:50.96,000 --> 0:05:52,000
or maybe like a tiger, because it has stripes.

122
0:05:53.127,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But it's not related to any of those. It's a marsupial.

123
0:05:55.96,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It raised its young in a pouch, like a koala or a kangaroo would do,

124
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and it has a long history, a long, fascinating history,

125
0:06:05.2,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that goes back 25 million years.

126
0:06:08.12,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But it's also a tragic history.

127
0:06:10.2,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The first one that we see occurs in the ancient rain forests of Australia

128
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
about 25 million years ago,

129
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and the National Geographic Society

130
0:06:19.52,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is helping us to explore these fossil deposits.

131
0:06:21.775,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is Riversleigh.

132
0:06:23.32,000 --> 0:06:26,000
In those fossil rocks are some amazing animals.

133
0:06:26.4,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We found marsupial lions.

134
0:06:28.32,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We found carnivorous kangaroos.

135
0:06:30.92,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's not what you usually think about as a kangaroo,

136
0:06:33.4,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but these are meat-eating kangaroos.

137
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We found the biggest bird in the world,

138
0:06:37.08,000 --> 0:06:39,000
bigger than that thing that was in Madagascar,

139
0:06:39.247,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and it too was a flesh eater.

140
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It was a giant, weird duck.

141
0:06:43.04,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And crocodiles were not behaving at that time either.

142
0:06:45.96,000 --> 0:06:47,000
You think of crocodiles as doing their ugly thing,

143
0:06:48.36,000 --> 0:06:49,000
sitting in a pool of water.

144
0:06:49.8,000 --> 0:06:51,000
These crocodiles were actually out on the land

145
0:06:52.36,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and they were even climbing trees and jumping on prey on the ground.

146
0:06:57.6,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We had, in Australia, drop crocs. They really do exist.

147
0:07:01.775,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:02.898,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But what they were dropping on was not only other weird animals

149
0:07:05.94,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but also thylacines.

150
0:07:07.24,000 --> 0:07:1,000
There were five different kinds of thylacines in those ancient forests,

151
0:07:11.2,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and they ranged from great big ones to middle-sized ones

152
0:07:15.68,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to one that was about the size of a chihuahua.

153
0:07:19.44,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Paris Hilton would have been able

154
0:07:21.08,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to carry one of these things around in a little handbag,

155
0:07:23.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
until a drop croc landed on her.

156
0:07:25.56,000 --> 0:07:26,000
At any rate, it was a fascinating place,

157
0:07:27.52,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but unfortunately, Australia didn't stay this way.

158
0:07:30.32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Climate change has affected the world for a long period of time,

159
0:07:33.84,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and gradually, the forests disappeared, the country began to dry out,

160
0:07:38.28,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the number of kinds of thylacines began to decline,

161
0:07:40.92,000 --> 0:07:41,000
until by five million years ago,

162
0:07:42.52,000 --> 0:07:43,000
only one left.

163
0:07:43.72,000 --> 0:07:46,000
By 10,000 years ago, they had disappeared from New Guinea,

164
0:07:47.28,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and unfortunately, by 4,000 years ago, somebodies, we don't know who this was,

165
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
introduced dingoes -- this is a very archaic kind of a dog --

166
0:07:57.92,000 --> 0:07:58,000
into Australia.

167
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
And as you can see,

168
0:08:00.4,000 --> 0:08:02,000
dingoes are very similar in their body form to thylacines.

169
0:08:03.24,000 --> 0:08:05,000
That similarity meant they probably competed.

170
0:08:06.2,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They were eating the same kinds of foods.

171
0:08:08.2,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's even possible that aborigines were keeping some of these dingoes as pets,

172
0:08:12.84,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and therefore they may have had an advantage in the battle for survival.

173
0:08:16.3,000 --> 0:08:18,000
All we know is, soon after the dingoes were brought in,

174
0:08:18.94,000 --> 0:08:2,000
thylacines were extinct in the Australian mainland,

175
0:08:21.38,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and after that they only survived in Tasmania.

176
0:08:25.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Then, unfortunately,

177
0:08:26.72,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the next sad part of the thylacine story is that Europeans arrived in 1788,

178
0:08:31.28,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and they brought with them the things they valued,

179
0:08:34.08,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and that included sheep.

180
0:08:36.36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They took one look at the thylacine in Tasmania,

181
0:08:38.92,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and they thought, hang on, this is not going to work.

182
0:08:42.04,000 --> 0:08:44,000
That guy is going to eat all our sheep.

183
0:08:44.938,000 --> 0:08:46,000
That was not what happened, actually.

184
0:08:47.2,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Wild dogs did eat a few of the sheep, but the thylacine got a bad rap.

185
0:08:50.799,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But immediately, the government said, that's it, let's get rid of them,

186
0:08:54.799,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and they paid people to slaughter every one that they saw.

187
0:08:58.6,000 --> 0:09:,000
By the early 1930s,

188
0:09:00.92,000 --> 0:09:03,000
3,000 to 4,000 thylacines had been murdered.

189
0:09:04.76,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall.

190
0:09:09.08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Have a look at this bit of film footage.

191
0:09:11.56,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal,

192
0:09:15.32,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it

193
0:09:20.4,000 --> 0:09:24,000
before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction,

194
0:09:24.48,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we didn't, unfortunately, at this same time,

195
0:09:27.12,000 --> 0:09:31,000
have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species.

196
0:09:31.2,000 --> 0:09:34,000
These are photos of the last surviving thylacine, Benjamin,

197
0:09:34.6,000 --> 0:09:36,000
who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart.

198
0:09:37.68,000 --> 0:09:38,000
To add insult to injury,

199
0:09:39.32,000 --> 0:09:42,000
having swept this species nearly off the table,

200
0:09:43.04,000 --> 0:09:45,000
this animal, when it died of neglect --

201
0:09:45.56,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.

202
0:09:50.08,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It died of exposure, and in the morning, when they found the body of Benjamin,

203
0:09:53.96,000 --> 0:09:57,000
they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump.

204
0:10:00.6,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Does it have to stay this way?

205
0:10:03.72,000 --> 0:10:05,000
In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum.

206
0:10:06.12,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I was fascinated by thylacines.

207
0:10:07.88,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I've always been obsessed with these animals.

208
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And I was studying skulls,

209
0:10:11.28,000 --> 0:10:14,000
trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals,

210
0:10:14.56,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and I saw this jar,

211
0:10:16.56,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup,

212
0:10:21.12,000 --> 0:10:22,000
perhaps six months old.

213
0:10:22.84,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The guy who had found it and killed the mother

214
0:10:25.2,000 --> 0:10:28,000
had pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol.

215
0:10:28.36,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative.

216
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But this was 1990, and I asked my geneticist friends,

217
0:10:36.36,000 --> 0:10:38,000
couldn't we think about going into this pup

218
0:10:38.8,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and extracting DNA, if it's there,

219
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and then somewhere down the line in the future,

220
0:10:44.04,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back?

221
0:10:46.28,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The geneticists laughed. But this was six years before Dolly.

222
0:10:50.791,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Cloning was science fiction.

223
0:10:52.562,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It had not happened.

224
0:10:53.82,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But then suddenly cloning did happen.

225
0:10:56.24,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And I thought, when I became director of the Australian Museum,

226
0:10:59.4,000 --> 0:11:,000
I'm going to give this a go.

227
0:11:00.76,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I put a team together.

228
0:11:02.24,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We went into that pup to see what was in it,

229
0:11:05.12,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and we did find thylacine DNA.

230
0:11:07.32,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It was a eureka moment. We were very excited.

231
0:11:09.52,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Unfortunately, we also found a lot of human DNA.

232
0:11:13.24,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Every old curator who'd been in that museum

233
0:11:16.24,000 --> 0:11:17,000
had seen this wonderful specimen,

234
0:11:18.12,000 --> 0:11:2,000
put their hand in the jar, pulled it out and thought,

235
0:11:20.64,000 --> 0:11:22,000
"Wow, look at that," plop, dropped it back in the jar,

236
0:11:23.2,000 --> 0:11:24,000
contaminating this specimen.

237
0:11:24.8,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And that was a worry.

238
0:11:26.12,000 --> 0:11:28,000
If the goal here was to get the DNA out

239
0:11:28.36,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back,

240
0:11:32.32,000 --> 0:11:33,000
what we didn't want happening

241
0:11:33.76,000 --> 0:11:35,000
when the information was shoved into the machine

242
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed,

243
0:11:38.48,000 --> 0:11:41,000
was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine.

244
0:11:42.48,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It would've kept the curator very happy, but it wasn't going to keep us happy.

245
0:11:46.2,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So we went back to these specimens and we started digging around,

246
0:11:49.28,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and particularly, we looked into the teeth of skulls,

247
0:11:52.44,000 --> 0:11:55,000
hard parts where humans had not been able to get their fingers,

248
0:11:55.52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and we found much better quality DNA.

249
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:,000
We found nuclear mitochondrial genes.

250
0:12:00.2,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It's there. So we got it.

251
0:12:01.72,000 --> 0:12:03,000
OK. What could we do with this stuff?

252
0:12:04.2,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Well, George Church, in his book, "Regenesis,"

253
0:12:06.42,000 --> 0:12:09,000
has mentioned many of the techniques that are rapidly advancing

254
0:12:09.48,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to work with fragmented DNA.

255
0:12:11.52,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We would hope that we'll be able to get that DNA back into a viable form,

256
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and then, much like we've done with the Lazarus Project,

257
0:12:18.84,000 --> 0:12:21,000
get that stuff into an egg of a host species.

258
0:12:21.92,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It has to be a different species. What could it be?

259
0:12:24.36,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Why couldn't it be a Tasmanian devil?

260
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
They're related, distantly, to thylacines.

261
0:12:28.76,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And then the Tasmanian devil is going to pop a thylacine out the south end.

262
0:12:33.164,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Critics of this project say, hang on.

263
0:12:36.2,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Thylacine, Tasmanian devil? That's going to hurt.

264
0:12:40.32,000 --> 0:12:42,000
No, it's not. These are marsupials.

265
0:12:43.2,000 --> 0:12:45,000
They give birth to babies that are the size of a jelly bean.

266
0:12:46.08,000 --> 0:12:49,000
That Tasmanian devil's not even going to know it gave birth.

267
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It is, shortly, going to think

268
0:12:50.96,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it's got the ugliest Tasmanian devil baby in the world,

269
0:12:54.08,000 --> 0:12:56,000
so maybe it'll need some help to keep it going.

270
0:12:58.44,000 --> 0:13:,000
Andrew Pask and his colleagues have demonstrated

271
0:13:00.72,000 --> 0:13:01,000
this might not be a waste of time.

272
0:13:02.6,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And it's sort of in the future, we haven't got there yet,

273
0:13:05.32,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but it's the kind of thing we want to think about.

274
0:13:07.72,000 --> 0:13:09,000
They took some of this same pickled thylacine DNA

275
0:13:10.28,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and they spliced it into a mouse genome,

276
0:13:13.6,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but they put a tag on it

277
0:13:15.12,000 --> 0:13:18,000
so that anything that this thylacine DNA produced

278
0:13:19.12,000 --> 0:13:21,000
would appear blue-green in the mouse baby.

279
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:26,000
In other words, if thylacine tissues were being produced by the thylacine DNA,

280
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it would be able to be recognized.

281
0:13:28.08,000 --> 0:13:32,000
When the baby popped up, it was filled with blue-green tissues.

282
0:13:32.12,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And that tells us if we can get that genome back together,

283
0:13:34.92,000 --> 0:13:35,000
get it into a live cell,

284
0:13:36.4,000 --> 0:13:38,000
it's going to produce thylacine stuff.

285
0:13:39.44,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Is this a risk?

286
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You've taken the bits of one animal

287
0:13:42.96,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and you've mixed them into the cell of a different kind of an animal.

288
0:13:46.231,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Are we going to get a Frankenstein? Some kind of weird hybrid chimera?

289
0:13:50.36,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And the answer is no.

290
0:13:51.64,000 --> 0:13:55,000
If the only nuclear DNA that goes into this hybrid cell is thylacine DNA,

291
0:13:56.4,000 --> 0:13:59,000
that's the only thing that can pop out the other end of the devil.

292
0:14:00.52,000 --> 0:14:03,000
OK, if we can do this, could we put it back?

293
0:14:04.04,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This is a key question for everybody.

294
0:14:05.84,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Does it have to stay in a laboratory, or could we put it back where it belongs?

295
0:14:09.6,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in Tasmania,

296
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:14,000
restore that ecosystem?

297
0:14:14.52,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Or has Tasmania changed so much that that's no longer possible?

298
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I've been to Tasmania.

299
0:14:20.8,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I've been to many of the areas where the thylacines were common.

300
0:14:23.84,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I've even spoken to people, like Peter Carter here,

301
0:14:26.72,000 --> 0:14:28,000
who when I spoke to him, was 90 years old,

302
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but in 1926, this man and his father and his brother

303
0:14:32.88,000 --> 0:14:33,000
caught thylacines.

304
0:14:34.28,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They trapped them.

305
0:14:35.64,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And when I spoke to this man, I was looking in his eyes and thinking,

306
0:14:39.96,000 --> 0:14:45,000
"Behind those eyes is a brain that has memories of what thylacines feel like,

307
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
what they smelled like, what they sounded like."

308
0:14:48.64,000 --> 0:14:49,000
He led them around on a rope.

309
0:14:50.2,000 --> 0:14:52,000
He has personal experiences

310
0:14:52.28,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that I would give my left leg to have in my head.

311
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We'd all love to have this sort of thing happen.

312
0:14:58.32,000 --> 0:15:,000
Anyway, I asked Peter, by any chance,

313
0:15:00.6,000 --> 0:15:02,000
could he take us back to where he caught those thylacines.

314
0:15:03.36,000 --> 0:15:05,000
My interest was in whether the environment had changed.

315
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
He thought hard. It was nearly 80 years before this that he'd been at this hut.

316
0:15:09.8,000 --> 0:15:11,000
At any rate, he led us down this bush track,

317
0:15:12.08,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and there, right where he remembered,

318
0:15:14.08,000 --> 0:15:15,000
was the hut,

319
0:15:15.36,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and tears came into his eyes.

320
0:15:17.84,000 --> 0:15:18,000
He looked at the hut. We went inside.

321
0:15:19.68,000 --> 0:15:21,000
There were the wooden boards on the sides of the hut

322
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
where he and his father and his brother had slept at night.

323
0:15:24.96,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And he told me, as it all was flooding back in memories.

324
0:15:27.64,000 --> 0:15:29,000
He said, "I remember the thylacines going around the hut

325
0:15:30.32,000 --> 0:15:31,000
wondering what was inside,"

326
0:15:31.68,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and he said they made sounds like "Yip! Yip! Yip!"

327
0:15:35.2,000 --> 0:15:38,000
All of these are parts of his life and what he remembers.

328
0:15:38.44,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And the key question for me was to ask Peter, has it changed?

329
0:15:41.88,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And he said no.

330
0:15:43.12,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The southern beech forests surrounded his hut

331
0:15:45.28,000 --> 0:15:47,000
just like it was when he was there in 1926.

332
0:15:47.64,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The grasslands were sweeping away.

333
0:15:49.64,000 --> 0:15:5,000
That's classic thylacine habitat.

334
0:15:51.64,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And the animals in those areas were the same that were there

335
0:15:54.52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
when the thylacine was around.

336
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So could we put it back? Yes.

337
0:15:58.64,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Is that all we would do? And this is an interesting question.

338
0:16:02.28,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Sometimes you might be able to put it back,

339
0:16:04.56,000 --> 0:16:07,000
but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again?

340
0:16:07.8,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And I don't think so.

341
0:16:09.36,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I think gradually, as we see species all around the world,

342
0:16:12.68,000 --> 0:16:15,000
it's kind of a mantra that wildlife is increasingly not safe in the wild.

343
0:16:16.48,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We'd love to think it is, but we know it isn't.

344
0:16:18.695,000 --> 0:16:2,000
We need other parallel strategies coming online.

345
0:16:21.12,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And this one interests me.

346
0:16:22.64,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Some of the thylacines that were being turned in to zoos,

347
0:16:25.386,000 --> 0:16:26,000
sanctuaries, even at the museums,

348
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
had collar marks on the neck.

349
0:16:29.52,000 --> 0:16:3,000
They were being kept as pets,

350
0:16:31.44,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and we know a lot of bush tales and memories

351
0:16:34.44,000 --> 0:16:35,000
of people who had them as pets,

352
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and they say they were wonderful, friendly.

353
0:16:38.2,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This particular one

354
0:16:39.44,000 --> 0:16:41,000
came in out of the forest to lick this boy

355
0:16:42.44,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and curled up around the fireplace to go to sleep.

356
0:16:45.074,000 --> 0:16:46,000
A wild animal.

357
0:16:46.48,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And I'd like to ask the question. We need to think about this.

358
0:16:50.8,000 --> 0:16:55,000
If it had not been illegal to keep these thylacines as pets then,

359
0:16:56.28,000 --> 0:16:58,000
would the thylacine be extinct now?

360
0:16:58.48,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And I'm positive it wouldn't.

361
0:17:00.24,000 --> 0:17:02,000
We need to think about this in today's world.

362
0:17:03.24,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Could it be that getting animals close to us so that we value them,

363
0:17:07.8,000 --> 0:17:08,000
maybe they won't go extinct?

364
0:17:09.2,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And this is such a critical issue for us

365
0:17:11.76,000 --> 0:17:12,000
because if we don't do that,

366
0:17:13.12,000 --> 0:17:17,000
we're going to watch more of these animals plunge off the precipice.

367
0:17:17.28,000 --> 0:17:18,000
As far as I'm concerned,

368
0:17:18.52,000 --> 0:17:22,000
this is why we're trying to do these kinds of de-extinction projects.

369
0:17:22.68,000 --> 0:17:25,000
We are trying to restore that balance of nature

370
0:17:25.76,000 --> 0:17:26,000
that we have upset.

371
0:17:27.793,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Thank you.

372
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Applause)

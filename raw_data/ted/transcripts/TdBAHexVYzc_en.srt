0:00:13.303,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A few years ago,

2
0:00:14.487,000 --> 0:00:16,000
with my colleague, Emmanuelle Charpentier,

3
0:00:17.281,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I invented a new technology for editing genomes.

4
0:00:21.093,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's called CRISPR-Cas9.

5
0:00:23.87,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The CRISPR technology allows scientists to make changes

6
0:00:27.47,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to the DNA in cells

7
0:00:29.349,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that could allow us to cure genetic disease.

8
0:00:33.196,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You might be interested to know

9
0:00:34.712,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that the CRISPR technology came about through a basic research project

10
0:00:38.52,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that was aimed at discovering how bacteria fight viral infections.

11
0:00:43.34,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Bacteria have to deal with viruses in their environment,

12
0:00:46.236,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and we can think about a viral infection like a ticking time bomb --

13
0:00:49.924,000 --> 0:00:52,000
a bacterium has only a few minutes to defuse the bomb

14
0:00:53.306,000 --> 0:00:54,000
before it gets destroyed.

15
0:00:55.284,000 --> 0:01:,000
So, many bacteria have in their cells an adaptive immune system called CRISPR,

16
0:01:00.698,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that allows them to detect viral DNA and destroy it.

17
0:01:05.148,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Part of the CRISPR system is a protein called Cas9,

18
0:01:09.14,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that's able to seek out, cut and eventually degrade viral DNA

19
0:01:15.113,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in a specific way.

20
0:01:17.054,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And it was through our research

21
0:01:18.58,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to understand the activity of this protein, Cas9,

22
0:01:22.261,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that we realized that we could harness its function

23
0:01:25.116,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as a genetic engineering technology --

24
0:01:28.546,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a way for scientists to delete or insert specific bits of DNA into cells

25
0:01:35.521,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with incredible precision --

26
0:01:37.576,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that would offer opportunities

27
0:01:39.267,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to do things that really haven't been possible in the past.

28
0:01:43.184,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The CRISPR technology has already been used

29
0:01:45.27,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to change the DNA in the cells of mice and monkeys,

30
0:01:50.378,000 --> 0:01:51,000
other organisms as well.

31
0:01:52.527,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Chinese scientists showed recently

32
0:01:54.306,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that they could even use the CRISPR technology

33
0:01:56.489,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to change genes in human embryos.

34
0:01:59.142,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And scientists in Philadelphia showed they could use CRISPR

35
0:02:02.309,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to remove the DNA of an integrated HIV virus

36
0:02:07.176,000 --> 0:02:09,000
from infected human cells.

37
0:02:10.217,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The opportunity to do this kind of genome editing

38
0:02:13.372,000 --> 0:02:16,000
also raises various ethical issues that we have to consider,

39
0:02:16.679,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because this technology can be employed not only in adult cells,

40
0:02:20.671,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but also in the embryos of organisms,

41
0:02:23.298,000 --> 0:02:26,000
including our own species.

42
0:02:26.767,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And so, together with my colleagues,

43
0:02:28.789,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I've called for a global conversation about the technology that I co-invented,

44
0:02:33.301,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so that we can consider all of the ethical and societal implications

45
0:02:37.865,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of a technology like this.

46
0:02:40.056,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What I want to do now is tell you what the CRISPR technology is,

47
0:02:45.019,000 --> 0:02:46,000
what it can do,

48
0:02:46.497,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where we are today

49
0:02:47.766,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and why I think we need to take a prudent path forward

50
0:02:50.812,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in the way that we employ this technology.

51
0:02:55.085,000 --> 0:02:58,000
When viruses infect a cell, they inject their DNA.

52
0:02:59.363,000 --> 0:03:,000
And in a bacterium,

53
0:03:00.863,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the CRISPR system allows that DNA to be plucked out of the virus,

54
0:03:05.752,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and inserted in little bits into the chromosome --

55
0:03:09.621,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the DNA of the bacterium.

56
0:03:11.937,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And these integrated bits of viral DNA get inserted at a site called CRISPR.

57
0:03:18.032,000 --> 0:03:23,000
CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats.

58
0:03:24.051,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:25.076,000 --> 0:03:28,000
A big mouthful -- you can see why we use the acronym CRISPR.

60
0:03:28.89,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's a mechanism that allows cells to record, over time,

61
0:03:32.902,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the viruses they have been exposed to.

62
0:03:35.608,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And importantly, those bits of DNA are passed on to the cells' progeny,

63
0:03:40.315,000 --> 0:03:44,000
so cells are protected from viruses not only in one generation,

64
0:03:44.872,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but over many generations of cells.

65
0:03:47.245,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This allows the cells to keep a record of infection,

66
0:03:51.554,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and as my colleague, Blake Wiedenheft, likes to say,

67
0:03:54.517,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the CRISPR locus is effectively a genetic vaccination card in cells.

68
0:04:00.572,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Once those bits of DNA have been inserted into the bacterial chromosome,

69
0:04:05.094,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the cell then makes a little copy of a molecule called RNA,

70
0:04:09.317,000 --> 0:04:11,000
which is orange in this picture,

71
0:04:11.356,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that is an exact replicate of the viral DNA.

72
0:04:16.502,000 --> 0:04:18,000
RNA is a chemical cousin of DNA,

73
0:04:18.862,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and it allows interaction with DNA molecules

74
0:04:22.839,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that have a matching sequence.

75
0:04:25.258,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So those little bits of RNA from the CRISPR locus

76
0:04:29.191,000 --> 0:04:32,000
associate -- they bind -- to protein called Cas9,

77
0:04:33.004,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which is white in the picture,

78
0:04:34.963,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and form a complex that functions like a sentinel in the cell.

79
0:04:39.206,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It searches through all of the DNA in the cell,

80
0:04:42.644,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to find sites that match the sequences in the bound RNAs.

81
0:04:46.92,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And when those sites are found --

82
0:04:48.579,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as you can see here, the blue molecule is DNA --

83
0:04:52.073,000 --> 0:04:54,000
this complex associates with that DNA

84
0:04:54.946,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and allows the Cas9 cleaver to cut up the viral DNA.

85
0:05:00.272,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It makes a very precise break.

86
0:05:04.096,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So we can think of the Cas9 RNA sentinel complex

87
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:11,000
like a pair of scissors that can cut DNA --

88
0:05:11.725,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it makes a double-stranded break in the DNA helix.

89
0:05:14.985,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And importantly, this complex is programmable,

90
0:05:18.991,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so it can be programmed to recognize particular DNA sequences,

91
0:05:24.215,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and make a break in the DNA at that site.

92
0:05:27.928,000 --> 0:05:28,000
As I'm going to tell you now,

93
0:05:29.532,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we recognized that that activity could be harnessed for genome engineering,

94
0:05:34.332,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to allow cells to make a very precise change to the DNA

95
0:05:38.583,000 --> 0:05:4,000
at the site where this break was introduced.

96
0:05:41.558,000 --> 0:05:42,000
That's sort of analogous

97
0:05:42.797,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to the way that we use a word-processing program

98
0:05:45.529,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to fix a typo in a document.

99
0:05:49.541,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The reason we envisioned using the CRISPR system for genome engineering

100
0:05:54.383,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is because cells have the ability to detect broken DNA

101
0:05:58.026,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and repair it.

102
0:05:59.78,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So when a plant or an animal cell detects a double-stranded break in its DNA,

103
0:06:04.735,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it can fix that break,

104
0:06:06.356,000 --> 0:06:09,000
either by pasting together the ends of the broken DNA

105
0:06:09.907,000 --> 0:06:13,000
with a little, tiny change in the sequence of that position,

106
0:06:14.041,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or it can repair the break by integrating a new piece of DNA at the site of the cut.

107
0:06:21.054,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So if we have a way to introduce double-stranded breaks into DNA

108
0:06:26.051,000 --> 0:06:27,000
at precise places,

109
0:06:27.655,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we can trigger cells to repair those breaks,

110
0:06:30.488,000 --> 0:06:35,000
by either the disruption or incorporation of new genetic information.

111
0:06:35.936,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So if we were able to program the CRISPR technology

112
0:06:39.202,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to make a break in DNA

113
0:06:41.549,000 --> 0:06:47,000
at the position at or near a mutation causing cystic fibrosis, for example,

114
0:06:47.842,000 --> 0:06:5,000
we could trigger cells to repair that mutation.

115
0:06:52.464,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Genome engineering is actually not new, it's been in development since the 1970s.

116
0:06:57.591,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We've had technologies for sequencing DNA,

117
0:07:00.366,000 --> 0:07:01,000
for copying DNA,

118
0:07:01.985,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and even for manipulating DNA.

119
0:07:04.969,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And these technologies were very promising,

120
0:07:08.129,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but the problem was that they were either inefficient,

121
0:07:12.559,000 --> 0:07:14,000
or they were difficult enough to use

122
0:07:14.916,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that most scientists had not adopted them for use in their own laboratories,

123
0:07:19.742,000 --> 0:07:23,000
or certainly for many clinical applications.

124
0:07:24.722,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So, the opportunity to take a technology like CRISPR and utilize it has appeal,

125
0:07:32.101,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because of its relative simplicity.

126
0:07:35.126,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We can think of older genome engineering technologies

127
0:07:38.919,000 --> 0:07:41,000
as similar to having to rewire your computer

128
0:07:42.602,000 --> 0:07:45,000
each time you want to run a new piece of software,

129
0:07:46.396,000 --> 0:07:49,000
whereas the CRISPR technology is like software for the genome,

130
0:07:50.184,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we can program it easily, using these little bits of RNA.

131
0:07:54.658,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So once a double-stranded break is made in DNA,

132
0:07:57.775,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we can induce repair,

133
0:07:59.886,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and thereby potentially achieve astounding things,

134
0:08:03.356,000 --> 0:08:07,000
like being able to correct mutations that cause sickle cell anemia

135
0:08:07.539,000 --> 0:08:09,000
or cause Huntington's Disease.

136
0:08:09.914,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I actually think that the first applications of the CRISPR technology

137
0:08:13.399,000 --> 0:08:15,000
are going to happen in the blood,

138
0:08:15.692,000 --> 0:08:19,000
where it's relatively easier to deliver this tool into cells,

139
0:08:20.469,000 --> 0:08:22,000
compared to solid tissues.

140
0:08:23.905,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Right now, a lot of the work that's going on

141
0:08:26.333,000 --> 0:08:29,000
applies to animal models of human disease, such as mice.

142
0:08:30.326,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The technology is being used to make very precise changes

143
0:08:33.619,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that allow us to study the way that these changes in the cell's DNA

144
0:08:38.814,000 --> 0:08:42,000
affect either a tissue or, in this case, an entire organism.

145
0:08:43.515,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now in this example,

146
0:08:44.746,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the CRISPR technology was used to disrupt a gene

147
0:08:48.563,000 --> 0:08:5,000
by making a tiny change in the DNA

148
0:08:51.354,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in a gene that is responsible for the black coat color of these mice.

149
0:08:56.219,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Imagine that these white mice differ from their pigmented litter-mates

150
0:09:01.261,000 --> 0:09:05,000
by just a tiny change at one gene in the entire genome,

151
0:09:05.952,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and they're otherwise completely normal.

152
0:09:07.966,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And when we sequence the DNA from these animals,

153
0:09:10.881,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we find that the change in the DNA

154
0:09:13.531,000 --> 0:09:16,000
has occurred at exactly the place where we induced it,

155
0:09:16.697,000 --> 0:09:17,000
using the CRISPR technology.

156
0:09:19.662,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Additional experiments are going on in other animals

157
0:09:22.41,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that are useful for creating models for human disease,

158
0:09:26.529,000 --> 0:09:27,000
such as monkeys.

159
0:09:28.156,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And here we find that we can use these systems

160
0:09:31.406,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to test the application of this technology in particular tissues,

161
0:09:35.232,000 --> 0:09:4,000
for example, figuring out how to deliver the CRISPR tool into cells.

162
0:09:40.329,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We also want to understand better

163
0:09:42.501,000 --> 0:09:45,000
how to control the way that DNA is repaired after it's cut,

164
0:09:46.152,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and also to figure out how to control and limit any kind of off-target,

165
0:09:51.857,000 --> 0:09:54,000
or unintended effects of using the technology.

166
0:09:56.356,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I think that we will see clinical application of this technology,

167
0:10:02.53,000 --> 0:10:03,000
certainly in adults,

168
0:10:04.066,000 --> 0:10:05,000
within the next 10 years.

169
0:10:05.693,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I think that it's likely that we will see clinical trials

170
0:10:08.851,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and possibly even approved therapies within that time,

171
0:10:12.304,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which is a very exciting thing to think about.

172
0:10:15.041,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And because of the excitement around this technology,

173
0:10:17.566,000 --> 0:10:2,000
there's a lot of interest in start-up companies

174
0:10:20.883,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that have been founded to commercialize the CRISPR technology,

175
0:10:25.669,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and lots of venture capitalists

176
0:10:27.182,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that have been investing in these companies.

177
0:10:31.242,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But we have to also consider

178
0:10:32.839,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that the CRISPR technology can be used for things like enhancement.

179
0:10:36.485,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Imagine that we could try to engineer humans

180
0:10:39.553,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that have enhanced properties, such as stronger bones,

181
0:10:44.012,000 --> 0:10:48,000
or less susceptibility to cardiovascular disease

182
0:10:48.107,000 --> 0:10:49,000
or even to have properties

183
0:10:49.642,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that we would consider maybe to be desirable,

184
0:10:52.065,000 --> 0:10:56,000
like a different eye color or to be taller, things like that.

185
0:10:57.942,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"Designer humans," if you will.

186
0:11:00.78,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Right now, the genetic information

187
0:11:03.194,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to understand what types of genes would give rise to these traits

188
0:11:07.711,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is mostly not known.

189
0:11:09.468,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But it's important to know

190
0:11:10.738,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that the CRISPR technology gives us a tool to make such changes,

191
0:11:15.047,000 --> 0:11:17,000
once that knowledge becomes available.

192
0:11:18.651,000 --> 0:11:22,000
This raises a number of ethical questions that we have to carefully consider,

193
0:11:22.786,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and this is why I and my colleagues have called for a global pause

194
0:11:27.025,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in any clinical application of the CRISPR technology in human embryos,

195
0:11:31.795,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to give us time

196
0:11:32.97,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to really consider all of the various implications of doing so.

197
0:11:37.743,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And actually, there is an important precedent for such a pause

198
0:11:41.61,000 --> 0:11:42,000
from the 1970s,

199
0:11:42.953,000 --> 0:11:43,000
when scientists got together

200
0:11:44.841,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to call for a moratorium on the use of molecular cloning,

201
0:11:48.695,000 --> 0:11:53,000
until the safety of that technology could be tested carefully and validated.

202
0:11:55.506,000 --> 0:12:,000
So, genome-engineered humans are not with us yet,

203
0:12:00.67,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but this is no longer science fiction.

204
0:12:04.179,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Genome-engineered animals and plants are happening right now.

205
0:12:09.069,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And this puts in front of all of us a huge responsibility,

206
0:12:13.146,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to consider carefully both the unintended consequences

207
0:12:17.747,000 --> 0:12:21,000
as well as the intended impacts of a scientific breakthrough.

208
0:12:22.19,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Thank you.

209
0:12:23.366,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Applause)

210
0:12:31.572,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause ends)

211
0:12:33.535,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Bruno Giussani: Jennifer, this is a technology with huge consequences,

212
0:12:37.453,000 --> 0:12:38,000
as you pointed out.

213
0:12:38.628,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Your attitude about asking for a pause or a moratorium or a quarantine

214
0:12:43.824,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is incredibly responsible.

215
0:12:46.733,000 --> 0:12:48,000
There are, of course, the therapeutic results of this,

216
0:12:49.305,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but then there are the un-therapeutic ones

217
0:12:51.479,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and they seem to be the ones gaining traction,

218
0:12:53.683,000 --> 0:12:54,000
particularly in the media.

219
0:12:54.953,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This is one of the latest issues of The Economist -- "Editing humanity."

220
0:12:59.143,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's all about genetic enhancement, it's not about therapeutics.

221
0:13:03.541,000 --> 0:13:05,000
What kind of reactions did you get back in March

222
0:13:05.847,000 --> 0:13:07,000
from your colleagues in the science world,

223
0:13:07.888,000 --> 0:13:08,000
when you asked or suggested

224
0:13:09.27,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that we should actually pause this for a moment and think about it?

225
0:13:13.054,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Jennifer Doudna: My colleagues were actually, I think, delighted

226
0:13:16.079,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to have the opportunity to discuss this openly.

227
0:13:18.348,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It's interesting that as I talk to people,

228
0:13:20.718,000 --> 0:13:22,000
my scientific colleagues as well as others,

229
0:13:23.21,000 --> 0:13:25,000
there's a wide variety of viewpoints about this.

230
0:13:25.544,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So clearly it's a topic that needs careful consideration and discussion.

231
0:13:29.242,000 --> 0:13:31,000
BG: There's a big meeting happening in December

232
0:13:31.481,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that you and your colleagues are calling,

233
0:13:33.481,000 --> 0:13:35,000
together with the National Academy of Sciences and others,

234
0:13:36.272,000 --> 0:13:39,000
what do you hope will come out of the meeting, practically?

235
0:13:39.588,000 --> 0:13:41,000
JD: Well, I hope that we can air the views

236
0:13:41.978,000 --> 0:13:44,000
of many different individuals and stakeholders

237
0:13:45.602,000 --> 0:13:49,000
who want to think about how to use this technology responsibly.

238
0:13:49.918,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It may not be possible to come up with a consensus point of view,

239
0:13:53.044,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but I think we should at least understand

240
0:13:55.061,000 --> 0:13:56,000
what all the issues are as we go forward.

241
0:13:57.057,000 --> 0:13:58,000
BG: Now, colleagues of yours,

242
0:13:58.487,000 --> 0:14:,000
like George Church, for example, at Harvard,

243
0:14:00.59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
they say, "Yeah, ethical issues basically are just a question of safety.

244
0:14:04.05,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We test and test and test again, in animals and in labs,

245
0:14:06.728,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and then once we feel it's safe enough, we move on to humans."

246
0:14:10.668,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So that's kind of the other school of thought,

247
0:14:13.273,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that we should actually use this opportunity and really go for it.

248
0:14:16.445,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Is there a possible split happening in the science community about this?

249
0:14:20.247,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I mean, are we going to see some people holding back

250
0:14:22.731,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because they have ethical concerns,

251
0:14:24.549,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and some others just going forward

252
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
because some countries under-regulate or don't regulate at all?

253
0:14:29.58,000 --> 0:14:32,000
JD: Well, I think with any new technology, especially something like this,

254
0:14:33.449,000 --> 0:14:35,000
there are going to be a variety of viewpoints,

255
0:14:36.258,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and I think that's perfectly understandable.

256
0:14:39.623,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I think that in the end,

257
0:14:41.159,000 --> 0:14:45,000
this technology will be used for human genome engineering,

258
0:14:46.134,000 --> 0:14:5,000
but I think to do that without careful consideration and discussion

259
0:14:50.475,000 --> 0:14:52,000
of the risks and potential complications

260
0:14:53.436,000 --> 0:14:54,000
would not be responsible.

261
0:14:54.999,000 --> 0:14:56,000
BG: There are a lot of technologies and other fields of science

262
0:14:58.002,000 --> 0:15:,000
that are developing exponentially, pretty much like yours.

263
0:15:00.797,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I'm thinking about artificial intelligence, autonomous robots and so on.

264
0:15:05.199,000 --> 0:15:06,000
No one seems --

265
0:15:06.39,000 --> 0:15:08,000
aside from autonomous warfare robots --

266
0:15:08.922,000 --> 0:15:12,000
nobody seems to have launched a similar discussion in those fields,

267
0:15:13.651,000 --> 0:15:14,000
in calling for a moratorium.

268
0:15:15.085,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Do you think that your discussion may serve as a blueprint for other fields?

269
0:15:19.18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
JD: Well, I think it's hard for scientists to get out of the laboratory.

270
0:15:22.723,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Speaking for myself,

271
0:15:23.9,000 --> 0:15:25,000
it's a little bit uncomfortable to do that.

272
0:15:26.54,000 --> 0:15:29,000
But I do think that being involved in the genesis of this

273
0:15:30.478,000 --> 0:15:33,000
really puts me and my colleagues in a position of responsibility.

274
0:15:34.358,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And I would say that I certainly hope that other technologies

275
0:15:37.812,000 --> 0:15:39,000
will be considered in the same way,

276
0:15:40.482,000 --> 0:15:43,000
just as we would want to consider something that could have implications

277
0:15:43.904,000 --> 0:15:44,000
in other fields besides biology.

278
0:15:45.855,000 --> 0:15:46,000
BG: Jennifer, thanks for coming to TED.

279
0:15:47.831,000 --> 0:15:48,000
JD: Thank you.

280
0:15:49.116,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.941,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Blah blah blah blah blah.

2
0:00:18.472,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Blah blah blah blah,

3
0:00:20.399,000 --> 0:00:22,000
blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

4
0:00:22.994,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Blah blah blah, blah.

5
0:00:26.997,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So what the hell was that?

6
0:00:29.17,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Well, you don't know because you couldn't understand it.

7
0:00:33.32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It wasn't clear.

8
0:00:36.53,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But hopefully, it was said with enough conviction

9
0:00:39.768,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that it was at least alluringly mysterious.

10
0:00:44.792,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Clarity or mystery?

11
0:00:47.973,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'm balancing these two things in my daily work as a graphic designer,

12
0:00:52.199,000 --> 0:00:56,000
as well as my daily life as a New Yorker

13
0:00:57.031,000 --> 0:00:58,000
every day,

14
0:00:58.561,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and there are two elements that absolutely fascinate me.

15
0:01:03.028,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Here's an example.

16
0:01:05.39,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, how many people know what this is?

17
0:01:11.703,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Okay. Now how many people know what this is?

18
0:01:16.727,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Okay. Thanks to two more deft strokes by the genius Charles M. Schulz,

19
0:01:24.41,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we now have seven deft strokes that in and of themselves

20
0:01:27.454,000 --> 0:01:3,000
create an entire emotional life,

21
0:01:30.984,000 --> 0:01:32,000
one that has enthralled hundreds of millions of fans

22
0:01:33.863,000 --> 0:01:35,000
for over 50 years.

23
0:01:35.906,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is actually a cover of a book

24
0:01:38.42,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that I designed about the work of Schulz and his art,

25
0:01:41.711,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which will be coming out this fall,

26
0:01:44.497,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and that is the entire cover.

27
0:01:46.378,000 --> 0:01:5,000
There is no other typographic information or visual information on the front,

28
0:01:51.324,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the name of the book is "Only What's Necessary."

29
0:01:55.317,000 --> 0:02:,000
So this is sort of symbolic about the decisions I have to make every day

30
0:02:00.79,000 --> 0:02:03,000
about the design that I'm perceiving,

31
0:02:04.706,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and the design I'm creating.

32
0:02:07.525,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So clarity.

33
0:02:09.332,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Clarity gets to the point.

34
0:02:11.421,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's blunt. It's honest. It's sincere.

35
0:02:15.748,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We ask ourselves this. ["When should you be clear?"]

36
0:02:19.37,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now, something like this, whether we can read it or not,

37
0:02:24.818,000 --> 0:02:27,000
needs to be really, really clear.

38
0:02:28.418,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Is it?

39
0:02:32.586,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This is a rather recent example of urban clarity that I just love,

40
0:02:39.284,000 --> 0:02:44,000
mainly because I'm always late and I am always in a hurry.

41
0:02:44.742,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So when these meters started showing up a couple of years ago on street corners,

42
0:02:51.288,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I was thrilled, because now I finally knew

43
0:02:54.748,000 --> 0:02:56,000
how many seconds I had to get across the street

44
0:02:57.673,000 --> 0:02:59,000
before I got run over by a car.

45
0:03:00.553,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Six? I can do that. (Laughter)

46
0:03:05.475,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So let's look at the yin to the clarity yang,

47
0:03:09.283,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and that is mystery.

48
0:03:12.812,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Mystery is a lot more complicated by its very definition.

49
0:03:18.176,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Mystery demands to be decoded,

50
0:03:21.659,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and when it's done right, we really, really want to.

51
0:03:24.643,000 --> 0:03:25,000
["When should you be mysterious?"]

52
0:03:26.303,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In World War II, the Germans really, really wanted to decode this,

53
0:03:32.107,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and they couldn't.

54
0:03:34.731,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Here's an example of a design that I've done recently

55
0:03:37.912,000 --> 0:03:39,000
for a novel by Haruki Murakami,

56
0:03:40.234,000 --> 0:03:43,000
who I've done design work for for over 20 years now,

57
0:03:43.438,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and this is a novel about a young man who has four dear friends

58
0:03:49.15,000 --> 0:03:52,000
who all of a sudden, after their freshman year of college,

59
0:03:52.819,000 --> 0:03:55,000
completely cut him off with no explanation,

60
0:03:56.116,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and he is devastated.

61
0:03:57.973,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the friends' names each have a connotation in Japanese to a color.

62
0:04:03.376,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So there's Mr. Red, there's Mr. Blue, there's Ms. White, and Ms. Black.

63
0:04:08.77,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Tsukuru Tazaki, his name does not correspond to a color,

64
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so his nickname is Colorless, and as he's looking back on their friendship,

65
0:04:16.61,000 --> 0:04:19,000
he recalls that they were like five fingers on a hand.

66
0:04:19.776,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So I created this sort of abstract representation of this,

67
0:04:24.257,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but there's a lot more going on underneath the surface of the story,

68
0:04:28.437,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and there's more going on underneath the surface of the jacket.

69
0:04:33.11,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The four fingers are now four train lines

70
0:04:37.515,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in the Tokyo subway system,

71
0:04:39.582,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which has significance within the story.

72
0:04:42.813,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And then you have the colorless subway line

73
0:04:45.61,000 --> 0:04:47,000
intersecting with each of the other colors,

74
0:04:48.173,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which basically he does later on in the story.

75
0:04:50.82,000 --> 0:04:51,000
He catches up with each of these people

76
0:04:52.802,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to find out why they treated him the way they did.

77
0:04:56.332,000 --> 0:05:,000
And so this is the three-dimensional finished product

78
0:05:00.558,000 --> 0:05:02,000
sitting on my desk in my office,

79
0:05:02.879,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and what I was hoping for here is that you'll simply be allured

80
0:05:07.546,000 --> 0:05:1,000
by the mystery of what this looks like,

81
0:05:11.401,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and will want to read it

82
0:05:14.196,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to decode and find out and make more clear why it looks the way it does.

83
0:05:20.163,000 --> 0:05:21,000
["The Visual Vernacular."]

84
0:05:21.858,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This is a way to use a more familiar kind of mystery.

85
0:05:26.177,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What does this mean?

86
0:05:27.938,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This is what it means. ["Make it look like something else."]

87
0:05:30.772,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The visual vernacular is the way we are used to seeing a certain thing

88
0:05:35.302,000 --> 0:05:39,000
applied to something else so that we see it in a different way.

89
0:05:39.691,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This is an approach I wanted to take to a book of essays by David Sedaris

90
0:05:43.84,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that had this title at the time. ["All the Beauty You Will Ever Need"]

91
0:05:47.211,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now, the challenge here was that this title actually means nothing.

92
0:05:51.402,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's not connected to any of the essays in the book.

93
0:05:54.792,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It came to the author's boyfriend in a dream.

94
0:05:59.993,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Thank you very much, so -- (Laughter) -- so usually, I am creating a design

95
0:06:05.659,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that is in some way based on the text, but this is all the text there is.

96
0:06:09.722,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So you've got this mysterious title that really doesn't mean anything,

97
0:06:14.111,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so I was trying to think:

98
0:06:16.61,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Where might I see a bit of mysterious text that seems to mean something but doesn't?

99
0:06:22.848,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And sure enough, not long after,

100
0:06:25.255,000 --> 0:06:28,000
one evening after a Chinese meal,

101
0:06:28.57,000 --> 0:06:34,000
this arrived, and I thought, "Ah, bing, ideagasm!" (Laughter)

102
0:06:35.472,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I've always loved the hilariously mysterious tropes of fortune cookies

103
0:06:40.673,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that seem to mean something extremely deep

104
0:06:43.575,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but when you think about them -- if you think about them -- they really don't.

105
0:06:47.662,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This says, "Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future."

106
0:06:54.537,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Thank you. (Laughter)

107
0:06:57.389,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But we can take this visual vernacular and apply it to Mr. Sedaris,

108
0:07:03.046,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and we are so familiar with how fortune cookie fortunes look

109
0:07:08.657,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that we don't even need the bits of the cookie anymore.

110
0:07:11.424,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We're just seeing this strange thing

111
0:07:14.419,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and we know we love David Sedaris,

112
0:07:16.416,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and so we're hoping that we're in for a good time.

113
0:07:19.76,000 --> 0:07:22,000
["'Fraud' Essays by David Rakoff"] David Rakoff was a wonderful writer

114
0:07:23.048,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and he called his first book "Fraud"

115
0:07:26.211,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because he was getting sent on assignments by magazines

116
0:07:30.171,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to do things that he was not equipped to do.

117
0:07:32.841,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So he was this skinny little urban guy

118
0:07:35.163,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and GQ magazine would send him down the Colorado River

119
0:07:38.762,000 --> 0:07:41,000
whitewater rafting to see if he would survive.

120
0:07:43.378,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And then he would write about it, and he felt that he was a fraud

121
0:07:46.679,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and that he was misrepresenting himself.

122
0:07:48.978,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And so I wanted the cover of this book to also misrepresent itself

123
0:07:53.645,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and then somehow show a reader reacting to it.

124
0:07:58.916,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This led me to graffiti.

125
0:08:02.167,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I'm fascinated by graffiti.

126
0:08:04.21,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I think anybody who lives in an urban environment

127
0:08:06.903,000 --> 0:08:1,000
encounters graffiti all the time, and there's all different sorts of it.

128
0:08:10.943,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This is a picture I took on the Lower East Side

129
0:08:14.55,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of just a transformer box on the sidewalk

130
0:08:17.398,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and it's been tagged like crazy.

131
0:08:19.372,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now whether you look at this and think, "Oh, that's a charming urban affectation,"

132
0:08:24.991,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or you look at it and say, "That's illegal abuse of property,"

133
0:08:29.379,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the one thing I think we can all agree on

134
0:08:31.724,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is that you cannot read it.

135
0:08:34.905,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Right? There is no clear message here.

136
0:08:38.458,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There is another kind of graffiti that I find far more interesting,

137
0:08:43.682,000 --> 0:08:45,000
which I call editorial graffiti.

138
0:08:46.538,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This is a picture I took recently in the subway,

139
0:08:50.744,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and sometimes you see lots of prurient, stupid stuff,

140
0:08:54.61,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but I thought this was interesting, and this is a poster that is saying

141
0:08:59.517,000 --> 0:09:01,000
rah-rah Airbnb,

142
0:09:01.747,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and someone has taken a Magic Marker

143
0:09:04.51,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and has editorialized about what they think about it.

144
0:09:08.434,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And it got my attention.

145
0:09:11.266,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So I was thinking, how do we apply this to this book?

146
0:09:14.692,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So I get the book by this person, and I start reading it, and I'm thinking,

147
0:09:20.405,000 --> 0:09:24,000
this guy is not who he says he is; he's a fraud.

148
0:09:25.079,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And I get out a red Magic Marker,

149
0:09:28.54,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and out of frustration just scribble this across the front.

150
0:09:33.151,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Design done. (Laughter)

151
0:09:37.815,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And they went for it! (Laughter)

152
0:09:42.19,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Author liked it, publisher liked it,

153
0:09:44.107,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and that is how the book went out into the world,

154
0:09:46.824,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and it was really fun to see people reading this on the subway

155
0:09:51.723,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and walking around with it and what have you,

156
0:09:53.859,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and they all sort of looked like they were crazy.

157
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

158
0:10:00.59,000 --> 0:10:04,000
["'Perfidia' a novel by James Ellroy"] Okay, James Ellroy, amazing crime writer,

159
0:10:04.633,000 --> 0:10:06,000
a good friend, I've worked with him for many years.

160
0:10:07.117,000 --> 0:10:09,000
He is probably best known as the author

161
0:10:09.325,000 --> 0:10:11,000
of "The Black Dahlia" and "L.A. Confidential."

162
0:10:12.295,000 --> 0:10:16,000
His most recent novel was called this, which is a very mysterious name

163
0:10:17.15,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that I'm sure a lot of people know what it means, but a lot of people don't.

164
0:10:20.756,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And it's a story about a Japanese-American detective in Los Angeles in 1941

165
0:10:27.814,000 --> 0:10:29,000
investigating a murder.

166
0:10:29.834,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And then Pearl Harbor happens,

167
0:10:32.247,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and as if his life wasn't difficult enough,

168
0:10:35.357,000 --> 0:10:39,000
now the race relations have really ratcheted up,

169
0:10:40.2,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and then the Japanese-American internment camps are quickly created,

170
0:10:44.718,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and there's lots of tension

171
0:10:46.738,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and horrible stuff as he's still trying to solve this murder.

172
0:10:50.824,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And so I did at first think very literally about this in terms of

173
0:10:56.656,000 --> 0:10:59,000
all right, we'll take Pearl Harbor and we'll add it to Los Angeles

174
0:11:00.539,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and we'll make this apocalyptic dawn on the horizon of the city.

175
0:11:08.146,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And so that's a picture from Pearl Harbor

176
0:11:10.561,000 --> 0:11:13,000
just grafted onto Los Angeles.

177
0:11:13.625,000 --> 0:11:16,000
My editor in chief said, "You know, it's interesting

178
0:11:16.899,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but I think you can do better and I think you can make it simpler."

179
0:11:22.286,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And so I went back to the drawing board, as I often do.

180
0:11:26.506,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But also, being alive to my surroundings,

181
0:11:31.197,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I work in a high-rise in Midtown,

182
0:11:34.83,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and every night, before I leave the office,

183
0:11:38.5,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I have to push this button to get out,

184
0:11:40.745,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and the big heavy glass doors open and I can get onto the elevator.

185
0:11:44.483,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And one night, all of a sudden,

186
0:11:47.979,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I looked at this and I saw it in a way that I hadn't really noticed it before.

187
0:11:53.75,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Big red circle, danger.

188
0:11:56.279,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And I thought this was so obvious

189
0:11:59.158,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that it had to have been done a zillion times,

190
0:12:01.875,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and so I did a Google image search, and I couldn't find another book cover

191
0:12:06.449,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that looked quite like this,

192
0:12:08.608,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and so this is really what solved the problem,

193
0:12:11.232,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and graphically it's more interesting

194
0:12:13.763,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and creates a bigger tension between the idea

195
0:12:17.989,000 --> 0:12:22,000
of a certain kind of sunrise coming up over L.A. and America.

196
0:12:23.506,000 --> 0:12:25,000
["'Gulp' A tour of the human digestive system by Mary Roach."]

197
0:12:26.492,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Mary Roach is an amazing writer

198
0:12:28.53,000 --> 0:12:31,000
who takes potentially mundane scientific subjects

199
0:12:32.152,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and makes them not mundane at all; she makes them really fun.

200
0:12:35.54,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So in this particular case,

201
0:12:37.167,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it's about the human digestive system.

202
0:12:40.279,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So I'm trying to figure out what is the cover of this book going to be.

203
0:12:46.141,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is a self-portrait. (Laughter)

204
0:12:49.845,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Every morning I look at myself in the medicine cabinet mirror

205
0:12:55.905,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to see if my tongue is black.

206
0:12:58.622,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And if it's not, I'm good to go.

207
0:13:02.17,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Laughter)

208
0:13:07.185,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I recommend you all do this.

209
0:13:10.296,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But I also started thinking, here's our introduction.

210
0:13:14.243,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Right? Into the human digestive system.

211
0:13:17.962,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But I think what we can all agree on

212
0:13:20.21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is that actual photographs of human mouths, at least based on this,

213
0:13:24.46,000 --> 0:13:27,000
are off-putting. (Laughter)

214
0:13:28.244,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So for the cover, then, I had this illustration done

215
0:13:32.145,000 --> 0:13:34,000
which is literally more palatable

216
0:13:34.374,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and reminds us that it's best to approach the digestive system

217
0:13:38.902,000 --> 0:13:4,000
from this end.

218
0:13:41.2,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Laughter)

219
0:13:43.847,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I don't even have to complete the sentence. All right.

220
0:13:47.533,000 --> 0:13:48,000
["Unuseful mystery"]

221
0:13:49.079,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What happens when clarity and mystery get mixed up?

222
0:13:53.516,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And we see this all the time.

223
0:13:55.489,000 --> 0:13:57,000
This is what I call unuseful mystery.

224
0:13:57.997,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I go down into the subway -- I take the subway a lot --

225
0:14:00.946,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and this piece of paper is taped to a girder.

226
0:14:06.59,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Right? And now I'm thinking, uh-oh,

227
0:14:10.243,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and the train's about to come and I'm trying to figure out what this means,

228
0:14:14.12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and thanks a lot.

229
0:14:16.914,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Part of the problem here is that they've compartmentalized the information

230
0:14:20.914,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in a way they think is helpful, and frankly, I don't think it is at all.

231
0:14:24.42,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So this is mystery we do not need.

232
0:14:27.694,000 --> 0:14:35,000
What we need is useful clarity, so just for fun, I redesigned this.

233
0:14:35.78,000 --> 0:14:37,000
This is using all the same elements.

234
0:14:38.259,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Applause)

235
0:14:41.532,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Thank you. I am still waiting for a call from the MTA. (Laughter)

236
0:14:46.447,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You know, I'm actually not even using more colors than they use.

237
0:14:49.506,000 --> 0:14:52,000
They just didn't even bother to make the 4 and the 5 green,

238
0:14:52.803,000 --> 0:14:55,000
those idiots. (Laughter)

239
0:14:56.851,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So the first thing we see is that there is a service change,

240
0:14:59.92,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and then, in two complete sentences with a beginning, a middle and an end,

241
0:15:03.613,000 --> 0:15:07,000
it tells us what the change is and what's going to be happening.

242
0:15:08.383,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Call me crazy! (Laughter)

243
0:15:13.63,000 --> 0:15:15,000
["Useful mystery"] All right.

244
0:15:16.161,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Now, here is a piece of mystery that I love:

245
0:15:21.841,000 --> 0:15:22,000
packaging.

246
0:15:23.498,000 --> 0:15:26,000
This redesign of the Diet Coke can

247
0:15:26.772,000 --> 0:15:31,000
by Turner Duckworth is to me truly a piece of art.

248
0:15:32.2,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It's a work of art. It's beautiful.

249
0:15:35.716,000 --> 0:15:38,000
But part of what makes it so heartening to me as a designer

250
0:15:38.893,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is that he's taken the visual vernacular of Diet Coke --

251
0:15:43.351,000 --> 0:15:46,000
the typefaces, the colors, the silver background --

252
0:15:46.889,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and he's reduced them to their most essential parts,

253
0:15:51.974,000 --> 0:15:53,000
so it's like going back to the Charlie Brown face.

254
0:15:54.714,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's like, how can you give them just enough information so they know what it is

255
0:15:58.661,000 --> 0:16:01,000
but giving them the credit for the knowledge that they already have

256
0:16:02.539,000 --> 0:16:03,000
about this thing?

257
0:16:04.396,000 --> 0:16:07,000
It looks great, and you would go into a delicatessen

258
0:16:08.181,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and all of a sudden see that on the shelf, and it's wonderful.

259
0:16:12.631,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Which makes the next thing --

260
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
["Unuseful clarity"] -- all the more disheartening,

261
0:16:18.862,000 --> 0:16:19,000
at least to me.

262
0:16:20.51,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So okay, again, going back down into the subway,

263
0:16:24.35,000 --> 0:16:26,000
after this came out,

264
0:16:26.44,000 --> 0:16:28,000
these are pictures that I took.

265
0:16:28.46,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Times Square subway station:

266
0:16:30.503,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Coca-Cola has bought out the entire thing for advertising. Okay?

267
0:16:35.681,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And maybe some of you know where this is going.

268
0:16:40.66,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Ahem.

269
0:16:42.438,000 --> 0:16:44,000
"You moved to New York with the clothes on your back,

270
0:16:45.056,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the cash in your pocket, and your eyes on the prize.

271
0:16:47.64,000 --> 0:16:5,000
You're on Coke." (Laughter)

272
0:16:57.298,000 --> 0:16:59,000
"You moved to New York with an MBA, one clean suit,

273
0:17:00.251,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and an extremely firm handshake.

274
0:17:02.341,000 --> 0:17:04,000
You're on Coke." (Laughter)

275
0:17:05.638,000 --> 0:17:09,000
These are real! (Laughter)

276
0:17:10.142,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Not even the support beams were spared,

277
0:17:13.973,000 --> 0:17:16,000
except they switched into Yoda mode. (Laughter)

278
0:17:19.569,000 --> 0:17:22,000
"Coke you're on." (Laughter)

279

["Excuse me, I'm on WHAT??"]

280
0:17:26.018,000 --> 0:17:29,000
This campaign was a huge misstep.

281
0:17:29.623,000 --> 0:17:33,000
It was pulled almost instantly due to consumer backlash

282
0:17:34.31,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and all sorts of unflattering parodies on the web --

283
0:17:38.85,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Laughter) --

284
0:17:40.731,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and also that dot next to "You're on," that's not a period, that's a trademark.

285
0:17:47.141,000 --> 0:17:48,000
So thanks a lot.

286
0:17:48.421,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So to me, this was just so bizarre

287
0:17:52.433,000 --> 0:17:58,000
about how they could get the packaging so mysteriously beautiful and perfect

288
0:17:58.447,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and the message so unbearably, clearly wrong.

289
0:18:02.905,000 --> 0:18:05,000
It was just incredible to me.

290
0:18:06.365,000 --> 0:18:11,000
So I just hope that I've been able to share with you some of my insights

291
0:18:11.891,000 --> 0:18:14,000
on the uses of clarity and mystery in my work,

292
0:18:15.699,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and maybe how you might decide to be more clear in your life,

293
0:18:21.005,000 --> 0:18:27,000
or maybe to be a bit more mysterious and not so over-sharing.

294
0:18:27.273,000 --> 0:18:29,000
(Laughter)

295
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And if there's just one thing that I leave you with from this talk,

296
0:18:35.806,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I hope it's this:

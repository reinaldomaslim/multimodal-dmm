1
0:00:12.946,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What is so special about the human brain?

2
0:00:15.34,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Why is it that we study other animals

3
0:00:17.552,000 --> 0:00:19,000
instead of them studying us?

4
0:00:19.673,000 --> 0:00:2,000
What does a human brain have or do

5
0:00:21.471,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that no other brain does?

6
0:00:23.204,000 --> 0:00:25,000
When I became interested in these questions about 10 years ago,

7
0:00:26.052,000 --> 0:00:28,000
scientists thought they knew what different brains were made of.

8
0:00:28.994,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Though it was based on very little evidence,

9
0:00:30.723,000 --> 0:00:32,000
many scientists thought that all mammalian brains,

10
0:00:32.91,000 --> 0:00:33,000
including the human brain,

11
0:00:34.635,000 --> 0:00:35,000
were made in the same way,

12
0:00:35.935,000 --> 0:00:36,000
with a number of neurons that was always

13
0:00:37.437,000 --> 0:00:39,000
proportional to the size of the brain.

14
0:00:39.668,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This means that two brains of the same size,

15
0:00:41.744,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like these two, with a respectable 400 grams,

16
0:00:45.292,000 --> 0:00:47,000
should have similar numbers of neurons.

17
0:00:47.844,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Now, if neurons are the functional

18
0:00:49.64,000 --> 0:00:51,000
information processing units of the brain,

19
0:00:52.543,000 --> 0:00:53,000
then the owners of these two brains

20
0:00:54.135,000 --> 0:00:56,000
should have similar cognitive abilities.

21
0:00:56.864,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And yet, one is a chimp,

22
0:00:59.213,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the other is a cow.

23
0:01:01.85,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now maybe cows have a really rich

24
0:01:04.212,000 --> 0:01:06,000
internal mental life and are so smart

25
0:01:06.465,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that they choose not to let us realize it,

26
0:01:10.268,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but we eat them.

27
0:01:11.713,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I think most people will agree

28
0:01:13.412,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that chimps are capable of much more complex,

29
0:01:15.413,000 --> 0:01:18,000
elaborate and flexible behaviors than cows are.

30
0:01:18.469,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So this is a first indication that the

31
0:01:20.401,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"all brains are made the same way" scenario

32
0:01:22.434,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is not quite right.

33
0:01:24.105,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But let's play along.

34
0:01:25.451,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If all brains were made the same way

35
0:01:27.229,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes,

36
0:01:30.141,000 --> 0:01:32,000
larger brains should always have more neurons

37
0:01:32.323,000 --> 0:01:34,000
than smaller brains, and the larger the brain,

38
0:01:34.646,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the more cognitively able its owner should be.

39
0:01:37.668,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So the largest brain around should also be

40
0:01:39.804,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the most cognitively able.

41
0:01:42.093,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And here comes the bad news:

42
0:01:43.674,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Our brain, not the largest one around.

43
0:01:46.431,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It seems quite vexing.

44
0:01:47.986,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Our brain weighs between 1.2 and 1.5 kilos,

45
0:01:50.721,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but elephant brains weigh between four and five kilos,

46
0:01:54.038,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and whale brains can weigh up to nine kilos,

47
0:01:56.623,000 --> 0:02:,000
which is why scientists used to resort to saying

48
0:02:01.361,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that our brain must be special

49
0:02:03.518,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to explain our cognitive abilities.

50
0:02:06.38,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It must be really extraordinary,

51
0:02:09.326,000 --> 0:02:1,000
an exception to the rule.

52
0:02:11.303,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Theirs may be bigger, but ours is better,

53
0:02:14.529,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and it could be better, for example,

54
0:02:16.404,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in that it seems larger than it should be,

55
0:02:18.515,000 --> 0:02:2,000
with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have

56
0:02:21.213,000 --> 0:02:22,000
for the size of our bodies.

57
0:02:22.752,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So that would give us extra cortex

58
0:02:24.404,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to do more interesting things than just operating the body.

59
0:02:27.364,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's because the size of the brain

60
0:02:29.043,000 --> 0:02:31,000
usually follows the size of the body.

61
0:02:31.376,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So the main reason for saying that

62
0:02:33.693,000 --> 0:02:35,000
our brain is larger than it should be

63
0:02:35.78,000 --> 0:02:36,000
actually comes from comparing ourselves

64
0:02:37.552,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to great apes.

65
0:02:39.238,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Gorillas can be two to three times larger than we are,

66
0:02:41.832,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so their brains should also be larger than ours,

67
0:02:44.253,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but instead it's the other way around.

68
0:02:46.198,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Our brain is three times larger than a gorilla brain.

69
0:02:49.133,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The human brain also seems special

70
0:02:51.253,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the amount of energy that it uses.

71
0:02:53.5,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Although it weighs only two percent of the body,

72
0:02:56.249,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it alone uses 25 percent of all the energy

73
0:02:59.692,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that your body requires to run per day.

74
0:03:02.155,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That's 500 calories out of a total of 2,000 calories,

75
0:03:05.508,000 --> 0:03:07,000
just to keep your brain working.

76
0:03:07.913,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So the human brain is larger than it should be,

77
0:03:10.841,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it uses much more energy than it should,

78
0:03:12.867,000 --> 0:03:13,000
so it's special.

79
0:03:14.325,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And this is where the story started to bother me.

80
0:03:16.896,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In biology, we look for rules

81
0:03:18.567,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that apply to all animals and to life in general,

82
0:03:21.413,000 --> 0:03:22,000
so why should the rules of evolution

83
0:03:23.263,000 --> 0:03:26,000
apply to everybody else but not to us?

84
0:03:26.905,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Maybe the problem was with the basic assumption

85
0:03:29.102,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that all brains are made in the same way.

86
0:03:30.973,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Maybe two brains of a similar size

87
0:03:32.572,000 --> 0:03:34,000
can actually be made of very different numbers of neurons.

88
0:03:35.163,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Maybe a very large brain

89
0:03:36.77,000 --> 0:03:37,000
does not necessarily have more neurons

90
0:03:38.61,000 --> 0:03:4,000
than a more modest-sized brain.

91
0:03:40.831,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Maybe the human brain actually has the most neurons

92
0:03:43.84,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of any brain, regardless of its size,

93
0:03:46.413,000 --> 0:03:48,000
especially in the cerebral cortex.

94
0:03:48.507,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So this to me became

95
0:03:50.059,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the important question to answer:

96
0:03:51.788,000 --> 0:03:53,000
how many neurons does the human brain have,

97
0:03:54.188,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and how does that compare to other animals?

98
0:03:56.71,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Now, you may have heard or read somewhere

99
0:03:59.133,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that we have 100 billion neurons,

100
0:04:01.244,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so 10 years ago, I asked my colleagues

101
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
if they knew where this number came from.

102
0:04:05.169,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But nobody did.

103
0:04:06.627,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I've been digging through the literature

104
0:04:08.08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
for the original reference for that number,

105
0:04:10.138,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and I could never find it.

106
0:04:11.921,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It seems that nobody had actually ever counted

107
0:04:14.66,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the number of neurons in the human brain,

108
0:04:16.194,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or in any other brain for that matter.

109
0:04:18.693,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So I came up with my own way to count cells in the brain,

110
0:04:22.228,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and it essentially consists of

111
0:04:24.336,000 --> 0:04:27,000
dissolving that brain into soup.

112
0:04:27.581,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It works like this:

113
0:04:29.618,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You take a brain, or parts of that brain,

114
0:04:32.745,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and you dissolve it in detergent,

115
0:04:34.489,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which destroys the cell membranes

116
0:04:35.998,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but keeps the cell nuclei intact,

117
0:04:38.434,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so you end up with a suspension of free nuclei

118
0:04:41.574,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that looks like this,

119
0:04:43.355,000 --> 0:04:44,000
like a clear soup.

120
0:04:44.628,000 --> 0:04:45,000
This soup contains all the nuclei

121
0:04:46.519,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that once were a mouse brain.

122
0:04:48.573,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now, the beauty of a soup is that because it is soup,

123
0:04:51.603,000 --> 0:04:53,000
you can agitate it and make those nuclei

124
0:04:54.501,000 --> 0:04:55,000
be distributed homogeneously in the liquid,

125
0:04:56.472,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so that now by looking under the microscope

126
0:04:58.453,000 --> 0:05:02,000
at just four or five samples of this homogeneous solution,

127
0:05:02.536,000 --> 0:05:04,000
you can count nuclei, and therefore tell

128
0:05:05.072,000 --> 0:05:06,000
how many cells that brain had.

129
0:05:06.751,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It's simple, it's straightforward,

130
0:05:08.376,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and it's really fast.

131
0:05:09.81,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So we've used that method to count neurons

132
0:05:11.807,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in dozens of different species so far,

133
0:05:14.118,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it turns out that all brains

134
0:05:15.807,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are not made the same way.

135
0:05:18.389,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Take rodents and primates, for instance:

136
0:05:20.576,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In larger rodent brains, the average size

137
0:05:22.86,000 --> 0:05:23,000
of the neuron increases,

138
0:05:24.546,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so the brain inflates very rapidly

139
0:05:27.145,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and gains size much faster than it gains neurons.

140
0:05:30.31,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But primate brains gain neurons

141
0:05:32.013,000 --> 0:05:34,000
without the average neuron becoming any larger,

142
0:05:34.472,000 --> 0:05:35,000
which is a very economical way

143
0:05:35.997,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to add neurons to your brain.

144
0:05:37.65,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The result is that a primate brain

145
0:05:39.414,000 --> 0:05:42,000
will always have more neurons than a rodent brain of the same size,

146
0:05:42.581,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and the larger the brain,

147
0:05:44.064,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the larger this difference will be.

148
0:05:46.278,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Well, what about our brain then?

149
0:05:48.381,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We found that we have, on average,

150
0:05:50.065,000 --> 0:05:51,000
86 billion neurons,

151
0:05:51.85,000 --> 0:05:53,000
16 billion of which are in the cerebral cortex,

152
0:05:54.849,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and if you consider that the cerebral cortex

153
0:05:56.93,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is the seat of functions like

154
0:06:00.024,000 --> 0:06:03,000
awareness and logical and abstract reasoning,

155
0:06:03.161,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and that 16 billion is the most neurons

156
0:06:06.145,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that any cortex has,

157
0:06:08.766,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I think this is the simplest explanation

158
0:06:10.484,000 --> 0:06:13,000
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

159
0:06:13.626,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But just as important is what the 86 billion neurons mean.

160
0:06:16.847,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Because we found that the relationship

161
0:06:18.376,000 --> 0:06:2,000
between the size of the brain and its number of neurons

162
0:06:20.728,000 --> 0:06:21,000
could be described mathematically,

163
0:06:22.355,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we could calculate what a human brain

164
0:06:24.573,000 --> 0:06:26,000
would look like if it was made like a rodent brain.

165
0:06:27.247,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So, a rodent brain with 86 billion neurons

166
0:06:30.821,000 --> 0:06:33,000
would weigh 36 kilos.

167
0:06:33.942,000 --> 0:06:34,000
That's not possible.

168
0:06:35.575,000 --> 0:06:36,000
A brain that huge would be crushed

169
0:06:37.481,000 --> 0:06:38,000
by its own weight,

170
0:06:38.665,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and this impossible brain would go

171
0:06:40.252,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in the body of 89 tons.

172
0:06:44.023,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I don't think it looks like us.

173
0:06:46.157,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So this brings us to a very important conclusion already,

174
0:06:48.71,000 --> 0:06:5,000
which is that we are not rodents.

175
0:06:51.357,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The human brain is not a large rat brain.

176
0:06:54.625,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Compared to a rat, we might seem special, yes,

177
0:06:57.253,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but that's not a fair comparison to make,

178
0:06:59.473,000 --> 0:07:01,000
given that we know that we are not rodents.

179
0:07:01.562,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We are primates,

180
0:07:02.952,000 --> 0:07:04,000
so the correct comparison is to other primates.

181
0:07:05.726,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And there, if you do the math,

182
0:07:06.953,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you find that a generic primate

183
0:07:09.739,000 --> 0:07:1,000
with 86 billion neurons

184
0:07:11.669,000 --> 0:07:14,000
would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos,

185
0:07:14.672,000 --> 0:07:15,000
which seems just right,

186
0:07:16.561,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in a body of some 66 kilos,

187
0:07:18.533,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which in my case is exactly right,

188
0:07:21.178,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which brings us to a very unsurprising

189
0:07:23.798,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but still incredibly important conclusion:

190
0:07:26.767,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I am a primate.

191
0:07:28.108,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And all of you are primates.

192
0:07:30.806,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And so was Darwin.

193
0:07:32.706,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I love to think that Darwin would have really appreciated this.

194
0:07:35.646,000 --> 0:07:36,000
His brain, like ours,

195
0:07:37.613,000 --> 0:07:4,000
was made in the image of other primate brains.

196
0:07:41.124,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So the human brain may be remarkable, yes,

197
0:07:43.426,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but it is not special in its number of neurons.

198
0:07:46.207,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It is just a large primate brain.

199
0:07:48.062,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I think that's a very humbling and sobering thought

200
0:07:51.106,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that should remind us of our place in nature.

201
0:07:54.169,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Why does it cost so much energy, then?

202
0:07:56.813,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Well, other people have figured out

203
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
how much energy the human brain

204
0:07:59.763,000 --> 0:08:,000
and that of other species costs,

205
0:08:01.17,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and now that we knew how many neurons

206
0:08:02.822,000 --> 0:08:04,000
each brain was made of, we could do the math.

207
0:08:05.164,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And it turns out that both human

208
0:08:07.03,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and other brains cost about the same,

209
0:08:09.853,000 --> 0:08:12,000
an average of six calories per billion neurons per day.

210
0:08:13.274,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So the total energetic cost of a brain

211
0:08:15.413,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is a simple, linear function

212
0:08:17.447,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of its number of neurons,

213
0:08:19.156,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and it turns out that the human brain

214
0:08:21.339,000 --> 0:08:24,000
costs just as much energy as you would expect.

215
0:08:25.18,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So the reason why the human brain

216
0:08:27.271,000 --> 0:08:28,000
costs so much energy is simply because

217
0:08:28.943,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it has a huge number of neurons,

218
0:08:30.926,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and because we are primates

219
0:08:32.411,000 --> 0:08:34,000
with many more neurons for a given body size

220
0:08:34.91,000 --> 0:08:35,000
than any other animal,

221
0:08:36.432,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the relative cost of our brain is large,

222
0:08:39.972,000 --> 0:08:42,000
but just because we're primates, not because we're special.

223
0:08:42.973,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Last question, then:

224
0:08:44.163,000 --> 0:08:47,000
how did we come by this remarkable number of neurons,

225
0:08:47.278,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and in particular, if great apes

226
0:08:49.178,000 --> 0:08:5,000
are larger than we are,

227
0:08:50.733,000 --> 0:08:53,000
why don't they have a larger brain than we do, with more neurons?

228
0:08:54.498,000 --> 0:08:56,000
When we realized how much expensive it is

229
0:08:56.588,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to have a lot of neurons in the brain, I figured,

230
0:08:58.921,000 --> 0:09:,000
maybe there's a simple reason.

231
0:09:00.924,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They just can't afford the energy

232
0:09:02.607,000 --> 0:09:04,000
for both a large body and a large number of neurons.

233
0:09:05.557,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So we did the math.

234
0:09:06.986,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We calculated on the one hand

235
0:09:08.586,000 --> 0:09:09,000
how much energy a primate gets per day

236
0:09:10.527,000 --> 0:09:11,000
from eating raw foods,

237
0:09:11.877,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and on the other hand, how much energy

238
0:09:13.914,000 --> 0:09:14,000
a body of a certain size costs

239
0:09:15.678,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and how much energy a brain of a certain number of neurons costs,

240
0:09:19.065,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and we looked for the combinations

241
0:09:20.554,000 --> 0:09:22,000
of body size and number of brain neurons

242
0:09:22.965,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that a primate could afford

243
0:09:24.235,000 --> 0:09:26,000
if it ate a certain number of hours per day.

244
0:09:26.783,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And what we found is that

245
0:09:28.599,000 --> 0:09:29,000
because neurons are so expensive,

246
0:09:30.311,000 --> 0:09:33,000
there is a tradeoff between body size and number of neurons.

247
0:09:33.681,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So a primate that eats eight hours per day

248
0:09:36.632,000 --> 0:09:39,000
can afford at most 53 billion neurons,

249
0:09:39.656,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but then its body cannot be any bigger

250
0:09:41.383,000 --> 0:09:42,000
than 25 kilos.

251
0:09:43.337,000 --> 0:09:44,000
To weigh any more than that,

252
0:09:45.038,000 --> 0:09:46,000
it has to give up neurons.

253
0:09:46.807,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So it's either a large body

254
0:09:49.46,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or a large number of neurons.

255
0:09:50.955,000 --> 0:09:51,000
When you eat like a primate,

256
0:09:52.32,000 --> 0:09:54,000
you can't afford both.

257
0:09:54.556,000 --> 0:09:55,000
One way out of this metabolic limitation

258
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:59,000
would be to spend even more hours per day eating,

259
0:09:59.921,000 --> 0:10:,000
but that gets dangerous,

260
0:10:01.284,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and past a certain point, it's just not possible.

261
0:10:04.003,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Gorillas and orangutans, for instance,

262
0:10:05.54,000 --> 0:10:06,000
afford about 30 billion neurons

263
0:10:07.463,000 --> 0:10:09,000
by spending eight and a half hours per day eating,

264
0:10:10.429,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and that seems to be about as much as they can do.

265
0:10:13.545,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Nine hours of feeding per day

266
0:10:15.336,000 --> 0:10:18,000
seems to be the practical limit for a primate.

267
0:10:18.607,000 --> 0:10:19,000
What about us?

268
0:10:20.398,000 --> 0:10:21,000
With our 86 billion neurons

269
0:10:21.998,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and 60 to 70 kilos of body mass,

270
0:10:25.033,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we should have to spend over nine hours

271
0:10:28.594,000 --> 0:10:31,000
per day every single day feeding,

272
0:10:32.169,000 --> 0:10:34,000
which is just not feasible.

273
0:10:34.208,000 --> 0:10:35,000
If we ate like a primate,

274
0:10:36.042,000 --> 0:10:38,000
we should not be here.

275
0:10:38.295,000 --> 0:10:4,000
How did we get here, then?

276
0:10:40.422,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Well, if our brain costs just as much energy

277
0:10:43.157,000 --> 0:10:44,000
as it should, and if we can't spend

278
0:10:44.88,000 --> 0:10:47,000
every waking hour of the day feeding,

279
0:10:48.554,000 --> 0:10:49,000
then the only alternative, really,

280
0:10:50.465,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is to somehow get more energy

281
0:10:52.423,000 --> 0:10:53,000
out of the same foods.

282
0:10:54.376,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And remarkably, that matches exactly

283
0:10:58.176,000 --> 0:11:01,000
what our ancestors are believed to have invented

284
0:11:01.213,000 --> 0:11:02,000
one and a half million years ago,

285
0:11:03.052,000 --> 0:11:05,000
when they invented cooking.

286
0:11:05.834,000 --> 0:11:06,000
To cook is to use fire

287
0:11:07.804,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to pre-digest foods outside of your body.

288
0:11:11.604,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Cooked foods are softer, so they're easier to chew

289
0:11:14.21,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and to turn completely into mush in your mouth,

290
0:11:16.773,000 --> 0:11:18,000
so that allows them to be completely digested

291
0:11:18.925,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and absorbed in your gut,

292
0:11:20.361,000 --> 0:11:23,000
which makes them yield much more energy in much less time.

293
0:11:24.016,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So cooking frees time for us to do

294
0:11:26.505,000 --> 0:11:28,000
much more interesting things with our day

295
0:11:28.567,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and with our neurons

296
0:11:30.047,000 --> 0:11:31,000
than just thinking about food,

297
0:11:31.952,000 --> 0:11:32,000
looking for food, and gobbling down food

298
0:11:33.656,000 --> 0:11:34,000
all day long.

299
0:11:34.881,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So because of cooking, what once was

300
0:11:37.38,000 --> 0:11:39,000
a major liability, this large,

301
0:11:39.733,000 --> 0:11:42,000
dangerously expensive brain with a lot of neurons,

302
0:11:42.766,000 --> 0:11:44,000
could now become a major asset,

303
0:11:44.802,000 --> 0:11:47,000
now that we could both afford the energy for a lot of neurons

304
0:11:48.056,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and the time to do interesting things with them.

305
0:11:50.559,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So I think this explains why the human brain

306
0:11:52.533,000 --> 0:11:55,000
grew to become so large so fast in evolution,

307
0:11:55.773,000 --> 0:11:58,000
all of the while remaining just a primate brain.

308
0:11:59.67,000 --> 0:12:01,000
With this large brain now affordable by cooking,

309
0:12:02.444,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we went rapidly from raw foods to culture,

310
0:12:05.357,000 --> 0:12:07,000
agriculture, civilization, grocery stores,

311
0:12:07.963,000 --> 0:12:08,000
electricity, refrigerators,

312
0:12:09.588,000 --> 0:12:1,000
all of those things that nowadays

313
0:12:11.195,000 --> 0:12:13,000
allow us to get all the energy we need

314
0:12:13.237,000 --> 0:12:15,000
for the whole day in a single sitting

315
0:12:16.019,000 --> 0:12:18,000
at your favorite fast food joint.

316
0:12:18.973,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So what once was a solution

317
0:12:21.41,000 --> 0:12:22,000
now became the problem,

318
0:12:23.109,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and ironically, we look for the solution in raw food.

319
0:12:28.626,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So what is the human advantage?

320
0:12:31.182,000 --> 0:12:32,000
What is it that we have

321
0:12:32.685,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that no other animal has?

322
0:12:35.22,000 --> 0:12:37,000
My answer is that we have the largest number

323
0:12:37.568,000 --> 0:12:38,000
of neurons in the cerebral cortex,

324
0:12:39.04,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and I think that's the simplest explanation

325
0:12:40.884,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for our remarkable cognitive abilities.

326
0:12:42.897,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And what is it that we do that no other animal does,

327
0:12:46.124,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and which I believe was fundamental

328
0:12:48.093,000 --> 0:12:51,000
to allow us to reach that large,

329
0:12:51.176,000 --> 0:12:53,000
largest number of neurons in the cortex?

330
0:12:53.398,000 --> 0:12:55,000
In two words, we cook.

331
0:12:55.613,000 --> 0:12:58,000
No other animal cooks its food. Only humans do.

332
0:12:59.179,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And I think that's how we got to become human.

333
0:13:02.049,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Studying the human brain changed the way I think about food.

334
0:13:04.509,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I now look at my kitchen,

335
0:13:06.154,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and I bow to it,

336
0:13:07.624,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and I thank my ancestors for coming up

337
0:13:09.329,000 --> 0:13:1,000
with the invention that probably made us humans.

338
0:13:11.229,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Thank you very much.

339
0:13:13.361,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

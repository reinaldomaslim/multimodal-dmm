1
0:00:12.74,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So there's this thing called the law of unintended consequences.

2
0:00:17.22,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I thought it was just like a saying,

3
0:00:18.98,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but it actually exists, I guess.

4
0:00:20.58,000 --> 0:00:21,000
There's, like, academic papers about it.

5
0:00:22.94,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I'm a designer.

6
0:00:24.22,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I don't like unintended consequences.

7
0:00:27.1,000 --> 0:00:31,000
People hire me because they have consequences that they really intend,

8
0:00:31.7,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and what they intend is for me to help them achieve those consequences.

9
0:00:35.58,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So I live in fear of unintended consequences.

10
0:00:38.62,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And so this is a story about consequences intended and unintended.

11
0:00:43.9,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I got called by an organization called Robin Hood

12
0:00:47.06,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to do a favor for them.

13
0:00:48.66,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Robin Hood is based in New York, a wonderful philanthropic organization

14
0:00:52.1,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that does what it says in the name.

15
0:00:53.86,000 --> 0:00:55,000
They take from rich people, give it to poor people.

16
0:00:56.66,000 --> 0:01:,000
In this case, what they wanted to benefit was the New York City school system,

17
0:01:01.58,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a huge enterprise that educates more than a million students at a time,

18
0:01:06.94,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and in buildings that are like this one,

19
0:01:09.3,000 --> 0:01:1,000
old buildings, big buildings,

20
0:01:11.22,000 --> 0:01:14,000
drafty buildings, sometimes buildings that are in disrepair,

21
0:01:14.38,000 --> 0:01:16,000
certainly buildings that could use a renovation.

22
0:01:16.94,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Robin Hood had this ambition to improve these buildings in some way,

23
0:01:20.22,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but what they realized was

24
0:01:21.7,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to fix the buildings would be too expensive and impractical.

25
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So instead they tried to figure out what one room they could go into

26
0:01:30.66,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in each of these buildings, in as many buildings that they could,

27
0:01:33.74,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and fix that one room

28
0:01:36.42,000 --> 0:01:38,000
so that they could improve the lives of the children inside

29
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
as they were studying.

30
0:01:40.5,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And what they came up with was the school library,

31
0:01:42.94,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and they came up with this idea called the Library Initiative.

32
0:01:45.9,000 --> 0:01:47,000
All the students have to pass through the library.

33
0:01:48.3,000 --> 0:01:49,000
That's where the books are.

34
0:01:49.66,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That's where the heart and soul of the school is.

35
0:01:52.02,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So let's fix these libraries.

36
0:01:53.46,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So they did this wonderful thing where they brought in

37
0:01:56.02,000 --> 0:01:59,000
first 10, then 20, then more architects,

38
0:01:59.14,000 --> 0:02:02,000
each one of whom was assigned a library to rethink what a library was.

39
0:02:02.9,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They trained special librarians.

40
0:02:04.98,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So they started this mighty enterprise

41
0:02:07.06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to reform public schools by improving these libraries.

42
0:02:10.1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Then they called me up and they said, "Could you make a little contribution?"

43
0:02:13.78,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?"

44
0:02:15.82,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And they said, "Well, we want you to be the graphic designer

45
0:02:18.7,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in charge of the whole thing."

46
0:02:20.18,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And so I thought, I know what that means. That means I get to design a logo.

47
0:02:23.78,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I know how to design that. I design logos.

48
0:02:25.82,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That's what people come to me for.

49
0:02:27.5,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.

50
0:02:29.62,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Easy to do, actually, compared with architecture

51
0:02:31.9,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and being a librarian.

52
0:02:33.18,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Just do a logo, make a contribution, and then you're out,

53
0:02:35.94,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and you feel really good about yourself.

54
0:02:37.9,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And I'm a great guy and I like to feel good about myself when I do these favors.

55
0:02:41.7,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So I thought, let's overdeliver.

56
0:02:43.3,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm going to give you three logos, all based on this one idea.

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So you have three options, pick any of the three.

58
0:02:48.62,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They're all great, I said.

59
0:02:49.94,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So the basic idea was these would be new school libraries

60
0:02:53.18,000 --> 0:02:54,000
for New York schools,

61
0:02:54.74,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and so the idea is that it's a new thing, a new idea that needs a new name.

62
0:02:58.62,000 --> 0:03:03,000
What I wanted to do was dispel the idea that these were musty old libraries,

63
0:03:03.66,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the kind of places that everyone is bored with,

64
0:03:07.3,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you know, not your grandparents' library.

65
0:03:09.3,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Don't worry about that at all.

66
0:03:10.78,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This is going to this new, exciting thing,

67
0:03:12.82,000 --> 0:03:13,000
not a boring library.

68
0:03:14.1,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So option number one:

69
0:03:15.78,000 --> 0:03:17,000
so instead of thinking of it as a library,

70
0:03:17.82,000 --> 0:03:21,000
think of it as a place where it is like: do talk, do make loud noises.

71
0:03:22.02,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Right? So no shushing, it's like a shush-free zone.

72
0:03:26.06,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We're going to call it the Reading Room.

73
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That was option number one. OK, option number two.

74
0:03:31.66,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Option number two was, wait for it,

75
0:03:35.1,000 --> 0:03:36,000
OWL.

76
0:03:36.38,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I'll meet you at OWL.

77
0:03:37.74,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm getting my book from the OWL. Meet you after school down at OWL.

78
0:03:41.06,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I like that, right? Now, what does OWL stand for?

79
0:03:43.42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Well, it could be One World Library,

80
0:03:45.34,000 --> 0:03:47,000
or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.

81
0:03:47.98,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Or it could be -- and I figure librarians could figure out other things it could be

82
0:03:52.5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because they know about words.

83
0:03:53.98,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So other things, right?

84
0:03:55.22,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then look at this. It's like the eye of the owl.

85
0:03:57.7,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is irresistible in my opinion.

86
0:03:59.42,000 --> 0:04:,000
But there's even another idea.

87
0:04:00.9,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Option number three.

88
0:04:02.14,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Option number three was based actually on language.

89
0:04:04.78,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's the idea that "read" is the past tense of "read,"

90
0:04:08.1,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and they're both spelled the same way.

91
0:04:09.98,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So why don't we call this place The Red Zone?

92
0:04:12.94,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I'll meet you at the Red Zone.

93
0:04:14.393,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Are you Red? Get Red.

94
0:04:17.7,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I'm well Red.

95
0:04:18.94,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:20.18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I really loved this idea,

97
0:04:21.54,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I somehow was not focused on the idea

98
0:04:23.9,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that librarians as a class are sort of interested in spelling and I don't know.

99
0:04:29.82,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:31.779,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But sometimes cleverness is more important than spelling,

101
0:04:35.3,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and I thought this would be one of those instances.

102
0:04:37.74,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So usually when I make these presentations

103
0:04:39.78,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I say there's just one question and the question should be,

104
0:04:42.58,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"How can I thank you, Mike?"

105
0:04:43.98,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But in this case, the question was more like,

106
0:04:46.62,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"Um, are you kidding?"

107
0:04:49.06,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Because, they said,

108
0:04:50.78,000 --> 0:04:51,000
the premise of all this work

109
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:56,000
was that kids were bored with old libraries, musty old libraries.

110
0:04:56.34,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They were tired of them.

111
0:04:57.58,000 --> 0:05:,000
And instead, they said, these kids have never really seen a library.

112
0:05:00.94,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The school libraries in these schools

113
0:05:02.78,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are really so dilapidated, if they're there at all,

114
0:05:06.22,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that they haven't bored anyone.

115
0:05:08.18,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They haven't even been there to bore anyone at all.

116
0:05:11.18,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So the idea was, just forget about giving it a new name.

117
0:05:14.62,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Just call it, one last try, a library.

118
0:05:18.7,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Right? OK.

119
0:05:19.94,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?

120
0:05:22.82,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Exclamation point?

121
0:05:24.06,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Then -- this is because I'm clever --

122
0:05:26.06,000 --> 0:05:28,000
move that into the "i,"

123
0:05:28.62,000 --> 0:05:29,000
make it red,

124
0:05:29.9,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and there you have it, the Library Initiative.

125
0:05:32.1,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So I thought, mission accomplished, there's your logo.

126
0:05:34.66,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So what's interesting about this logo, an unintended consequence,

127
0:05:37.74,000 --> 0:05:4,000
was that it turned out that they didn't really even need my design

128
0:05:40.9,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because you could type it any font, you could write it by hand,

129
0:05:43.9,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and when they started sending emails around,

130
0:05:46.02,000 --> 0:05:47,000
they just would use Shift and 1,

131
0:05:47.62,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they'd get their own logo just right out of the thing.

132
0:05:50.22,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I thought, well, that's fine.

133
0:05:51.98,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Feel free to use that logo.

134
0:05:53.78,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And then I embarked on the real rollout of this thing --

135
0:05:56.7,000 --> 0:05:57,000
working with every one of the architects

136
0:05:58.66,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to put this logo on the front door of their own library. Right?

137
0:06:02.18,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So here's the big rollout.

138
0:06:03.58,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Basically I'd work with different architects.

139
0:06:05.86,000 --> 0:06:08,000
First Robin Hood was my client. Now these architects were my client.

140
0:06:09.1,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I'd say, "Here's your logo. Put it on the door."

141
0:06:11.363,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"Here's your logo. Put it on both doors."

142
0:06:13.34,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Here's your logo. Put it off to the side."

143
0:06:15.38,000 --> 0:06:17,000
"Here's your logo repeated all over to the top."

144
0:06:17.66,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So everything was going swimmingly.

145
0:06:19.38,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I just was saying, "Here's your logo. Here's your logo."

146
0:06:22.06,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Then I got a call from one of the architects,

147
0:06:24.22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a guy named Richard Lewis, and he says, "I've got a problem.

148
0:06:27.1,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You're the graphics guy. Can you solve it?"

149
0:06:29.14,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And I said, OK, sure."

150
0:06:30.38,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And he said, "The problem is that there's a space

151
0:06:32.98,000 --> 0:06:33,000
between the shelf and the ceiling."

152
0:06:34.82,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So that sounds like an architectural issue to me,

153
0:06:37.18,000 --> 0:06:39,000
not a graphic design issue, so I'm, "Go on."

154
0:06:39.3,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And Richard says, "Well, the top shelf has to be low enough

155
0:06:42.98,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for the kid to reach it,

156
0:06:44.22,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but I'm in a big old building, and the ceilings are really high,

157
0:06:47.244,000 --> 0:06:49,000
so actually I've got all this space up there

158
0:06:49.34,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and I need something like a mural."

159
0:06:51.06,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And I'm like, "Whoa, you know, I'm a logo designer.

160
0:06:54.02,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I'm not Diego Rivera or something.

161
0:06:56.18,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'm not a muralist."

162
0:06:57.82,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And so he said, "But can't you think of anything?"

163
0:07:00.22,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So I said, "OK, what if we just took pictures of the kids in the school

164
0:07:05.62,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and just put them around the top of the thing,

165
0:07:08.1,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and maybe that could work."

166
0:07:09.46,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And my wife is a photographer,

167
0:07:11.34,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and I said, "Dorothy, there's no budget,

168
0:07:13.3,000 --> 0:07:16,000
can you come to this school in east New York, take these pictures?"

169
0:07:16.5,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And she did,

170
0:07:17.74,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and if you go in Richard's library,

171
0:07:19.74,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which is one of the first that opened,

172
0:07:21.62,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it has this glorious frieze of, like, the heroes of the school,

173
0:07:24.74,000 --> 0:07:25,000
oversized, looking down

174
0:07:26.46,000 --> 0:07:29,000
into the little dollhouse of the real library, right?

175
0:07:29.5,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the kids were great, hand-selected by the principals

176
0:07:32.34,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and the librarian.

177
0:07:34.14,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It just kind of created this heroic atmosphere in this library,

178
0:07:37.42,000 --> 0:07:4,000
this very dignified setting below and the joy of the children above.

179
0:07:40.94,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So naturally all the other librarians in the other schools see this

180
0:07:45.3,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and they said, well, we want murals too.

181
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I'm like, OK.

182
0:07:48.58,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So then I think, well, it can't be the same mural every time,

183
0:07:51.5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so Dorothy did another one, and then she did another one,

184
0:07:54.58,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but then we needed more help,

185
0:07:56.22,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so I called an illustrator I knew named Lynn Pauley,

186
0:07:59.1,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and Lynn did these beautiful paintings of the kids.

187
0:08:02.06,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkin at a place called Automatic Design.

188
0:08:06.42,000 --> 0:08:07,000
He did these amazing collages.

189
0:08:08.78,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We had Rafael Esquer

190
0:08:11.14,000 --> 0:08:12,000
do these great silhouettes.

191
0:08:13.02,000 --> 0:08:15,000
He would work with the kids, asking for words,

192
0:08:15.22,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and then based on those prompts,

193
0:08:16.82,000 --> 0:08:18,000
come up with this little, delirious kind of constellation

194
0:08:19.54,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of silhouettes of things that are in books.

195
0:08:21.62,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Peter Arkle interviewed the kids

196
0:08:23.22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and had them talk about their favorite books

197
0:08:25.34,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and he put their testimony as a frieze up there.

198
0:08:27.62,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu

199
0:08:29.9,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and they did this amazing manga-style statement,

200
0:08:32.22,000 --> 0:08:34,000
"Everyone who is honest is interesting,"

201
0:08:34.7,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that goes all the way around.

202
0:08:36.58,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,

203
0:08:38.98,000 --> 0:08:39,000
did a whole series of things

204
0:08:40.38,000 --> 0:08:43,000
where he embedded books into the faces and characters

205
0:08:43.42,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and images and places that you find in the books.

206
0:08:46.58,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And then even Maira Kalman

207
0:08:48.66,000 --> 0:08:51,000
did this amazing cryptic installation of objects and words

208
0:08:52.499,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that kind of go all around and will fascinate students

209
0:08:55.7,000 --> 0:08:56,000
for as long as it's up there.

210
0:08:57.3,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So this was really satisfying,

211
0:08:58.98,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and basically my role here was reading a series of dimensions to these artists,

212
0:09:04.9,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and I would say,

213
0:09:06.18,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.

214
0:09:08.9,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Let me know if you have any problem with that."

215
0:09:11.14,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And they would go and install these. It just was the greatest thing.

216
0:09:14.38,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But the greatest thing, actually, was --

217
0:09:16.7,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Every once in a while,

218
0:09:17.94,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I'd get, like, an invitation in the mail made of construction paper,

219
0:09:21.18,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and it would say, "You are invited to the opening of our new library."

220
0:09:24.5,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So you'd go to the library, say, you'd go to PS10,

221
0:09:26.9,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and you'd go inside.

222
0:09:28.14,000 --> 0:09:3,000
There'd be balloons, there'd be a student ambassador,

223
0:09:30.94,000 --> 0:09:32,000
there'd be speeches that were read,

224
0:09:33.1,000 --> 0:09:35,000
poetry that was written specifically for the opening,

225
0:09:36.02,000 --> 0:09:38,000
dignitaries would present people with certificates,

226
0:09:38.98,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and the whole thing was just a delirious, fun party.

227
0:09:41.62,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So I loved going to these things.

228
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I would stand there dressed like this, obviously not belonging,

229
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and someone would say, "What are you doing here, mister?"

230
0:09:48.951,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the team that designed this place."

231
0:09:52.14,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And they'd said, "You do these shelves?"

232
0:09:54.069,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I said, "No." "You took the pictures up above."

233
0:09:56.5,000 --> 0:09:57,000
"No."

234
0:09:57.74,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"Well, what did you do?"

235
0:09:58.98,000 --> 0:10:,000
"You know when you came in? The sign over the door?"

236
0:10:01.46,000 --> 0:10:02,000
"The sign that says library?"

237
0:10:02.9,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:03.94,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"Yeah, I did that!"

239
0:10:05.18,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And then they'd sort of go, "OK. Nice work if you can get it."

240
0:10:10.02,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So it was so satisfying going to these little openings

241
0:10:14.14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
despite the fact that I was kind of largely ignored or humiliated,

242
0:10:17.9,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but it was actually fun going to the openings,

243
0:10:20.1,000 --> 0:10:22,000
so I decided that I wanted to get the people in my office

244
0:10:22.82,000 --> 0:10:25,000
who had worked on these projects, get the illustrators and photographers,

245
0:10:26.3,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and I said, why don't we rent a van

246
0:10:28.02,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and drive around the five boroughs of New York

247
0:10:30.42,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and see how many we could hit at one time.

248
0:10:32.46,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And eventually there were going to be 60 of these libraries,

249
0:10:35.34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
so we probably got to see maybe half a dozen in one long day.

250
0:10:39.14,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And the best thing of all was meeting these librarians

251
0:10:42.1,000 --> 0:10:45,000
who kind of were running these, took possession of these places

252
0:10:45.7,000 --> 0:10:47,000
like their private stage upon which they were invited

253
0:10:48.3,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to mesmerize their students and bring the books to life,

254
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and it was just this really exciting experience

255
0:10:54.82,000 --> 0:10:56,000
for all of us to actually see these things in action.

256
0:10:57.66,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So we spent a long day doing this

257
0:11:00.22,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and we were in the very last library.

258
0:11:02.06,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It was still winter, because it got dark early,

259
0:11:04.9,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the librarian says,

260
0:11:06.14,000 --> 0:11:08,000
"I'm about to close down. So really nice having you here.

261
0:11:08.86,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Hey, wait a second, do you want to see how I turn off the lights?"

262
0:11:12.02,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I'm like, "OK."

263
0:11:13.34,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And she said, "I have this special way that I do it."

264
0:11:15.86,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And then she showed me.

265
0:11:17.14,000 --> 0:11:2,000
What she did was she turned out every light one by one by one by one,

266
0:11:20.62,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and the last light she left on

267
0:11:22.7,000 --> 0:11:24,000
was the light that illuminated the kids' faces,

268
0:11:25.62,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and she said, "That's the last light I turn off every night,

269
0:11:28.5,000 --> 0:11:3,000
because I like to remind myself why I come to work."

270
0:11:31.1,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So when I started this whole thing,

271
0:11:33.98,000 --> 0:11:35,000
remember, it was just about designing that logo

272
0:11:36.195,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and being clever, come up with a new name?

273
0:11:38.22,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The unintended consequence here,

274
0:11:39.82,000 --> 0:11:4,000
which I would like to take credit for

275
0:11:41.66,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and like to think I can think through the experience to that extent,

276
0:11:44.9,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but I can't.

277
0:11:46.14,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I was just focused on a foot ahead of me, as far as I could reach with my own hands.

278
0:11:50.14,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Instead, way off in the distance

279
0:11:52.74,000 --> 0:11:53,000
was a librarian

280
0:11:54.02,000 --> 0:11:56,000
who was going to find the chain of consequences

281
0:11:56.98,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that we had set in motion,

282
0:11:58.42,000 --> 0:11:59,000
a source of inspiration

283
0:11:59.94,000 --> 0:12:02,000
so that she in this case could do her work really well.

284
0:12:03.34,000 --> 0:12:06,000
40,000 kids a year are affected by these libraries.

285
0:12:06.74,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They've been happening for more than 10 years now,

286
0:12:09.22,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so those librarians have kind of turned on a generation of children to books

287
0:12:13.78,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and so it's been a thrill to find out

288
0:12:16.3,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that sometimes unintended consequences are the best consequences.

289
0:12:20.06,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Thank you very much.

290
0:12:21.3,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

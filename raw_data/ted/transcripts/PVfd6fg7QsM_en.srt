1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In high school, I took a bus to school

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
an hour each way every day.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I was always absorbed in a book,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
science fiction book,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which took my mind to other worlds,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and satisfied, in a narrative form,

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself

10
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school

11
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was out in the woods,

12
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
hiking and taking "samples" --

13
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.

15
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
You know, I was a real science geek.

16
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But it was all about trying to understand the world,

17
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
understand the limits of possibility.

18
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And my love of science fiction

19
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,

20
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,

21
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we were going to the moon,

22
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we were exploring the deep oceans.

23
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms

24
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with his amazing specials that showed us

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
animals and places and a wondrous world

26
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that we could never really have previously imagined.

27
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So, that seemed to resonate

28
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with the whole science fiction part of it.

29
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I was an artist.

30
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I could draw. I could paint.

31
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I found that because there weren't video games

32
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and this saturation of CG movies and all of this

33
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
imagery in the media landscape,

34
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I had to create these images in my head.

35
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You know, we all did, as kids having to

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
read a book, and through the author's description,

37
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
put something on the movie screen in our heads.

38
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw

39
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
alien creatures, alien worlds,

40
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
robots, spaceships, all that stuff.

41
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I was endlessly getting busted in math class

42
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
doodling behind the textbook.

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
That was -- the creativity

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
had to find its outlet somehow.

45
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows

46
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
actually got me very excited about the fact that there was

47
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
an alien world right here on Earth.

48
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I might not really go to an alien world

49
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
on a spaceship someday --

50
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that seemed pretty darn unlikely.

51
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But that was a world I could really go to,

52
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic

53
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
as anything that I had imagined

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
from reading these books.

55
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver

56
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at the age of 15.

57
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And the only problem with that was that I lived

58
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in a little village in Canada,

59
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
600 miles from the nearest ocean.

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
But I didn't let that daunt me.

61
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I pestered my father until he finally found

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
right across the border from where we live.

64
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I actually got certified

65
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter

66
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in Buffalo, New York.

67
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,

68
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for another two years,

69
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
until we moved to California.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Since then, in the intervening

71
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
40 years,

72
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.

74
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and even the shallow oceans,

76
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
are so rich with amazing life

77
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that really is beyond our imagination.

78
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Nature's imagination is so boundless

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
compared to our own

80
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
meager human imagination.

81
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe

82
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of what I see when I make these dives.

83
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,

84
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and just as strong as it ever was.

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But when I chose a career as an adult,

86
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
it was filmmaking.

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
this urge I had to tell stories

89
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
with my urges to create images.

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories

92
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
together, and that made sense.

93
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And of course the stories that I chose to tell

94
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"

95
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and "The Abyss."

96
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love

97
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of underwater and diving with filmmaking.

98
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So, you know, merging the two passions.

99
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Something interesting came out of "The Abyss,"

100
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which was that to solve a specific narrative

101
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
problem on that film,

102
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,

103
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.

104
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And this resulted in the first soft-surface

105
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
character, CG animation

106
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that was ever in a movie.

107
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And even though the film didn't make any money --

108
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
barely broke even, I should say --

109
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,

110
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the global audience, was mesmerized

111
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
by this apparent magic.

112
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law

113
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

114
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They were seeing something magical.

115
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And so that got me very excited.

116
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced

117
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
into the cinematic art."

118
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,

119
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we took that much farther.

120
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude

121
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in that film. The success hung in the balance

122
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
on whether that effect would work.

123
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And it did, and we created magic again,

124
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and we had the same result with an audience --

125
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
although we did make a little more money on that one.

126
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So, drawing a line through those two dots

127
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of experience

128
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
came to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"

129
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
this was a whole new world of creativity

130
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
for film artists.

131
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So, I started a company with Stan Winston,

132
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
my good friend Stan Winston,

133
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
who is the premier make-up and creature designer

134
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.

135
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And the concept of the company was

136
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that we would leapfrog past

137
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the analog processes of optical printers and so on,

138
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and we would go right to digital production.

139
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.

140
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s

141
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in the creature and character design stuff

142
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that we had actually founded the company to do.

143
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"

144
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which was meant to absolutely push the envelope

145
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of visual effects,

146
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
of CG effects, beyond,

147
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
with realistic human emotive characters

148
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
generated in CG,

149
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and the main characters would all be in CG,

150
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and the world would be in CG.

151
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And the envelope pushed back,

152
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and I was told by the folks at my company

153
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.

154
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.

155
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:

157
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
"It's going to be this epic romance,

158
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
passionate film."

159
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Secretly, what I wanted to do was

160
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."

161
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And that's why I made the movie.

162
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Applause)

163
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.

164
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But I convinced them. I said,

165
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.

166
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.

167
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."

168
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I talked them into funding an expedition.

169
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme

171
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
about your imagination creating a reality.

172
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Because we actually created a reality where six months later,

173
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I find myself in a Russian submersible

174
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,

175
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
looking at the real Titanic through a view port.

176
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Not a movie, not HD -- for real.

177
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Applause)

178
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, that blew my mind.

179
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras

180
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and lights and all kinds of things.

181
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But, it struck me how much

182
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
this dive, these deep dives,

183
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
was like a space mission.

184
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
You know, where it was highly technical,

185
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and it required enormous planning.

186
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark

187
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
hostile environment

188
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
where there is no hope of rescue

189
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
if you can't get back by yourself.

190
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,

191
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
living in a science fiction movie.

192
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This is really cool."

193
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.

194
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --

195
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it was everything. It was adventure,

196
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it was curiosity, it was imagination.

197
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And it was an experience that

198
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Hollywood couldn't give me.

199
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could

200
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing

201
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
out that window.

202
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,

203
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents

204
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and sometimes things that I had never seen before,

205
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
sometimes things that no one had seen before,

206
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that actually were not described by science

207
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
at the time that we saw them and imaged them.

208
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So, I was completely smitten by this,

209
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and had to do more.

210
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.

211
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
After the success of "Titanic,"

212
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job

213
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
as a Hollywood movie maker,

214
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."

215
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And so, we started planning these

216
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
expeditions.

217
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And we wound up going to the Bismark,

218
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and exploring it with robotic vehicles.

219
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We went back to the Titanic wreck.

220
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We took little bots that we had created

221
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that spooled a fiber optic.

222
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And the idea was to go in and do an interior

223
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
survey of that ship, which had never been done.

224
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,

225
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
so we created technology to do it.

226
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck

227
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,

228
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and looking out at planks that look much like this,

229
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
where I knew that the band had played.

230
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle

231
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
through the corridor of the ship.

232
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
When I say, "I'm operating it,"

233
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but my mind is in the vehicle.

234
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I felt like I was physically present

235
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
inside the shipwreck of Titanic.

236
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And it was the most surreal kind

237
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
of deja vu experience I've ever had,

238
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because I would know before I turned a corner

239
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
what was going to be there before the lights

240
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of the vehicle actually revealed it,

241
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because I had walked the set for months

242
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
when we were making the movie.

243
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And the set was based as an exact replica

244
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
on the blueprints of the ship.

245
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.

246
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And it really made me realize that

247
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the telepresence experience --

248
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that you actually can have these robotic avatars,

249
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,

250
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
into this other form of existence.

251
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It was really, really quite profound.

252
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening

253
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
some decades out

254
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
as we start to have cyborg bodies

255
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
for exploration or for other means

256
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
in many sort of

257
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
post-human futures

258
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that I can imagine,

259
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
as a science fiction fan.

260
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So, having done these expeditions,

261
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,

262
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
such as at the deep ocean vents

263
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
where we had these amazing, amazing animals --

264
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
they're basically aliens right here on Earth.

265
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.

266
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They don't survive on sunlight-based

267
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
system the way we do.

268
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to

269
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
a 500-degree-Centigrade

270
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
water plumes.

271
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
You think they can't possibly exist.

272
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
At the same time

273
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I was getting very interested in space science as well --

274
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.

275
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And I wound up getting involved with

276
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the space community,

277
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
really involved with NASA,

278
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
sitting on the NASA advisory board,

279
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
planning actual space missions,

280
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut

281
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
biomedical protocols,

282
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and all these sorts of things,

283
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to actually go and fly to the international space station

284
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
with our 3D camera systems.

285
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And this was fascinating.

286
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists

287
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
with us into the deep.

288
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And taking them down so that they had access --

289
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
astrobiologists, planetary scientists,

290
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
people who were interested in these extreme environments --

291
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,

292
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and take samples and test instruments, and so on.

293
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So, here we were making documentary films,

294
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but actually doing science,

295
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and actually doing space science.

296
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I'd completely closed the loop

297
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
between being the science fiction fan,

298
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
you know, as a kid,

299
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and doing this stuff for real.

300
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And you know, along the way in this journey

301
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
of discovery,

302
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I learned a lot.

303
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot

304
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
about leadership.

305
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Now you think director has got to be a leader,

306
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.

307
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I didn't really learn about leadership

308
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
until I did these expeditions.

309
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Because I had to, at a certain point, say,

310
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
"What am I doing out here?

311
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"

312
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We don't make money at these damn shows.

313
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We barely break even. There is no fame in it.

314
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
People sort of think I went away

315
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails

316
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
someplace, sitting at the beach.

317
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Made all these films, made all these documentary films

318
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
for a very limited audience.

319
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?

320
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
You're doing it for the task itself,

321
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
for the challenge --

322
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --

323
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
for the thrill of discovery,

324
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and for that strange bond that happens

325
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.

326
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,

327
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
working for years at a time,

328
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.

329
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And in that bond, you realize

330
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that the most important thing

331
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is the respect that you have for them

332
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and that they have for you, that you've done a task

333
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that you can't explain to someone else.

334
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
When you come back to the shore and you say,

335
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,

336
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and the this and the that,

337
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
all the technology of it, and the difficulty,

338
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the human-performance aspects of working at sea,"

339
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that

340
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together

341
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and they know they can never explain it.

342
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.

343
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So, when I came back to make my next movie,

344
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
which was "Avatar,"

345
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,

346
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
which is that you respect your team,

347
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and you earn their respect in return.

348
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And it really changed the dynamic.

349
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So, here I was again with a small team,

350
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
in uncharted territory,

351
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology

352
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that didn't exist before.

353
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Tremendously exciting.

354
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Tremendously challenging.

355
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.

356
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And it completely changed how I do movies.

357
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,

358
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
you brought back the ocean organisms

359
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and put them on the planet of Pandora."

360
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,

361
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
the process itself, that changed as a result of that.

362
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So, what can we synthesize out of all this?

363
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
You know, what are the lessons learned?

364
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Well, I think number one is

365
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
curiosity.

366
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
It's the most powerful thing you own.

367
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Imagination is a force

368
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that can actually manifest a reality.

369
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And the respect of your team

370
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
is more important than all the

371
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
laurels in the world.

372
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I have young filmmakers

373
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."

374
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.

375
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,

376
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
don't bet against yourself,

377
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and take risks."

378
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
NASA has this phrase that they like:

379
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
"Failure is not an option."

380
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
But failure has to be an option

381
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.

382
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And no important endeavor

383
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that required innovation

384
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
was done without risk.

385
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
You have to be willing to take those risks.

386
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So, that's the thought I would leave you with,

387
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
is that in whatever you're doing,

388
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
failure is an option,

389
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
but fear is not. Thank you.

390
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.096,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It was the end of October in the mountains in Austria.

2
0:00:17.442,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I was there on a field trip with my architecture students from Zurich.

3
0:00:21.66,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And when we reached a high valley,

4
0:00:25.799,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I surprised them with the news that there was no hut

5
0:00:28.292,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or hotel booked for the night.

6
0:00:31.552,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It was not a mistake.

7
0:00:33.243,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It was totally on purpose.

8
0:00:37.093,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The challenge was to build our own shelter with whatever we could find.

9
0:00:42.662,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And we all survived.

10
0:00:44.078,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It was cold, it was really tough ...

11
0:00:47.022,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it was a great learning experience

12
0:00:49.729,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to discover that there are a lot of resources given by nature for free,

13
0:00:53.563,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and all that we need is our sensitivity to see them ...

14
0:00:58.21,000 --> 0:01:,000
and our creativity to use them.

15
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I found myself in a similar situation.

16
0:01:06.425,000 --> 0:01:1,000
When I was an architecture student about 13 years ago,

17
0:01:10.95,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I went to Bangladesh to a remote village called Rudrapur

18
0:01:14.263,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with the aim to design and build a school as my thesis project.

19
0:01:18.188,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I had lived in that village before when I was 19 and a volunteer

20
0:01:21.407,000 --> 0:01:23,000
at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGO for rural development.

21
0:01:24.368,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And what I had learned from them

22
0:01:26.074,000 --> 0:01:3,000
was that the most sustainable strategy for sustainable development

23
0:01:30.876,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is to cherish and to use your very own resources and potential,

24
0:01:36.059,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and not get dependent on external factors.

25
0:01:39.512,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And this is what I tried to do with my architecture as well.

26
0:01:43.359,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In terms of suitable building materials for my school,

27
0:01:46.764,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I didn't have to look far.

28
0:01:48.718,000 --> 0:01:49,000
They were right under my feet:

29
0:01:51.732,000 --> 0:01:54,000
mud, earth, dirt, clay, however you call it ...

30
0:01:56.788,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and bamboo that was growing all around.

31
0:02:01.4,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,

32
0:02:05.559,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but we didn't need it.

33
0:02:06.789,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We had human energy

34
0:02:08.412,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and the people were happy to have the work.

35
0:02:12.188,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Tools were an issue, too,

36
0:02:14.151,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but we had these guys,

37
0:02:15.738,000 --> 0:02:16,000
water buffalos.

38
0:02:18.73,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We had also tried a bit cows,

39
0:02:20.89,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but interestingly, they were too intelligent.

40
0:02:24.01,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They were always stepping in the holes of the previous round.

41
0:02:26.93,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw --

42
0:02:28.812,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:29.886,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the sand, which are the ingredients in the walls.

44
0:02:34.171,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And except a small team of consultants

45
0:02:36.569,000 --> 0:02:38,000
like my partner for realization, Eike Roswag,

46
0:02:38.696,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,

47
0:02:41.338,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it was all built by craftsmen from the village.

48
0:02:47.613,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And this is the METI school after six months of construction.

49
0:02:50.921,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:53.288,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Thank you.

51
0:02:54.471,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Applause)

52
0:02:56.097,000 --> 0:03:,000
Load-bearing earth walls that really ground the school,

53
0:03:00.226,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and large bamboo structures that bring the lightness in.

54
0:03:05.635,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That's the classroom on the ground floor.

55
0:03:09.072,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Attached to it are the caves.

56
0:03:11.763,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They're for reading, for snuggling, for solo work,

57
0:03:14.201,000 --> 0:03:15,000
for meditation, for playing ...

58
0:03:16.891,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and the classroom on the top.

59
0:03:21.831,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The children all signed with their names in Bengali the doors,

60
0:03:25.638,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and they did not only sign, they also helped building the school.

61
0:03:30.207,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And I'm sure you all had your hands in mud or clay before.

62
0:03:33.133,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's wonderful to touch. I love it.

63
0:03:34.97,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The children loved it.

64
0:03:36.894,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And can you imagine the feeling of a small boy or a girl

65
0:03:41.773,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or an illiterate day laborer standing in front of that school building

66
0:03:45.726,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and knowing that you built this

67
0:03:47.291,000 --> 0:03:5,000
out of the ordinary bamboo and just the dirt underneath your feet,

68
0:03:50.909,000 --> 0:03:52,000
using nothing but your hands?

69
0:03:55.561,000 --> 0:04:,000
That gives such an enormous boost of trust and confidence

70
0:04:01.262,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in yourself and the community.

71
0:04:04.81,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And in the material.

72
0:04:07.348,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Especially mud has a very poor image.

73
0:04:10.241,000 --> 0:04:13,000
When we think of mud, we think of dirt --

74
0:04:13.369,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it's ugly, it's nondurable --

75
0:04:15.607,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and this is the image I want to change.

76
0:04:19.159,000 --> 0:04:22,000
In fact, it's the 11th rainy season for this school now,

77
0:04:22.93,000 --> 0:04:25,000
really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,

78
0:04:26.208,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and the walls are standing strong.

79
0:04:29.131,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:33.664,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So how does it work?

81
0:04:35.03,000 --> 0:04:39,000
First rule, a good foundation that keeps the wall dry from the ground,

82
0:04:39.21,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and second rule, a good roof that protects from the top,

83
0:04:42.93,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and third rule, erosion control.

84
0:04:46.193,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Mud walls need speed breakers

85
0:04:48.503,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so that the rainwater cannot run down the wall fast,

86
0:04:52.735,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and these speed breakers could be lines of bamboo

87
0:04:56.041,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or stones or straw mixed into the mud,

88
0:04:59.646,000 --> 0:05:04,000
just like a hill needs trees or rocks in order to prevent erosion.

89
0:05:04.931,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It works just the same way.

90
0:05:07.34,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And people always ask me if I have to add cement to the mud,

91
0:05:11.397,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and the answer is no.

92
0:05:13.311,000 --> 0:05:16,000
There is no stabilizer, no coating on these walls,

93
0:05:17.074,000 --> 0:05:18,000
only in the foundation.

94
0:05:20.294,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So this is the close-up of the wall

95
0:05:22.136,000 --> 0:05:25,000
after 10 rainy seasons,

96
0:05:25.62,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and as much as I grew a bit older,

97
0:05:28.084,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the wall got some wrinkles as well.

98
0:05:29.83,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The edges my not be as sharp as before,

99
0:05:32.021,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but it still looks pretty good,

100
0:05:34.197,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and if it needs repairing,

101
0:05:35.951,000 --> 0:05:36,000
it is really easy to do.

102
0:05:37.966,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You just take the broken part,

103
0:05:39.733,000 --> 0:05:41,000
make it wet, and put it back on the wall,

104
0:05:42.495,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and it will look the same as before.

105
0:05:44.542,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Wish that would work on me, too.

106
0:05:46.109,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:50.685,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Yeah, and the great thing is,

108
0:05:52.865,000 --> 0:05:54,000
if an earth wall is not needed anymore,

109
0:05:55.31,000 --> 0:05:58,000
it can go back to the ground it came from,

110
0:05:58.575,000 --> 0:05:59,000
turn into a garden,

111
0:06:00.507,000 --> 0:06:03,000
or get fully recycled without any loss of quality.

112
0:06:04.607,000 --> 0:06:06,000
There's no other material that can do this,

113
0:06:06.722,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and this is why mud is so excellent in terms of environmental performance.

114
0:06:12.421,000 --> 0:06:14,000
What about the economic sustainability?

115
0:06:15.252,000 --> 0:06:16,000
When we built the school,

116
0:06:16.542,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I practically lived on the construction site,

117
0:06:18.943,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and in the evening, I used to go with the workers to the market,

118
0:06:21.991,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and I could see how they spent their money.

119
0:06:24.984,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And they would buy the vegetables from their neighbors,

120
0:06:28.308,000 --> 0:06:31,000
they would get a new haircut or a new blouse from the tailor.

121
0:06:32.858,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And because the main part of the building budget

122
0:06:36.74,000 --> 0:06:38,000
was spent on craftsmanship,

123
0:06:38.909,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the school wasn't just a building,

124
0:06:41.365,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it became a real catalyst for local development,

125
0:06:45.553,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and that made me happy.

126
0:06:48.989,000 --> 0:06:5,000
If I had designed the school in cement and steel,

127
0:06:51.411,000 --> 0:06:54,000
this money would have been exported and lost for those families.

128
0:06:56.514,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Applause)

129
0:07:01.935,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The building budget at that time was 35,000 euros --

130
0:07:05.53,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it's probably doubled by now --

131
0:07:07.515,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and this is a lot of money for that region,

132
0:07:10.627,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and especially because this money is working within the community

133
0:07:14.656,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and rotating fast,

134
0:07:15.958,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and not on the stock market.

135
0:07:18.402,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So when it comes to the economic sustainability of my project,

136
0:07:23.283,000 --> 0:07:26,000
my main question is, who gets the profit?

137
0:07:28.949,000 --> 0:07:3,000
How many of you in here

138
0:07:30.99,000 --> 0:07:32,000
have some experience living in a mud house?

139
0:07:33.514,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Chris Anderson, where is your hand?

140
0:07:35.575,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:36.656,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You? OK.

142
0:07:39.139,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Yeah.

143
0:07:40.314,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It seems totally out of our focus,

144
0:07:43.503,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but approximately three billion people all around the planet

145
0:07:48.161,000 --> 0:07:5,000
are living in earth houses,

146
0:07:50.668,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and it is a traditional building material

147
0:07:52.978,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in Europe just as much as in Africa.

148
0:07:58.076,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Strangely enough,

149
0:07:59.641,000 --> 0:08:02,000
mud is not considered worthy of being studied at universities ...

150
0:08:04.281,000 --> 0:08:07,000
so I brought the dirt to Harvard,

151
0:08:07.503,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:09.734,000 --> 0:08:12,000
precisely 60 tons of dirt right in front of the main facade

153
0:08:13.734,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of the Graduate School of Design.

154
0:08:17.478,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Students and faculty rolled up their sleeves,

155
0:08:19.646,000 --> 0:08:2,000
got their hands dirty

156
0:08:20.825,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and transformed the front into a warm place for people to gather.

157
0:08:25.248,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Children would climb the structures,

158
0:08:26.988,000 --> 0:08:27,000
skaters would ride the ramp,

159
0:08:28.529,000 --> 0:08:29,000
students having lunch breaks,

160
0:08:30.299,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and it was particularly fascinating to see how many people were touching the wall,

161
0:08:34.395,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and we usually don't go around cities caressing our facades, right?

162
0:08:38.272,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:44.366,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:48.603,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Of course, this was a small-scale project,

165
0:08:50.634,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but in terms of awareness-building and in terms of education,

166
0:08:53.754,000 --> 0:08:55,000
it was like an acupuncture trigger point.

167
0:08:57.701,000 --> 0:09:,000
And in fact, in more and more countries,

168
0:09:01.305,000 --> 0:09:05,000
load-bearing earthen structures are not allowed to be built anymore

169
0:09:06.314,000 --> 0:09:09,000
although they're traditional and have lasted for hundreds of years,

170
0:09:09.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and not because the material is weak,

171
0:09:11.88,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but because there are no architects and engineers

172
0:09:15.056,000 --> 0:09:17,000
who know how to deal with that material.

173
0:09:17.516,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So education on all levels,

174
0:09:19.214,000 --> 0:09:21,000
for craftsmen, engineers and architects,

175
0:09:21.914,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is really strongly needed.

176
0:09:24.085,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Equally important is technological development,

177
0:09:27.453,000 --> 0:09:3,000
like prefabrication developed by my colleague Martin Rauch,

178
0:09:30.57,000 --> 0:09:33,000
who is an Austrian artist and expert in earthen structures.

179
0:09:34.58,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And he has created technologies for rammed earth elements,

180
0:09:38.214,000 --> 0:09:4,000
for prefabrication of rammed earth elements

181
0:09:40.671,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that include insulation, wall heatings and coolings

182
0:09:44.456,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and all sorts of electrical fittings

183
0:09:46.281,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that can be layered to multistoried buildings,

184
0:09:48.598,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and this is important in order to scale up

185
0:09:51.299,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and in order to [speed] up the processes,

186
0:09:53.291,000 --> 0:09:56,000
like in the Ricola Herb Center in Switzerland.

187
0:09:58.555,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And finally, we need good built projects

188
0:10:01.707,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that prove you can build with an ancient material

189
0:10:04.826,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in a very modern way.

190
0:10:07.434,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It is not a matter of how old a material is;

191
0:10:11.152,000 --> 0:10:14,000
it's a matter of our creative ability to use it today.

192
0:10:16.936,000 --> 0:10:18,000
These, for example, are three hostels

193
0:10:19.215,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that I did in China in the village Baoxi,

194
0:10:21.586,000 --> 0:10:23,000
about six hours by bus from Shanghai.

195
0:10:25.859,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The outside shape is woven bamboo,

196
0:10:28.574,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the inside core is stones and rammed earth.

197
0:10:33.058,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And it is a traditional building material.

198
0:10:35.538,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Even large parts of the Great Wall of China

199
0:10:37.755,000 --> 0:10:38,000
have been built with rammed earth,

200
0:10:39.424,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but it's getting replaced by concrete.

201
0:10:42.411,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And this trend is happening very fast.

202
0:10:45.909,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Within only a couple of years,

203
0:10:48.909,000 --> 0:10:5,000
China has consumed more cement than the United States

204
0:10:51.926,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in the entire 20th century.

205
0:10:54.618,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And this trend of replacing natural building materials

206
0:10:58.151,000 --> 0:11:,000
with materials that require a lot of energy,

207
0:11:00.428,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that are energy-intensive,

208
0:11:02.238,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and that emit CO2

209
0:11:04.303,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is really clearly contributing to climate change.

210
0:11:07.667,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And we have alternatives,

211
0:11:09.104,000 --> 0:11:13,000
such as mud, stones, timber, bamboo, earth,

212
0:11:13.379,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that are totally effective options for all sorts of purposes.

213
0:11:17.926,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This, for example, is an office building that we did

214
0:11:20.497,000 --> 0:11:22,000
for Omicron Electronics in Austria.

215
0:11:22.902,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Mud is healthy for the planet, but also for the human bodies,

216
0:11:25.823,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and the material is low-tech,

217
0:11:28.489,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but the performance is high-tech.

218
0:11:30.736,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The earth walls keep the highly sophisticated tools in the building safe

219
0:11:34.839,000 --> 0:11:35,000
by naturally regulating moisture.

220
0:11:37.59,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And this wall in my own home

221
0:11:41.126,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is our humidfier.

222
0:11:44.372,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We love our six tons of dirt at home

223
0:11:47.326,000 --> 0:11:49,000
not only because it's healthy and sustainable.

224
0:11:50.397,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Its archaic warmth is touching deep within.

225
0:11:54.708,000 --> 0:11:58,000
My personal dream is to build a mud skyscraper right in Manhattan.

226
0:11:59.82,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

227
0:12:01.883,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Yeah.

228
0:12:03.058,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Applause)

229
0:12:05.281,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And this dream isn't so crazy

230
0:12:06.854,000 --> 0:12:08,000
if you think of the mud city of Shibam in Yemen

231
0:12:09.07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that was built in the 16th century

232
0:12:10.959,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and has lasted now for 500 years.

233
0:12:15.267,000 --> 0:12:19,000
What was possible that long ago is possible today as well,

234
0:12:19.398,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and we can apply all our technical know-how

235
0:12:23.026,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to these ancient materials

236
0:12:25.06,000 --> 0:12:28,000
so that it meets our needs and our dreams.

237
0:12:30.403,000 --> 0:12:31,000
All around us,

238
0:12:32.301,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and just below our feet ...

239
0:12:35.06,000 --> 0:12:37,000
are wonderful natural building materials.

240
0:12:37.851,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Let's use them.

241
0:12:40.221,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And I deeply believe

242
0:12:42.161,000 --> 0:12:44,000
our homes, our work spaces, our cities

243
0:12:45.716,000 --> 0:12:47,000
would become more healthy and sustainable

244
0:12:49.54,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and more humane

245
0:12:52.087,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and beautiful.

246
0:12:53.932,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Thank you.

247
0:12:55.107,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:14.801,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Chris Anderson: So two months ago, something crazy happened.

2
0:00:17.643,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Can you talk us through this, because this caught so many people's attention?

3
0:00:21.294,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Gwynne Shotwell: I'll stay quiet for the beginning,

4
0:00:23.707,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and then I'll start talking.

5
0:00:25.073,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Video) Voices: Five, four, three, two, one.

6
0:00:29.436,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Cheering)

7
0:00:31.58,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Woman: Liftoff. Go Falcon Heavy.

8
0:00:34.93,000 --> 0:00:37,000
GS: So this was such an important moment for SpaceX.

9
0:00:38.216,000 --> 0:00:4,000
With the Falcon 9 and now the Falcon Heavy,

10
0:00:40.996,000 --> 0:00:42,000
we can launch into orbit

11
0:00:43.735,000 --> 0:00:47,000
any payload that has previously been conceived or is conceived right now.

12
0:00:48.631,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We've got a couple of launches of Falcon Heavy later this year,

13
0:00:51.608,000 --> 0:00:52,000
so this had to go right.

14
0:00:53.288,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It was the first time we flew it,

15
0:00:55.67,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and the star of the show, of course,

16
0:00:57.493,000 --> 0:00:59,000
brother and sister side boosters landing.

17
0:01:00.041,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I was excited.

18
0:01:01.216,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:02.843,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Thanking my team.

20
0:01:04.018,000 --> 0:01:06,000
By the way, there's maybe a thousand people

21
0:01:06.09,000 --> 0:01:07,000
standing around me right there.

22
0:01:08.682,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And Starman.

23
0:01:10.357,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Starman did not steal the show, though --

24
0:01:12.334,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the boosters did.

25
0:01:13.604,000 --> 0:01:14,000
CA: (Laughter)

26
0:01:14.639,000 --> 0:01:17,000
CA: There had to be some payload -- why not put a Tesla into space?

27
0:01:17.98,000 --> 0:01:18,000
GS: Exactly. It was perfect.

28
0:01:19.957,000 --> 0:01:21,000
CA: Gwynne, let's wind the clock back.

29
0:01:22.446,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I mean, how did you end up an engineer and President of SpaceX?

30
0:01:26.814,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Were you supernerdy as a girl?

31
0:01:29.107,000 --> 0:01:3,000
GS: I don't think I was nerdy,

32
0:01:30.629,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but I was definitely doing the things that the girls weren't doing.

33
0:01:33.969,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I asked my mom, who was an artist, when I was in third grade,

34
0:01:37.005,000 --> 0:01:38,000
how a car worked,

35
0:01:38.27,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so she had no idea so she gave me a book, and I read it,

36
0:01:41.984,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and sure enough, my first job out of my mechanical engineering degree

37
0:01:46.181,000 --> 0:01:49,000
was with Chrysler Motors in the automotive industry.

38
0:01:49.677,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But I actually got into engineering not because of that book

39
0:01:52.587,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but because my mom took me to a Society of Women Engineers event,

40
0:01:55.695,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and I fell in love with the mechanical engineer that spoke.

41
0:01:58.5,000 --> 0:01:59,000
She was doing really critical work,

42
0:02:00.317,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I loved her suit.

43
0:02:02.383,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:03.408,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And that's what a 15-year-old girl connects with.

45
0:02:05.741,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I used to shy away from telling that story,

46
0:02:08.239,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but if that's what caused me to be an engineer --

47
0:02:10.549,000 --> 0:02:11,000
hey, I think we should talk about that.

48
0:02:12.431,000 --> 0:02:17,000
CA: Sixteen years ago, you became employee number seven at SpaceX,

49
0:02:18.331,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and then over the next years,

50
0:02:20.157,000 --> 0:02:25,000
you somehow built a multi-billion-dollar relationship with NASA,

51
0:02:25.533,000 --> 0:02:28,000
despite the fact that SpaceX's first three launches blew up.

52
0:02:29.382,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I mean, how on earth did you do that?

53
0:02:31.282,000 --> 0:02:34,000
GS: So actually, selling rockets is all about relationships

54
0:02:35.186,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and making a connection with these customers.

55
0:02:37.844,000 --> 0:02:38,000
When you don't have a rocket to sell,

56
0:02:39.685,000 --> 0:02:41,000
what's really important is selling your team,

57
0:02:41.835,000 --> 0:02:43,000
selling the business savvy of your CEO --

58
0:02:44.027,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that's not really hard to sell these days --

59
0:02:46.417,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and basically, making sure that any technical issue that they have

60
0:02:49.705,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or any concern, you can address right away.

61
0:02:51.848,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So I think it was helpful for me to be an engineer.

62
0:02:55.284,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I think it was helpful to my role of running sales for Elon.

63
0:02:58.879,000 --> 0:03:,000
CA: And currently, a big focus of the company

64
0:03:01.308,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is, I guess, kind of a race with Boeing

65
0:03:03.567,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to be the first to provide the service to NASA

66
0:03:06.908,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of actually putting humans into orbit.

67
0:03:12.702,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Safety considerations obviously come to the fore, here.

68
0:03:15.959,000 --> 0:03:17,000
How are you sleeping?

69
0:03:18.506,000 --> 0:03:21,000
GS: I actually sleep really well. I'm a good sleeper, that's my best thing.

70
0:03:22.503,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But I think the days leading up to our flying crew

71
0:03:26.764,000 --> 0:03:27,000
will probably be a little sleepless.

72
0:03:28.7,000 --> 0:03:31,000
But really, fundamentally, safety comes in the design

73
0:03:32.1,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of the system that you're going to fly people on,

74
0:03:34.41,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and so we've been working for years,

75
0:03:36.373,000 --> 0:03:38,000
actually, almost a decade, on this technology.

76
0:03:38.782,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We're taking the Dragon cargo spaceship

77
0:03:41.038,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and we're upgrading it to be able to carry crew.

78
0:03:43.8,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And as I said, we've been engineering in these safety systems

79
0:03:47.847,000 --> 0:03:48,000
for quite some time.

80
0:03:49.459,000 --> 0:03:53,000
CA: So isn't it that there's one system that actually allows instant escape

81
0:03:53.839,000 --> 0:03:54,000
if there's a problem.

82
0:03:55.045,000 --> 0:03:57,000
GS: That's right. It's called the launch escape system.

83
0:03:57.681,000 --> 0:03:59,000
CA: I think we have that. Let's show that.

84
0:03:59.705,000 --> 0:04:01,000
GS: We've got a video of a test that we ran in 2015.

85
0:04:03.062,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So this simulated having a really bad day on the pad.

86
0:04:07.192,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Basically, you want the capsule to get out of Dodge.

87
0:04:09.915,000 --> 0:04:11,000
You want it to get away from the rocket

88
0:04:11.947,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that had a bad day right below it.

89
0:04:14.724,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This is if there was an issue on the pad.

90
0:04:16.776,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We also will be doing another demonstration later this year

91
0:04:19.562,000 --> 0:04:22,000
on if we have an issue with the rocket during flight.

92
0:04:23.228,000 --> 0:04:27,000
CA: And those rockets have another potential function as well, eventually.

93
0:04:27.435,000 --> 0:04:3,000
GS: Yeah, so the launch escape system for Dragon is pretty unique.

94
0:04:30.766,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's an integrated launch escape system.

95
0:04:32.695,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It's basically a pusher,

96
0:04:33.997,000 --> 0:04:37,000
so the propellant system and the thrusters are integrated into the capsule,

97
0:04:38.357,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and so if it detects a rocket problem, it pushes the capsule away.

98
0:04:42.488,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Capsule safety systems in the past have been like tractor pullers,

99
0:04:46.313,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the reason we didn't want to do that

100
0:04:48.313,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is that puller needs to come off before you can safely reenter that capsule,

101
0:04:51.988,000 --> 0:04:55,000
so we wanted to eliminate, in design, that possibility of failure.

102
0:04:57.084,000 --> 0:05:01,000
CA: I mean, SpaceX has made the regular reusability of rockets

103
0:05:01.537,000 --> 0:05:03,000
seem almost routine,

104
0:05:03.726,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which means you've done something

105
0:05:05.402,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that no national space program, for example,

106
0:05:08.086,000 --> 0:05:1,000
has been able to achieve.

107
0:05:10.122,000 --> 0:05:11,000
How was that possible?

108
0:05:12.423,000 --> 0:05:14,000
GS: I think there's a couple of things --

109
0:05:15.153,000 --> 0:05:17,000
there's a million things, actually --

110
0:05:17.24,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that have allowed SpaceX to be successful.

111
0:05:20.184,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The first is that we're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants. Right?

112
0:05:23.85,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We got to look at the rocket industry and the developments to date,

113
0:05:28.43,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we got to pick the best ideas,

114
0:05:30.881,000 --> 0:05:31,000
leverage them.

115
0:05:32.712,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We also didn't have technology that we had to include

116
0:05:36.763,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in our vehicle systems.

117
0:05:38.203,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So we didn't have to design around legacy components

118
0:05:42.059,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that maybe weren't the most reliable or were particularly expensive,

119
0:05:45.274,000 --> 0:05:49,000
so we really were able to let physics drive the design of these systems.

120
0:05:49.358,000 --> 0:05:51,000
CA: I mean, there are other programs started from scratch.

121
0:05:52.097,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That last phrase you said there, you let physics drive the design,

122
0:05:55.469,000 --> 0:05:57,000
what's an example of that?

123
0:05:57.865,000 --> 0:06:,000
GS: There's hundreds of examples, actually, of that,

124
0:06:01.008,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but basically, we got to construct the vehicle design

125
0:06:05.412,000 --> 0:06:07,000
from, really, a clean sheet of paper,

126
0:06:07.5,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and we got to make decisions that we wanted to make.

127
0:06:11.38,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The tank architecture -- it's a common dome design.

128
0:06:14.173,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Basically it's like two beer cans stacked together,

129
0:06:16.768,000 --> 0:06:17,000
one full of liquid oxygen,

130
0:06:18.402,000 --> 0:06:2,000
one full of RP,

131
0:06:20.545,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and that basically saved weight.

132
0:06:23.203,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It allowed us to basically take more payload for the same design.

133
0:06:27.871,000 --> 0:06:3,000
One of the other elements of the vehicle that we're flying right now

134
0:06:31.29,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is we do use densified liquid oxygen and densified RP,

135
0:06:34.65,000 --> 0:06:35,000
so it's ultracold,

136
0:06:36.115,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and it allows you to pack more propellent into the vehicle.

137
0:06:40.867,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It is done elsewhere,

138
0:06:42.372,000 --> 0:06:44,000
probably not to the degree that we do it,

139
0:06:44.674,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but it adds a lot of margin to the vehicle,

140
0:06:46.699,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which obviously adds reliability.

141
0:06:48.941,000 --> 0:06:52,000
CA: Gwynne, you became President of SpaceX 10 years ago, I think.

142
0:06:53.401,000 --> 0:06:56,000
What's it been like to work so closely with Elon Musk?

143
0:06:57.408,000 --> 0:06:59,000
GS: So I love working for Elon.

144
0:06:59.879,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I've been doing it for 16 years this year, actually.

145
0:07:02.364,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I don't think I'm dumb enough to do something for 16 years

146
0:07:05.823,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that I don't like doing.

147
0:07:07.823,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He's funny

148
0:07:09.767,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and fundamentally without him saying anything

149
0:07:12.939,000 --> 0:07:14,000
he drives you to do your best work.

150
0:07:16.3,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He doesn't have to say a word.

151
0:07:17.767,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You just want to do great work.

152
0:07:20.101,000 --> 0:07:23,000
CA: You might be the person best placed to answer this question,

153
0:07:23.136,000 --> 0:07:24,000
which has puzzled me,

154
0:07:24.653,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which is to shed light on this strange unit of time

155
0:07:28.159,000 --> 0:07:3,000
called "Elon time."

156
0:07:30.959,000 --> 0:07:33,000
For example, last year, I asked Elon, you know,

157
0:07:34.144,000 --> 0:07:37,000
when Tesla would auto-drive across America,

158
0:07:37.612,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and he said by last December,

159
0:07:39.961,000 --> 0:07:43,000
which is definitely true, if you take Elon time into account.

160
0:07:44.289,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So what's the conversion ratio between Elon time and real time?

161
0:07:48.892,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

162
0:07:49.923,000 --> 0:07:51,000
GS: You put me in a unique position, Chris.

163
0:07:51.957,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Thanks for that.

164
0:07:53.849,000 --> 0:07:56,000
There's no question that Elon is very aggressive on his timelines,

165
0:07:56.969,000 --> 0:08:,000
but frankly, that drives us to do things better and faster.

166
0:08:01.526,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I think all the time and all the money in the world

167
0:08:03.938,000 --> 0:08:04,000
does not yield the best solution,

168
0:08:05.827,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and so putting that pressure on the team to move quickly is really important.

169
0:08:11.531,000 --> 0:08:14,000
CA: It feels like you play kind of a key intermediary role here.

170
0:08:14.573,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I mean, he sets these crazy goals that have their impact,

171
0:08:19.084,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but, in other circumstances, might blow up a team

172
0:08:22.602,000 --> 0:08:24,000
or set impossible expectations.

173
0:08:24.823,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It feels like you've found a way of saying, "Yes, Elon,"

174
0:08:28.648,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and then making it happen in a way that is acceptable

175
0:08:31.15,000 --> 0:08:33,000
both to him and to your company, to your employees.

176
0:08:34.296,000 --> 0:08:37,000
GS: There is two really important realizations for that.

177
0:08:37.973,000 --> 0:08:41,000
First of all, when Elon says something, you have to pause

178
0:08:42.607,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and not immediately blurt out, "Well, that's impossible,"

179
0:08:46.706,000 --> 0:08:48,000
or, "There's no way we're going to do that. I don't know how."

180
0:08:49.695,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So you zip it, and you think about it,

181
0:08:51.561,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and you find ways to get that done.

182
0:08:53.801,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And the other thing I realized,

183
0:08:56.082,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and it made my job satisfaction substantially harder.

184
0:08:59.141,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So I always felt like my job was to take these ideas

185
0:09:04.125,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and kind of turn them into company goals, make them achievable,

186
0:09:07.632,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and kind of roll the company over from this steep slope, get it comfortable.

187
0:09:12.258,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And I noticed every time I felt like we were there,

188
0:09:15.321,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we were rolling over, people were getting comfortable,

189
0:09:18.658,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Elon would throw something out there,

190
0:09:20.444,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and all of a sudden, we're not comfortable

191
0:09:22.611,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and we're climbing that steep slope again.

192
0:09:24.952,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But then once I realized that that's his job,

193
0:09:27.602,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and my job is to get the company close to comfortable

194
0:09:30.948,000 --> 0:09:32,000
so he can push again and put us back on that slope,

195
0:09:33.681,000 --> 0:09:34,000
then I started liking my job a lot more,

196
0:09:35.676,000 --> 0:09:37,000
instead of always being frustrated.

197
0:09:37.789,000 --> 0:09:4,000
CA: So if I estimated that the conversation ratio

198
0:09:41.114,000 --> 0:09:43,000
for Elon time to your time is about 2x,

199
0:09:43.431,000 --> 0:09:45,000
am I a long way out there?

200
0:09:46.375,000 --> 0:09:48,000
GS: That's not terrible, and you said it, I didn't.

201
0:09:48.963,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:50.978,000 --> 0:09:51,000
CA: You know, looking ahead,

203
0:09:53.001,000 --> 0:09:54,000
one huge initiative

204
0:09:54.693,000 --> 0:09:57,000
SpaceX is believed to be, rumored to be working on,

205
0:09:57.723,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is a massive network of literally thousands of low earth orbit satellites

206
0:10:04.302,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to provide high-bandwidth, low-cost internet connection

207
0:10:07.841,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to every square foot of planet earth.

208
0:10:10.23,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Is there anything you can tell us about this?

209
0:10:12.488,000 --> 0:10:16,000
GS: We actually don't chat very much about this particular project,

210
0:10:16.614,000 --> 0:10:17,000
not because we're hiding anything,

211
0:10:18.328,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but this is probably one of the most challenging

212
0:10:20.598,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if not the most challenging project we've undertaken.

213
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
No one has been successful

214
0:10:25.026,000 --> 0:10:28,000
deploying a huge constellation for internet broadband,

215
0:10:28.631,000 --> 0:10:3,000
or basically for satellite internet,

216
0:10:30.954,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and I don't think physics is the difficulty here.

217
0:10:33.593,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I think we can come up with the right technology solution,

218
0:10:36.493,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but we need to make a business out of it,

219
0:10:38.777,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and it'll cost the company about 10 billion dollars or more

220
0:10:42.388,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to deploy this system.

221
0:10:44.173,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And so we're marching steadily along

222
0:10:48.258,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but we're certainly not claiming victory yet.

223
0:10:50.647,000 --> 0:10:53,000
CA: I mean, the impact of that, obviously, if that happened to the world,

224
0:10:54.1,000 --> 0:10:57,000
of connectivity everywhere, would be pretty radical,

225
0:10:57.512,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and perhaps mainly for good --

226
0:10:59.029,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I mean, it changes a lot if suddenly everyone can connect cheaply.

227
0:11:02.868,000 --> 0:11:04,000
GS: Yeah, there's no question it'll change the world.

228
0:11:05.369,000 --> 0:11:06,000
CA: How much of a worry is it,

229
0:11:07.241,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and how much of a drag on the planning is it,

230
0:11:09.448,000 --> 0:11:1,000
are concerns just about space junk?

231
0:11:11.457,000 --> 0:11:12,000
People worry a lot about this.

232
0:11:12.949,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This would a huge increase in the total number of satellites in orbit.

233
0:11:16.316,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Is that a concern?

234
0:11:17.491,000 --> 0:11:2,000
GS: So space debris is a concern, there's no question --

235
0:11:21.196,000 --> 0:11:23,000
not because it's so likely to happen,

236
0:11:23.735,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but the consequences of it happening are pretty devastating.

237
0:11:27.653,000 --> 0:11:3,000
You could basically spew a bunch of particles in orbit

238
0:11:31.443,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that could take out that orbit from being useful for decades or longer.

239
0:11:36.625,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So as a matter of fact,

240
0:11:38.467,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we are required to bring down our second stage after every mission

241
0:11:42.37,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so it doesn't end up being a rocket carcass orbiting earth.

242
0:11:46.521,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So you really need to be a good steward of that.

243
0:11:50.398,000 --> 0:11:54,000
CA: So despite the remarkable success there

244
0:11:54.522,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of that Falcon Heavy rocket,

245
0:11:57.893,000 --> 0:12:,000
you're actually not focusing on that as your future development plan.

246
0:12:01.165,000 --> 0:12:03,000
You're doubling down to a much bigger rocket

247
0:12:04.18,000 --> 0:12:05,000
called the BFR,

248
0:12:05.712,000 --> 0:12:06,000
which stands for ...

249
0:12:07.506,000 --> 0:12:11,000
GS: It's the Big Falcon Rocket. CA: The Big Falcon Rocket, that's right.

250
0:12:11.863,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

251
0:12:13.553,000 --> 0:12:15,000
What's the business logic of doing this

252
0:12:16.247,000 --> 0:12:19,000
when you invested all that in that incredible technology,

253
0:12:19.569,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and now you're just going to something much bigger. Why?

254
0:12:22.421,000 --> 0:12:23,000
GS: Actually, we've learned some lessons

255
0:12:24.357,000 --> 0:12:27,000
over the duration where we've been developing these launch systems.

256
0:12:28.068,000 --> 0:12:32,000
What we want to do is not introduce a new product before we've been able

257
0:12:32.972,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to convince the customers that this is the product that they should move to,

258
0:12:36.575,000 --> 0:12:39,000
so we're working on the Big Falcon Rocket now,

259
0:12:39.971,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but we're going to continue flying Falcon 9s and Falcon Heavies

260
0:12:43.01,000 --> 0:12:46,000
until there is absolute widespread acceptance of BFR.

261
0:12:46.867,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But we are working on it right now,

262
0:12:48.819,000 --> 0:12:51,000
we're just not going to cancel Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy

263
0:12:52.073,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and just put in place BFR.

264
0:12:55.001,000 --> 0:12:59,000
CA: The logic is that BFR is what you need to take humanity to Mars?

265
0:12:59.524,000 --> 0:13:,000
GS: That's correct.

266
0:13:00.777,000 --> 0:13:04,000
CA: But somehow, you've also found other business ideas for this.

267
0:13:04.911,000 --> 0:13:07,000
GS: Yes. BFR can take the satellites that we're currently taking to orbit

268
0:13:08.407,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to many orbits.

269
0:13:09.664,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It allows for even a new class of satellites to be delivered to orbit.

270
0:13:15.013,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Basically, the width, the diameter of the fairing is eight meters,

271
0:13:18.663,000 --> 0:13:2,000
so you can think about what giant telescopes

272
0:13:21.036,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you can put in that fairing, in that cargo bay,

273
0:13:24.48,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and see really incredible things

274
0:13:26.599,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and discover incredible things in space.

275
0:13:28.892,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But then there are some residual capabilities

276
0:13:31.098,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that we have out of BFR as well.

277
0:13:33.43,000 --> 0:13:35,000
CA: A residual capability? GS: It's a residual capability.

278
0:13:36.226,000 --> 0:13:39,000
CA: Is that what you call this? Talk about what the heck this is.

279
0:13:39.36,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Oh wait a sec --

280
0:13:40.535,000 --> 0:13:41,000
GS: That's Falcon Heavy.

281
0:13:41.73,000 --> 0:13:42,000
That's worth pointing out, by the way.

282
0:13:43.565,000 --> 0:13:44,000
What a beautiful rocket,

283
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and that hangar could just fit the Statue of Liberty in it,

284
0:13:49.984,000 --> 0:13:53,000
so you get a sense of size of that Falcon Heavy Rocket.

285
0:13:54.404,000 --> 0:13:56,000
CA: And the fact that there are 27 engines there.

286
0:13:56.904,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That's part of the design principle

287
0:13:58.595,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that you, rather than just inventing ever bigger rockets,

288
0:14:01.848,000 --> 0:14:02,000
you team them up.

289
0:14:03.014,000 --> 0:14:05,000
GS: It's exactly this residual capability.

290
0:14:05.124,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We developed the Merlin engine for the Falcon 1 launch vehicle.

291
0:14:08.166,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We could have tossed that engine

292
0:14:09.956,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and built an entirely new engine for the Falcon 9.

293
0:14:12.941,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It would have been called something different,

294
0:14:15.143,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because Falcon 9 is nine Merlin engines,

295
0:14:17.072,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but instead of spending a billion dollars on a brand new engine,

296
0:14:20.135,000 --> 0:14:23,000
we put nine of them together on the back end of Falcon 9.

297
0:14:23.345,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Residual capability: glue three Falcon 9s together

298
0:14:26.449,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and you have the largest operational rocket flying.

299
0:14:29.592,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And so it was expensive to do,

300
0:14:31.425,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but it was a much more efficient path than starting from scratch.

301
0:14:34.675,000 --> 0:14:37,000
CA: And the BFR is the equivalent of how much bigger than that,

302
0:14:38.56,000 --> 0:14:39,000
in terms of its power?

303
0:14:39.735,000 --> 0:14:42,000
GS: BFR is about, I believe, two and half times the size of this.

304
0:14:42.879,000 --> 0:14:43,000
CA: Right, and so that allows you --

305
0:14:44.88,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I mean, I still don't really believe this video that we're about to play here.

306
0:14:48.591,000 --> 0:14:49,000
What on earth is this?

307
0:14:50.863,000 --> 0:14:52,000
GS: So it currently is on earth,

308
0:14:53.746,000 --> 0:14:56,000
but this is basically space travel for earthlings.

309
0:14:56.903,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I can't wait for this residual capability.

310
0:14:59.148,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Basically, what we're going to do is we're going to fly BFR like an aircraft

311
0:15:03.828,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and do point-to-point travel on earth,

312
0:15:06.438,000 --> 0:15:1,000
so you can take off from New York City or Vancouver

313
0:15:10.489,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and fly halfway across the globe.

314
0:15:12.551,000 --> 0:15:16,000
You'll be on the BFR for roughly half an hour or 40 minutes,

315
0:15:16.59,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and the longest part -- yeah, it's so awesome.

316
0:15:19.058,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Applause)

317
0:15:20.174,000 --> 0:15:24,000
The longest part of that flight is actually the boat out and back.

318
0:15:24.391,000 --> 0:15:25,000
(Laughter)

319
0:15:25.416,000 --> 0:15:28,000
CA: I mean. Gwynne, come on, this is awesome, but it's crazy, right?

320
0:15:28.842,000 --> 0:15:3,000
This is never going to actually happen.

321
0:15:31.716,000 --> 0:15:33,000
GS: Oh no, it's definitely going to happen.

322
0:15:33.759,000 --> 0:15:34,000
This is definitely going to happen.

323
0:15:35.45,000 --> 0:15:36,000
CA: How?

324
0:15:36.625,000 --> 0:15:4,000
(Applause)

325
0:15:40.783,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So first of all, countries are going to accept this incoming missile --

326
0:15:45.063,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Laughter)

327
0:15:46.088,000 --> 0:15:5,000
GS: Chris, so can you imagine us trying to convince a federal range,

328
0:15:50.453,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Air Force bases to take the incomers?

329
0:15:52.62,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Because we're doing it now, regularly, right?

330
0:15:54.824,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We're bringing the first stages back,

331
0:15:56.649,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and we're landing them on federal property on an Air Force base.

332
0:15:59.68,000 --> 0:16:,000
So I think doing it, I don't know,

333
0:16:01.449,000 --> 0:16:04,000
10 kilometers out from a city, maybe it's only five kilometers out from a city.

334
0:16:05.202,000 --> 0:16:07,000
CA: So how many passengers can possibly afford the fortune

335
0:16:08.041,000 --> 0:16:09,000
of flying by space?

336
0:16:09.132,000 --> 0:16:14,000
GS: So the first BFR is going to have roughly a hundred passengers.

337
0:16:14.165,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And let's talk a little bit about the business.

338
0:16:16.387,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Everyone thinks rockets are really expensive,

339
0:16:18.554,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and to a large degree they are,

340
0:16:20.463,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and how could we possibly compete with airline tickets here?

341
0:16:23.298,000 --> 0:16:25,000
But if you think about it, if I can do this trip

342
0:16:25.638,000 --> 0:16:27,000
in half an hour to an hour,

343
0:16:28.591,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I can do dozens of these a day, right?

344
0:16:31.571,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And yet, a long-haul aircraft can only make one of those flights a day.

345
0:16:35.217,000 --> 0:16:37,000
So even if my rocket was slightly more expensive

346
0:16:37.55,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and the fuel is a little bit more expensive,

347
0:16:39.611,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I can run 10x at least what they're running in a day,

348
0:16:42.536,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and really make the revenue that I need to out of that system.

349
0:16:46.051,000 --> 0:16:49,000
CA: So you really believe this is going to be deployed at some point

350
0:16:49.349,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in our amazing future. When?

351
0:16:51.042,000 --> 0:16:52,000
GS: Within a decade, for sure.

352
0:16:53.495,000 --> 0:16:55,000
CA: And this is Gwynne time or Elon time?

353
0:16:56.137,000 --> 0:16:59,000
GS: That's Gwynne time. I'm sure Elon will want us to go faster.

354
0:16:59.233,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Laughter)

355
0:17:01.056,000 --> 0:17:05,000
CA: OK, that's certainly amazing.

356
0:17:05.191,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Laughter)

357
0:17:06.836,000 --> 0:17:09,000
GS: I'm personally invested in this one, because I travel a lot

358
0:17:09.904,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and I do not love to travel,

359
0:17:11.296,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and I would love to get to see my customers in Riyadh,

360
0:17:14.907,000 --> 0:17:17,000
leave in the morning and be back in time to make dinner.

361
0:17:18.149,000 --> 0:17:19,000
CA: So we're going to test this out.

362
0:17:19.942,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So within 10 years, an economy price ticket,

363
0:17:22.736,000 --> 0:17:27,000
or, like, a couple thousand dollars per person to fly New York to Shanghai.

364
0:17:28.41,000 --> 0:17:31,000
GS: Yeah, I think it'll be between economy and business,

365
0:17:31.544,000 --> 0:17:32,000
but you do it in an hour.

366
0:17:32.966,000 --> 0:17:34,000
CA: Yeah, well, OK, that is definitely something.

367
0:17:35.767,000 --> 0:17:36,000
(Laughter)

368
0:17:36.792,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And meanwhile, the other use of BFR is being developed

369
0:17:40.155,000 --> 0:17:43,000
to go a little bit further than Shanghai.

370
0:17:43.368,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Talk about this.

371
0:17:44.634,000 --> 0:17:47,000
You guys have actually developed quite a detailed, sort of, picture

372
0:17:48.651,000 --> 0:17:51,000
of how humans might fly to Mars,

373
0:17:52.095,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and what that would look like.

374
0:17:53.711,000 --> 0:17:55,000
GS: Yeah. So we've got a video, this is a cropped video

375
0:17:56.307,000 --> 0:17:59,000
from others we've shown, and then there's a couple of new bits to it.

376
0:17:59.64,000 --> 0:18:02,000
But basically, you're going to lift off from a pad,

377
0:18:02.982,000 --> 0:18:05,000
you've got a booster as well as the BFS, the Big Falcon Spaceship.

378
0:18:07.535,000 --> 0:18:08,000
It's going to take off.

379
0:18:11.55,000 --> 0:18:14,000
The booster is going to drop the spaceship off in orbit,

380
0:18:14.965,000 --> 0:18:15,000
low earth orbit,

381
0:18:16.139,000 --> 0:18:19,000
and then return just like we're returning boosters right now.

382
0:18:19.369,000 --> 0:18:21,000
So it sounds incredible, but we're working on the pieces,

383
0:18:22.115,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and you can see us achieve these pieces.

384
0:18:24.107,000 --> 0:18:25,000
So booster comes back.

385
0:18:25.334,000 --> 0:18:26,000
The new thing here

386
0:18:26.509,000 --> 0:18:29,000
is that we're going to actually land on the pad that we launched from.

387
0:18:29.852,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Currently, we land on a separate pad, or we land out on a boat.

388
0:18:33.39,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Fast, quick connect.

389
0:18:35.087,000 --> 0:18:37,000
You take a cargo ship full of fuel,

390
0:18:37.78,000 --> 0:18:38,000
or a fuel depot,

391
0:18:38.977,000 --> 0:18:4,000
put it on that booster, get that in orbit,

392
0:18:41.475,000 --> 0:18:43,000
do a docking maneuver, refuel the spaceship,

393
0:18:45.979,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and head on to your destination,

394
0:18:47.877,000 --> 0:18:49,000
and this one is Mars.

395
0:18:51.131,000 --> 0:18:56,000
CA: So, like, a hundred people go to Mars at one time,

396
0:18:56.456,000 --> 0:18:58,000
taking, what, six months? Two months?

397
0:18:59.17,000 --> 0:19:01,000
GS: It ends up depending on how big the rocket is.

398
0:19:01.82,000 --> 0:19:04,000
I think this first version, and we'll continue to make

399
0:19:05.026,000 --> 0:19:07,000
even bigger BFRs,

400
0:19:07.208,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I think it's a three-month trip.

401
0:19:09.263,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Right now, the average is six to eight,

402
0:19:11.202,000 --> 0:19:12,000
but we're going to try to do it faster.

403
0:19:13.188,000 --> 0:19:17,000
CA: When do you believe SpaceX will land the first human on Mars?

404
0:19:17.667,000 --> 0:19:19,000
GS: It's a very similar time frame from the point-to-point.

405
0:19:20.453,000 --> 0:19:21,000
It's the same capability.

406
0:19:21.722,000 --> 0:19:25,000
It will be within a decade -- not this decade.

407
0:19:25.955,000 --> 0:19:27,000
CA: In real time, again, within a decade.

408
0:19:28.189,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Well, that would also be amazing.

409
0:19:31.012,000 --> 0:19:32,000
(Laughter)

410
0:19:32.186,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Why, though? Seriously, why?

411
0:19:34.725,000 --> 0:19:37,000
I mean, you've got a company where this is the official stated mission.

412
0:19:38.503,000 --> 0:19:4,000
Has everyone actually bought into that mission,

413
0:19:41.034,000 --> 0:19:43,000
given that, I mean, there's a lot of people around

414
0:19:43.75,000 --> 0:19:45,000
who think, come on, you've got so much talent,

415
0:19:45.932,000 --> 0:19:46,000
so much technology capability.

416
0:19:47.653,000 --> 0:19:5,000
There are so many things on earth that need urgent attention.

417
0:19:50.988,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Why would you have this escape trip off to another planet?

418
0:19:53.957,000 --> 0:19:54,000
(Applause)

419
0:19:55.616,000 --> 0:19:56,000
GS: So I am glad you asked that,

420
0:19:57.32,000 --> 0:19:59,000
but I think we need to expand our minds a little bit.

421
0:19:59.988,000 --> 0:20:01,000
There are plenty of things to do on earth,

422
0:20:02.091,000 --> 0:20:04,000
but there are lots of companies working on that.

423
0:20:04.686,000 --> 0:20:08,000
I think we're working on one of the most important things we possibly can,

424
0:20:09.005,000 --> 0:20:13,000
and that's to find another place for humans to live and survive and thrive.

425
0:20:13.756,000 --> 0:20:16,000
If something happened on earth,

426
0:20:17.089,000 --> 0:20:19,000
you need humans living somewhere else.

427
0:20:20.896,000 --> 0:20:21,000
(Applause)

428
0:20:22.692,000 --> 0:20:24,000
It's the fundamental risk reduction for the human species.

429
0:20:25.473,000 --> 0:20:27,000
And this does not subvert

430
0:20:27.72,000 --> 0:20:31,000
making our planet here better and doing a better job taking care of it,

431
0:20:32.553,000 --> 0:20:35,000
but I think you need multiple paths to survival,

432
0:20:35.687,000 --> 0:20:37,000
and this is one of them.

433
0:20:37.854,000 --> 0:20:39,000
And let's not talk about the downer piece,

434
0:20:39.977,000 --> 0:20:42,000
like, you go to Mars to make sure all earthlings don't die.

435
0:20:43.389,000 --> 0:20:46,000
That's terrible, actually, that's a terrible reason to go do it.

436
0:20:47.063,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Fundamentally, it's another place to explore,

437
0:20:50.015,000 --> 0:20:53,000
and that's what makes humans different from animals,

438
0:20:53.437,000 --> 0:20:55,000
it's our sense of exploration and sense of wonderment

439
0:20:55.938,000 --> 0:20:56,000
and learning something new.

440
0:20:57.339,000 --> 0:20:59,000
And then I also have to say,

441
0:20:59.878,000 --> 0:21:02,000
this is the first step in us moving to other solar systems

442
0:21:03.743,000 --> 0:21:04,000
and potentially other galaxies,

443
0:21:05.351,000 --> 0:21:08,000
and I think this is the only time I ever out-vision Elon,

444
0:21:08.52,000 --> 0:21:1,000
because I want to meet other people in other solar systems.

445
0:21:11.393,000 --> 0:21:13,000
Mars is fine, but it is a fixer-upper planet.

446
0:21:13.686,000 --> 0:21:15,000
There's work to do there to make it habitable.

447
0:21:15.894,000 --> 0:21:16,000
(Laughter)

448
0:21:16.919,000 --> 0:21:18,000
I want to find people, or whatever they call themselves,

449
0:21:19.93,000 --> 0:21:2,000
in another solar system.

450
0:21:21.573,000 --> 0:21:23,000
CA: That is a big vision.

451
0:21:23.825,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Gwynne Shotwell, thank you.

452
0:21:25.619,000 --> 0:21:27,000
You have one of the most amazing jobs on the planet.

453
0:21:28.073,000 --> 0:21:3,000
GS: Thank you very much. Thanks, Chris.

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly.

2
0:00:27.278,000 --> 0:00:29,000
To explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere

3
0:00:30.151,000 --> 0:00:32,000
where many people haven't been, and that's around the world.

4
0:00:33.004,000 --> 0:00:37,000
When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohr and myself started an organization

5
0:00:37.137,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work,

6
0:00:40.801,000 --> 0:00:42,000
not only about responding to natural disasters,

7
0:00:43.468,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but involved in systemic issues.

8
0:00:46.436,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce,

9
0:00:51.039,000 --> 0:00:55,000
innovative, sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives.

10
0:00:57.118,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So I started my life as an architect, or training as an architect,

11
0:01:02.043,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I was always interested in socially responsible design,

12
0:01:05.484,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and how you can really make an impact.

13
0:01:07.4,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But when I went to architecture school,

14
0:01:09.37,000 --> 0:01:11,000
it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.

15
0:01:12.345,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Many architects seemed to think that when you design,

16
0:01:15.036,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for;

17
0:01:18.841,000 --> 0:01:19,000
whereas I felt that when you design,

18
0:01:20.802,000 --> 0:01:22,000
you either improve or you create a detriment

19
0:01:23.481,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to the community in which you're designing.

20
0:01:25.568,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So you're not just doing a building for the residents

21
0:01:28.1,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or for the people who are going to use it, but for the community as a whole.

22
0:01:31.703,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And in 1999, we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis

23
0:01:38.153,000 --> 0:01:4,000
for returning refugees in Kosovo.

24
0:01:40.188,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And I didn't know what I was doing -- like I said, mid-20s --

25
0:01:43.824,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website.

26
0:01:48.397,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months,

27
0:01:51.91,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we had hundreds of entries from around the world.

28
0:01:55.132,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That led to a number of prototypes being built

29
0:01:57.329,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and really experimenting with some ideas.

30
0:02:00.272,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Two years later we started doing a project

31
0:02:02.427,000 --> 0:02:05,000
on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa,

32
0:02:06.085,000 --> 0:02:08,000
responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.

33
0:02:10.418,000 --> 0:02:16,000
That led to 550 entries from 53 countries.

34
0:02:16.826,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We also have designers from around the world that participate.

35
0:02:21.6,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And we had an exhibit of work that followed that.

36
0:02:25.27,000 --> 0:02:27,000
2004 was the tipping point for us.

37
0:02:27.708,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We started responding to natural disasters

38
0:02:29.753,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and getting involved in Iran, in Bam,

39
0:02:32.398,000 --> 0:02:34,000
also following up on our work in Africa.

40
0:02:35.122,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Working within the United States --

41
0:02:36.994,000 --> 0:02:39,000
most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner.

42
0:02:40.089,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But I live in Bozeman, Montana --

43
0:02:42.187,000 --> 0:02:44,000
go up to the north plains on the reservations,

44
0:02:44.429,000 --> 0:02:47,000
or go down to Alabama or Mississippi, pre-Katrina,

45
0:02:47.878,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions

46
0:02:50.934,000 --> 0:02:52,000
than many developing countries that I've been to.

47
0:02:53.264,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere;

48
0:02:56.776,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and also, I will go into some more projects.

49
0:03:00.217,000 --> 0:03:02,000
2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.

50
0:03:03.135,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year

51
0:03:07.912,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when it comes to natural disasters.

52
0:03:09.603,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And because of the Internet,

53
0:03:11.117,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and because of connections to blogs and so forth,

54
0:03:14.53,000 --> 0:03:18,000
within literally hours of the tsunami, we were already raising funds,

55
0:03:19.006,000 --> 0:03:22,000
getting involved, working with people on the ground.

56
0:03:22.606,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We run from a couple of laptops, and in the first couple of days,

57
0:03:25.812,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I had 4,000 emails from people needing help.

58
0:03:28.915,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So we began to get involved in projects there,

59
0:03:31.812,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I'll talk about some others.

60
0:03:33.45,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina,

61
0:03:36.445,000 --> 0:03:38,000
as well as following up on our reconstruction work.

62
0:03:38.913,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So this is a brief overview.

63
0:03:41.6,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In 2004, I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help,

64
0:03:46.041,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or the number of requests that I was getting.

65
0:03:48.17,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone.

66
0:03:50.725,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So we decided to embrace an open-source model of business --

67
0:03:56.122,000 --> 0:03:59,000
so that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter,

68
0:03:59.313,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and they can get involved in local problems.

69
0:04:01.403,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia.

70
0:04:03.838,000 --> 0:04:05,000
All problems are local. All solutions are local.

71
0:04:06.434,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So that means, you know, somebody who's based in Mississippi

72
0:04:11.092,000 --> 0:04:13,000
knows more about Mississippi than I do.

73
0:04:13.469,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So what happened is, we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools,

74
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up,

75
0:04:23.915,000 --> 0:04:25,000
thousands of architects in 104 countries.

76
0:04:28.008,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So the bullet point -- sorry, I never do a suit,

77
0:04:31.473,000 --> 0:04:33,000
so I knew that I was going to take this off.

78
0:04:33.892,000 --> 0:04:35,000
OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.

79
0:04:38.203,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This isn't just about nonprofit.

80
0:04:40.25,000 --> 0:04:43,000
What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on,

81
0:04:43.448,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of socially responsible designers who really believe

82
0:04:46.046,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that this world has got a lot smaller, and that we have the opportunity --

83
0:04:49.982,000 --> 0:04:51,000
not the responsibility, but the opportunity --

84
0:04:52.162,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to really get involved in making change.

85
0:04:56.665,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

86
0:05:01.941,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

87
0:05:05.989,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'm adding that to my time.

88
0:05:07.812,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

89
0:05:10.637,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So what you don't know is,

90
0:05:12.6,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we've got these thousands of designers working around the world,

91
0:05:15.648,000 --> 0:05:18,000
connected basically by a website, and we have a staff of three.

92
0:05:19.504,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it, we did it.

93
0:05:23.942,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And so there's something to be said about naïveté.

94
0:05:26.314,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So seven years later, we've developed

95
0:05:28.235,000 --> 0:05:31,000
so that we've got advocacy, instigation and implementation.

96
0:05:31.673,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We advocate for good design, not only through student workshops

97
0:05:35.342,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and lectures and public forums, op-eds;

98
0:05:37.688,000 --> 0:05:39,000
we have a book on humanitarian work;

99
0:05:39.933,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy.

100
0:05:43.14,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We can talk about FEMA, but that's another talk.

101
0:05:47.036,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs,

102
0:05:50.42,000 --> 0:05:52,000
doing open-source design competitions.

103
0:05:53.272,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Referring, matchmaking with communities.

104
0:05:55.804,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And then implementing -- actually going out there and doing the work,

105
0:05:59.135,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built.

106
0:06:05.338,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So it's really important that if we're designing

107
0:06:08.103,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and trying to create change, we build that change.

108
0:06:10.801,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So here's a select number of projects.

109
0:06:14.464,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Kosovo.

110
0:06:16.67,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This is Kosovo in '99.

111
0:06:18.707,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We did an open design competition, like I said.

112
0:06:21.581,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It led to a whole variety of ideas.

113
0:06:23.999,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And this wasn't about emergency shelter,

114
0:06:25.941,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but transitional shelter that would last five to 10 years,

115
0:06:29.487,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in,

116
0:06:33.52,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and that they would rebuild their own home.

117
0:06:35.671,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community;

118
0:06:38.373,000 --> 0:06:41,000
this was giving them the tools and the space

119
0:06:41.519,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to.

120
0:06:46.287,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked.

121
0:06:49.231,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built; it works.

122
0:06:54.6,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This is a shipping container.

123
0:06:57.68,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Built and works.

124
0:06:59.364,000 --> 0:07:,000
And a whole variety of ideas

125
0:07:00.738,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that not only dealt with architectural building,

126
0:07:04.269,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but also the issues of governance,

127
0:07:05.967,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and the idea of creating communities through complex networks.

128
0:07:09.402,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So we've engaged not just designers,

129
0:07:11.248,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but also a whole variety of technology-based professionals.

130
0:07:16.797,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes.

131
0:07:20.428,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Using straw bale construction, creating heat walls.

132
0:07:26.734,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And then something remarkable happened in '99.

133
0:07:28.926,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue.

134
0:07:33.048,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing;

135
0:07:35.859,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.

136
0:07:38.97,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And it wasn't doctors telling us this;

137
0:07:40.847,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it was actual villagers that we were staying with.

138
0:07:43.871,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And so we came up with the bright idea

139
0:07:46.507,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that instead of getting people to walk 10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,

140
0:07:50.726,000 --> 0:07:51,000
you get the doctors to the people.

141
0:07:52.589,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And we started engaging the medical community,

142
0:07:55.481,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and you know, we thought we were real bright sparks --

143
0:07:58.608,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"We've come up with this great idea:

144
0:08:00.378,000 --> 0:08:04,000
mobile health clinics, widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa."

145
0:08:05.349,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And the medical community there said,

146
0:08:07.817,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"We've said this for the last decade.

147
0:08:10.307,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We know this. We just don't know how to show this."

148
0:08:13.409,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions.

149
0:08:19.177,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And so again, we had a whole variety of ideas that came in.

150
0:08:24.173,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This one I personally love,

151
0:08:26.04,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions,

152
0:08:29.365,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but about raising awareness.

153
0:08:31.068,000 --> 0:08:33,000
This is a kenaf clinic.

154
0:08:33.506,000 --> 0:08:36,000
You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land,

155
0:08:36.6,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and it grows 14 feet in a month.

156
0:08:40.293,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area,

157
0:08:43.469,000 --> 0:08:45,000
put a tensile structure on the top,

158
0:08:45.572,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and when the doctors have finished treating

159
0:08:48.268,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and seeing patients and villagers,

160
0:08:52.013,000 --> 0:08:53,000
you cut down the clinic and you eat it.

161
0:08:53.909,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It's an eat-your-own-clinic.

162
0:08:55.6,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS,

163
0:08:58.978,000 --> 0:08:59,000
you also need to have nutrition rates,

164
0:09:00.946,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and the idea of nutrition is as important

165
0:09:03.826,000 --> 0:09:04,000
as getting antiretrovirals out there.

166
0:09:05.684,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So you know, this is a serious solution.

167
0:09:09.043,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This one I love.

168
0:09:10.223,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The idea is it's not just a clinic, it's a community center.

169
0:09:13.072,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This looked at setting up trade routes

170
0:09:15.119,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and economic engines within the community,

171
0:09:17.208,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so it can be a self-sustaining project.

172
0:09:19.446,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Every one of these projects is sustainable.

173
0:09:22.176,000 --> 0:09:25,000
That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person.

174
0:09:25.504,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's because when you live on four dollars a day,

175
0:09:27.852,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable.

176
0:09:31.227,000 --> 0:09:33,000
You have to know where your energy is coming from,

177
0:09:33.601,000 --> 0:09:35,000
you have to know where your resource is coming from,

178
0:09:36.077,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and you have to keep the maintenance down.

179
0:09:38.115,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So this is about getting an economic engine,

180
0:09:40.227,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and then at night, it turns into a movie theater.

181
0:09:42.544,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center.

182
0:09:47.695,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So you can see ideas.

183
0:09:49.909,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And these ideas developed into prototypes,

184
0:09:52.6,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and they were eventually built.

185
0:09:54.415,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And currently, as of this year,

186
0:09:55.946,000 --> 0:09:59,000
there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya.

187
0:10:01.976,000 --> 0:10:04,000
From that, we also developed Siyathemba.

188
0:10:05.563,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The community came to us and said,

189
0:10:07.248,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"The problem is that the girls don't have education."

190
0:10:10.295,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And we're working in an area

191
0:10:11.669,000 --> 0:10:13,000
where young women between the ages of 16 and 24

192
0:10:13.922,000 --> 0:10:15,000
have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.

193
0:10:17.317,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And that's not because they're promiscuous,

194
0:10:20.103,000 --> 0:10:21,000
it's because there's no knowledge.

195
0:10:21.777,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And so we decided to look at the idea of sports,

196
0:10:24.8,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and create a youth sports center

197
0:10:26.666,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that doubled as an HIV/AIDS outreach center,

198
0:10:29.488,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors.

199
0:10:33.345,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care.

200
0:10:40.514,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And we picked nine finalists,

201
0:10:42.983,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region,

202
0:10:46.816,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and then the community picked their design.

203
0:10:48.967,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They said, this is our design,

204
0:10:50.919,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because it's not only about engaging a community;

205
0:10:53.243,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it's about empowering a community,

206
0:10:54.961,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process.

207
0:10:59.738,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, the winning design is here.

208
0:11:03.6,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And then, of course, we actually go and work

209
0:11:05.687,000 --> 0:11:06,000
with the community and the clients.

210
0:11:07.394,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So this is the designer.

211
0:11:08.616,000 --> 0:11:1,000
He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team

212
0:11:11.593,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.

213
0:11:14.871,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And they can tell it better.

214
0:11:18.014,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(A cappella singing in a South African language)

215
0:11:39.505,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.

216
0:11:41.514,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I work at the Africa Centre, I'm an IT user consultant.

217
0:11:44.484,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I'm also the national football player for South Africa, Banyana Banyana.

218
0:11:48.992,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa,

219
0:11:55.751,000 --> 0:11:57,000
which has now changed to Siyathemba.

220
0:11:59.061,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is our home ground.

221
0:12:01.712,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time.

222
0:12:05.475,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I can see Chris looking at me slyly.

223
0:12:07.82,000 --> 0:12:09,000
This was a connection, just a meeting with somebody

224
0:12:10.781,000 --> 0:12:14,000
who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center, in Tanzania.

225
0:12:15.553,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And we met, literally, a couple of months ago.

226
0:12:17.815,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We've already developed a design.

227
0:12:19.426,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The team is over there, working in partnership.

228
0:12:21.657,000 --> 0:12:24,000
This was a matchmaking, thanks to a couple of TEDsters --

229
0:12:24.965,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Sun [Microsystems], Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,

230
0:12:28.539,000 --> 0:12:3,000
who connected me with this amazing African woman.

231
0:12:30.922,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.

232
0:12:34.466,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.

233
0:12:37.537,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development,

234
0:12:41.587,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and we've been involved in a lot of issues,

235
0:12:43.65,000 --> 0:12:49,000
such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina.

236
0:12:49.861,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled.

237
0:12:57.904,000 --> 0:13:01,000
This is a community-designed community center.

238
0:13:02.904,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And what that means is we actually live and work with the community,

239
0:13:06.824,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and they're part of the design process.

240
0:13:11.296,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The kids actually get involved in mapping out

241
0:13:13.858,000 --> 0:13:15,000
where the community center should be.

242
0:13:16.932,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And then eventually, the community, through skills training,

243
0:13:20.423,000 --> 0:13:22,000
end up building the building with us.

244
0:13:22.984,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Here is another school.

245
0:13:25.096,000 --> 0:13:29,000
This is what the UN gave these guys for six months -- 12 plastic tarps.

246
0:13:30.136,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This was in August.

247
0:13:31.415,000 --> 0:13:34,000
This was the replacement; that's supposed to last for two years.

248
0:13:34.463,000 --> 0:13:36,000
When the rain comes down, you can't hear a thing,

249
0:13:36.789,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and in the summer, it's about 140 degrees inside.

250
0:13:39.127,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water.

251
0:13:42.6,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system.

252
0:13:45.654,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Very low cost: three classrooms and rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.

253
0:13:52.18,000 --> 0:13:56,000
This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta.

254
0:13:57.311,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's built by the parents of the kids.

255
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The kids are out there on-site, building the buildings.

256
0:14:01.911,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And it opened a couple of weeks ago,

257
0:14:03.696,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.

258
0:14:06.299,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

259
0:14:13.127,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So, disaster hits home.

260
0:14:16.09,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that,

261
0:14:20.843,000 --> 0:14:21,000
but we don't see the good stories.

262
0:14:22.651,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Here is a community that got together, and they said "no" to waiting.

263
0:14:26.794,000 --> 0:14:29,000
They formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players,

264
0:14:30.064,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to actually map out East Biloxi,

265
0:14:32.199,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to figure out who's getting involved.

266
0:14:34.087,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We've had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding, rehabbing homes.

267
0:14:38.6,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Figuring out what FEMA regulations are,

268
0:14:40.809,000 --> 0:14:43,000
not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild.

269
0:14:44.658,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Working with residents,

270
0:14:45.921,000 --> 0:14:48,000
getting them out of their homes, so they don't get ill.

271
0:14:49.36,000 --> 0:14:51,000
This is what they're cleaning up on their own.

272
0:14:52.983,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Designing housing.

273
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
This house is going in in a couple of weeks.

274
0:14:56.301,000 --> 0:14:58,000
This is a rehabbed home, done in four days.

275
0:14:59.433,000 --> 0:15:03,000
This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker.

276
0:15:03.6,000 --> 0:15:05,000
She's 70 years old. This is what FEMA gave her.

277
0:15:07.026,000 --> 0:15:09,000
600 bucks, happened two days ago.

278
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We put together, very quickly, a washroom.

279
0:15:12.88,000 --> 0:15:14,000
It's built, it's running and she just started a business today,

280
0:15:15.897,000 --> 0:15:17,000
where she's washing other people's clothes.

281
0:15:17.944,000 --> 0:15:2,000
These are the Calhouns.

282
0:15:21.6,000 --> 0:15:24,000
They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.

283
0:15:25.941,000 --> 0:15:27,000
That was their home, and these are the photographs they took.

284
0:15:28.89,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And we're helping, working with them to create a new building.

285
0:15:32.533,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Projects we've done.

286
0:15:34.183,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Projects we've been a part of, support.

287
0:15:36.98,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Why don't aid agencies do this?

288
0:15:40.716,000 --> 0:15:41,000
This is the UN tent.

289
0:15:43.406,000 --> 0:15:45,000
This is the new UN tent, just introduced this year.

290
0:15:46.351,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Quick to assemble.

291
0:15:47.854,000 --> 0:15:49,000
It's got a flap -- that's the invention.

292
0:15:51.426,000 --> 0:15:55,000
It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field.

293
0:15:55.844,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I was 12 years old.

294
0:15:58.768,000 --> 0:15:59,000
There's a problem here.

295
0:16:01.728,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Luckily, we're not alone.

296
0:16:03.712,000 --> 0:16:05,000
There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

297
0:16:06.6,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors

298
0:16:10.6,000 --> 0:16:13,000
around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work.

299
0:16:16.234,000 --> 0:16:19,000
More hemp houses -- it's a theme in Japan, apparently.

300
0:16:19.298,000 --> 0:16:2,000
I'm not sure what they're smoking.

301
0:16:20.957,000 --> 0:16:21,000
(Laughter)

302
0:16:24.671,000 --> 0:16:26,000
This is a Grip Clip, designed by somebody who said,

303
0:16:27.402,000 --> 0:16:3,000
"All you need is some way to attach membrane structures

304
0:16:30.433,000 --> 0:16:33,000
to physical support beams."

305
0:16:35.942,000 --> 0:16:39,000
This guy designed for NASA, is now doing housing.

306
0:16:41.314,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I'm going to whip through this quickly,

307
0:16:43.243,000 --> 0:16:45,000
because I know I've got only a couple of minutes.

308
0:16:47.165,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So this is all done in the last two years.

309
0:16:49.334,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I showed you something that took 20 years to do.

310
0:16:51.985,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And this is just a selection of things

311
0:16:54.094,000 --> 0:16:56,000
that were built in the last couple of years.

312
0:16:57.217,000 --> 0:16:58,000
From Brazil to India,

313
0:17:00.167,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Mexico,

314
0:17:02.42,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Alabama,

315
0:17:06.326,000 --> 0:17:07,000
China,

316
0:17:08.825,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Israel,

317
0:17:10.003,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Palestine,

318
0:17:11.823,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Vietnam.

319
0:17:13.306,000 --> 0:17:17,000
The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is 32 --

320
0:17:17.481,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that's how old I am.

321
0:17:18.776,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So it's a young --

322
0:17:21.949,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I just have to stop here, because Arup is in the room,

323
0:17:24.621,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and this is the best-designed toilet in the world.

324
0:17:27.002,000 --> 0:17:3,000
If you're ever, ever in India, go use this toilet.

325
0:17:30.073,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Laughter)

326
0:17:31.167,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Chris Luebkeman will tell you why.

327
0:17:33.6,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party.

328
0:17:41.548,000 --> 0:17:44,000
But the future is not going to be the sky-scraping cities of New York,

329
0:17:44.882,000 --> 0:17:45,000
but this.

330
0:17:46.057,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And when you look at this, you see crisis.

331
0:17:48.167,000 --> 0:17:5,000
What I see is many, many inventors.

332
0:17:51.469,000 --> 0:17:53,000
One billion people live in abject poverty.

333
0:17:53.628,000 --> 0:17:54,000
We hear about them all the time.

334
0:17:55.296,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Four billion live in growing but fragile economies.

335
0:17:59.68,000 --> 0:18:01,000
One in seven live in unplanned settlements.

336
0:18:02.462,000 --> 0:18:05,000
If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen,

337
0:18:05.636,000 --> 0:18:08,000
in 20 years, one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement

338
0:18:09.215,000 --> 0:18:1,000
or a refugee camp.

339
0:18:10.502,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Look left, look right: one of you will be there.

340
0:18:14.08,000 --> 0:18:17,000
How do we improve the living standards of five billion people?

341
0:18:17.866,000 --> 0:18:18,000
With 10 million solutions.

342
0:18:20.176,000 --> 0:18:21,000
So I wish to develop a community

343
0:18:21.903,000 --> 0:18:24,000
that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design

344
0:18:25.5,000 --> 0:18:27,000
to improve the living conditions for everyone.

345
0:18:28.497,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Chris Anderson: Wait a sec -- that's your wish?

346
0:18:30.839,000 --> 0:18:31,000
CS: That's my wish.

347
0:18:32.014,000 --> 0:18:33,000
CA: That's his wish!

348
0:18:33.189,000 --> 0:18:39,000
(Applause)

349
0:18:46.303,000 --> 0:18:49,000
CS: We started Architecture for Humanity with 700 dollars and a website.

350
0:18:50.707,000 --> 0:18:53,000
So Chris somehow decided to give me 100,000.

351
0:18:54.783,000 --> 0:18:55,000
So why not this many people?

352
0:18:57.983,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Open-source architecture is the way to go.

353
0:19:00.452,000 --> 0:19:03,000
You have a diverse community of participants --

354
0:19:03.563,000 --> 0:19:05,000
and we're not just talking about inventors and designers,

355
0:19:06.46,000 --> 0:19:08,000
but we're talking about the funding model.

356
0:19:08.603,000 --> 0:19:09,000
My role is not as a designer;

357
0:19:10.405,000 --> 0:19:13,000
it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world.

358
0:19:13.914,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And what we need is something that replicates me globally,

359
0:19:18.692,000 --> 0:19:2,000
because I haven't slept in seven years.

360
0:19:21.06,000 --> 0:19:23,000
(Laughter)

361
0:19:23.6,000 --> 0:19:25,000
Secondly, what will this thing be?

362
0:19:26.453,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis,

363
0:19:30.357,000 --> 0:19:32,000
but they don't want some company in the West

364
0:19:33.332,000 --> 0:19:35,000
taking their idea and basically profiting from it.

365
0:19:36.007,000 --> 0:19:4,000
So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license.

366
0:19:40.18,000 --> 0:19:42,000
And what that means is that a designer can --

367
0:19:42.594,000 --> 0:19:43,000
The Siyathemba project I showed

368
0:19:44.451,000 --> 0:19:47,000
was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it.

369
0:19:48.443,000 --> 0:19:53,000
As soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation

370
0:19:53.6,000 --> 0:19:56,000
can take the construction documents and replicate it for free.

371
0:19:58.657,000 --> 0:20:02,000
(Applause)

372
0:20:03.233,000 --> 0:20:05,000
So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this,

373
0:20:06.176,000 --> 0:20:08,000
but still protect their rights here?

374
0:20:08.478,000 --> 0:20:12,000
We want to have a community where you can upload ideas,

375
0:20:12.507,000 --> 0:20:16,000
and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake, in flood,

376
0:20:16.731,000 --> 0:20:18,000
in all sorts of austere environments.

377
0:20:19.075,000 --> 0:20:2,000
The reason that's important

378
0:20:20.836,000 --> 0:20:22,000
is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina

379
0:20:22.917,000 --> 0:20:23,000
to find out if my house works.

380
0:20:25.672,000 --> 0:20:27,000
That's too late, we need to do it now.

381
0:20:28.172,000 --> 0:20:29,000
So doing that globally --

382
0:20:29.53,000 --> 0:20:34,000
and I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually.

383
0:20:35.044,000 --> 0:20:39,000
When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy.

384
0:20:39.151,000 --> 0:20:41,000
I don't see that; I see the face of the world.

385
0:20:41.89,000 --> 0:20:43,000
So I want everyone from all over the planet

386
0:20:43.974,000 --> 0:20:46,000
to be able to be a part of this design and development.

387
0:20:47.942,000 --> 0:20:49,000
The idea of needs-based competitions --

388
0:20:50.015,000 --> 0:20:53,000
XPRIZE for the other 98 percent, if you want to call it that.

389
0:20:54.749,000 --> 0:20:56,000
We also want to look at ways of matchmaking

390
0:20:57.067,000 --> 0:20:59,000
and putting funding partners together,

391
0:20:59.208,000 --> 0:21:01,000
and the idea of integrating manufacturers --

392
0:21:01.574,000 --> 0:21:02,000
fab labs in every country.

393
0:21:03.193,000 --> 0:21:06,000
When I hear about the $100 laptop and it's going to educate every child --

394
0:21:07.032,000 --> 0:21:09,000
educate every designer in the world.

395
0:21:09.057,000 --> 0:21:13,000
Put one in every favela, every slum settlement.

396
0:21:13.591,000 --> 0:21:15,000
Because you know what? Innovation will happen.

397
0:21:15.853,000 --> 0:21:17,000
And I need to know that. It's called the leap-back.

398
0:21:18.259,000 --> 0:21:2,000
We talk about leapfrog technologies.

399
0:21:20.413,000 --> 0:21:21,000
I write with Worldchanging,

400
0:21:21.818,000 --> 0:21:23,000
and the one thing we've been talking about is,

401
0:21:23.995,000 --> 0:21:25,000
I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here.

402
0:21:26.606,000 --> 0:21:29,000
So let's take those ideas, adapt them, and we can use them.

403
0:21:32.428,000 --> 0:21:35,000
These ideas are supposed to be adaptable;

404
0:21:35.873,000 --> 0:21:38,000
they should have the potential for evolution;

405
0:21:39.634,000 --> 0:21:41,000
they should be developed by every nation in the world

406
0:21:42.154,000 --> 0:21:44,000
and useful for every nation in the world.

407
0:21:44.837,000 --> 0:21:45,000
What will it take?

408
0:21:46.43,000 --> 0:21:47,000
There should be a sheet.

409
0:21:47.628,000 --> 0:21:5,000
I don't have time to read this, because I'm going to be yanked off.

410
0:21:51.16,000 --> 0:21:53,000
CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec.

411
0:21:53.454,000 --> 0:21:55,000
CS: Well, what will it take? You guys are smart.

412
0:21:57.094,000 --> 0:21:59,000
So it's going to take a lot of computing power,

413
0:21:59.982,000 --> 0:22:02,000
because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world

414
0:22:03.105,000 --> 0:22:04,000
can plug into the system

415
0:22:04.5,000 --> 0:22:07,000
and be able to not only participate in developing these designs,

416
0:22:08.086,000 --> 0:22:09,000
but utilize the designs.

417
0:22:09.865,000 --> 0:22:12,000
Also, a process of reviewing the designs.

418
0:22:13.646,000 --> 0:22:16,000
I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure

419
0:22:17.082,000 --> 0:22:18,000
that we're doing stuff that's standing,

420
0:22:18.975,000 --> 0:22:2,000
because those guys are the best in the world.

421
0:22:21.14,000 --> 0:22:22,000
Plug.

422
0:22:22.909,000 --> 0:22:25,000
And so, you know, I want these --

423
0:22:26.49,000 --> 0:22:29,000
I just should note: I have two laptops and one of them is there,

424
0:22:30.268,000 --> 0:22:32,000
and that has 3000 designs on it.

425
0:22:32.775,000 --> 0:22:34,000
If I drop that laptop ...

426
0:22:35.752,000 --> 0:22:36,000
What happens?

427
0:22:37.226,000 --> 0:22:39,000
So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there,

428
0:22:40.218,000 --> 0:22:41,000
easy to use, easy to get ahold of.

429
0:22:46.044,000 --> 0:22:49,000
My mom once said, "There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers."

430
0:22:49.843,000 --> 0:22:5,000
(Laughter)

431
0:22:51.374,000 --> 0:22:54,000
I'm fed up of talking about making change.

432
0:22:54.549,000 --> 0:22:55,000
You only make it by doing it.

433
0:22:56.843,000 --> 0:22:59,000
We've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy;

434
0:23:00.447,000 --> 0:23:04,000
we've changed international response -- based on building things.

435
0:23:04.885,000 --> 0:23:08,000
So for me, it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation,

436
0:23:09.258,000 --> 0:23:1,000
and that it's free innovation.

437
0:23:10.926,000 --> 0:23:12,000
Think of free culture -- this is free innovation.

438
0:23:15.858,000 --> 0:23:17,000
Somebody said this a couple of years back.

439
0:23:20.138,000 --> 0:23:22,000
I will give points for those who know it.

440
0:23:22.299,000 --> 0:23:28,000
But I think the man was maybe 25 years too early.

441
0:23:28.584,000 --> 0:23:3,000
So let's do it.

442
0:23:30.833,000 --> 0:23:31,000
Thank you.

443
0:23:32.01,000 --> 0:23:35,000
(Applause)

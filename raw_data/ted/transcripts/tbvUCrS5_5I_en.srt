1
0:00:13.672,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Good evening, everyone.

2
0:00:16.204,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I am from Japan,

3
0:00:18.122,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so I'd like to start with a story about Japanese fishing villages.

4
0:00:24.671,000 --> 0:00:3,000
In the past, every fisherman was tempted to catch as many as fish as possible,

5
0:00:32.027,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but if everybody did that,

6
0:00:35.455,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the fish, common shared resource in the community, would disappear.

7
0:00:41.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The result would be hardship and poverty for everyone.

8
0:00:47.927,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This happened in some cases,

9
0:00:51.252,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but it did not happen in other cases.

10
0:00:56.694,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In these communities,

11
0:00:58.686,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the fishermen developed a kind of social contract

12
0:01:03.148,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that told each one of them to hold back a bit to prevent overfishing.

13
0:01:09.772,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The fisherman would keep an eye on each other.

14
0:01:13.896,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There would be a penalty if you were caught cheating.

15
0:01:18.965,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But once the benefit of a social contract became clear to everyone,

16
0:01:25.577,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the incentive to cheat dramatically dropped.

17
0:01:30.606,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We find the same story around the world.

18
0:01:34.361,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is how villagers in medieval Europe

19
0:01:38.436,000 --> 0:01:41,000
managed pasture and forests.

20
0:01:42.353,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This is how communities in Asia managed water,

21
0:01:46.954,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and this is how indigenous peoples in the Amazon managed wildlife.

22
0:01:53.858,000 --> 0:01:59,000
These communities realized they relied on a finite, shared resource.

23
0:02:01.318,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They developed rules and practices on how to manage those resources,

24
0:02:07.426,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and they changed their behavior

25
0:02:09.879,000 --> 0:02:15,000
so that they could continue to rely on those shared resources tomorrow

26
0:02:16.45,000 --> 0:02:18,000
by not overfishing,

27
0:02:19.021,000 --> 0:02:2,000
not overgrazing,

28
0:02:20.998,000 --> 0:02:24,000
not polluting or depleting water streams today.

29
0:02:26.572,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is a story of the commons,

30
0:02:29.628,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and also how to avoid the so-called tragedy of the commons.

31
0:02:37.462,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But this is also a story of an economy

32
0:02:40.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that was mainly local,

33
0:02:43.095,000 --> 0:02:47,000
where everybody had a very strong sense of belonging.

34
0:02:49.032,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Our economies are no longer local.

35
0:02:52.359,000 --> 0:02:55,000
When we moved away from being local,

36
0:02:55.732,000 --> 0:02:59,000
we started to lose our connection to the commons.

37
0:03:00.675,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We carried economic objectives, goals and systems beyond the local,

38
0:03:06.532,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but we did not carry the notion of taking care of the commons.

39
0:03:13.365,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So our oceans, forests,

40
0:03:17.38,000 --> 0:03:2,000
once very close to us as our local commons,

41
0:03:21.338,000 --> 0:03:23,000
moved very far away from us.

42
0:03:25.609,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So today, we pump millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the air,

43
0:03:33.098,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we dump plastics, fertilizers and industrial waste

44
0:03:38.407,000 --> 0:03:4,000
into the rivers and oceans,

45
0:03:40.914,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and we cut down forests that absorb CO2.

46
0:03:45.486,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We make the wild biodiversity much more fragile.

47
0:03:51.163,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We seem to have totally forgotten

48
0:03:53.863,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that there is such a thing as global commons:

49
0:03:58.489,000 --> 0:04:03,000
air, water, forests and biodiversity.

50
0:04:05.664,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, it is modern science

51
0:04:08.853,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that reminds us how vital the global commons are.

52
0:04:14.536,000 --> 0:04:18,000
In 2009, a group of scientists proposed

53
0:04:19.557,000 --> 0:04:22,000
how to assess the health of the global commons.

54
0:04:23.726,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They defined nine planetary boundaries vital to our survival,

55
0:04:29.822,000 --> 0:04:32,000
then they measured how far we could go

56
0:04:33.299,000 --> 0:04:37,000
before we cross over the tipping points or thresholds

57
0:04:37.903,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that would lead us to the irreversible or even catastrophic change.

58
0:04:45.716,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is where we were in the 1950s.

59
0:04:51.165,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We broadly remained within safe operating space,

60
0:04:56.031,000 --> 0:04:58,000
marked by the green line.

61
0:05:00.196,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But look at where we are now.

62
0:05:04.892,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We have crossed four of those boundaries,

63
0:05:09.194,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and we will be crossing others in the future.

64
0:05:13.279,000 --> 0:05:16,000
How did we end up in this situation?

65
0:05:17.957,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Well, my personal story may tell us something.

66
0:05:23.167,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Five years ago, I was appointed

67
0:05:25.341,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as CEO of the GEF, Global Environment Facility,

68
0:05:30.009,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but I am not a conservationist

69
0:05:33.772,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or an environmental activist.

70
0:05:37.171,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I am an economist,

71
0:05:39.212,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and for the last 30 years,

72
0:05:41.585,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I had worked for public finance in my home country and around the world.

73
0:05:48.616,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I can tell you one thing for sure:

74
0:05:51.474,000 --> 0:05:53,000
during these 30 years,

75
0:05:53.839,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the notion of the global commons never crossed my mind.

76
0:05:58.657,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I didn't have a single conversation about the global commons

77
0:06:02.746,000 --> 0:06:03,000
with my colleagues.

78
0:06:05.244,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This tells me that the notion of the global commons

79
0:06:09.142,000 --> 0:06:12,000
was not really entering into the big money decisions

80
0:06:13.098,000 --> 0:06:16,000
like state budgets or investment plans.

81
0:06:18.24,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I'm wondering, why do we have this sheer ignorance

82
0:06:21.938,000 --> 0:06:22,000
about the global commons,

83
0:06:23.882,000 --> 0:06:25,000
including me, myself?

84
0:06:27.835,000 --> 0:06:3,000
One possible explanation might be

85
0:06:31.7,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that until recently, it didn't really matter too much.

86
0:06:36.394,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Even if we mess up some part of the environment,

87
0:06:40.548,000 --> 0:06:45,000
we were not fundamentally changing the functions of the earth system.

88
0:06:47.072,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The global commons had still enough capacity

89
0:06:51.087,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to take the punches we gave them.

90
0:06:54.5,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In fact, the fish were still plentiful,

91
0:06:59.325,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the fields for grazing were still vast.

92
0:07:04.849,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Our mistake was to assume

93
0:07:07.421,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that the capacity of the earth for self-repair

94
0:07:10.644,000 --> 0:07:11,000
had no limits.

95
0:07:12.752,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It does have limits.

96
0:07:15.812,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The message from the science is very clear:

97
0:07:19.213,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we humans have become an overwhelming force

98
0:07:22.467,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to determine the future living conditions on earth,

99
0:07:26.658,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and what's more, we are running out of time.

100
0:07:30.589,000 --> 0:07:34,000
If we don't act on them,

101
0:07:34.68,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we will be losing the global commons.

102
0:07:37.062,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's only our generation who are able to preserve it --

103
0:07:40.744,000 --> 0:07:42,000
preserve the commons as we know them.

104
0:07:44.193,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now is the time we start managing the global commons

105
0:07:49.337,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as our parents or our grandparents managed their local commons.

106
0:07:56.851,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The first thing we need to do

107
0:07:59.322,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is to simply recognize that we do have the global commons

108
0:08:05.381,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and they are very, very important.

109
0:08:09.393,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Then we need to build the stewardship of the global commons

110
0:08:13.315,000 --> 0:08:15,000
into all of our thinking,

111
0:08:15.418,000 --> 0:08:17,000
our business, our economy,

112
0:08:17.561,000 --> 0:08:18,000
our policy-making --

113
0:08:19.101,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in all of our actions.

114
0:08:21.567,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We need to recreate the social contract of the fishing villages

115
0:08:27.015,000 --> 0:08:29,000
on the global scale.

116
0:08:31.539,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But what does it mean in practice?

117
0:08:34.875,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Where to start with?

118
0:08:37.375,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I see there are four key economic systems

119
0:08:41.454,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that fundamentally need to change.

120
0:08:44.396,000 --> 0:08:47,000
First, we need to change our cities.

121
0:08:48.298,000 --> 0:08:53,000
By 2050, two thirds of our population will live in cities.

122
0:08:54.298,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We need green cities.

123
0:08:57.092,000 --> 0:09:,000
Second, we need to change our energy system.

124
0:09:00.878,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The world economy must sharply decarbonize,

125
0:09:04.608,000 --> 0:09:06,000
essentially in one generation.

126
0:09:08.05,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Third, we need to change our production-consumption system.

127
0:09:13.376,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We need to break away from current take-make-waste consumption patterns.

128
0:09:20.686,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And finally, we need to change our food system,

129
0:09:25.548,000 --> 0:09:27,000
what to eat and how to produce it.

130
0:09:28.644,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And all of those four systems

131
0:09:31.51,000 --> 0:09:35,000
are putting enormous pressure on the global commons,

132
0:09:35.732,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and it's also very difficult to flip them.

133
0:09:38.84,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They are extremely complex,

134
0:09:40.942,000 --> 0:09:42,000
with many decision-makers, actors involved.

135
0:09:45.753,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Let's take the example of the food system.

136
0:09:50.556,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Food production is currently responsible

137
0:09:54.223,000 --> 0:09:57,000
for one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions.

138
0:09:58.19,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It is also a main user of the world's water resources.

139
0:10:02.775,000 --> 0:10:07,000
In fact, 70 percent of today's water is used to grow crops.

140
0:10:09.74,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Vast areas of tropical forest are used for agriculture.

141
0:10:15.055,000 --> 0:10:18,000
This deforestation drives extinction.

142
0:10:18.781,000 --> 0:10:22,000
In fact, we are losing species 1,000 times faster

143
0:10:23.765,000 --> 0:10:24,000
than the natural rate.

144
0:10:26.2,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And on top of all of that bad news,

145
0:10:29.947,000 --> 0:10:33,000
one third of food produced today globally

146
0:10:34.151,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is not eaten.

147
0:10:35.768,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's wasted.

148
0:10:39.449,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But there is the good news,

149
0:10:42.426,000 --> 0:10:43,000
good signs.

150
0:10:44.22,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Coalitions of stakeholders

151
0:10:47.604,000 --> 0:10:51,000
are now coming together to try to transform the food system

152
0:10:52.505,000 --> 0:10:54,000
with one shared goal:

153
0:10:54.914,000 --> 0:10:58,000
how to produce enough healthy food for everyone,

154
0:10:59.49,000 --> 0:11:,000
at the same time,

155
0:11:01.01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to try to cut, to sharply reduce,

156
0:11:04.154,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the footprint from the food system on the global commons.

157
0:11:10.983,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I had an opportunity

158
0:11:12.706,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to fly over the Indonesian island of Sumatra,

159
0:11:17.09,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and I saw with my own eyes

160
0:11:19.782,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the massive deforestation

161
0:11:21.963,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to make room for palm oil plantations.

162
0:11:27.178,000 --> 0:11:31,000
By the way, palm oil is included in thousands of food products

163
0:11:31.903,000 --> 0:11:32,000
we eat every day.

164
0:11:33.528,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The global demand for palm oil is just increasing.

165
0:11:38.168,000 --> 0:11:42,000
In Sumatra, I met smallholder farmers

166
0:11:42.328,000 --> 0:11:46,000
who need to make a day-to-day living from growing oil palm.

167
0:11:47.803,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I met global food companies,

168
0:11:50.676,000 --> 0:11:51,000
financial institutions

169
0:11:52.551,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and local government officials.

170
0:11:56.035,000 --> 0:12:01,000
All of them told me that they can't make the change by themselves,

171
0:12:01.87,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and only by working together under a kind of new contract,

172
0:12:07.363,000 --> 0:12:08,000
or a new practice,

173
0:12:08.95,000 --> 0:12:11,000
do they have a chance to protect tropical forests.

174
0:12:13.891,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So it's so encouraging to see, at least for the last few years,

175
0:12:18.959,000 --> 0:12:23,000
this new coalition among these committed actors along the supply chain

176
0:12:24.691,000 --> 0:12:28,000
come together to try to transform the food system.

177
0:12:29.392,000 --> 0:12:32,000
In fact, what they are trying to do

178
0:12:32.521,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is to create a new kind of social contract to manage the global commons.

179
0:12:41.697,000 --> 0:12:44,000
All changes start at home,

180
0:12:45.063,000 --> 0:12:47,000
at your place and at my place.

181
0:12:48.626,000 --> 0:12:51,000
At GEF, Global Environment Facility,

182
0:12:52.316,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we have now a new strategy,

183
0:12:54.777,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and we put the global commons at its center.

184
0:13:00.552,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I hope we won't be the only ones.

185
0:13:04.273,000 --> 0:13:09,000
If everybody stays on the sidelines, waiting for others to step in,

186
0:13:09.901,000 --> 0:13:12,000
the global commons will continue to deteriorate,

187
0:13:13.584,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and everybody will be much worse off.

188
0:13:18.388,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We need to save ourselves from the tragedy of the commons.

189
0:13:24.451,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So, I invite all of you to embrace the global commons.

190
0:13:30.801,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Please do remember that global commons do exist

191
0:13:34.665,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and are waiting for your stewardship.

192
0:13:38.609,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We all share one planet in common.

193
0:13:42.546,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We breathe the same air,

194
0:13:44.895,000 --> 0:13:45,000
we drink the same water,

195
0:13:46.911,000 --> 0:13:5,000
we depend on the same oceans, forests, and biodiversity.

196
0:13:52.974,000 --> 0:13:55,000
There is no space left on earth for egoism.

197
0:13:57.144,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The global commons must be kept within their safe operating space,

198
0:14:02.683,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and we can only do it together.

199
0:14:08.071,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Thank you so much.

200
0:14:09.341,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.882,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Just after Christmas last year,

2
0:00:15.482,000 --> 0:00:18,000
132 kids in California got the measles

3
0:00:19.32,000 --> 0:00:21,000
by either visiting Disneyland

4
0:00:21.333,000 --> 0:00:23,000
or being exposed to someone who'd been there.

5
0:00:24.282,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The virus then hopped the Canadian border,

6
0:00:27.486,000 --> 0:00:3,000
infecting more than 100 children in Quebec.

7
0:00:30.922,000 --> 0:00:32,000
One of the tragic things about this outbreak

8
0:00:33.871,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is that measles, which can be fatal to a child with a weakened immune system,

9
0:00:39.49,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.

10
0:00:43.275,000 --> 0:00:44,000
An effective vaccine against it

11
0:00:45.272,000 --> 0:00:48,000
has been available for more than half a century,

12
0:00:48.638,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but many of the kids involved in the Disneyland outbreak

13
0:00:51.912,000 --> 0:00:52,000
had not been vaccinated

14
0:00:53.886,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because their parents were afraid

15
0:00:56.138,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of something allegedly even worse:

16
0:00:59.157,000 --> 0:01:,000
autism.

17
0:01:00.875,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But wait -- wasn't the paper that sparked the controversy

18
0:01:04.658,000 --> 0:01:06,000
about autism and vaccines

19
0:01:06.981,000 --> 0:01:07,000
debunked, retracted,

20
0:01:08.978,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and branded a deliberate fraud

21
0:01:11.45,000 --> 0:01:12,000
by the British Medical Journal?

22
0:01:13.158,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Don't most science-savvy people

23
0:01:15.201,000 --> 0:01:19,000
know that the theory that vaccines cause autism is B.S.?

24
0:01:19.52,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I think most of you do,

25
0:01:21.377,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but millions of parents worldwide

26
0:01:23.955,000 --> 0:01:27,000
continue to fear that vaccines put their kids at risk for autism.

27
0:01:28.923,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Why?

28
0:01:30.827,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Here's why.

29
0:01:32.29,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is a graph of autism prevalence estimates rising over time.

30
0:01:37.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For most of the 20th century,

31
0:01:39.488,000 --> 0:01:42,000
autism was considered an incredibly rare condition.

32
0:01:43.18,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The few psychologists and pediatricians who'd even heard of it

33
0:01:46.5,000 --> 0:01:48,000
figured they would get through their entire careers

34
0:01:49.217,000 --> 0:01:51,000
without seeing a single case.

35
0:01:52.364,000 --> 0:01:55,000
For decades, the prevalence estimates remained stable

36
0:01:55.602,000 --> 0:01:58,000
at just three or four children in 10,000.

37
0:01:58.853,000 --> 0:02:,000
But then, in the 1990s,

38
0:02:00.919,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the numbers started to skyrocket.

39
0:02:03.38,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Fundraising organizations like Autism Speaks

40
0:02:06.608,000 --> 0:02:09,000
routinely refer to autism as an epidemic,

41
0:02:09.696,000 --> 0:02:12,000
as if you could catch it from another kid at Disneyland.

42
0:02:13.365,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So what's going on?

43
0:02:14.967,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If it isn't vaccines, what is it?

44
0:02:18.194,000 --> 0:02:21,000
If you ask the folks down at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta

45
0:02:22.165,000 --> 0:02:23,000
what's going on,

46
0:02:23.86,000 --> 0:02:27,000
they tend to rely on phrases like "broadened diagnostic criteria"

47
0:02:28.37,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and "better case finding"

48
0:02:30.134,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to explain these rising numbers.

49
0:02:32.711,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But that kind of language

50
0:02:34.731,000 --> 0:02:36,000
doesn't do much to allay the fears of a young mother

51
0:02:37.68,000 --> 0:02:41,000
who is searching her two-year-old's face for eye contact.

52
0:02:42.324,000 --> 0:02:44,000
If the diagnostic criteria had to be broadened,

53
0:02:45.319,000 --> 0:02:47,000
why were they so narrow in the first place?

54
0:02:48.152,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Why were cases of autism so hard to find

55
0:02:51.147,000 --> 0:02:53,000
before the 1990s?

56
0:02:53.437,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Five years ago, I decided to try to uncover the answers to these questions.

57
0:02:59.172,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I learned that what happened

58
0:03:01.216,000 --> 0:03:04,000
has less to do with the slow and cautious progress of science

59
0:03:05.116,000 --> 0:03:08,000
than it does with the seductive power of storytelling.

60
0:03:08.544,000 --> 0:03:1,000
For most of the 20th century,

61
0:03:10.75,000 --> 0:03:12,000
clinicians told one story

62
0:03:13.211,000 --> 0:03:16,000
about what autism is and how it was discovered,

63
0:03:16.763,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but that story turned out to be wrong,

64
0:03:19.573,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and the consequences of it

65
0:03:21.384,000 --> 0:03:24,000
are having a devastating impact on global public health.

66
0:03:25.285,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There was a second, more accurate story of autism

67
0:03:28.814,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which had been lost and forgotten

68
0:03:31.43,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in obscure corners of the clinical literature.

69
0:03:34.41,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This second story tells us everything about how we got here

70
0:03:38.427,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and where we need to go next.

71
0:03:41.352,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins Hospital

72
0:03:45.996,000 --> 0:03:46,000
named Leo Kanner.

73
0:03:47.946,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In 1943, Kanner published a paper

74
0:03:51.499,000 --> 0:03:55,000
describing 11 young patients who seemed to inhabit private worlds,

75
0:03:56.212,000 --> 0:03:58,000
ignoring the people around them,

76
0:03:58.302,000 --> 0:04:,000
even their own parents.

77
0:04:00.462,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They could amuse themselves for hours

78
0:04:02.737,000 --> 0:04:04,000
by flapping their hands in front of their faces,

79
0:04:05.384,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but they were panicked by little things

80
0:04:07.358,000 --> 0:04:1,000
like their favorite toy being moved from its usual place

81
0:04:10.97,000 --> 0:04:12,000
without their knowledge.

82
0:04:12.977,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Based on the patients who were brought to his clinic,

83
0:04:15.693,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Kanner speculated that autism is very rare.

84
0:04:19.269,000 --> 0:04:23,000
By the 1950s, as the world's leading authority on the subject,

85
0:04:23.727,000 --> 0:04:28,000
he declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome

86
0:04:29.3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
while fielding referrals from as far away as South Africa.

87
0:04:33.363,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That's actually not surprising,

88
0:04:35.754,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because Kanner's criteria for diagnosing autism

89
0:04:39.13,000 --> 0:04:41,000
were incredibly selective.

90
0:04:41.443,000 --> 0:04:46,000
For example, he discouraged giving the diagnosis to children who had seizures

91
0:04:46.621,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.

92
0:04:50.382,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He once bragged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids

93
0:04:53.424,000 --> 0:04:56,000
referred to his office as autistic by other clinicians

94
0:04:57.255,000 --> 0:04:59,000
without giving them an autism diagnosis.

95
0:05:00.503,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Kanner was a smart guy,

96
0:05:02.944,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but a number of his theories didn't pan out.

97
0:05:05.113,000 --> 0:05:08,000
He classified autism as a form of infantile psychosis

98
0:05:08.888,000 --> 0:05:11,000
caused by cold and unaffectionate parents.

99
0:05:12.858,000 --> 0:05:14,000
These children, he said,

100
0:05:14.995,000 --> 0:05:18,000
had been kept neatly in a refrigerator that didn't defrost.

101
0:05:19.313,000 --> 0:05:2,000
At the same time, however,

102
0:05:21.264,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Kanner noticed that some of his young patients

103
0:05:24.189,000 --> 0:05:27,000
had special abilities that clustered in certain areas

104
0:05:27.602,000 --> 0:05:3,000
like music, math and memory.

105
0:05:30.853,000 --> 0:05:31,000
One boy in his clinic

106
0:05:32.734,000 --> 0:05:36,000
could distinguish between 18 symphonies before he turned two.

107
0:05:37.796,000 --> 0:05:39,000
When his mother put on one of his favorite records,

108
0:05:40.443,000 --> 0:05:43,000
he would correctly declare, "Beethoven!"

109
0:05:43.809,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But Kanner took a dim view of these abilities,

110
0:05:46.665,000 --> 0:05:49,000
claiming that the kids were just regurgitating things

111
0:05:50.242,000 --> 0:05:52,000
they'd heard their pompous parents say,

112
0:05:52.865,000 --> 0:05:54,000
desperate to earn their approval.

113
0:05:55.465,000 --> 0:06:,000
As a result, autism became a source of shame and stigma for families,

114
0:06:00.829,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and two generations of autistic children

115
0:06:03.406,000 --> 0:06:06,000
were shipped off to institutions for their own good,

116
0:06:06.889,000 --> 0:06:09,000
becoming invisible to the world at large.

117
0:06:10.163,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s

118
0:06:14.4,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that researchers began to test Kanner's theory that autism was rare.

119
0:06:19.567,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Lorna Wing was a cognitive psychologist in London

120
0:06:23.305,000 --> 0:06:26,000
who thought that Kanner's theory of refrigerator parenting

121
0:06:26.509,000 --> 0:06:29,000
were "bloody stupid," as she told me.

122
0:06:29.528,000 --> 0:06:33,000
She and her husband John were warm and affectionate people,

123
0:06:33.707,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and they had a profoundly autistic daughter named Susie.

124
0:06:37.11,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Lorna and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Susie

125
0:06:41.822,000 --> 0:06:42,000
without support services,

126
0:06:43.784,000 --> 0:06:44,000
special education,

127
0:06:45.386,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagnosis.

128
0:06:49.635,000 --> 0:06:51,000
To make the case to the National Health Service

129
0:06:52.259,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that more resources were needed for autistic children and their families,

130
0:06:57.507,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Lorna and her colleague Judith Gould

131
0:06:59.643,000 --> 0:07:03,000
decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier.

132
0:07:04.193,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They undertook a study of autism prevalence in the general population.

133
0:07:09.139,000 --> 0:07:13,000
They pounded the pavement in a London suburb called Camberwell

134
0:07:13.435,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to try to find autistic children in the community.

135
0:07:17.1,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What they saw made clear that Kanner's model was way too narrow,

136
0:07:21.767,000 --> 0:07:25,000
while the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.

137
0:07:26.663,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Some kids couldn't talk at all,

138
0:07:28.806,000 --> 0:07:32,000
while others waxed on at length about their fascination with astrophysics,

139
0:07:33.542,000 --> 0:07:36,000
dinosaurs or the genealogy of royalty.

140
0:07:37.486,000 --> 0:07:41,000
In other words, these children didn't fit into nice, neat boxes,

141
0:07:42.176,000 --> 0:07:43,000
as Judith put it,

142
0:07:43.871,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they saw lots of them,

143
0:07:45.752,000 --> 0:07:48,000
way more than Kanner's monolithic model would have predicted.

144
0:07:49.537,000 --> 0:07:52,000
At first, they were at a loss to make sense of their data.

145
0:07:53.252,000 --> 0:07:56,000
How had no one noticed these children before?

146
0:07:56.38,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But then Lorna came upon a reference to a paper that had been published

147
0:07:59.899,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in German in 1944,

148
0:08:02.554,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the year after Kanner's paper,

149
0:08:04.899,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and then forgotten,

150
0:08:06.617,000 --> 0:08:08,000
buried with the ashes of a terrible time

151
0:08:09.194,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that no one wanted to remember or think about.

152
0:08:12.445,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Kanner knew about this competing paper,

153
0:08:15.115,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but scrupulously avoided mentioning it in his own work.

154
0:08:19.86,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It had never even been translated into English,

155
0:08:22.322,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but luckily, Lorna's husband spoke German,

156
0:08:25.285,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and he translated it for her.

157
0:08:27.932,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The paper offered an alternate story of autism.

158
0:08:31.624,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Its author was a man named Hans Asperger,

159
0:08:34.317,000 --> 0:08:37,000
who ran a combination clinic and residential school

160
0:08:37.591,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in Vienna in the 1930s.

161
0:08:40.331,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences

162
0:08:44.302,000 --> 0:08:47,000
were progressive even by contemporary standards.

163
0:08:47.436,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music,

164
0:08:51.848,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons.

165
0:08:55.354,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Instead of blaming parents for causing autism,

166
0:08:58.349,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Asperger framed it as a lifelong, polygenetic disability

167
0:09:03.202,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that requires compassionate forms of support and accommodations

168
0:09:07.103,000 --> 0:09:1,000
over the course of one's whole life.

169
0:09:10.51,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Rather than treating the kids in his clinic like patients,

170
0:09:13.395,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Asperger called them his little professors,

171
0:09:16.46,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and enlisted their help in developing methods of education

172
0:09:20.245,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that were particularly suited to them.

173
0:09:22.729,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Crucially, Asperger viewed autism as a diverse continuum

174
0:09:28.46,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that spans an astonishing range of giftedness and disability.

175
0:09:33.584,000 --> 0:09:36,000
He believed that autism and autistic traits are common

176
0:09:37.116,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and always have been,

177
0:09:38.982,000 --> 0:09:43,000
seeing aspects of this continuum in familiar archetypes from pop culture

178
0:09:44.276,000 --> 0:09:46,000
like the socially awkward scientist

179
0:09:46.612,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and the absent-minded professor.

180
0:09:49.306,000 --> 0:09:51,000
He went so far as to say,

181
0:09:51.419,000 --> 0:09:54,000
it seems that for success in science and art,

182
0:09:54.646,000 --> 0:09:56,000
a dash of autism is essential.

183
0:09:58.292,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Lorna and Judith realized that Kanner had been as wrong about autism being rare

184
0:10:03.214,000 --> 0:10:05,000
as he had been about parents causing it.

185
0:10:05.907,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Over the next several years,

186
0:10:07.951,000 --> 0:10:1,000
they quietly worked with the American Psychiatric Association

187
0:10:11.364,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to broaden the criteria for diagnosis

188
0:10:13.964,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to reflect the diversity of what they called "the autism spectrum."

189
0:10:17.981,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In the late '80s and early 1990s,

190
0:10:20.559,000 --> 0:10:22,000
their changes went into effect,

191
0:10:22.857,000 --> 0:10:24,000
swapping out Kanner's narrow model

192
0:10:25.226,000 --> 0:10:28,000
for Asperger's broad and inclusive one.

193
0:10:28.801,000 --> 0:10:3,000
These changes weren't happening in a vacuum.

194
0:10:31.472,000 --> 0:10:34,000
By coincidence, as Lorna and Judith worked behind the scenes

195
0:10:35.326,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to reform the criteria,

196
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
people all over the world were seeing an autistic adult for the first time.

197
0:10:42.176,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Before "Rain Man" came out in 1988,

198
0:10:45.55,000 --> 0:10:49,000
only a tiny, ingrown circle of experts knew what autism looked like,

199
0:10:50.209,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but after Dustin Hoffman's unforgettable performance as Raymond Babbitt

200
0:10:54.969,000 --> 0:10:57,000
earned "Rain Man" four Academy Awards,

201
0:10:58.104,000 --> 0:11:,000
pediatricians, psychologists,

202
0:11:00.844,000 --> 0:11:04,000
teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like.

203
0:11:05.534,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Coincidentally, at the same time,

204
0:11:08.459,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the first easy-to-use clinical tests for diagnosing autism were introduced.

205
0:11:13.939,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts

206
0:11:18.629,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to get your child evaluated.

207
0:11:21.207,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The combination of "Rain Man,"

208
0:11:23.32,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the changes to the criteria, and the introduction of these tests

209
0:11:27.499,000 --> 0:11:29,000
created a network effect,

210
0:11:29.774,000 --> 0:11:32,000
a perfect storm of autism awareness.

211
0:11:33.304,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The number of diagnoses started to soar,

212
0:11:36.322,000 --> 0:11:41,000
just as Lorna and Judith predicted, indeed hoped, that it would,

213
0:11:41.99,000 --> 0:11:43,000
enabling autistic people and their families

214
0:11:44.106,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to finally get the support and services they deserved.

215
0:11:47.798,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Then Andrew Wakefield came along

216
0:11:49.864,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to blame the spike in diagnoses on vaccines,

217
0:11:53.719,000 --> 0:11:55,000
a simple, powerful,

218
0:11:55.832,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and seductively believable story

219
0:11:58.618,000 --> 0:12:,000
that was as wrong as Kanner's theory

220
0:12:00.986,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that autism was rare.

221
0:12:03.239,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If the CDC's current estimate,

222
0:12:06.71,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that one in 68 kids in America are on the spectrum, is correct,

223
0:12:11.133,000 --> 0:12:15,000
autistics are one of the largest minority groups in the world.

224
0:12:15.34,000 --> 0:12:18,000
In recent years, autistic people have come together on the Internet

225
0:12:19.167,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to reject the notion that they are puzzles to be solved

226
0:12:22.812,000 --> 0:12:24,000
by the next medical breakthrough,

227
0:12:24.995,000 --> 0:12:26,000
coining the term "neurodiversity"

228
0:12:27.456,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.

229
0:12:31.264,000 --> 0:12:33,000
One way to understand neurodiversity

230
0:12:33.655,000 --> 0:12:36,000
is to think in terms of human operating systems.

231
0:12:37.324,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Just because a P.C. is not running Windows doesn't mean that it's broken.

232
0:12:42.24,000 --> 0:12:45,000
By autistic standards, the normal human brain

233
0:12:45.869,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is easily distractable,

234
0:12:47.889,000 --> 0:12:48,000
obsessively social,

235
0:12:49.677,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.

236
0:12:52.997,000 --> 0:12:54,000
To be sure, autistic people have a hard time

237
0:12:55.992,000 --> 0:12:57,000
living in a world not built for them.

238
0:12:58.268,000 --> 0:13:02,000
[Seventy] years later, we're still catching up to Asperger,

239
0:13:02.52,000 --> 0:13:06,000
who believed that the "cure" for the most disabling aspects of autism

240
0:13:06.603,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is to be found in understanding teachers,

241
0:13:09.529,000 --> 0:13:11,000
accommodating employers,

242
0:13:11.665,000 --> 0:13:12,000
supportive communities,

243
0:13:13.522,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and parents who have faith in their children's potential.

244
0:13:16.866,000 --> 0:13:19,000
An autistic [man] named Zosia Zaks once said,

245
0:13:19.908,000 --> 0:13:24,000
"We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity."

246
0:13:25.211,000 --> 0:13:27,000
As we sail into an uncertain future,

247
0:13:27.764,000 --> 0:13:3,000
we need every form of human intelligence on the planet

248
0:13:31.502,000 --> 0:13:36,000
working together to tackle the challenges that we face as a society.

249
0:13:37.469,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We can't afford to waste a brain.

250
0:13:39.791,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Thank you.

251
0:13:42.136,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

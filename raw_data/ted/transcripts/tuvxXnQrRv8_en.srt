1
0:00:16.421,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Oh, there's a lot of it.

2
0:00:18.532,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is seaweed.

3
0:00:25.789,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's pretty humble stuff.

4
0:00:27.979,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But it does have some remarkable qualities.

5
0:00:31.328,000 --> 0:00:33,000
For one, it grows really fast.

6
0:00:34.529,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So the carbon that is part of that seaweed,

7
0:00:38.474,000 --> 0:00:39,000
just a few weeks ago,

8
0:00:40.015,000 --> 0:00:43,000
was floating in the atmosphere as atmospheric CO2,

9
0:00:43.601,000 --> 0:00:46,000
driving all the adverse consequences of climate change.

10
0:00:48.244,000 --> 0:00:51,000
For the moment, it's locked safely away in the seaweed,

11
0:00:51.885,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but when that seaweed rots --

12
0:00:53.327,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and by the smell of it, it's not far away --

13
0:00:56.465,000 --> 0:01:,000
when it rots, that CO2 will be released back to the atmosphere.

14
0:01:01.482,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could find a way

15
0:01:05.417,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of keeping that CO2 locked up long-term,

16
0:01:09.339,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and thereby significantly contributing to solving the climate problem?

17
0:01:15.684,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What I'm talking about here is drawdown.

18
0:01:18.803,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It's now become the other half of the climate challenge.

19
0:01:22.157,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And that's because we have delayed so long,

20
0:01:26.133,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in terms of addressing climate change,

21
0:01:28.03,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that we now have to do two very big and very difficult things at once.

22
0:01:33.061,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We have to cut our emissions and clean our energy supply

23
0:01:36.505,000 --> 0:01:39,000
at the same time that we draw significant volumes

24
0:01:39.878,000 --> 0:01:41,000
of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

25
0:01:42.649,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If we don't do that, about 25 percent of the CO2 we put in the air

26
0:01:47.363,000 --> 0:01:5,000
will remain there, by human standards, forever.

27
0:01:50.919,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So we have to act.

28
0:01:54.419,000 --> 0:01:57,000
This is really a new phase in addressing the climate crisis

29
0:01:57.927,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and it demands new thinking.

30
0:02:00.221,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, ideas like carbon offsets really don't make sense

31
0:02:04.475,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in the modern era.

32
0:02:05.665,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You know, when you offset something,

33
0:02:07.459,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you say, "I'll permit myself to put some greenhouse gas into the atmosphere,

34
0:02:11.19,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but then I'll offset it by drawing it down."

35
0:02:13.492,000 --> 0:02:15,000
When you've got to both cut your emissions

36
0:02:15.793,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and draw down CO2,

37
0:02:17.436,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that thinking doesn't make sense anymore.

38
0:02:19.982,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And when we're talking about drawdown,

39
0:02:21.887,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we're talking about putting large volumes of greenhouses gases, particularly CO2,

40
0:02:26.8,000 --> 0:02:27,000
out of circulation.

41
0:02:28.609,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And to do that, we need a carbon price.

42
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We need a significant price that we'll pay for that service

43
0:02:34.966,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that we'll all benefit from.

44
0:02:38.27,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We've made almost no progress so far

45
0:02:40.508,000 --> 0:02:42,000
with the second half of the climate challenge.

46
0:02:42.715,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's not on most people's radar.

47
0:02:45.722,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And, you know, I must say, at times, I hear people saying,

48
0:02:50.084,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"I've lost hope that we can do anything about the climate crisis."

49
0:02:53.863,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And look, I've had my sleepless nights too, I can tell you.

50
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But I'm here today as an ambassador for this humble weed, seaweed.

51
0:03:02.972,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I think it has the potential

52
0:03:06.599,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to be a big part of addressing the challenge of climate change

53
0:03:11.669,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and a big part of our future.

54
0:03:14.256,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, what the scientists are telling us we need to do over the next 80-odd years

55
0:03:18.51,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to the end of this century,

56
0:03:20.058,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is to cut our greenhouse gas emissions

57
0:03:22.715,000 --> 0:03:25,000
by three percent every year,

58
0:03:25.858,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and draw three gigatons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year.

59
0:03:30.366,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Those numbers are so large that they baffle us.

60
0:03:33.958,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But that's what the scientists tell us we need to do.

61
0:03:37.157,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I really hate showing this graph,

62
0:03:39.188,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but I'm sorry, I have to do it.

63
0:03:41.363,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It is very eloquent in terms of telling the story

64
0:03:44.34,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of my personal failure

65
0:03:46.165,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in terms of all the advocacy I've done in climate change work

66
0:03:49.395,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and in fact, our collective failure to address climate change.

67
0:03:52.958,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You can see our trajectory there

68
0:03:55.282,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in terms of warming and greenhouse gas concentrations.

69
0:03:58.307,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You can see all of the great scientific announcements that we've made,

70
0:04:02.038,000 --> 0:04:04,000
saying how much danger we face with climate change.

71
0:04:04.76,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You can see the political meetings.

72
0:04:06.962,000 --> 0:04:08,000
None of it has changed the trajectory.

73
0:04:10.344,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And this is why we need new thinking,

74
0:04:12.948,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we need a new approach.

75
0:04:15.645,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So how might we go about drawing down greenhouse gases at a large scale?

76
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:25,000
There's really only two ways of doing it,

77
0:04:25.152,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and I've done a very deep dive into drawdown.

78
0:04:28.839,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I'll preempt my --

79
0:04:31.93,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I would say this stuff comes up smelling like roses at the end of the day.

80
0:04:37.165,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It does, it's one of the best options,

81
0:04:39.013,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but there are many, many possibilities.

82
0:04:42.442,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There are chemical pathways and biological pathways.

83
0:04:45.649,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So two ways, really, of getting the job done.

84
0:04:48.577,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The biological pathways are fantastic

85
0:04:50.768,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because the energy source that's needed to drive them, the sun,

86
0:04:54.538,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is effectively free.

87
0:04:55.982,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We use the sun to drive photosynthesis in plants,

88
0:04:59.046,000 --> 0:05:01,000
break apart that CO2 and capture the carbon.

89
0:05:01.617,000 --> 0:05:02,000
There are also chemical pathways.

90
0:05:03.471,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They sound ominous, but actually, they're not bad at all.

91
0:05:06.259,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The difficulty they face is that we have to actually pay

92
0:05:09.696,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for the energy that's required to do the job

93
0:05:11.895,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or pay to facilitate that energy.

94
0:05:14.339,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Direct air capture is a great example of a chemical pathway,

95
0:05:17.482,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and people are using that right now to take CO2 out of the atmosphere

96
0:05:20.927,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and manufacture biofuels or manufacture plastics.

97
0:05:24.498,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Great progress is being made,

98
0:05:26.213,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but it will be many decades

99
0:05:28.053,000 --> 0:05:33,000
before those chemical pathways are drawing down a gigaton of CO2 a year.

100
0:05:33.489,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The biological pathways offer us a lot more hope, I think,

101
0:05:36.411,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in the short term.

102
0:05:38.061,000 --> 0:05:41,000
You've probably heard about reforestation, planting trees,

103
0:05:42.069,000 --> 0:05:44,000
as a solution to the climate problem.

104
0:05:44.514,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You know, it's a fair question:

105
0:05:46.078,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Can we plant our way out of this problem by using trees?

106
0:05:49.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm skeptical about that for a number of reasons.

107
0:05:52.633,000 --> 0:05:54,000
One is just the scale of the problem.

108
0:05:55.03,000 --> 0:05:58,000
All trees start as seeds, little tiny things,

109
0:05:58.077,000 --> 0:06:,000
and it's many decades before they've reached

110
0:06:00.216,000 --> 0:06:02,000
their full carbon-capture potential.

111
0:06:02.966,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And secondly,

112
0:06:04.141,000 --> 0:06:07,000
if you look at the land surface, you see that it's so heavily utilized.

113
0:06:08.038,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We get our food from it, we get our forestry products from it,

114
0:06:11.78,000 --> 0:06:13,000
biodiversity protection and water and everything else.

115
0:06:14.784,000 --> 0:06:17,000
To expect that we'll find enough space to deal with this problem,

116
0:06:17.886,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I think is going to be quite problematic.

117
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But if we look offshore,

118
0:06:23.339,000 --> 0:06:26,000
wee see a solution where there's already an existing industry,

119
0:06:26.712,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and where there's a clearer way forward.

120
0:06:28.982,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The oceans cover about 70 percent of our planet.

121
0:06:32.379,000 --> 0:06:35,000
They play a really big role in regulating our climate,

122
0:06:35.88,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and if we can enhance the growth of seaweed in them,

123
0:06:38.728,000 --> 0:06:41,000
we can use them, I think, to develop a climate-altering crop.

124
0:06:43.347,000 --> 0:06:45,000
There are so many different kinds of seaweed,

125
0:06:45.482,000 --> 0:06:47,000
there's unbelievable genetic diversity in seaweed,

126
0:06:48.149,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and they're very ancient;

127
0:06:49.419,000 --> 0:06:52,000
they were some of the first multicellular organisms ever to evolve.

128
0:06:53.3,000 --> 0:06:55,000
People are using special kinds of seaweed now

129
0:06:56.022,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for particular purposes,

130
0:06:57.237,000 --> 0:07:,000
like developing very high-quality pharmaceutical products.

131
0:07:01.022,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But you can also use seaweed to take a seaweed bath,

132
0:07:04.109,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it's supposed to be good for your skin;

133
0:07:06.006,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I can't testify to that, but you can do it.

134
0:07:08.815,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The scalability is the big thing about seaweed farming.

135
0:07:11.872,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You know, if we could cover nine percent of the world's ocean

136
0:07:15.944,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in seaweed farms,

137
0:07:17.476,000 --> 0:07:2,000
we could draw down the equivalent of all of the greenhouse gases

138
0:07:20.609,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we put up in any one year,

139
0:07:22.126,000 --> 0:07:23,000
more than 50 gigatons.

140
0:07:24.212,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, I thought that was fantastic when I first read it,

141
0:07:26.831,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but I thought I'd better calculate how big nine percent of the world's oceans is.

142
0:07:30.711,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It turns out, it's about four and a half Australias,

143
0:07:33.187,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the place I live in.

144
0:07:34.461,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And how close are we to that at the moment?

145
0:07:36.597,000 --> 0:07:4,000
How many ocean-going seaweed farms do we actually have out there?

146
0:07:40.641,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Zero.

147
0:07:41.816,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But we do have some prototypes, and therein lies some hope.

148
0:07:45.473,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This little drawing here of a seaweed farm that's currently under construction

149
0:07:50.37,000 --> 0:07:52,000
tells you some very interesting things about seaweed.

150
0:07:52.919,000 --> 0:07:54,000
You can see the seaweed growing on that rack,

151
0:07:55.053,000 --> 0:07:57,000
25 meters down in the ocean there.

152
0:07:57.141,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's really different from anything you see on land.

153
0:08:00.928,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And the reason being that, you know, seaweed is not like trees,

154
0:08:04.69,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it doesn't have nonproductive parts

155
0:08:07.641,000 --> 0:08:1,000
like roots and trunks and branches and bark.

156
0:08:10.966,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The whole of the plant is pretty much photosynthetic,

157
0:08:14.133,000 --> 0:08:15,000
so it grows fast.

158
0:08:15.482,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Seaweed can grow a meter a day.

159
0:08:18.553,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And how do we sequester the carbon?

160
0:08:21.366,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Again, it's very different from on land.

161
0:08:23.3,000 --> 0:08:25,000
All you need to do is cut that seaweed off --

162
0:08:26.101,000 --> 0:08:27,000
drifts into the ocean abyss,

163
0:08:27.712,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Once it's down a kilometer,

164
0:08:29.331,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the carbon in that seaweed is effectively out of the atmospheric system

165
0:08:33.649,000 --> 0:08:34,000
for centuries or millennia.

166
0:08:35.853,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Whereas if you plant a forest,

167
0:08:37.338,000 --> 0:08:39,000
you've got to worry about forest fires, bugs, etc.,

168
0:08:40.162,000 --> 0:08:41,000
releasing that carbon.

169
0:08:42.932,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The key to this farm, though,

170
0:08:44.463,000 --> 0:08:47,000
is that little pipe going down into the depths.

171
0:08:48.03,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You know, the mid-ocean is basically a vast biological desert.

172
0:08:52.339,000 --> 0:08:54,000
There's no nutrients there that were used up long ago.

173
0:08:55.014,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But just 500 meters down,

174
0:08:57.101,000 --> 0:08:59,000
there is cool, very nutrient-rich water.

175
0:09:00.173,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And with just a little bit of clean, renewable energy,

176
0:09:03.076,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you can pump that water up

177
0:09:04.815,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and use the nutrients in it to irrigate your seaweed crop.

178
0:09:09.532,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So I think this really has so many benefits.

179
0:09:14.793,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It's changing a biological desert,

180
0:09:18.677,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the mid-ocean,

181
0:09:19.852,000 --> 0:09:22,000
into a productive, maybe even planet-saving solution.

182
0:09:25.25,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So what could go wrong?

183
0:09:26.639,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Well, anything we're talking about at this scale

184
0:09:30.135,000 --> 0:09:32,000
involves a planetary-scale intervention.

185
0:09:32.694,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And we have to be very careful.

186
0:09:34.506,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I think that piles of stinking seaweed

187
0:09:36.579,000 --> 0:09:38,000
are probably going to be the least of our problems.

188
0:09:39.006,000 --> 0:09:41,000
There's other unforeseen things that will happen.

189
0:09:41.331,000 --> 0:09:44,000
One of the things that really worries me, when I talk about this,

190
0:09:44.426,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is the fate of biodiversity in the deep ocean.

191
0:09:47.347,000 --> 0:09:49,000
If we are putting gigatons of seaweed into the deep ocean,

192
0:09:50.156,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we're affecting life down there.

193
0:09:51.83,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The good news is that we know

194
0:09:53.556,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that a lot of seaweed already reaches the deep ocean,

195
0:09:56.731,000 --> 0:09:59,000
after storms or through submarine canyons.

196
0:09:59.771,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So we're not talking about a novel process here;

197
0:10:02.31,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we are talking about enhancing a natural process.

198
0:10:07.552,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And we'll learn as we go.

199
0:10:09.266,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I mean, it may be that these ocean-going seaweed farms will need to be mobile,

200
0:10:13.314,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to distribute the seaweed across vast areas of the ocean,

201
0:10:16.137,000 --> 0:10:19,000
rather than creating a big stinking pile in one place.

202
0:10:19.82,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It may be that we'll need to char the seaweed --

203
0:10:23.328,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so create a sort of an inert, mineral biochar

204
0:10:26.758,000 --> 0:10:28,000
before we dispatch it into the deep.

205
0:10:28.863,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We won't know until we start the process,

206
0:10:31.228,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and we will learn effectively by doing.

207
0:10:34.831,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I just want to take you to contemporary seaweed farming.

208
0:10:38.188,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's a big business --

209
0:10:39.363,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it's a six-billion-dollar-a-year business.

210
0:10:41.728,000 --> 0:10:42,000
These seaweed farms off South Korea --

211
0:10:43.63,000 --> 0:10:45,000
you can see them from space, they are huge.

212
0:10:46.105,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And they're increasingly not just seaweed farms.

213
0:10:48.954,000 --> 0:10:52,000
What people are doing in places like this is something called ocean permaculture.

214
0:10:53.192,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And in ocean permaculture,

215
0:10:55.065,000 --> 0:10:58,000
you grow fish, shellfish and seaweed all together.

216
0:10:58.582,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And the reason it works so well

217
0:11:00.529,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is that the seaweed makes the seawater less acid.

218
0:11:04.354,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It provides an ideal environment for growing marine protein.

219
0:11:08.442,000 --> 0:11:1,000
If we covered nine percent of the world's oceans

220
0:11:10.717,000 --> 0:11:11,000
in ocean permaculture,

221
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we would be producing enough protein in the form of fish and shellfish

222
0:11:16.582,000 --> 0:11:19,000
to give every person in a population of 10 billion

223
0:11:20.101,000 --> 0:11:24,000
200 kilograms of high-quality protein per year.

224
0:11:24.853,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So, we've got a multipotent solution here.

225
0:11:26.924,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We can address climate change, we can feed the world,

226
0:11:29.472,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we can deacidify the oceans.

227
0:11:32.345,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The economics of all of this is going to be challenging.

228
0:11:35.007,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We'll be investing many, many billions of dollars

229
0:11:38.3,000 --> 0:11:39,000
into these solutions,

230
0:11:39.594,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and they will take decades to get to the gigaton scale.

231
0:11:42.951,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The reason that I'm convinced that this is going to happen

232
0:11:46.17,000 --> 0:11:48,000
is that unless we get the gas out of the air,

233
0:11:49.011,000 --> 0:11:51,000
it is going to keep driving adverse consequences.

234
0:11:51.876,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It will flood our cities,

235
0:11:53.725,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it will deprive us of food,

236
0:11:55.236,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it will cause all sorts of civil unrest.

237
0:11:58.571,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So anyone who's got a solution to dealing with this problem

238
0:12:01.825,000 --> 0:12:02,000
has a valuable asset.

239
0:12:03.587,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And already, as I've explained,

240
0:12:06.404,000 --> 0:12:1,000
ocean permaculture is well on the road to being economically sustainable.

241
0:12:13.121,000 --> 0:12:14,000
You know, in the next 30 years,

242
0:12:14.962,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we have to go from being a carbon-emitting economy

243
0:12:19.263,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to a carbon-absorbing economy.

244
0:12:21.861,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And that doesn't seem like very long.

245
0:12:24.766,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But half of the greenhouse gases that we've put into the atmosphere,

246
0:12:28.551,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we've put there in the last 30 years.

247
0:12:31.631,000 --> 0:12:32,000
My argument is,

248
0:12:32.834,000 --> 0:12:34,000
if we can put the gas in in 30 years,

249
0:12:35.636,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we can pull it out in 30 years.

250
0:12:38.461,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And if you doubt how much can be done over 30 years,

251
0:12:41.144,000 --> 0:12:44,000
just cast your mind back a century, to 1919,

252
0:12:44.732,000 --> 0:12:45,000
compare it with 1950.

253
0:12:46.645,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Now, in 1919, here in Edinburgh,

254
0:12:49.195,000 --> 0:12:51,000
you might have seen a canvas and wood biplane.

255
0:12:52.217,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Thirty years later, you'd be seeing jet aircraft.

256
0:12:55.109,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Transport in the street were horses in 1919.

257
0:12:58.093,000 --> 0:13:,000
By 1950, they're motor vehicles.

258
0:13:01.093,000 --> 0:13:03,000
1919, we had gun powder;

259
0:13:03.3,000 --> 0:13:05,000
1950, we had nuclear power.

260
0:13:06.038,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We can do a lot in a short period of time.

261
0:13:08.982,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But it all depends upon us believing that we can find a solution.

262
0:13:13.577,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Now what I would love to do is bring together all of the people

263
0:13:16.999,000 --> 0:13:18,000
with knowledge in this space.

264
0:13:19.252,000 --> 0:13:21,000
The engineers who know how to build structures offshore,

265
0:13:22.228,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the seaweed farmers, the financiers,

266
0:13:24.434,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the government regulators,

267
0:13:25.855,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the people who understand how things are done.

268
0:13:29.165,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And chart a way forward,

269
0:13:30.8,000 --> 0:13:33,000
say: How do we go from the existing six-billion-dollar-a-year,

270
0:13:34.631,000 --> 0:13:36,000
inshore seaweed industry,

271
0:13:36.655,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to this new form of industry, which has got so much potential,

272
0:13:40.538,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but will require large amounts of investment?

273
0:13:45.077,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I'm not a betting man, you know.

274
0:13:47.276,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But if I were,

275
0:13:48.569,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I'll tell you, my money would be on that stuff,

276
0:13:50.876,000 --> 0:13:51,000
it would be on seaweed.

277
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's my hero.

278
0:13:53.722,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Thank you.

279
0:13:54.897,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Applause)

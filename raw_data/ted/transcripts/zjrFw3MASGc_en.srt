1
0:00:12.809,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Isn't it fascinating how the simple act of drawing a line on the map

2
0:00:17.58,000 --> 0:00:19,000
can transform the way we see and experience the world?

3
0:00:21.714,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And how those spaces in between lines, borders,

4
0:00:24.802,000 --> 0:00:25,000
become places.

5
0:00:26.58,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They become places where language and food and music

6
0:00:31.284,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and people of different cultures rub up against each other

7
0:00:34.432,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in beautiful and sometimes violent and occasionally really ridiculous ways.

8
0:00:40.454,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And those lines drawn on a map

9
0:00:43.189,000 --> 0:00:45,000
can actually create scars in the landscape,

10
0:00:45.66,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and they can create scars in our memories.

11
0:00:48.645,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My interest in borders came about

12
0:00:50.575,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when I was searching for an architecture of the borderlands.

13
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I was working on several projects along the US-Mexico border,

14
0:00:59.601,000 --> 0:01:02,000
designing buildings made out of mud taken right from the ground.

15
0:01:03.911,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I also work on projects that you might say immigrated to this landscape.

16
0:01:07.508,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Prada Marfa," a land-art sculpture

17
0:01:09.857,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that crosses the border between art and architecture,

18
0:01:12.881,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and it demonstrated to me that architecture could communicate ideas

19
0:01:16.348,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that are much more politically and culturally complex,

20
0:01:19.723,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that architecture could be satirical and serious at the same time

21
0:01:24.296,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and it could speak to the disparities between wealth and poverty

22
0:01:27.321,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and what's local and what's foreign.

23
0:01:30.644,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And so in my search for an architecture of the borderlands,

24
0:01:34.089,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I began to wonder,

25
0:01:35.812,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is the wall architecture?

26
0:01:39.42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I began to document my thoughts and visits to the wall

27
0:01:44.678,000 --> 0:01:47,000
by creating a series of souvenirs

28
0:01:48.251,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to remind us of the time when we built a wall

29
0:01:52.934,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and what a crazy idea that was.

30
0:01:56.112,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I created border games,

31
0:01:57.882,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:59.429,000 --> 0:02:,000
postcards,

33
0:02:01.921,000 --> 0:02:04,000
snow globes with little architectural models inside of them,

34
0:02:05.913,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and maps that told the story of resilience at the wall

35
0:02:10.961,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and sought for ways that design could bring to light the problems

36
0:02:15.66,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that the border wall was creating.

37
0:02:18.777,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So, is the wall architecture?

38
0:02:21.349,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Well, it certainly is a design structure,

39
0:02:23.65,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and it's designed at a research facility called FenceLab,

40
0:02:27.356,000 --> 0:02:3,000
where they would load vehicles with 10,000 pounds

41
0:02:30.388,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and ram them into the wall at 40 miles an hour

42
0:02:32.571,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to test the wall's impermeability.

43
0:02:34.666,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But there was also counter-research going on on the other side,

44
0:02:37.948,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the design of portable drawbridges

45
0:02:40.242,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that you could bring right up to the wall

46
0:02:42.267,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and allow vehicles to drive right over.

47
0:02:44.294,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:46.289,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And like with all research projects, there are successes

49
0:02:49.481,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and there are failures.

50
0:02:50.924,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:52.305,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But it's these medieval reactions to the wall --

52
0:02:55.671,000 --> 0:02:57,000
drawbridges, for example --

53
0:02:57.972,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that are because the wall itself is an arcane, medieval form of architecture.

54
0:03:03.613,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's an overly simplistic response to a complex set of issues.

55
0:03:09.136,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And a number of medieval technologies have sprung up along the wall:

56
0:03:13.748,000 --> 0:03:16,000
catapults that launch bales of marijuana over the wall

57
0:03:16.772,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:17.797,000 --> 0:03:2,000
or cannons that shoot packets of cocaine and heroin over the wall.

59
0:03:22.286,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now during medieval times,

60
0:03:24.247,000 --> 0:03:26,000
diseased, dead bodies

61
0:03:26.659,000 --> 0:03:3,000
were sometimes catapulted over walls as an early form of biological warfare,

62
0:03:31.618,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and it's speculated that today,

63
0:03:34.544,000 --> 0:03:39,000
humans are being propelled over the wall as a form of immigration.

64
0:03:41.053,000 --> 0:03:42,000
A ridiculous idea.

65
0:03:43.204,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But the only person ever known to be documented to have launched over the wall

66
0:03:49.154,000 --> 0:03:5,000
from Mexico to the United States

67
0:03:51.062,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was in fact a US citizen,

68
0:03:53.196,000 --> 0:03:57,000
who was given permission to human-cannonball over the wall,

69
0:03:57.726,000 --> 0:03:58,000
200 feet,

70
0:03:58.901,000 --> 0:04:,000
so long as he carried his passport in hand

71
0:04:00.997,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:03.004,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and he landed safely in a net on the other side.

73
0:04:07.665,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And my thoughts are inspired by a quote by the architect Hassan Fathy,

74
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who said,

75
0:04:13.406,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"Architects do not design walls,

76
0:04:15.875,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but the spaces between them."

77
0:04:18.356,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So while I do not think that architects should be designing walls,

78
0:04:21.483,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I do think it's important and urgent that they should be paying attention

79
0:04:25.229,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to those spaces in between.

80
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They should be designing for the places and the people, the landscapes

81
0:04:31.809,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that the wall endangers.

82
0:04:34.769,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, people are already rising to this occasion,

83
0:04:37.443,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and while the purpose of the wall is to keep people apart and away,

84
0:04:42.347,000 --> 0:04:45,000
it's actually bringing people together in some really remarkable ways,

85
0:04:46.204,000 --> 0:04:49,000
holding social events like binational yoga classes along the border,

86
0:04:49.649,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to bring people together across the divide.

87
0:04:52.386,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I call this the monument pose.

88
0:04:54.191,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:56.388,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And have you ever heard of "wall y ball"?

90
0:04:59.666,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:01.094,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's a borderland version of volleyball, and it's been played since 1979

92
0:05:06.982,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:08.42,000 --> 0:05:09,000
along the US-Mexico border

94
0:05:09.976,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to celebrate binational heritage.

95
0:05:12.442,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And it raises some interesting questions, right?

96
0:05:14.884,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Is such a game even legal?

97
0:05:18.017,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Does hitting a ball back and forth over the wall constitute illegal trade?

98
0:05:21.724,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:23.975,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The beauty of volleyball is that it transforms the wall

100
0:05:28.922,000 --> 0:05:3,000
into nothing more than a line in the sand

101
0:05:31.31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
negotiated by the minds and bodies and spirits of players on both sides.

102
0:05:36.406,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And I think it's exactly these kinds of two-sided negotiations

103
0:05:40.665,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that are needed to bring down walls that divide.

104
0:05:44.715,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, throwing the ball over the wall is one thing,

105
0:05:47.906,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but throwing rocks over the wall

106
0:05:50.327,000 --> 0:05:53,000
has caused damage to Border Patrol vehicles

107
0:05:53.403,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and have injured Border Patrol agents,

108
0:05:56.59,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the response from the US side has been drastic.

109
0:05:59.177,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Border Patrol agents have fired through the wall,

110
0:06:02.734,000 --> 0:06:04,000
killing people throwing rocks on the Mexican side.

111
0:06:06.906,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And another response by Border Patrol agents

112
0:06:09.304,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is to erect baseball backstops to protect themselves and their vehicles.

113
0:06:13.519,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And these backstops became a permanent feature

114
0:06:16.972,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the construction of new walls.

115
0:06:19.339,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I began to wonder if, like volleyball,

116
0:06:22.353,000 --> 0:06:26,000
maybe baseball should be a permanent feature at the border,

117
0:06:26.582,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and walls could start opening up,

118
0:06:28.936,000 --> 0:06:31,000
allowing communities to come across and play,

119
0:06:31.988,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and if they hit a home run,

120
0:06:33.655,000 --> 0:06:35,000
maybe a Border Patrol agent would pick up the ball and throw it

121
0:06:36.659,000 --> 0:06:37,000
back over to the other side.

122
0:06:39.941,000 --> 0:06:43,000
A Border Patrol agent buys a raspado, a frozen treat,

123
0:06:43.99,000 --> 0:06:45,000
from a vendor just a couple feet away,

124
0:06:46.665,000 --> 0:06:48,000
food and money is exchanged through the wall,

125
0:06:49.259,000 --> 0:06:54,000
an entirely normal event made illegal by that line drawn on a map

126
0:06:56.356,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and a couple millimeters of steel.

127
0:06:59.35,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And this scene reminded me of a saying:

128
0:07:02.078,000 --> 0:07:04,000
"If you have more than you need, you should build longer tables

129
0:07:05.07,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and not higher walls."

130
0:07:06.946,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So I created this souvenir to remember the moment that we could share

131
0:07:10.475,000 --> 0:07:12,000
food and conversation across the divide.

132
0:07:13.767,000 --> 0:07:16,000
A swing allows one to enter and swing over to the other side

133
0:07:17.098,000 --> 0:07:19,000
until gravity deports them back to their own country.

134
0:07:20.817,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The border and the border wall

135
0:07:23.366,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is thought of as a sort of political theater today,

136
0:07:28.68,000 --> 0:07:31,000
so perhaps we should invite audiences to that theater,

137
0:07:32.007,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to a binational theater where people can come together

138
0:07:35.688,000 --> 0:07:37,000
with performers, musicians.

139
0:07:38.71,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Maybe the wall is nothing more than an enormous instrument,

140
0:07:41.971,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the world's largest xylophone, and we could play down this wall

141
0:07:45.701,000 --> 0:07:46,000
with weapons of mass percussion.

142
0:07:47.524,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:50.492,000 --> 0:07:52,000
When I envisioned this binational library,

144
0:07:52.939,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I wanted to imagine a space where one could share

145
0:07:56.154,000 --> 0:08:,000
books and information and knowledge across a divide,

146
0:08:01.073,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where the wall was nothing more than a bookshelf.

147
0:08:04.046,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And perhaps the best way to illustrate the mutual relationship that we have

148
0:08:08.003,000 --> 0:08:1,000
with Mexico and the United States

149
0:08:10.323,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is by imagining a teeter-totter,

150
0:08:13.045,000 --> 0:08:16,000
where the actions on one side had a direct consequence

151
0:08:16.63,000 --> 0:08:18,000
on what happens on the other side,

152
0:08:18.877,000 --> 0:08:2,000
because you see, the border itself

153
0:08:20.914,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is both a symbolic and literal fulcrum for US-Mexico relations,

154
0:08:25.181,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and building walls between neighbors severs those relationships.

155
0:08:30.047,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You probably remember this quote, "Good fences make good neighbors."

156
0:08:34.246,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's often thought of as the moral of Robert Frost's poem "Mending Wall."

157
0:08:39.316,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But the poem is really about questioning the need for building walls at all.

158
0:08:44.171,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's really a poem about mending human relationships.

159
0:08:47.787,000 --> 0:08:49,000
My favorite line is the first one:

160
0:08:49.814,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Something there is that doesn't love a wall."

161
0:08:53.313,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Because if there's one thing that's clear to me --

162
0:08:55.765,000 --> 0:08:57,000
there are not two sides defined by a wall.

163
0:08:58.436,000 --> 0:08:59,000
This is one landscape, divided.

164
0:09:01.161,000 --> 0:09:02,000
On one side, it might look like this.

165
0:09:03.084,000 --> 0:09:06,000
A man is mowing his lawn while the wall is looming in his backyard.

166
0:09:07.04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And on the other side, it might look like this.

167
0:09:09.664,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The wall is the fourth wall of someone's house.

168
0:09:13.465,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But the reality is that the wall is cutting through people's lives.

169
0:09:18.278,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It is cutting through our private property,

170
0:09:21.251,000 --> 0:09:22,000
our public lands,

171
0:09:22.426,000 --> 0:09:24,000
our Native American lands, our cities,

172
0:09:25.274,000 --> 0:09:26,000
a university,

173
0:09:27.242,000 --> 0:09:28,000
our neighborhoods.

174
0:09:29.077,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I couldn't help but wonder

175
0:09:30.929,000 --> 0:09:32,000
what it would be like if the wall cut through a house.

176
0:09:34.789,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Remember those disparities between wealth and poverty?

177
0:09:37.39,000 --> 0:09:39,000
On the right is the average size of a house in El Paso, Texas,

178
0:09:40.351,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and on the left is the average size of a house in Juarez.

179
0:09:43.794,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And here, the wall cuts directly through the kitchen table.

180
0:09:47.747,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And here, the wall cuts through the bed in the bedroom.

181
0:09:51.699,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Because I wanted to communicate how the wall is not only dividing places,

182
0:09:55.467,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it's dividing people, it's dividing families.

183
0:09:58.195,000 --> 0:10:,000
And the unfortunate politics of the wall

184
0:10:00.426,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is today, it is dividing children from their parents.

185
0:10:04.647,000 --> 0:10:06,000
You might be familiar with this well-known traffic sign.

186
0:10:07.456,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It was designed by graphic designer John Hood,

187
0:10:11.144,000 --> 0:10:12,000
a Native American war veteran

188
0:10:12.922,000 --> 0:10:14,000
working for the California Department of Transportation.

189
0:10:16.366,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And he was tasked with creating a sign to warn motorists

190
0:10:19.93,000 --> 0:10:21,000
of immigrants who were stranded alongside the highway

191
0:10:22.605,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and who might attempt to run across the road.

192
0:10:26.041,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Hood related the plight of the immigrant today

193
0:10:29.804,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to that of the Navajo during the Long Walk.

194
0:10:33.778,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And this is really a brilliant piece of design activism.

195
0:10:37.796,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And he was very careful

196
0:10:38.97,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in thinking about using a little girl with pigtails, for example,

197
0:10:42.631,000 --> 0:10:46,000
because he thought that's who motorists might empathize with the most,

198
0:10:46.933,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and he used the silhouette of the civil rights leader Cesar Chavez

199
0:10:51.443,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to create the head of the father.

200
0:10:53.839,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I wanted to build upon the brilliance of this sign

201
0:10:57.54,000 --> 0:11:,000
to call attention to the problem of child separation at the border,

202
0:11:00.953,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and I made one very simple move.

203
0:11:02.834,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I turned the families to face each other.

204
0:11:05.583,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And in the last few weeks,

205
0:11:06.868,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I've had the opportunity to bring that sign back to the highway

206
0:11:09.98,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to tell a story,

207
0:11:11.773,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the story of the relationships that we should be mending

208
0:11:15.52,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and a reminder that we should be designing

209
0:11:17.945,000 --> 0:11:2,000
a reunited states and not a divided states.

210
0:11:21.515,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Thank you.

211
0:11:22.69,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Applause)

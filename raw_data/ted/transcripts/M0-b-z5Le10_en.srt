1
0:00:13.435,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How many of you are tired

2
0:00:16.674,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of seeing celebrities adopting kids from the African continent?

3
0:00:21.159,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:24.342,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Well, it's not all that bad.

5
0:00:28.573,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was adopted.

6
0:00:31.451,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I grew up in rural Uganda,

7
0:00:35.495,000 --> 0:00:37,000
lost both my parents when I was very, very young.

8
0:00:39.978,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And when my parents passed,

9
0:00:42.467,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I experienced all the negative effects of poverty,

10
0:00:49.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
from homelessness,

11
0:00:51.003,000 --> 0:00:52,000
eating out of trash piles,

12
0:00:53.539,000 --> 0:00:54,000
you name it.

13
0:00:56.603,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But my life changed

14
0:00:59.038,000 --> 0:01:02,000
when I got accepted into an orphanage.

15
0:01:03.808,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Through one of those sponsor-an-orphan programs,

16
0:01:06.924,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I was sponsored and given an opportunity to acquire an education.

17
0:01:11.963,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I started off in Uganda.

18
0:01:14.097,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I went through school, and the way this particular program worked,

19
0:01:17.875,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you finished high school and after high school,

20
0:01:20.107,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you go learn a trade -- to become a carpenter, a mechanic

21
0:01:23.791,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or something along those lines.

22
0:01:26.559,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My case was a little different.

23
0:01:30.308,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The sponsor family that was sending these 25 dollars a month

24
0:01:34.425,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to this orphanage to sponsor me,

25
0:01:36.861,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which -- I had never met them --

26
0:01:39.702,000 --> 0:01:4,000
said, "Well ...

27
0:01:42.813,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we would like to send you to college instead."

28
0:01:46.538,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Oh -- it gets better.

29
0:01:47.79,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:48.857,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And they said, "If you get the paperwork,

31
0:01:51.717,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we'll send you to school in America instead."

32
0:01:56.856,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So with their help,

33
0:01:59.287,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I went to the embassy and applied for the visa.

34
0:02:03.216,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I got the visa.

35
0:02:04.629,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I remember this day like it was yesterday.

36
0:02:09.054,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I walked out of the embassy with this piece of paper in my hand,

37
0:02:12.442,000 --> 0:02:13,000
a hop in my step,

38
0:02:14.181,000 --> 0:02:15,000
smile on my face,

39
0:02:15.906,000 --> 0:02:18,000
knowing that my life is about to change.

40
0:02:20.875,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I went home that night,

41
0:02:23.168,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and I slept with my passport,

42
0:02:25.006,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because I was afraid that someone might steal it.

43
0:02:27.337,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:29.216,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I couldn't fall asleep.

45
0:02:31.446,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I kept feeling it.

46
0:02:33.896,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I had a good idea for security.

47
0:02:36.324,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I was like, "OK, I'm going to put it in a plastic bag,

48
0:02:38.917,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and take it outside and dig a hole, and put it in there."

49
0:02:43.706,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I did that, went back in the house.

50
0:02:45.675,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I could not fall asleep. I was like, "Maybe someone saw me."

51
0:02:48.652,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I went back --

52
0:02:49.827,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:50.861,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I pulled it out, and I put it with me the entire night --

54
0:02:53.659,000 --> 0:02:55,000
all to say that it was an anxiety-filled night.

55
0:02:56.641,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:58.203,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Going to the US was, just like another speaker said,

57
0:03:02.278,000 --> 0:03:04,000
was my first time to see a plane,

58
0:03:04.656,000 --> 0:03:07,000
be on one, let alone sit on it to fly to another country.

59
0:03:09.172,000 --> 0:03:11,000
December 15, 2006.

60
0:03:12.061,000 --> 0:03:13,000
7:08pm.

61
0:03:14.58,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I sat in seat 7A.

62
0:03:18.009,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Fly Emirates.

63
0:03:21.427,000 --> 0:03:24,000
One of the most gorgeous, beautiful women I've ever seen walked up,

64
0:03:26.246,000 --> 0:03:28,000
red little hat with a white veil.

65
0:03:29.792,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I'm looking terrified, I have no idea what I'm doing.

66
0:03:33.391,000 --> 0:03:35,000
She hands me this warm towel --

67
0:03:35.641,000 --> 0:03:37,000
warm, steamy, snow white.

68
0:03:39.686,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm looking at this warm towel;

69
0:03:42.024,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I don't know what to do with my life, let alone with this damn towel --

70
0:03:45.442,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:47.343,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

72
0:03:51.712,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I did one of the --

73
0:03:53.075,000 --> 0:03:55,000
you know, anything anyone could do in that situation:

74
0:03:56.043,000 --> 0:03:58,000
look around, see what everyone else is doing.

75
0:03:58.764,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I did the same.

76
0:04:00.549,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Mind you, I drove about seven hours from my village to the airport that day.

77
0:04:06.524,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So I grab this warm towel,

78
0:04:08.598,000 --> 0:04:11,000
wipe my face just like everyone else is doing,

79
0:04:11.767,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I look at it --

80
0:04:13.237,000 --> 0:04:14,000
damn.

81
0:04:14.426,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:16.983,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It was all dirt brown.

83
0:04:18.845,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:20.94,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I remember being so embarrassed that when she came by to pick it up,

85
0:04:26.219,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I didn't give mine.

86
0:04:27.47,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:28.611,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I still have it.

88
0:04:29.803,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:31.498,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Applause)

90
0:04:34.95,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Going to America opened doors for me

91
0:04:37.912,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to live up to my full God-given potential.

92
0:04:41.862,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I remember when I arrived,

93
0:04:43.415,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the sponsor family embraced me,

94
0:04:45.404,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they literally had to teach me everything from scratch:

95
0:04:48.757,000 --> 0:04:5,000
this is a microwave, that's a refrigerator --

96
0:04:51.529,000 --> 0:04:53,000
things I'd never seen before.

97
0:04:54.262,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And it was also the first time

98
0:04:56.035,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I got immersed into a new and different culture.

99
0:05:00.159,000 --> 0:05:03,000
These strangers showed me

100
0:05:04.381,000 --> 0:05:05,000
true love.

101
0:05:07.08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
These strangers showed me that I mattered,

102
0:05:12.038,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that my dreams mattered.

103
0:05:22.165,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Applause)

104
0:05:28.841,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Thank you.

105
0:05:32.708,000 --> 0:05:35,000
These individuals had two of their own biological children.

106
0:05:36.479,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And when I came in, I had needs.

107
0:05:39.691,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They had to teach me English,

108
0:05:41.788,000 --> 0:05:43,000
teach me literally everything,

109
0:05:44.596,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which resulted in them spending a lot of time with me.

110
0:05:47.726,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And that created a little bit of jealousy with their children.

111
0:05:55.155,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So, if you're a parent in this room,

112
0:05:59.688,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and you have those teenager children

113
0:06:02.721,000 --> 0:06:06,000
who don't want anything to do with your love and affection --

114
0:06:07.099,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in fact, they find it repulsive --

115
0:06:09.701,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I got a solution:

116
0:06:11.278,000 --> 0:06:12,000
adopt a child.

117
0:06:12.674,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:13.71,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It will solve the problem.

119
0:06:14.974,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Applause)

120
0:06:19.274,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I went on to acquire two engineering degrees

121
0:06:21.928,000 --> 0:06:23,000
from one of the best institutions in the world.

122
0:06:25.173,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I've got to tell you:

123
0:06:26.462,000 --> 0:06:27,000
talent is universal,

124
0:06:28.303,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but opportunities are not.

125
0:06:31.738,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And I credit this

126
0:06:34.296,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to the individuals who embrace multiculturalism,

127
0:06:38.747,000 --> 0:06:39,000
love, empathy

128
0:06:40.58,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and compassion for others.

129
0:06:44.572,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We live in a world filled with hate:

130
0:06:47.598,000 --> 0:06:48,000
building walls,

131
0:06:49.22,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Brexit,

132
0:06:50.538,000 --> 0:06:53,000
xenophobia here on the African continent.

133
0:06:55.326,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Multiculturalism can be an answer

134
0:06:57.75,000 --> 0:07:,000
to many of these worst human qualities.

135
0:07:03.308,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Today, I challenge you

136
0:07:06.12,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to help a young child experience multiculturalism.

137
0:07:11.165,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I guarantee you that will enrich their life,

138
0:07:15.272,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and in turn,

139
0:07:16.939,000 --> 0:07:17,000
it will enrich yours.

140
0:07:19.519,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And as a bonus,

141
0:07:21.207,000 --> 0:07:23,000
one of them may even give a TED Talk.

142
0:07:23.244,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:25.269,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Applause)

144
0:07:30.218,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We may not be able to solve the bigotry and the racism of this world today,

145
0:07:35.164,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but certainly we can raise children

146
0:07:39.772,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to create a positive, inclusive, connected world

147
0:07:43.81,000 --> 0:07:44,000
full of empathy,

148
0:07:46.29,000 --> 0:07:47,000
love

149
0:07:47.592,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and compassion.

150
0:07:49.361,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Love wins.

151
0:07:50.557,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Thank you.

152
0:07:51.731,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Applause)

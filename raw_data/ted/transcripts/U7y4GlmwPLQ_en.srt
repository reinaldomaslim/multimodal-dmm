1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I want you to reimagine how life is organized on earth.

2
0:00:18.92,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Think of the planet like a human body that we inhabit.

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The skeleton is the transportation system of roads and railways,

4
0:00:28.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
bridges and tunnels, air and seaports

5
0:00:31.6,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that enable our mobility across the continents.

6
0:00:34.84,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The vascular system that powers the body

7
0:00:38.12,000 --> 0:00:4,000
are the oil and gas pipelines and electricity grids.

8
0:00:40.92,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that distribute energy.

9
0:00:42.68,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And the nervous system of communications

10
0:00:45.72,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is the Internet cables, satellites, cellular networks

11
0:00:49.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and data centers that allow us to share information.

12
0:00:53.48,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This ever-expanding infrastructural matrix

13
0:00:57.88,000 --> 0:01:02,000
already consists of 64 million kilometers of roads,

14
0:01:02.92,000 --> 0:01:04,000
four million kilometers of railways,

15
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:07,000
two million kilometers of pipelines

16
0:01:08.72,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and one million kilometers of Internet cables.

17
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What about international borders?

18
0:01:16.959,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We have less than 500,000 kilometers of borders.

19
0:01:21.68,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Let's build a better map of the world.

20
0:01:24.72,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And we can start by overcoming some ancient mythology.

21
0:01:29.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
There's a saying with which all students of history are familiar:

22
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Geography is destiny."

23
0:01:35.96,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Sounds so grave, doesn't it?

24
0:01:38.12,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's such a fatalistic adage.

25
0:01:40.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It tells us that landlocked countries are condemned to be poor,

26
0:01:44.68,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that small countries cannot escape their larger neighbors,

27
0:01:47.92,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that vast distances are insurmountable.

28
0:01:51.88,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But every journey I take around the world,

29
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I see an even greater force sweeping the planet:

30
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
connectivity.

31
0:02:02.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The global connectivity revolution, in all of its forms --

32
0:02:05.84,000 --> 0:02:07,000
transportation, energy and communications --

33
0:02:08.56,000 --> 0:02:12,000
has enabled such a quantum leap in the mobility of people,

34
0:02:12.84,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of goods, of resources, of knowledge,

35
0:02:15.6,000 --> 0:02:19,000
such that we can no longer even think of geography as distinct from it.

36
0:02:20.84,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In fact, I view the two forces as fusing together

37
0:02:24.96,000 --> 0:02:26,000
into what I call "connectography."

38
0:02:28.28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Connectography represents a quantum leap

39
0:02:32.24,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in the mobility of people, resources and ideas,

40
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but it is an evolution,

41
0:02:38.28,000 --> 0:02:44,000
an evolution of the world from political geography,

42
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is how we legally divide the world,

43
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to functional geography,

44
0:02:50.24,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which is how we actually use the world,

45
0:02:52.84,000 --> 0:02:56,000
from nations and borders, to infrastructure and supply chains.

46
0:02:57.72,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Our global system is evolving

47
0:03:01.24,000 --> 0:03:04,000
from the vertically integrated empires of the 19th century,

48
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:08,000
through the horizontally interdependent nations of the 20th century,

49
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:14,000
into a global network civilization in the 21st century.

50
0:03:15.24,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Connectivity, not sovereignty,

51
0:03:18.6,000 --> 0:03:22,000
has become the organizing principle of the human species.

52
0:03:22.84,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Applause)

53
0:03:27.48,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We are becoming this global network civilization

54
0:03:30.72,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because we are literally building it.

55
0:03:33.52,000 --> 0:03:36,000
All of the world's defense budgets and military spending taken together

56
0:03:37.24,000 --> 0:03:4,000
total just under two trillion dollars per year.

57
0:03:40.36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Meanwhile, our global infrastructure spending

58
0:03:42.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is projected to rise to nine trillion dollars per year

59
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
within the coming decade.

60
0:03:47.72,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And, well, it should.

61
0:03:49.36,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We have been living off an infrastructure stock

62
0:03:52.12,000 --> 0:03:54,000
meant for a world population of three billion,

63
0:03:55.64,000 --> 0:03:58,000
as our population has crossed seven billion to eight billion

64
0:03:58.76,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and eventually nine billion and more.

65
0:04:01.28,000 --> 0:04:05,000
As a rule of thumb, we should spend about one trillion dollars

66
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:1,000
on the basic infrastructure needs of every billion people in the world.

67
0:04:11.36,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Not surprisingly, Asia is in the lead.

68
0:04:15.32,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In 2015, China announced the creation

69
0:04:17.96,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,

70
0:04:21.88,000 --> 0:04:24,000
which together with a network of other organizations

71
0:04:25.08,000 --> 0:04:28,000
aims to construct a network of iron and silk roads,

72
0:04:28.519,000 --> 0:04:3,000
stretching from Shanghai to Lisbon.

73
0:04:31.64,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And as all of this topographical engineering unfolds,

74
0:04:35.84,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we will likely spend more on infrastructure in the next 40 years,

75
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we will build more infrastructure in the next 40 years,

76
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
than we have in the past 4,000 years.

77
0:04:48.76,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now let's stop and think about it for a minute.

78
0:04:51.56,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Spending so much more on building the foundations of global society

79
0:04:56.36,000 --> 0:04:58,000
rather than on the tools to destroy it

80
0:04:59.2,000 --> 0:05:01,000
can have profound consequences.

81
0:05:01.8,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Connectivity is how we optimize the distribution

82
0:05:04.88,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of people and resources around the world.

83
0:05:07.48,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It is how mankind comes to be more than just the sum of its parts.

84
0:05:12.84,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I believe that is what is happening.

85
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Connectivity has a twin megatrend in the 21st century:

86
0:05:20.96,000 --> 0:05:22,000
planetary urbanization.

87
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Cities are the infrastructures that most define us.

88
0:05:27.84,000 --> 0:05:3,000
By 2030, more than two thirds of the world's population

89
0:05:31.08,000 --> 0:05:32,000
will live in cities.

90
0:05:32.36,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And these are not mere little dots on the map,

91
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but they are vast archipelagos stretching hundreds of kilometers.

92
0:05:39.36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Here we are in Vancouver,

93
0:05:40.96,000 --> 0:05:41,000
at the head of the Cascadia Corridor

94
0:05:42.84,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that stretches south across the US border to Seattle.

95
0:05:46.6,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The technology powerhouse of Silicon Valley

96
0:05:48.96,000 --> 0:05:5,000
begins north of San Francisco down to San Jose

97
0:05:51.84,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and across the bay to Oakland.

98
0:05:53.64,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The sprawl of Los Angeles now passes San Diego

99
0:05:56.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
across the Mexican border to Tijuana.

100
0:05:58.92,000 --> 0:06:,000
San Diego and Tijuana now share an airport terminal

101
0:06:01.92,000 --> 0:06:03,000
where you can exit into either country.

102
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Eventually, a high-speed rail network may connect the entire Pacific spine.

103
0:06:09.68,000 --> 0:06:13,000
America's northeastern megalopolis begins in Boston through New York

104
0:06:13.84,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and Philadelphia to Washington.

105
0:06:15.64,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It contains more than 50 million people

106
0:06:17.84,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and also has plans for a high-speed rail network.

107
0:06:20.64,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But Asia is where we really see the megacities coming together.

108
0:06:25.28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This continuous strip of light from Tokyo through Nagoya to Osaka

109
0:06:29.56,000 --> 0:06:31,000
contains more than 80 million people

110
0:06:31.76,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and most of Japan's economy.

111
0:06:34.2,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It is the world's largest megacity.

112
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
For now.

113
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But in China, megacity clusters are coming together

114
0:06:41.36,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with populations reaching 100 million people.

115
0:06:44.28,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The Bohai Rim around Beijing,

116
0:06:46.2,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The Yangtze River Delta around Shanghai

117
0:06:48.48,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and the Pearl River Delta,

118
0:06:50.4,000 --> 0:06:52,000
stretching from Hong Kong north to Guangzhou.

119
0:06:52.76,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And in the middle,

120
0:06:54.12,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the Chongqing-Chengdu megacity cluster,

121
0:06:57.04,000 --> 0:06:59,000
whose geographic footprint is almost the same size

122
0:06:59.84,000 --> 0:07:,000
as the country of Austria.

123
0:07:03.263,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And any number of these megacity clusters

124
0:07:05.24,000 --> 0:07:08,000
has a GDP approaching two trillion dollars --

125
0:07:08.32,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that's almost the same as all of India today.

126
0:07:11.56,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So imagine if our global diplomatic institutions, such as the G20,

127
0:07:17.24,000 --> 0:07:2,000
were to base their membership on economic size

128
0:07:20.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
rather than national representation.

129
0:07:23.32,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Some Chinese megacities may be in and have a seat at the table,

130
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:3,000
while entire countries, like Argentina or Indonesia would be out.

131
0:07:32.08,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Moving to India, whose population will soon exceed that of China,

132
0:07:35.8,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it too has a number of megacity clusters,

133
0:07:38.12,000 --> 0:07:4,000
such as the Delhi Capital Region

134
0:07:40.56,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and Mumbai.

135
0:07:42.04,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In the Middle East,

136
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Greater Tehran is absorbing one third of Iran's population.

137
0:07:46.44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Most of Egypt's 80 million people

138
0:07:48.32,000 --> 0:07:51,000
live in the corridor between Cairo and Alexandria.

139
0:07:51.36,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And in the gulf, a necklace of city-states is forming,

140
0:07:55.4,000 --> 0:07:56,000
from Bahrain and Qatar,

141
0:07:56.88,000 --> 0:07:58,000
through the United Arab Emirates to Muscat in Oman.

142
0:08:00.52,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And then there's Lagos,

143
0:08:02.8,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Africa's largest city and Nigeria's commercial hub.

144
0:08:06.68,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It has plans for a rail network

145
0:08:08.76,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that will make it the anchor of a vast Atlantic coastal corridor,

146
0:08:13.2,000 --> 0:08:16,000
stretching across Benin, Togo and Ghana,

147
0:08:16.28,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast.

148
0:08:19.76,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But these countries are suburbs of Lagos.

149
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In a megacity world,

150
0:08:25.88,000 --> 0:08:27,000
countries can be suburbs of cities.

151
0:08:30.64,000 --> 0:08:36,000
By 2030, we will have as many as 50 such megacity clusters in the world.

152
0:08:37.4,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So which map tells you more?

153
0:08:39.28,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Our traditional map of 200 discrete nations

154
0:08:42.44,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that hang on most of our walls,

155
0:08:44.36,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or this map of the 50 megacity clusters?

156
0:08:48.159,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And yet, even this is incomplete

157
0:08:50.919,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because you cannot understand any individual megacity

158
0:08:54.96,000 --> 0:08:57,000
without understanding its connections to the others.

159
0:08:58.88,000 --> 0:09:,000
People move to cities to be connected,

160
0:09:01.28,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and connectivity is why these cities thrive.

161
0:09:05.32,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Any number of them, such as Sao Paulo or Istanbul or Moscow,

162
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:13,000
has a GDP approaching or exceeding one third of one half

163
0:09:13.12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of their entire national GDP.

164
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But equally importantly,

165
0:09:17.92,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you cannot calculate any of their individual value

166
0:09:20.8,000 --> 0:09:23,000
without understanding the role of the flows of people,

167
0:09:24.48,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of finance, of technology

168
0:09:26.2,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that enable them to thrive.

169
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Take the Gauteng province of South Africa,

170
0:09:31.4,000 --> 0:09:34,000
which contains Johannesburg and the capital Pretoria.

171
0:09:34.56,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It too represents just over a third of South Africa's GDP.

172
0:09:38.52,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But equally importantly, it is home to the offices

173
0:09:41.8,000 --> 0:09:43,000
of almost every single multinational corporation

174
0:09:44.8,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that invests directly into South Africa

175
0:09:47.04,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and indeed, into the entire African continent.

176
0:09:50.68,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Cities want to be part of global value chains.

177
0:09:54.4,000 --> 0:09:57,000
They want to be part of this global division of labor.

178
0:09:58,000 --> 0:09:59,000
That is how cities think.

179
0:10:00.64,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I've never met a mayor who said to me,

180
0:10:02.48,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"I want my city to be cut off."

181
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They know that their cities belong as much

182
0:10:07.92,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to the global network civilization as to their home countries.

183
0:10:14.68,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, for many people, urbanization causes great dismay.

184
0:10:18.92,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They think cities are wrecking the planet.

185
0:10:21.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But right now,

186
0:10:23.2,000 --> 0:10:27,000
there are more than 200 intercity learning networks thriving.

187
0:10:27.48,000 --> 0:10:3,000
That is as many as the number of intergovernmental organizations

188
0:10:30.84,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that we have.

189
0:10:32.08,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And all of these intercity networks are devoted to one purpose,

190
0:10:36.48,000 --> 0:10:4,000
mankind's number one priority in the 21st century:

191
0:10:41.2,000 --> 0:10:43,000
sustainable urbanization.

192
0:10:44.68,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Is it working?

193
0:10:46.56,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Let's take climate change.

194
0:10:48.32,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We know that summit after summit in New York and Paris

195
0:10:51.08,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is not going to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

196
0:10:54.56,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But what we can see is that transferring technology

197
0:10:57.88,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and knowledge and policies between cities

198
0:11:00.52,000 --> 0:11:04,000
is how we've actually begun to reduce the carbon intensity of our economies.

199
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Cities are learning from each other.

200
0:11:07.32,000 --> 0:11:09,000
How to install zero-emissions buildings,

201
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:12,000
how to deploy electric car-sharing systems.

202
0:11:12.96,000 --> 0:11:13,000
In major Chinese cities,

203
0:11:14.2,000 --> 0:11:17,000
they're imposing quotas on the number of cars on the streets.

204
0:11:17.28,000 --> 0:11:18,000
In many Western cities,

205
0:11:18.56,000 --> 0:11:2,000
young people don't even want to drive anymore.

206
0:11:21.72,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Cities have been part of the problem,

207
0:11:23.96,000 --> 0:11:25,000
now they are part of the solution.

208
0:11:26.88,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Inequality is the other great challenge to achieving sustainable urbanization.

209
0:11:31.96,000 --> 0:11:34,000
When I travel through megacities from end to end --

210
0:11:35.4,000 --> 0:11:37,000
it takes hours and days --

211
0:11:37.52,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I experience the tragedy of extreme disparity

212
0:11:41.28,000 --> 0:11:42,000
within the same geography.

213
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And yet, our global stock of financial assets

214
0:11:47.12,000 --> 0:11:48,000
has never been larger,

215
0:11:48.6,000 --> 0:11:51,000
approaching 300 trillion dollars.

216
0:11:52.12,000 --> 0:11:55,000
That's almost four times the actual GDP of the world.

217
0:11:56.52,000 --> 0:12:,000
We have taken on such enormous debts since the financial crisis,

218
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but have we invested them in inclusive growth?

219
0:12:04.84,000 --> 0:12:06,000
No, not yet.

220
0:12:07.8,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Only when we build sufficient, affordable public housing,

221
0:12:11.64,000 --> 0:12:14,000
when we invest in robust transportation networks

222
0:12:14.8,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to allow people to connect to each other both physically and digitally,

223
0:12:19.36,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that's when our divided cities and societies

224
0:12:21.76,000 --> 0:12:22,000
will come to feel whole again.

225
0:12:23.64,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

226
0:12:27.84,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And that is why infrastructure has just been included

227
0:12:30.76,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,

228
0:12:33.24,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because it enables all the others.

229
0:12:36.08,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Our political and economic leaders

230
0:12:37.92,000 --> 0:12:4,000
are learning that connectivity is not charity,

231
0:12:41.04,000 --> 0:12:42,000
it's opportunity.

232
0:12:43.08,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And that's why our financial community needs to understand

233
0:12:45.84,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that connectivity is the most important asset class of the 21st century.

234
0:12:52.28,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Now, cities can make the world more sustainable,

235
0:12:56.6,000 --> 0:12:58,000
they can make the world more equitable,

236
0:12:58.88,000 --> 0:13:,000
I also believe that connectivity between cities

237
0:13:01.76,000 --> 0:13:02,000
can make the world more peaceful.

238
0:13:04.4,000 --> 0:13:08,000
If we look at regions of the world with dense relations across borders,

239
0:13:08.44,000 --> 0:13:1,000
we see more trade, more investment

240
0:13:11.24,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and more stability.

241
0:13:12.68,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We all know the story of Europe after World War II,

242
0:13:15.2,000 --> 0:13:17,000
where industrial integration kicked off a process

243
0:13:17.8,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that gave rise to today's peaceful European Union.

244
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And you can see that Russia, by the way,

245
0:13:23.64,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is the least connected of major powers in the international system.

246
0:13:28.24,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And that goes a long way towards explaining the tensions today.

247
0:13:32.04,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Countries that have less stake in the system

248
0:13:34.96,000 --> 0:13:36,000
also have less to lose in disturbing it.

249
0:13:38.8,000 --> 0:13:4,000
In North America, the lines that matter most on the map

250
0:13:41.64,000 --> 0:13:44,000
are not the US-Canada border or the US-Mexico border,

251
0:13:45.44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but the dense network of roads and railways and pipelines

252
0:13:48.84,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and electricity grids and even water canals

253
0:13:51.72,000 --> 0:13:54,000
that are forming an integrated North American union.

254
0:13:55.56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
North America does not need more walls, it needs more connections.

255
0:14:00.28,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

256
0:14:07.88,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But the real promise of connectivity is in the postcolonial world.

257
0:14:12.24,000 --> 0:14:16,000
All of those regions where borders have historically been the most arbitrary

258
0:14:16.6,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and where generations of leaders

259
0:14:18.56,000 --> 0:14:2,000
have had hostile relations with each other.

260
0:14:21.2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But now a new group of leaders has come into power

261
0:14:23.6,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and is burying the hatchet.

262
0:14:25.76,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Let's take Southeast Asia, where high-speed rail networks

263
0:14:28.96,000 --> 0:14:3,000
are planned to connect Bangkok to Singapore

264
0:14:31.28,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and trade corridors from Vietnam to Myanmar.

265
0:14:34.2,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Now this region of 600 million people coordinates its agricultural resources

266
0:14:39.76,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and its industrial output.

267
0:14:41.72,000 --> 0:14:45,000
It is evolving into what I call a Pax Asiana,

268
0:14:46.4,000 --> 0:14:48,000
a peace among Southeast Asian nations.

269
0:14:50.04,000 --> 0:14:53,000
A similar phenomenon is underway in East Africa,

270
0:14:53.2,000 --> 0:14:54,000
where a half dozen countries

271
0:14:54.6,000 --> 0:14:57,000
are investing in railways and multimodal corridors

272
0:14:57.92,000 --> 0:15:,000
so that landlocked countries can get their goods to market.

273
0:15:01.08,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Now these countries coordinate their utilities

274
0:15:03.68,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and their investment policies.

275
0:15:05.8,000 --> 0:15:08,000
They, too, are evolving into a Pax Africana.

276
0:15:11.2,000 --> 0:15:13,000
One region we know could especially use this kind of thinking

277
0:15:14.12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
is the Middle East.

278
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
As Arab states tragically collapse,

279
0:15:18.48,000 --> 0:15:2,000
what is left behind but the ancient cities,

280
0:15:21.24,000 --> 0:15:23,000
such as Cairo, Beirut and Baghdad?

281
0:15:24.4,000 --> 0:15:28,000
In fact, the nearly 400 million people of the Arab world

282
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
are almost entirely urbanized.

283
0:15:31.28,000 --> 0:15:32,000
As societies, as cities,

284
0:15:33.2,000 --> 0:15:35,000
they are either water rich or water poor,

285
0:15:35.48,000 --> 0:15:36,000
energy rich or energy poor.

286
0:15:38.04,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And the only way to correct these mismatches

287
0:15:40.96,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is not through more wars and more borders,

288
0:15:43.6,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but through more connectivity of pipelines and water canals.

289
0:15:48.04,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Sadly, this is not yet the map of the Middle East.

290
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:53,000
But it should be,

291
0:15:54.76,000 --> 0:15:57,000
a connected Pax Arabia,

292
0:15:58.64,000 --> 0:15:59,000
internally integrated

293
0:16:00.36,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and productively connected to its neighbors: Europe, Asia and Africa.

294
0:16:04.68,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Now, it may not seem like connectivity is what we want right now

295
0:16:07.8,000 --> 0:16:09,000
towards the world's most turbulent region.

296
0:16:10.6,000 --> 0:16:13,000
But we know from history that more connectivity is the only way

297
0:16:14.24,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to bring about stability in the long run.

298
0:16:16.76,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Because we know that in region after region,

299
0:16:19.48,000 --> 0:16:21,000
connectivity is the new reality.

300
0:16:22.44,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Cities and countries are learning to aggregate

301
0:16:25.6,000 --> 0:16:27,000
into more peaceful and prosperous wholes.

302
0:16:29.76,000 --> 0:16:31,000
But the real test is going to be Asia.

303
0:16:33.04,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Can connectivity overcome the patterns of rivalry

304
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
among the great powers of the Far East?

305
0:16:38.6,000 --> 0:16:42,000
After all, this is where World War III is supposed to break out.

306
0:16:43.92,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Since the end of the Cold War, a quarter century ago,

307
0:16:47.08,000 --> 0:16:5,000
at least six major wars have been predicted for this region.

308
0:16:50.48,000 --> 0:16:51,000
But none have broken out.

309
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Take China and Taiwan.

310
0:16:55.56,000 --> 0:16:59,000
In the 1990s, this was everyone's leading World War III scenario.

311
0:17:00.2,000 --> 0:17:01,000
But since that time,

312
0:17:01.72,000 --> 0:17:05,000
the trade and investment volumes across the straits have become so intense

313
0:17:06.24,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that last November,

314
0:17:07.48,000 --> 0:17:09,000
leaders from both sides held a historic summit

315
0:17:10.36,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to discuss eventual peaceful reunification.

316
0:17:13.96,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And even the election of a nationalist party in Taiwan

317
0:17:16.8,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that's pro-independence earlier this year

318
0:17:19.599,000 --> 0:17:21,000
does not undermine this fundamental dynamic.

319
0:17:23.359,000 --> 0:17:25,000
China and Japan have an even longer history of rivalry

320
0:17:26.28,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and have been deploying their air forces and navies

321
0:17:28.72,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to show their strength in island disputes.

322
0:17:31.52,000 --> 0:17:32,000
But in recent years,

323
0:17:32.76,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Japan has been making its largest foreign investments in China.

324
0:17:36.92,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Japanese cars are selling in record numbers there.

325
0:17:40.44,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And guess where the largest number of foreigners

326
0:17:43.4,000 --> 0:17:45,000
residing in Japan today comes from?

327
0:17:46.12,000 --> 0:17:47,000
You guessed it: China.

328
0:17:49.52,000 --> 0:17:5,000
China and India have fought a major war

329
0:17:51.44,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and have three outstanding border disputes,

330
0:17:53.52,000 --> 0:17:55,000
but today India is the second largest shareholder

331
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:58,000
in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

332
0:17:58.44,000 --> 0:18:01,000
They're building a trade corridor stretching from Northeast India

333
0:18:01.72,000 --> 0:18:04,000
through Myanmar and Bangladesh to Southern China.

334
0:18:06.32,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Their trade volume has grown from 20 billion dollars a decade ago

335
0:18:10.2,000 --> 0:18:11,000
to 80 billion dollars today.

336
0:18:12.6,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan have fought three wars

337
0:18:15.64,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and continue to dispute Kashmir,

338
0:18:17.88,000 --> 0:18:2,000
but they're also negotiating a most-favored-nation trade agreement

339
0:18:21.44,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and want to complete a pipeline

340
0:18:23.2,000 --> 0:18:26,000
stretching from Iran through Pakistan to India.

341
0:18:27.2,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And let's talk about Iran.

342
0:18:29.88,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Wasn't it just two years ago that war with Iran seemed inevitable?

343
0:18:33.76,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Then why is every single major power rushing to do business there today?

344
0:18:40.56,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

345
0:18:41.84,000 --> 0:18:45,000
I cannot guarantee that World War III will not break out.

346
0:18:46.64,000 --> 0:18:49,000
But we can definitely see why it hasn't happened yet.

347
0:18:50.68,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Even though Asia is home to the world's fastest growing militaries,

348
0:18:54.4,000 --> 0:18:57,000
these same countries are also investing billions of dollars

349
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:,000
in each other's infrastructure and supply chains.

350
0:19:00.96,000 --> 0:19:03,000
They are more interested in each other's functional geography

351
0:19:04.8,000 --> 0:19:06,000
than in their political geography.

352
0:19:07.28,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And that is why their leaders think twice, step back from the brink,

353
0:19:12.36,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and decide to focus on economic ties over territorial tensions.

354
0:19:18.44,000 --> 0:19:2,000
So often it seems like the world is falling apart,

355
0:19:21.76,000 --> 0:19:22,000
but building more connectivity

356
0:19:23.72,000 --> 0:19:26,000
is how we put Humpty Dumpty back together again,

357
0:19:27.48,000 --> 0:19:28,000
much better than before.

358
0:19:29.96,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And by wrapping the world

359
0:19:31.24,000 --> 0:19:34,000
in such seamless physical and digital connectivity,

360
0:19:34.72,000 --> 0:19:36,000
we evolve towards a world

361
0:19:36.92,000 --> 0:19:39,000
in which people can rise above their geographic constraints.

362
0:19:40.92,000 --> 0:19:43,000
We are the cells and vessels

363
0:19:44.12,000 --> 0:19:47,000
pulsing through these global connectivity networks.

364
0:19:47.36,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Everyday, hundreds of millions of people go online

365
0:19:51.04,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and work with people they've never met.

366
0:19:53.68,000 --> 0:19:56,000
More than one billion people cross borders every year,

367
0:19:57.2,000 --> 0:20:,000
and that's expected to rise to three billion in the coming decade.

368
0:20:02.2,000 --> 0:20:04,000
We don't just build connectivity,

369
0:20:04.72,000 --> 0:20:05,000
we embody it.

370
0:20:06.96,000 --> 0:20:09,000
We are the global network civilization,

371
0:20:10.32,000 --> 0:20:11,000
and this is our map.

372
0:20:13.24,000 --> 0:20:17,000
A map of the world in which geography is no longer destiny.

373
0:20:18.56,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Instead, the future has a new and more hopeful motto:

374
0:20:23.4,000 --> 0:20:24,000
connectivity is destiny.

375
0:20:26.04,000 --> 0:20:27,000
Thank you.

376
0:20:27.28,000 --> 0:20:33,000
(Applause)

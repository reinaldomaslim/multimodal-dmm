1
0:00:13.542,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There are 39 million people in the world

2
0:00:16.386,000 --> 0:00:17,000
who are blind.

3
0:00:17.876,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Eighty percent of them

4
0:00:20.35,000 --> 0:00:22,000
are living in low-income countries such as Kenya,

5
0:00:23.169,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and the absolute majority

6
0:00:25.118,000 --> 0:00:26,000
do not need to be blind.

7
0:00:26.625,000 --> 0:00:27,000
They are blind from diseases

8
0:00:28.48,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that are either completely curable or preventable.

9
0:00:32.256,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Knowing this, with my young family,

10
0:00:34.768,000 --> 0:00:35,000
we moved to Kenya.

11
0:00:36.162,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We secured equipment,

12
0:00:37.969,000 --> 0:00:4,000
funds, vehicles, we trained a team,

13
0:00:41.668,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we set up a hundred clinics throughout

14
0:00:43.692,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the Great Rift Valley

15
0:00:45.19,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to try and understand a single question:

16
0:00:48.651,000 --> 0:00:5,000
why are people going blind,

17
0:00:50.737,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and what can we do?

18
0:00:53.656,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The challenges were great.

19
0:00:56.57,000 --> 0:00:57,000
When we got to where we were going,

20
0:00:58.401,000 --> 0:01:,000
we set up our high-tech equipment.

21
0:01:01.067,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Power was rarely available.

22
0:01:03.246,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We'd have to run our equipment

23
0:01:04.099,000 --> 0:01:06,000
from petrol power generators.

24
0:01:06.999,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And then something occurred to me:

25
0:01:08.946,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There has to be an easier way,

26
0:01:11.441,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because it's the patients who are the most in need

27
0:01:13.441,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of access to eye care

28
0:01:14.999,000 --> 0:01:16,000
who are the least likely to get it.

29
0:01:17.34,000 --> 0:01:18,000
More people in Kenya,

30
0:01:18.446,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and in sub-Saharan Africa,

31
0:01:20.358,000 --> 0:01:21,000
have access to a mobile phone

32
0:01:22.149,000 --> 0:01:24,000
than they do clean running water.

33
0:01:24.302,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So we said, could we harness

34
0:01:26.021,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the power of mobile technology

35
0:01:27.64,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to deliver eye care in a new way?

36
0:01:29.791,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And so we developed Peek,

37
0:01:31.576,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a smartphone [system] that enables

38
0:01:34.114,000 --> 0:01:35,000
community healthcare workers

39
0:01:35.626,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and empowers them to deliver eye care everywhere.

40
0:01:39.456,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We set about replacing traditional hospital equipment,

41
0:01:42.126,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which is bulky, expensive and fragile,

42
0:01:44.649,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with smartphone apps and hardware

43
0:01:46.684,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that make it possible to test anyone

44
0:01:48.821,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in any language and of any age.

45
0:01:52.01,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Here we have a demonstration

46
0:01:53.814,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of a three-month-old having their vision

47
0:01:55.537,000 --> 0:01:59,000
accurately tested using an app and an eye tracker.

48
0:02:03.65,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We've got many trials going on

49
0:02:05.393,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in the community and in schools,

50
0:02:07.593,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and through the lessons that we've learned in the field,

51
0:02:09.493,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we've realized it's extremely important

52
0:02:11.196,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to share the data in non-medical jargon

53
0:02:14.056,000 --> 0:02:15,000
so that people understand

54
0:02:15.717,000 --> 0:02:17,000
what we're examining and what that means to them.

55
0:02:18.34,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So here, for example,

56
0:02:19.614,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we use our sight sim application,

57
0:02:21.47,000 --> 0:02:22,000
once your vision has been measured,

58
0:02:23.262,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to show carers and teachers

59
0:02:25.972,000 --> 0:02:27,000
what the visual world is like for that person,

60
0:02:28.486,000 --> 0:02:31,000
so they can empathize with them and help them.

61
0:02:31.952,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Once we've discovered somebody has low vision,

62
0:02:34.34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the next big challenge is to work out why,

63
0:02:36.911,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and to be able to do that,

64
0:02:38.028,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we need to have access to the inside of the eye.

65
0:02:40.529,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Traditionally, this requires expensive equipment

66
0:02:43.115,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to examine an area called the retina.

67
0:02:45.196,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The retina is the single part of the eye that has

68
0:02:48.005,000 --> 0:02:5,000
huge amounts of information about the body

69
0:02:50.101,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and its health.

70
0:02:51.889,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We've developed 3D-printed,

71
0:02:53.7,000 --> 0:02:54,000
low-cost hardware

72
0:02:55.141,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that comes in at less than five dollars to produce,

73
0:02:57.541,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which can then be clipped onto a smartphone

74
0:03:00.484,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and makes it possible to get views

75
0:03:01.926,000 --> 0:03:02,000
of the back of the eye

76
0:03:03.147,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of a very high quality.

77
0:03:04.903,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the beauty is, anybody can do it.

78
0:03:08.1,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In our trials on over two and half thousand people,

79
0:03:10.979,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the smartphone with the add-on clip

80
0:03:12.896,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is comparable to a camera

81
0:03:14.577,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that is hugely more expensive

82
0:03:16.472,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and hugely more difficult to transport.

83
0:03:20.061,000 --> 0:03:21,000
When we first moved to Kenya,

84
0:03:21.94,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we went with 150,000 dollars of equipment,

85
0:03:24.593,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a team of 15 people,

86
0:03:27.05,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and that was what was needed to deliver health care.

87
0:03:29.942,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, all that's needed

88
0:03:32.307,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is a single person

89
0:03:34.099,000 --> 0:03:37,000
on a bike with a smartphone.

90
0:03:37.495,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And it costs just 500 dollars.

91
0:03:41.349,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The issue of power supply

92
0:03:43.219,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is overcome by harnessing the power of solar.

93
0:03:45.78,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Our healthcare workers travel

94
0:03:46.92,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with a solar-powered rucksack

95
0:03:48.465,000 --> 0:03:5,000
which keeps the phone charged and backed up.

96
0:03:50.926,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now we go to the patient

97
0:03:53.196,000 --> 0:03:55,000
rather than waiting for the patient never to come.

98
0:03:55.907,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We go to them in their homes

99
0:03:57.64,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and we give them the most comprehensive,

100
0:03:59.437,000 --> 0:04:,000
high-tech, accurate examination,

101
0:04:01.377,000 --> 0:04:05,000
which can be delivered by anyone with minimal training.

102
0:04:05.481,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We can link global experts

103
0:04:08.318,000 --> 0:04:09,000
with people in the most rural,

104
0:04:10.06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
difficult-to-reach places

105
0:04:11.25,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that are beyond the end of the road,

106
0:04:12.839,000 --> 0:04:14,000
effectively putting those experts in their homes,

107
0:04:15.353,000 --> 0:04:16,000
allowing us to make diagnoses

108
0:04:17.331,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and make plans for treatment.

109
0:04:20.399,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Project managers, hospital directors,

110
0:04:23.126,000 --> 0:04:24,000
are able to search on our interface

111
0:04:25.045,000 --> 0:04:27,000
by any parameter they may be interested in.

112
0:04:27.047,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Here in Nakuru, where I've been living,

113
0:04:29.07,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we can search for people

114
0:04:30.406,000 --> 0:04:31,000
by whatever condition.

115
0:04:31.85,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Here are people who are blind

116
0:04:33.122,000 --> 0:04:35,000
from a curable condition cataract.

117
0:04:35.652,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Each red pin depicts somebody

118
0:04:37.681,000 --> 0:04:39,000
who is blind from a disease that is curable

119
0:04:40.338,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and treatable, and they're locatable.

120
0:04:42.584,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We can use bulk text messaging services

121
0:04:44.468,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to explain that we're coming to arrange a treatment.

122
0:04:47.622,000 --> 0:04:49,000
What's more, we've learned that this is something

123
0:04:50.237,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that we haven't built just for the community

124
0:04:52.275,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but with the community.

125
0:04:53.86,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Those blue pins that drop represent

126
0:04:56.112,000 --> 0:04:58,000
elders, or local leaders,

127
0:04:58.213,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that are connected to those people

128
0:04:59.452,000 --> 0:05:,000
who can ensure that we can find them

129
0:05:00.785,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and arrange treatment.

130
0:05:02.886,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So for patients like Mama Wangari,

131
0:05:05.888,000 --> 0:05:06,000
who have been blind for over 10 years

132
0:05:07.484,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and never seen her grandchildren,

133
0:05:09.113,000 --> 0:05:12,000
for less than 40 dollars, we can restore her eyesight.

134
0:05:12.931,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This is something that has to happen.

135
0:05:18.209,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's only in statistics

136
0:05:19.84,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that people go blind by the millions.

137
0:05:22.563,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The reality is everyone goes blind on their own.

138
0:05:26.431,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But now, they might just be

139
0:05:28.408,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a text message away from help.

140
0:05:30.547,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

141
0:05:37.295,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And now because live demos are always a bad idea,

142
0:05:39.426,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we're going to try a live demo.

143
0:05:41.224,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

144
0:05:42.48,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So here we have the Peek Vision app.

145
0:05:52.142,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Okay, and what we're looking at here,

146
0:05:54.786,000 --> 0:05:55,000
this is Sam's optic nerve,

147
0:05:56.281,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which is a direct extension of her brain,

148
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
so I'm actually looking at her brain as we look there.

149
0:06:01.289,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We can see all parts of the retina.

150
0:06:04.82,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It makes it possible to pick up diseases

151
0:06:07.35,000 --> 0:06:09,000
of the eye and of the body

152
0:06:09.517,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that would not be possible without access to the eye,

153
0:06:12.046,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and that clip-on device can be manufactured

154
0:06:13.981,000 --> 0:06:14,000
for just a few dollars,

155
0:06:15.531,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and people can be cured of blindness,

156
0:06:17.162,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and I think it says a lot about us as a human race

157
0:06:20.385,000 --> 0:06:22,000
if we've developed cures and we don't deliver them.

158
0:06:22.91,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But now we can.

159
0:06:24.108,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Thank you.

160
0:06:26.324,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.166,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It was a Thursday,

2
0:00:15.546,000 --> 0:00:18,000
June the 23rd, 1994.

3
0:00:23.086,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Sighs)

4
0:00:24.269,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"Collect your belongings. You are free to go.

5
0:00:28.808,000 --> 0:00:32,000
When escorted outside, go directly to your car.

6
0:00:32.933,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Do not talk to reporters."

7
0:00:36.983,000 --> 0:00:37,000
My head is spinning,

8
0:00:38.551,000 --> 0:00:39,000
my heart is racing,

9
0:00:40.054,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I can't get a breath.

10
0:00:43.108,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I just want out of there.

11
0:00:47.589,000 --> 0:00:48,000
When I get to my car,

12
0:00:49.521,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I throw everything on the back,

13
0:00:52.45,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and I just collapse into the driver's seat.

14
0:00:55.637,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"I can't do this.

15
0:00:57.368,000 --> 0:01:,000
I can't go home to my family

16
0:01:02.231,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that I haven't seen in a week

17
0:01:06.455,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and pretend to be happy."

18
0:01:10.764,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Not even their love and support

19
0:01:14.237,000 --> 0:01:16,000
could help me at this particular time.

20
0:01:19.592,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We had just sentenced a man to death.

21
0:01:26.21,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now what?

22
0:01:28.909,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Just go home and wash dishes?

23
0:01:32.772,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You see, in Mississippi,

24
0:01:37.423,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the death penalty is like a part of our unspoken culture.

25
0:01:43.821,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The basic logic is, if you murder someone,

26
0:01:47.472,000 --> 0:01:49,000
then you're going to receive the death penalty.

27
0:01:51.744,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So when the jury selection process took place,

28
0:01:57.623,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they asked me,

29
0:02:01.646,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Could you,

30
0:02:03.505,000 --> 0:02:08,000
if the evidence presented justified the death penalty,

31
0:02:09.028,000 --> 0:02:11,000
could you deliver,

32
0:02:11.386,000 --> 0:02:13,000
rationally and without reservations,

33
0:02:13.91,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a penalty of death?"

34
0:02:17.545,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My answer was an astounding "yes,"

35
0:02:21.676,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and I was selected as Juror Number 2.

36
0:02:26.41,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The trial started.

37
0:02:28.559,000 --> 0:02:3,000
From the evidence being presented

38
0:02:32.106,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and from the pictures of the victim,

39
0:02:34.95,000 --> 0:02:38,000
my first response was, "Yes, this man is a monster,

40
0:02:39.933,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and he deserves the death penalty."

41
0:02:44.082,000 --> 0:02:48,000
For days, I sat and looked at his hands,

42
0:02:48.75,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the ones that yielded the knife,

43
0:02:53.883,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and against his pasty white skin,

44
0:02:58.589,000 --> 0:02:59,000
his eyes ...

45
0:03:00.82,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Well, he spent endless days in his cell,

46
0:03:04.2,000 --> 0:03:05,000
no sunlight,

47
0:03:05.806,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so his eyes were as black as his hair and his mustache.

48
0:03:10.609,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He was very intimidating,

49
0:03:14.424,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and there was absolutely no doubt in his guilt.

50
0:03:21.037,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But regardless of his guilt,

51
0:03:23.44,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as the days passed,

52
0:03:26.435,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I began to see this monster

53
0:03:30.684,000 --> 0:03:31,000
as a human being.

54
0:03:34.014,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Something inside of me was changing that I just didn't understand.

55
0:03:39.106,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I was beginning to question myself

56
0:03:41.584,000 --> 0:03:45,000
as to whether or not I wanted to give this man the death penalty.

57
0:03:47.713,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Jury deliberations began,

58
0:03:50.556,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the judge gave us jury instructions

59
0:03:56.397,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and it was to be used as a tool

60
0:03:59.178,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in how to reach a verdict.

61
0:04:02.869,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Well, using this tool only led to one decision,

62
0:04:07.554,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and that was the death penalty.

63
0:04:10.506,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I felt backed into a corner.

64
0:04:13.176,000 --> 0:04:16,000
My head and my heart were in conflict with each other,

65
0:04:16.624,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and the thought of the death penalty

66
0:04:18.783,000 --> 0:04:19,000
made me sick.

67
0:04:23.369,000 --> 0:04:27,000
However, following the judge's instructions,

68
0:04:28.172,000 --> 0:04:3,000
being a law-abiding person,

69
0:04:31.972,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I gave up.

70
0:04:34.39,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I gave up and voted along with the other 11 jurors.

71
0:04:40.608,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And there it was:

72
0:04:42.754,000 --> 0:04:46,000
our broken judicial system at work.

73
0:04:50.021,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So here I am in my car,

74
0:04:52.41,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and I'm wondering:

75
0:04:54.041,000 --> 0:04:58,000
How is my life ever going to be the same?

76
0:04:59.049,000 --> 0:05:04,000
My life was kids, work, church, ball games --

77
0:05:04.521,000 --> 0:05:07,000
just your average, normal, everyday life.

78
0:05:08.998,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now everything felt trivial.

79
0:05:11.466,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I was going down this rabbit hole.

80
0:05:14.978,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The anger, the anxiety,

81
0:05:18.374,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the guilt, the depression ...

82
0:05:21.232,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it just clung to me.

83
0:05:23.989,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I knew that my life had to resume,

84
0:05:29.038,000 --> 0:05:3,000
so I sought counseling.

85
0:05:31.252,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The counselor diagnosed me with PTSD

86
0:05:35.217,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and told me that the best way to overcome the PTSD

87
0:05:40.541,000 --> 0:05:41,000
was to talk about the trauma.

88
0:05:43.559,000 --> 0:05:48,000
However, if I talked or tried to talk about the trauma

89
0:05:48.976,000 --> 0:05:49,000
outside her office,

90
0:05:50.424,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I was shut down.

91
0:05:52.285,000 --> 0:05:54,000
No one wanted to hear about it.

92
0:05:55.03,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He was just a murderer. Get over it.

93
0:05:59.513,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It was then that I decided to become a silent survivor.

94
0:06:06.263,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Twelve years later, 2006,

95
0:06:09.953,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I learned that Bobby Wilcher had dropped all of his appeals,

96
0:06:15.053,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and his execution date was approaching.

97
0:06:19.291,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That was like a punch in the stomach.

98
0:06:22.143,000 --> 0:06:25,000
All of those buried feelings just started coming back.

99
0:06:27.943,000 --> 0:06:31,000
To try and find peace, I called Bobby's attorney, and I said,

100
0:06:32.824,000 --> 0:06:34,000
"Can I see Bobby before he's executed?"

101
0:06:36.47,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Driving to the penitentiary on the day of his execution,

102
0:06:41.285,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in my mind,

103
0:06:42.853,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Bobby was going to be manic.

104
0:06:45.975,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But, surprisingly, he was very calm.

105
0:06:50.967,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And for two hours, he and I sat there and talked about life,

106
0:06:56.753,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and I got to ask him to forgive me for my hand in his death.

107
0:07:04.212,000 --> 0:07:05,000
His words to me were:

108
0:07:06.748,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"You don't have to apologize.

109
0:07:08.996,000 --> 0:07:09,000
You didn't put me here.

110
0:07:10.95,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I did this myself.

111
0:07:14.032,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But if it'll make you feel better,

112
0:07:15.885,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I forgive you."

113
0:07:19.097,000 --> 0:07:2,000
On my way home,

114
0:07:20.899,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I stopped by a restaurant and bought a margarita.

115
0:07:24.909,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:29.107,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I don't think I could get one big enough --

117
0:07:31.228,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

118
0:07:32.447,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to try and calm down.

119
0:07:35.411,000 --> 0:07:36,000
My phone rang.

120
0:07:38.244,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It was Bobby's attorney.

121
0:07:41.18,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Within two minutes of his execution,

122
0:07:44.206,000 --> 0:07:46,000
they had given him a stay.

123
0:07:48.456,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This stay gave me time

124
0:07:52.377,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to reach out to Bobby.

125
0:07:55.319,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And as crazy as it may sound,

126
0:07:57.484,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we became friends.

127
0:08:00.936,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Three months later,

128
0:08:02.944,000 --> 0:08:04,000
he was executed by the State of Mississippi.

129
0:08:07.415,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I'm here to tell you my story,

130
0:08:13.163,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because it was precisely 22 years later

131
0:08:18.249,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that I even wanted to open up enough to talk about it,

132
0:08:23.148,000 --> 0:08:25,000
when a friend encouraged me.

133
0:08:26.109,000 --> 0:08:3,000
"Hey, perhaps you need to talk to the other jurors.

134
0:08:30.248,000 --> 0:08:32,000
You've been through the same experience."

135
0:08:33.859,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Uncertain of what I was after,

136
0:08:36.547,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I did need to talk to them.

137
0:08:39.198,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So I set out on my quest,

138
0:08:42.587,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and I actually found most of them.

139
0:08:45.117,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The first juror I met

140
0:08:47.659,000 --> 0:08:49,000
thought that Bobby got what he deserved.

141
0:08:50.61,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Another juror --

142
0:08:53.339,000 --> 0:08:56,000
well, they just kind of regretted that it took so long

143
0:08:57.076,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to carry the sentence out.

144
0:08:59.371,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Then one juror, and I don't know what was wrong with him,

145
0:09:02.139,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but he didn't remember anything about the trial.

146
0:09:04.526,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Laughter)

147
0:09:06.449,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Well,

148
0:09:08.902,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I'm thinking in my mind,

149
0:09:10.626,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"Jeez, is this the response I'm gonna get from everybody else?"

150
0:09:15.898,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Well, thank God for Allen.

151
0:09:19.598,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Allen was a gentle soul.

152
0:09:22.956,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And when I talked to him, he was genuinely upset

153
0:09:26.683,000 --> 0:09:27,000
about our decision.

154
0:09:29.121,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And he told me about the day that the devastation

155
0:09:33.939,000 --> 0:09:36,000
really set in on him and hit him.

156
0:09:37.927,000 --> 0:09:39,000
He was listening to the radio,

157
0:09:40.195,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and the radio had a list of names of men to be executed

158
0:09:45.586,000 --> 0:09:46,000
at Parchman Penitentiary.

159
0:09:49.37,000 --> 0:09:51,000
He heard Bobby's name,

160
0:09:51.451,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and he then truly realized what he had done.

161
0:09:55.101,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And he said, "You know, I had a responsibility in that man's death."

162
0:10:01.325,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Now here it is, 20-something years later,

163
0:10:03.964,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and Allen is still dealing with that issue.

164
0:10:08.134,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And he's never told anyone about it, not even his wife.

165
0:10:14.065,000 --> 0:10:15,000
He also told me

166
0:10:15.503,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that if the State of Mississippi wanted to keep the death penalty,

167
0:10:18.673,000 --> 0:10:23,000
then hey, they needed to provide counseling for the jurors.

168
0:10:24.941,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Then the next juror I met was Jane.

169
0:10:27.934,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Jane is now totally against the death penalty,

170
0:10:31.273,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And there was Bill.

171
0:10:33.394,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Bill said he had this crushing depression for weeks,

172
0:10:38.677,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and when he went back to work,

173
0:10:40.784,000 --> 0:10:43,000
his colleagues would say things to him like,

174
0:10:44.115,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Hey, did you fry him?"

175
0:10:45.923,000 --> 0:10:46,000
To them, it was just a joke.

176
0:10:48.885,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Then there was Jon.

177
0:10:50.701,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Jon said his decision weighed on him,

178
0:10:55.104,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and it burdened him daily.

179
0:10:58.558,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The final juror that I spoke to was Ken.

180
0:11:01.643,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Ken was the foreman of the jury.

181
0:11:05.078,000 --> 0:11:06,000
When we sat down to talk,

182
0:11:08.485,000 --> 0:11:14,000
it was apparent that he was deeply saddened by what we were required to do.

183
0:11:15.49,000 --> 0:11:19,000
He relived the day that he left the courthouse

184
0:11:19.914,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and he drove home

185
0:11:21.768,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and he went to put his key in his door and unlock it,

186
0:11:24.878,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and he said he literally broke down.

187
0:11:30.237,000 --> 0:11:33,000
He said he knew that Bobby was guilty,

188
0:11:33.413,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but the decision he made,

189
0:11:35.532,000 --> 0:11:38,000
he did not know if it was the right decision.

190
0:11:40.098,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And he said that he played it over and over in his head.

191
0:11:43.989,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Did we do the right thing?

192
0:11:46.777,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Did we do the right thing?

193
0:11:49.554,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Did we do the right thing?

194
0:11:55.966,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Sighs)

195
0:11:58.395,000 --> 0:11:59,000
All those years,

196
0:12:00.738,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and I finally realized that I was not the only disillusioned juror.

197
0:12:06.778,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And we talked about sharing our experience

198
0:12:11.634,000 --> 0:12:13,000
with potential jurors

199
0:12:15.392,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to give them some insight into what to expect,

200
0:12:20.006,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and to tell them do not be complacent;

201
0:12:23.703,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to know what you believe;

202
0:12:26.635,000 --> 0:12:29,000
to know where you stand and be prepared,

203
0:12:31.318,000 --> 0:12:37,000
because you don't want to walk in one morning as a juror

204
0:12:37.478,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and leave at the end of the trial feeling like a murderer.

205
0:12:42.595,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Now, through this storm in my life, I did find some inspiration,

206
0:12:46.612,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and it came in the form of my granddaughters.

207
0:12:50.669,000 --> 0:12:52,000
My 14-year-old granddaughter, Maddie,

208
0:12:53.73,000 --> 0:12:56,000
was writing an essay on the death penalty for school,

209
0:12:57.171,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and she was asking me questions.

210
0:12:59.94,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Well, it dawned on me that this child was being raised

211
0:13:03.22,000 --> 0:13:07,000
in the same eye-for-an-eye culture

212
0:13:08.003,000 --> 0:13:09,000
as I was,

213
0:13:09.592,000 --> 0:13:1,000
or had been.

214
0:13:12.467,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And so I explained my experience to her this way:

215
0:13:16.927,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that I had sentenced someone to death

216
0:13:21.761,000 --> 0:13:23,000
as I served on a jury.

217
0:13:24.144,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And I asked her,

218
0:13:26.479,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"Did that make me a murderer?"

219
0:13:29.602,000 --> 0:13:3,000
She couldn't answer.

220
0:13:31.645,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I knew then that this topic needed to be open for discussion.

221
0:13:36.411,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And guess what happened?

222
0:13:38.574,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I got invited to speak, just recently,

223
0:13:42.358,000 --> 0:13:44,000
in an abolitionist community.

224
0:13:45.503,000 --> 0:13:47,000
While I was there, I got a T-shirt.

225
0:13:48.706,000 --> 0:13:5,000
It says, "Stop Executions."

226
0:13:52.031,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Well, when I get home, my 16-year-old granddaughter was there, Anna,

227
0:13:56.746,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and she says, "Can I have that shirt?"

228
0:14:00.065,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Well, I looked at her dad --

229
0:14:02.557,000 --> 0:14:03,000
her dad is my son --

230
0:14:04.829,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and I knew that he is still dealing with this death penalty issue.

231
0:14:09.812,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So I turned around and I looked at her, and I said,

232
0:14:12.507,000 --> 0:14:13,000
"Are you gonna wear this?"

233
0:14:14.726,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So she turned and she looked at her dad, and she said,

234
0:14:18.15,000 --> 0:14:19,000
"Dad, I know how you feel,

235
0:14:19.46,000 --> 0:14:23,000
but I don't believe in the death penalty."

236
0:14:24.337,000 --> 0:14:27,000
My son looked at me,

237
0:14:27.472,000 --> 0:14:29,000
shook his head, and said,

238
0:14:31.719,000 --> 0:14:32,000
"Thanks, Mom."

239
0:14:34.124,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And I knew it wasn't a nice "Thanks, Mom."

240
0:14:37.509,000 --> 0:14:38,000
(Laughter)

241
0:14:39.964,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So I learned that life had taught me some lessons.

242
0:14:46.18,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It taught me, if I had not served on that jury,

243
0:14:51.596,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that I would still be of the same mindset.

244
0:14:57.002,000 --> 0:14:59,000
It also gave me confidence

245
0:14:59.642,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to be able to see through the eyes of my granddaughters,

246
0:15:03.879,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that this younger generation, they're capable and they're willing

247
0:15:09.03,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to tackle these difficult social issues.

248
0:15:14.201,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And because of my experience,

249
0:15:16.593,000 --> 0:15:17,000
my granddaughters,

250
0:15:18.859,000 --> 0:15:23,000
they're now more equipped to stand on their own

251
0:15:23.93,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and to think for themselves

252
0:15:26.397,000 --> 0:15:3,000
than to rely on cultural beliefs.

253
0:15:32.134,000 --> 0:15:33,000
So:

254
0:15:34.115,000 --> 0:15:37,000
being from a conservative, Christian family

255
0:15:38.452,000 --> 0:15:42,000
from a very conservative state in the United States,

256
0:15:44.415,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I am here to tell you

257
0:15:45.922,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that the death penalty has new opponents.

258
0:15:51.542,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Thank you.

259
0:15:52.74,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Applause)

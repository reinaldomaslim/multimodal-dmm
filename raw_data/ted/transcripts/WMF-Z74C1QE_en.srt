2
0:00:15.648,000 --> 0:00:18,000
As it turns out, when tens of millions of people are unemployed

3
0:00:19.252,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or underemployed,

4
0:00:20.81,000 --> 0:00:23,000
there's a fair amount of interest in what technology might be doing

5
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to the labor force.

6
0:00:25.186,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And as I look at the conversation,

7
0:00:27.099,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it strikes me that it's focused on exactly the right topic,

8
0:00:30.803,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and at the same time, it's missing the point entirely.

9
0:00:33.652,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The topic that it's focused on,

10
0:00:35.217,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the question is whether or not all these digital technologies are affecting

11
0:00:39.724,000 --> 0:00:41,000
people's ability to earn a living,

12
0:00:41.765,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or, to say it a little bit different way,

13
0:00:43.774,000 --> 0:00:45,000
are the droids taking our jobs?

14
0:00:45.887,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And there's some evidence that they are.

15
0:00:47.848,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The Great Recession ended when American GDP resumed

16
0:00:51.917,000 --> 0:00:53,000
its kind of slow, steady march upward,

17
0:00:54.808,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and some other economic indicators also started to rebound,

18
0:00:58.102,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they got kind of healthy kind of quickly.

19
0:01:00.419,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Corporate profits are quite high;

20
0:01:02.61,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in fact, if you include bank profits,

21
0:01:04.53,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they're higher than they've ever been.

22
0:01:06.545,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And business investment in gear -- in equipment

23
0:01:10.056,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and hardware and software -- is at an all-time high.

24
0:01:12.924,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So the businesses are getting out their checkbooks.

25
0:01:16.263,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What they're not really doing is hiring.

26
0:01:18.661,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So this red line

27
0:01:19.836,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is the employment-to-population ratio,

28
0:01:22.398,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in other words, the percentage of working-age people in America

29
0:01:26.551,000 --> 0:01:27,000
who have work.

30
0:01:27.961,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And we see that it cratered during the Great Recession,

31
0:01:31.091,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and it hasn't started to bounce back at all.

32
0:01:34.012,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But the story is not just a recession story.

33
0:01:36.955,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The decade that we've just been through had

34
0:01:39.059,000 --> 0:01:42,000
relatively anemic job growth all throughout,

35
0:01:42.296,000 --> 0:01:44,000
especially when we compare it to other decades,

36
0:01:44.943,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and the 2000s are the only time we have on record

37
0:01:47.997,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where there were fewer people working at the end of the decade

38
0:01:51.553,000 --> 0:01:52,000
than at the beginning.

39
0:01:52.979,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is not what you want to see.

40
0:01:54.984,000 --> 0:01:57,000
When you graph the number of potential employees

41
0:01:58.391,000 --> 0:02:,000
versus the number of jobs in the country,

42
0:02:00.971,000 --> 0:02:03,000
you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time,

43
0:02:04.845,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and then, during the Great Recession, it opened up in a huge way.

44
0:02:08.179,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I did some quick calculations.

45
0:02:09.663,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I took the last 20 years of GDP growth

46
0:02:12.119,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the last 20 years of labor-productivity growth

47
0:02:15.415,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and used those in a fairly straightforward way

48
0:02:18.157,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to try to project how many jobs the economy was going to need

49
0:02:21.204,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to keep growing,

50
0:02:22.531,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and this is the line that I came up with.

51
0:02:24.68,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Is that good or bad?

52
0:02:26.446,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is the government's projection

53
0:02:28.381,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for the working-age population going forward.

54
0:02:31.741,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So if these predictions are accurate, that gap is not going to close.

55
0:02:36.863,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The problem is, I don't think these projections are accurate.

56
0:02:39.913,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In particular, I think my projection is way too optimistic,

57
0:02:43.416,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because when I did it,

58
0:02:44.887,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I was assuming that the future was kind of going to look like the past,

59
0:02:49.129,000 --> 0:02:5,000
with labor productivity growth,

60
0:02:50.822,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and that's actually not what I believe.

61
0:02:52.717,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Because when I look around,

62
0:02:54.09,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I think that we ain't seen nothing yet

63
0:02:56.334,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when it comes to technology's impact on the labor force.

64
0:02:59.962,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Just in the past couple years, we've seen digital tools

65
0:03:03.957,000 --> 0:03:07,000
display skills and abilities that they never, ever had before,

66
0:03:08.214,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and that kind of eat deeply into what we human beings

67
0:03:11.748,000 --> 0:03:12,000
do for a living.

68
0:03:13.054,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Let me give you a couple examples.

69
0:03:15.004,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Throughout all of history,

70
0:03:16.28,000 --> 0:03:19,000
if you wanted something translated from one language into another,

71
0:03:19.854,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you had to involve a human being.

72
0:03:21.93,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now we have multi-language, instantaneous,

73
0:03:25.082,000 --> 0:03:29,000
automatic translation services available for free

74
0:03:29.526,000 --> 0:03:32,000
via many of our devices, all the way down to smartphones.

75
0:03:32.693,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And if any of us have used these,

76
0:03:34.513,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we know that they're not perfect, but they're decent.

77
0:03:38.54,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Throughout all of history, if you wanted something written,

78
0:03:41.536,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a report or an article, you had to involve a person.

79
0:03:45.418,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Not anymore.

80
0:03:46.595,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This is an article that appeared in Forbes online a while back,

81
0:03:49.592,000 --> 0:03:5,000
about Apple's earnings.

82
0:03:50.792,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It was written by an algorithm.

83
0:03:52.98,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And it's not decent -- it's perfect.

84
0:03:57.009,000 --> 0:03:59,000
A lot of people look at this and they say,

85
0:03:59.062,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"OK, but those are very specific, narrow tasks,

86
0:04:01.391,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and most knowledge workers are actually generalists.

87
0:04:04.326,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And what they do is sit on top of a very large body of expertise and knowledge

88
0:04:08.542,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and they use that to react on the fly to kind of unpredictable demands,

89
0:04:12.363,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and that's very, very hard to automate."

90
0:04:15.063,000 --> 0:04:17,000
One of the most impressive knowledge workers in recent memory

91
0:04:17.992,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is a guy named Ken Jennings.

92
0:04:19.537,000 --> 0:04:23,000
He won the quiz show "Jeopardy!" 74 times in a row.

93
0:04:24.87,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Took home three million dollars.

94
0:04:27.084,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That's Ken on the right, getting beat three-to-one

95
0:04:30.879,000 --> 0:04:34,000
by Watson, the Jeopardy-playing supercomputer from IBM.

96
0:04:35.902,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So when we look at what technology can do to general knowledge workers,

97
0:04:39.441,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I start to think there might not be something so special

98
0:04:42.543,000 --> 0:04:43,000
about this idea of a generalist,

99
0:04:44.335,000 --> 0:04:48,000
particularly when we start doing things like hooking Siri up to Watson,

100
0:04:48.689,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and having technologies that can understand what we're saying

101
0:04:51.982,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and repeat speech back to us.

102
0:04:53.99,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, Siri is far from perfect, and we can make fun of her flaws,

103
0:04:57.917,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but we should also keep in mind

104
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that if technologies like Siri and Watson improve along a Moore's law trajectory,

105
0:05:04.828,000 --> 0:05:05,000
which they will,

106
0:05:06.374,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in six years, they're not going to be two times better or four times better,

107
0:05:09.988,000 --> 0:05:12,000
they'll be 16 times better than they are right now.

108
0:05:13.482,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So I start to think a lot of knowledge work is going to be affected by this.

109
0:05:17.352,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And digital technologies are not just impacting knowledge work,

110
0:05:21.112,000 --> 0:05:24,000
they're starting to flex their muscles in the physical world as well.

111
0:05:24.875,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I had the chance a little while back to ride in the Google autonomous car,

112
0:05:28.624,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which is as cool as it sounds.

113
0:05:30.925,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:33.137,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I will vouch that it handled the stop-and-go traffic on US 101

115
0:05:37.582,000 --> 0:05:38,000
very smoothly.

116
0:05:38.859,000 --> 0:05:41,000
There are about three and a half million people who drive trucks for a living

117
0:05:42.534,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in the United States;

118
0:05:43.709,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I think some of them are going to be affected by this technology.

119
0:05:46.801,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And right now, humanoid robots are still incredibly primitive.

120
0:05:49.925,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They can't do very much.

121
0:05:51.906,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But they're getting better quite quickly

122
0:05:53.902,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and DARPA, which is the investment arm of the Defense Department,

123
0:05:57.463,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is trying to accelerate their trajectory.

124
0:05:59.464,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So, in short, yeah, the droids are coming for our jobs.

125
0:06:05.105,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In the short term, we can stimulate job growth

126
0:06:08.021,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by encouraging entrepreneurship

127
0:06:10.182,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and by investing in infrastructure,

128
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because the robots today still aren't very good at fixing bridges.

129
0:06:15.682,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But in the not-too-long-term,

130
0:06:17.604,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I think within the lifetimes of most of the people in this room,

131
0:06:21.53,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we're going to transition into an economy that is very productive,

132
0:06:25.102,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but that just doesn't need a lot of human workers.

133
0:06:28.02,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And managing that transition is going to be the greatest challenge

134
0:06:31.156,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that our society faces.

135
0:06:32.718,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Voltaire summarized why; he said,

136
0:06:34.692,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"Work saves us from three great evils: boredom, vice and need."

137
0:06:40.43,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But despite this challenge --

138
0:06:42.511,000 --> 0:06:44,000
personally, I'm still a huge digital optimist,

139
0:06:45.447,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and I am supremely confident

140
0:06:47.675,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that the digital technologies that we're developing now

141
0:06:50.287,000 --> 0:06:52,000
are going to take us into a Utopian future,

142
0:06:52.961,000 --> 0:06:53,000
not a dystopian future.

143
0:06:54.697,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And to explain why,

144
0:06:55.872,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I want to pose a ridiculously broad question.

145
0:06:58.475,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I want to ask:

146
0:06:59.65,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what have been the most important developments in human history?

147
0:07:03.02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, I want to share some of the answers that I've gotten

148
0:07:06.005,000 --> 0:07:07,000
in response to this question.

149
0:07:07.426,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It's a wonderful question to ask and start an endless debate about,

150
0:07:10.618,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because some people are going to bring up

151
0:07:12.616,000 --> 0:07:15,000
systems of philosophy in both the West and the East

152
0:07:15.94,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that have changed how a lot of people think about the world.

153
0:07:19.187,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And then other people will say,

154
0:07:20.704,000 --> 0:07:22,000
"No, actually, the big stories, the big developments

155
0:07:23.189,000 --> 0:07:25,000
are the founding of the world's major religions,

156
0:07:25.796,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which have changed civilizations and have changed and influenced

157
0:07:29.046,000 --> 0:07:31,000
how countless people are living their lives."

158
0:07:31.664,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And then some other folk will say,

159
0:07:33.385,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"Actually, what changes civilizations,

160
0:07:35.799,000 --> 0:07:39,000
what modifies them and what changes people's lives are empires,

161
0:07:40.608,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so the great developments in human history

162
0:07:43.037,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are stories of conquest and of war."

163
0:07:45.823,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And then some cheery soul usually always pipes up and says,

164
0:07:48.628,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"Hey, don't forget about plagues!"

165
0:07:50.334,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:54.267,000 --> 0:07:56,000
There are some optimistic answers to this question,

167
0:07:56.814,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so some people will bring up the Age of Exploration

168
0:07:59.252,000 --> 0:08:,000
and the opening up of the world.

169
0:08:00.821,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Others will talk about intellectual achievements in disciplines like math

170
0:08:04.623,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that have helped us get a better handle on the world,

171
0:08:07.141,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and other folk will talk about periods when there was a deep flourishing

172
0:08:10.605,000 --> 0:08:11,000
of the arts and sciences.

173
0:08:12.234,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So this debate will go on and on.

174
0:08:13.845,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's an endless debate

175
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and there's no conclusive, single answer to it.

176
0:08:18.587,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But if you're a geek like me,

177
0:08:20.128,000 --> 0:08:22,000
you say, "Well, what do the data say?"

178
0:08:22.833,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And you start to do things

179
0:08:24.189,000 --> 0:08:26,000
like graph things that we might be interested in --

180
0:08:26.897,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the total worldwide population, for example,

181
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or some measure of social development

182
0:08:32.389,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or the state of advancement of a society.

183
0:08:34.901,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And you start to plot the data, because, by this approach,

184
0:08:39.048,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the big stories, the big developments in human history,

185
0:08:41.677,000 --> 0:08:43,000
are the ones that will bend these curves a lot.

186
0:08:44.211,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So when you do this and when you plot the data,

187
0:08:46.455,000 --> 0:08:48,000
you pretty quickly come to some weird conclusions.

188
0:08:49.171,000 --> 0:08:5,000
You conclude, actually,

189
0:08:50.591,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that none of these things have mattered very much.

190
0:08:53.178,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:57.24,000 --> 0:09:,000
They haven't done a darn thing to the curves.

192
0:09:00.617,000 --> 0:09:04,000
There has been one story, one development in human history

193
0:09:05.331,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that bent the curve, bent it just about 90 degrees,

194
0:09:08.564,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and it is a technology story.

195
0:09:11.223,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The steam engine and the other associated technologies

196
0:09:14.017,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of the Industrial Revolution

197
0:09:16.072,000 --> 0:09:19,000
changed the world and influenced human history so much,

198
0:09:19.372,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that in the words of the historian Ian Morris,

199
0:09:21.798,000 --> 0:09:24,000
"... they made mockery out of all that had come before."

200
0:09:25.613,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And they did this by infinitely multiplying the power of our muscles,

201
0:09:29.164,000 --> 0:09:31,000
overcoming the limitations of our muscles.

202
0:09:31.582,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now, what we're in the middle of now

203
0:09:34.104,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is overcoming the limitations of our individual brains

204
0:09:37.161,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and infinitely multiplying our mental power.

205
0:09:40.096,000 --> 0:09:43,000
How can this not be as big a deal

206
0:09:43.297,000 --> 0:09:45,000
as overcoming the limitations of our muscles?

207
0:09:46.025,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So at the risk of repeating myself a little bit,

208
0:09:48.909,000 --> 0:09:51,000
when I look at what's going on with digital technology these days,

209
0:09:52.686,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we are not anywhere near through with this journey.

210
0:09:55.82,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies,

211
0:09:59.35,000 --> 0:10:02,000
my single conclusion is that we ain't seen nothing yet.

212
0:10:02.463,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The best days are really ahead.

213
0:10:04.213,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Let me give you a couple examples.

214
0:10:06.238,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Economies don't run on energy.

215
0:10:08.635,000 --> 0:10:11,000
They don't run on capital, they don't run on labor.

216
0:10:11.698,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Economies run on ideas.

217
0:10:14.127,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So the work of innovation, the work of coming up with new ideas,

218
0:10:17.492,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is some of the most powerful, most fundamental work that we can do

219
0:10:21.214,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in an economy.

220
0:10:22.389,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And this is kind of how we used to do innovation.

221
0:10:25.531,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We'd find a bunch of fairly similar-looking people ...

222
0:10:28.531,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:32.051,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We'd take them out of elite institutions,

224
0:10:34.068,000 --> 0:10:36,000
we'd put them into other elite institutions

225
0:10:36.171,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and we'd wait for the innovation.

226
0:10:37.781,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Now --

227
0:10:38.974,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

228
0:10:41.427,000 --> 0:10:44,000
as a white guy who spent his whole career at MIT and Harvard,

229
0:10:44.939,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I've got no problem with this.

230
0:10:46.989,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:50.605,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But some other people do,

232
0:10:51.836,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and they've kind of crashed the party

233
0:10:53.645,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and loosened up the dress code of innovation.

234
0:10:55.814,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

235
0:10:56.87,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So here are the winners of a Topcoder programming challenge,

236
0:11:00.094,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and I assure you that nobody cares

237
0:11:02.81,000 --> 0:11:05,000
where these kids grew up, where they went to school,

238
0:11:06.59,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or what they look like.

239
0:11:08.114,000 --> 0:11:11,000
All anyone cares about is the quality of the work, the quality of the ideas.

240
0:11:11.981,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And over and over again, we see this happening

241
0:11:14.241,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in the technology-facilitated world.

242
0:11:16.789,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The work of innovation is becoming more open,

243
0:11:19.31,000 --> 0:11:22,000
more inclusive, more transparent and more merit-based,

244
0:11:22.983,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and that's going to continue no matter what MIT and Harvard think of it,

245
0:11:26.705,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and I couldn't be happier about that development.

246
0:11:29.609,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I hear once in a while, "OK, I'll grant you that,

247
0:11:32.088,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but technology is still a tool for the rich world,

248
0:11:35.131,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and what's not happening,

249
0:11:36.554,000 --> 0:11:38,000
these digital tools are not improving the lives

250
0:11:39.189,000 --> 0:11:41,000
of people at the bottom of the pyramid."

251
0:11:41.362,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And I want to say to that very clearly: nonsense.

252
0:11:44.052,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The bottom of the pyramid is benefiting hugely from technology.

253
0:11:47.569,000 --> 0:11:5,000
The economist Robert Jensen did this wonderful study a while back

254
0:11:51.153,000 --> 0:11:52,000
where he watched, in great detail,

255
0:11:53.11,000 --> 0:11:56,000
what happened to the fishing villages of Kerala, India,

256
0:11:56.752,000 --> 0:11:58,000
when they got mobile phones for the very first time.

257
0:11:59.657,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And when you write for the Quarterly Journal of Economics,

258
0:12:02.49,000 --> 0:12:04,000
you have to use very dry and very circumspect language.

259
0:12:05.396,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But when I read his paper,

260
0:12:06.682,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I kind of feel Jensen is trying to scream at us

261
0:12:08.913,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and say, "Look, this was a big deal.

262
0:12:11.261,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Prices stabilized, so people could plan their economic lives.

263
0:12:14.936,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Waste was not reduced -- it was eliminated.

264
0:12:19.007,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And the lives of both the buyers and the sellers

265
0:12:21.272,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in these villages measurably improved."

266
0:12:24.073,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now, what I don't think is that Jensen got extremely lucky

267
0:12:27.887,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and happened to land in the one set of villages

268
0:12:30.122,000 --> 0:12:32,000
where technology made things better.

269
0:12:32.455,000 --> 0:12:34,000
What happened instead is he very carefully documented

270
0:12:35.126,000 --> 0:12:39,000
what happens over and over again when technology comes for the first time

271
0:12:39.229,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to an environment and a community:

272
0:12:41.19,000 --> 0:12:44,000
the lives of people, the welfares of people, improve dramatically.

273
0:12:45.051,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So as I look around at all the evidence

274
0:12:46.956,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and I think about the room that we have ahead of us,

275
0:12:49.417,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I become a huge digital optimist

276
0:12:51.269,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and I start to think that this wonderful statement from the physicist Freeman Dyson

277
0:12:55.869,000 --> 0:12:56,000
is actually not hyperbole.

278
0:12:57.631,000 --> 0:12:59,000
This is an accurate assessment of what's going on.

279
0:13:00.164,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Our technologies are great gifts,

280
0:13:02.886,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and we, right now, have the great good fortune

281
0:13:05.957,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to be living at a time when digital technology is flourishing,

282
0:13:09.711,000 --> 0:13:12,000
when it is broadening and deepening and becoming more profound

283
0:13:13.13,000 --> 0:13:14,000
all around the world.

284
0:13:14.432,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So, yeah, the droids are taking our jobs,

285
0:13:17.731,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but focusing on that fact misses the point entirely.

286
0:13:21.326,000 --> 0:13:24,000
The point is that then we are freed up to do other things,

287
0:13:24.85,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and what we're going to do, I am very confident,

288
0:13:27.161,000 --> 0:13:29,000
what we're going to do is reduce poverty

289
0:13:29.701,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and drudgery and misery around the world.

290
0:13:32.194,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I'm very confident we're going to learn to live more lightly on the planet,

291
0:13:36.223,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and I am extremely confident that what we're going to do

292
0:13:39.672,000 --> 0:13:4,000
with our new digital tools

293
0:13:41.071,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is going to be so profound and so beneficial

294
0:13:44.087,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that it's going to make a mockery out of everything that came before.

295
0:13:47.595,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I'm going to leave the last word

296
0:13:49.175,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to a guy who had a front-row seat for digital progress,

297
0:13:51.853,000 --> 0:13:52,000
our old friend Ken Jennings.

298
0:13:53.449,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I'm with him; I'm going to echo his words:

299
0:13:55.716,000 --> 0:13:57,000
"I, for one, welcome our new computer overlords."

300
0:13:58.656,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

301
0:13:59.761,000 --> 0:14:,000
Thanks very much.

302
0:14:01.269,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

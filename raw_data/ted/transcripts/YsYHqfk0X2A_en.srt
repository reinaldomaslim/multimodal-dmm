Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.829,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I teach chemistry.

3
0:00:15.048,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Explosion)

4
0:00:16.414,000 --> 0:00:19,000
All right, all right.

5
0:00:19.572,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So more than just explosions,

6
0:00:21.853,000 --> 0:00:22,000
chemistry is everywhere.

7
0:00:23.464,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out

8
0:00:26.104,000 --> 0:00:28,000
just doing this over and over?

9
0:00:28.449,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Some people nodding yes.

10
0:00:30.654,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Recently, I showed this to my students,

11
0:00:32.982,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened.

12
0:00:37.331,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The questions and conversations that followed

13
0:00:39.952,000 --> 0:00:4,000
were fascinating.

14
0:00:41.603,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Check out this video that Maddie

15
0:00:43.417,000 --> 0:00:46,000
from my period three class sent me that evening.

16
0:00:57.104,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Clang) (Laughs)

17
0:00:59.569,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher,

18
0:01:02.763,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I love that she went home and continued to geek out

19
0:01:05.869,000 --> 0:01:07,000
about this kind of ridiculous demonstration

20
0:01:08.487,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we did in class.

21
0:01:09.909,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity

22
0:01:12.855,000 --> 0:01:13,000
took her to a new level.

23
0:01:14.549,000 --> 0:01:16,000
If you look inside that beaker,

24
0:01:16.682,000 --> 0:01:17,000
you might see a candle.

25
0:01:18.242,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon

26
0:01:21.251,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to a new scenario.

27
0:01:24.028,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's

28
0:01:27.266,000 --> 0:01:29,000
are magnets that draw us towards our teachers,

29
0:01:30.232,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and they transcend all technology

30
0:01:33.184,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or buzzwords in education.

31
0:01:36.325,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But if we place these technologies before student inquiry,

32
0:01:40.426,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we can be robbing ourselves

33
0:01:42.549,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions.

34
0:01:47.483,000 --> 0:01:51,000
For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom

35
0:01:51.863,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to the screen of a mobile device

36
0:01:53.64,000 --> 0:01:54,000
might save instructional time,

37
0:01:55.477,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but if it is the focus of our students' experience,

38
0:01:58.376,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it's the same dehumanizing chatter

39
0:02:01.496,000 --> 0:02:03,000
just wrapped up in fancy clothing.

40
0:02:03.728,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But if instead we have the guts

41
0:02:06.003,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to confuse our students, perplex them,

42
0:02:08.873,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and evoke real questions,

43
0:02:11.149,000 --> 0:02:14,000
through those questions, we as teachers have information

44
0:02:14.149,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that we can use to tailor robust

45
0:02:17.177,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and informed methods of blended instruction.

46
0:02:20.868,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside,

47
0:02:26.04,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now,

48
0:02:30.244,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and it took a life-threatening situation

49
0:02:32.718,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching

50
0:02:35.665,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and help me realize that student questions

51
0:02:39.28,000 --> 0:02:42,000
are the seeds of real learning,

52
0:02:42.401,000 --> 0:02:44,000
not some scripted curriculum

53
0:02:44.515,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that gave them tidbits of random information.

54
0:02:47.811,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In May of 2010, at 35 years old,

55
0:02:51.283,000 --> 0:02:54,000
with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way,

56
0:02:54.376,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm

57
0:02:56.992,000 --> 0:02:58,000
at the base of my thoracic aorta.

58
0:02:59.512,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email

59
0:03:02.564,000 --> 0:03:03,000
from my doctor right there.

60
0:03:04.098,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock --

61
0:03:07.623,000 --> 0:03:09,000
absolutely freaked out, okay?

62
0:03:10.088,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But I found surprising moments of comfort

63
0:03:14.307,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in the confidence that my surgeon embodied.

64
0:03:17.997,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it?

65
0:03:21.441,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So when I asked him, he told me three things.

66
0:03:25.033,000 --> 0:03:28,000
He said first, his curiosity drove him

67
0:03:28.415,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to ask hard questions about the procedure,

68
0:03:30.69,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about what worked and what didn't work.

69
0:03:33.875,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Second, he embraced, and didn't fear,

70
0:03:36.969,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the messy process of trial and error,

71
0:03:39.045,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the inevitable process of trial and error.

72
0:03:41.554,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And third, through intense reflection,

73
0:03:44.53,000 --> 0:03:46,000
he gathered the information that he needed

74
0:03:47.206,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to design and revise the procedure,

75
0:03:49.112,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life.

76
0:03:52.633,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom,

77
0:03:56.309,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and before I went back into the classroom that fall,

78
0:03:58.289,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I wrote down three rules of my own

79
0:04:01.547,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that I bring to my lesson planning still today.

80
0:04:04.327,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Rule number one: Curiosity comes first.

81
0:04:08.369,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Questions can be windows to great instruction,

82
0:04:11.468,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but not the other way around.

83
0:04:14.158,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Rule number two: Embrace the mess.

84
0:04:17.792,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly.

85
0:04:20.463,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And just because the scientific method is allocated

86
0:04:23.334,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one

87
0:04:26.785,000 --> 0:04:29,000
of the one that we all skip, okay,

88
0:04:30.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
trial and error can still be an informal part

89
0:04:33.442,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of what we do every single day

90
0:04:35.359,000 --> 0:04:38,000
at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206.

91
0:04:38.691,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And rule number three: Practice reflection.

92
0:04:42.713,000 --> 0:04:44,000
What we do is important. It deserves our care,

93
0:04:45.057,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but it also deserves our revision.

94
0:04:48.289,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms?

95
0:04:51.067,000 --> 0:04:53,000
As if what we are doing one day will save lives.

96
0:04:54.063,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Our students our worth it.

97
0:04:55.614,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And each case is different.

98
0:04:58.049,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Explosion)

99
0:04:59.144,000 --> 0:05:,000
All right. Sorry.

100
0:05:01.091,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that

101
0:05:02.999,000 --> 0:05:04,000
out of my system before we move on.

102
0:05:05.834,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So these are my daughters.

103
0:05:07.619,000 --> 0:05:1,000
On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family.

104
0:05:11.291,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And, on the left, Riley.

105
0:05:14.073,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here.

106
0:05:16.728,000 --> 0:05:17,000
She's going to be four years old,

107
0:05:18.422,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and anyone who knows a four-year-old

108
0:05:20.672,000 --> 0:05:23,000
knows that they love to ask, "Why?"

109
0:05:23.872,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Yeah. Why.

110
0:05:25.356,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I could teach this kid anything

111
0:05:27.666,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because she is curious about everything.

112
0:05:30.516,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We all were at that age.

113
0:05:32.999,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers,

114
0:05:36.474,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the ones she has yet to meet.

115
0:05:39.296,000 --> 0:05:41,000
How will they grow this curiosity?

116
0:05:41.788,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids,

117
0:05:47.27,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms --

118
0:05:50.664,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun

119
0:05:53.988,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom.

120
0:05:59.006,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But if we as educators leave behind

121
0:06:01.681,000 --> 0:06:03,000
this simple role as disseminators of content

122
0:06:04.263,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and embrace a new paradigm

123
0:06:06.6,000 --> 0:06:09,000
as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry,

124
0:06:09.644,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we just might bring a little bit more meaning

125
0:06:11.869,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to their school day, and spark their imagination.

126
0:06:14.584,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Thank you very much.

127
0:06:16.168,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Applause)

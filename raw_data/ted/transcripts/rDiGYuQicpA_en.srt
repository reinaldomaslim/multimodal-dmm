1
0:00:28.337,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Thank you so much, Chris.

2
0:00:29.552,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity

3
0:00:33.526,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.

4
0:00:36.554,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I have been blown away by this conference,

5
0:00:40.112,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments

6
0:00:45.804,000 --> 0:00:47,000
about what I had to say the other night.

7
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I say that sincerely,

8
0:00:50.899,000 --> 0:00:51,000
partly because (Mock sob)

9
0:00:52.887,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I need that.

10
0:00:54.062,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:59.943,000 --> 0:01:,000
Put yourselves in my position.

12
0:01:01.888,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

13
0:01:08.44,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years.

14
0:01:11.021,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane!

16
0:01:16.388,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:19.117,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Applause)

18
0:01:25.589,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'll tell you one quick story

19
0:01:27.336,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to illustrate what that's been like for me.

20
0:01:30.479,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:32.024,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's a true story -- every bit of this is true.

22
0:01:35.158,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House --

23
0:01:38.767,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:40.809,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have

25
0:01:45.748,000 --> 0:01:46,000
50 miles east of Nashville.

26
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Driving ourselves.

27
0:01:50.514,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but --

29
0:01:55.741,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

30
0:02:01.234,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I looked in the rear-view mirror

31
0:02:06.965,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and all of a sudden it just hit me.

32
0:02:10.195,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There was no motorcade back there.

33
0:02:11.855,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:14.533,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You've heard of phantom limb pain?

35
0:02:16.55,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:21.386,000 --> 0:02:25,000
This was a rented Ford Taurus.

37
0:02:25.626,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:28.154,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It was dinnertime,

39
0:02:30.184,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we started looking for a place to eat.

40
0:02:33.588,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We were on I-40.

41
0:02:35.017,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.

42
0:02:38.238,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.

43
0:02:41.95,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it.

44
0:02:46.877,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over,

45
0:02:51.336,000 --> 0:02:52,000
made a big commotion over Tipper.

46
0:02:53.346,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:55.833,000 --> 0:02:58,000
She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us,

48
0:02:59.277,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and she lowered her voice so much,

49
0:03:01.405,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I had to really strain to hear what she was saying.

50
0:03:04.43,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore

51
0:03:07.133,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and his wife, Tipper."

52
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And the man said,

53
0:03:10.551,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"

54
0:03:12.767,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:17.699,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
There's been kind of a series of epiphanies.

57
0:03:25.143,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:26.311,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The very next day, continuing the totally true story,

59
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria,

60
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.

61
0:03:39.301,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And I began the speech by telling them the story

62
0:03:43.121,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of what had just happened the day before in Nashville.

63
0:03:46.196,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you:

64
0:03:49.526,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Tipper and I were driving ourselves,

65
0:03:51.288,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain,

66
0:03:53.35,000 --> 0:03:54,000
what the man said -- they laughed.

67
0:03:55.703,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.

68
0:03:59.31,000 --> 0:04:,000
I fell asleep on the plane

69
0:04:01.2,000 --> 0:04:03,000
until, during the middle of the night, we landed

70
0:04:03.762,000 --> 0:04:05,000
on the Azores Islands for refueling.

71
0:04:06.364,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air,

72
0:04:09.5,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.

73
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling,

74
0:04:16.079,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"Call Washington! Call Washington!"

75
0:04:20.981,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night,

76
0:04:23.45,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in the middle of the Atlantic,

77
0:04:24.91,000 --> 0:04:26,000
what in the world could be wrong in Washington?

78
0:04:27.154,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.

79
0:04:29.439,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But what it turned out to be,

81
0:04:36.951,000 --> 0:04:39,000
was that my staff was extremely upset

82
0:04:40.286,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story

83
0:04:46.512,000 --> 0:04:47,000
about my speech,

84
0:04:47.956,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and it had already been printed in cities

85
0:04:49.956,000 --> 0:04:51,000
all across the United States of America.

86
0:04:52.312,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.

87
0:04:54.164,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:55.553,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the story began,

89
0:04:58.238,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:

90
0:05:02.555,000 --> 0:05:05,000
'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" --

91
0:05:06.208,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:07.874,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"'named Shoney's,

93
0:05:09.246,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and we are running it ourselves.'"

94
0:05:11.069,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:14.413,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Before I could get back to U.S. soil,

96
0:05:16.595,000 --> 0:05:2,000
David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on --

97
0:05:20.733,000 --> 0:05:23,000
one of them had me in a big white chef's hat,

98
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Tipper was saying, "One more burger with fries!"

99
0:05:26.453,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:27.524,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Three days later,

101
0:05:28.83,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I got a nice, long, handwritten letter

102
0:05:31.593,000 --> 0:05:34,000
from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,

103
0:05:35.038,000 --> 0:05:37,000
"Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!"

104
0:05:37.458,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:44.155,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We like to celebrate each other's successes in life.

106
0:05:47.316,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:53.606,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I was going to talk about information ecology.

108
0:05:56.177,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But I was thinking that,

109
0:05:58.219,000 --> 0:06:01,000
since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED,

110
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that maybe I could talk about that another time.

111
0:06:04.717,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

112
0:06:06.141,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Chris Anderson: It's a deal!

113
0:06:07.562,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Applause)

114
0:06:10.212,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said

115
0:06:14.754,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you would like me to elaborate on:

116
0:06:16.644,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What can you do about the climate crisis?

117
0:06:21.317,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I want to start with a couple of --

118
0:06:24.68,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I'm going to show some new images,

119
0:06:27.273,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five.

120
0:06:33.075,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now, the slide show.

121
0:06:34.671,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I update the slide show every time I give it.

122
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I add new images,

123
0:06:39.261,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because I learn more about it every time I give it.

124
0:06:42.823,000 --> 0:06:43,000
It's like beach-combing, you know?

125
0:06:44.798,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.

126
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.

127
0:06:54.007,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is just for the United States of America.

128
0:06:57.041,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees;

129
0:06:59.803,000 --> 0:07:02,000
last month was 39.5 degrees.

130
0:07:03.932,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment --

131
0:07:08.769,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I'm kidding.

132
0:07:10.404,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But these are the recapitulation slides,

133
0:07:13.484,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.

134
0:07:16.902,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.

135
0:07:19.321,000 --> 0:07:22,000
First of all, this is where we're projected to go

136
0:07:22.656,000 --> 0:07:24,000
with the U.S. contribution to global warming,

137
0:07:24.782,000 --> 0:07:25,000
under business as usual.

138
0:07:26.59,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy

139
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is the low-hanging fruit.

140
0:07:33.648,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit.

141
0:07:38.176,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The sign is wrong.

142
0:07:40.877,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's not negative; it's positive.

143
0:07:43.044,000 --> 0:07:45,000
These are investments that pay for themselves.

144
0:07:45.908,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.

145
0:07:50.62,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow,

146
0:07:54.639,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but I want you to put it in perspective.

147
0:07:57.893,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's an easy, visible target of concern --

148
0:08:02.514,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and it should be --

149
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings

150
0:08:08.703,000 --> 0:08:09,000
than from cars and trucks.

151
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Cars and trucks are very significant,

152
0:08:13.665,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we have the lowest standards in the world.

153
0:08:16.274,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle.

154
0:08:19.324,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.

155
0:08:24.709,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency

156
0:08:29.075,000 --> 0:08:3,000
can make this much difference.

157
0:08:30.846,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here --

158
0:08:36.825,000 --> 0:08:38,000
there are a lot of people directly involved in this --

159
0:08:39.416,000 --> 0:08:41,000
this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly

160
0:08:41.972,000 --> 0:08:43,000
than the current projection shows it.

161
0:08:44.183,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for --

162
0:08:49.947,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is likely to become the killer app that will enable us

163
0:08:56.786,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe.

164
0:09:04.459,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Not quite there yet.

165
0:09:05.819,000 --> 0:09:08,000
OK. Now, what can you do?

166
0:09:11.495,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Reduce emissions in your home.

167
0:09:14.022,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Most of these expenditures are also profitable.

168
0:09:19.007,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Insulation, better design.

169
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Buy green electricity where you can.

170
0:09:24.436,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.

171
0:09:28.27,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Use light rail.

172
0:09:30.505,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Figure out some of the other options that are much better.

173
0:09:33.311,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It's important.

174
0:09:35.254,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Be a green consumer.

175
0:09:36.997,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You have choices with everything you buy,

176
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
between things that have a harsh effect,

177
0:09:43.631,000 --> 0:09:48,000
or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis.

178
0:09:49.87,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Consider this:

179
0:09:51.726,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life.

180
0:09:55.663,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Those of you who are good at branding,

181
0:09:58.121,000 --> 0:10:,000
I'd love to get your advice and help

182
0:10:00.617,000 --> 0:10:06,000
on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.

183
0:10:06.719,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It is easier than you think.

184
0:10:08.724,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It really is.

185
0:10:12.223,000 --> 0:10:15,000
A lot of us in here have made that decision,

186
0:10:15.642,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and it is really pretty easy.

187
0:10:17.8,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions

188
0:10:23.751,000 --> 0:10:25,000
with the full range of choices that you make,

189
0:10:26.471,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and then purchase or acquire offsets

190
0:10:30.62,000 --> 0:10:33,000
for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.

191
0:10:33.761,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.

192
0:10:40.755,000 --> 0:10:42,000
There is a carbon calculator.

193
0:10:44.501,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Participant Productions convened --

194
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
with my active involvement --

195
0:10:50.594,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the leading software writers in the world,

196
0:10:53.435,000 --> 0:10:56,000
on this arcane science of carbon calculation,

197
0:10:56.762,000 --> 0:11:,000
to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.

198
0:11:01.317,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are,

199
0:11:07.55,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and then you will be given options to reduce.

200
0:11:10.892,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And by the time the movie comes out in May,

201
0:11:14.113,000 --> 0:11:15,000
this will be updated to 2.0,

202
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and we will have click-through purchases of offsets.

203
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral.

204
0:11:23.246,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Again, some of us have done that,

205
0:11:24.878,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and it's not as hard as you think.

206
0:11:28.196,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations,

207
0:11:32.41,000 --> 0:11:33,000
whether you are from the technology,

208
0:11:34.347,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or entertainment, or design and architecture community.

209
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Invest sustainably.

210
0:11:40.067,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Majora mentioned this.

211
0:11:42.248,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate

212
0:11:49.064,000 --> 0:11:51,000
on the basis of their annual performance,

213
0:11:51.805,000 --> 0:11:55,000
don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.

214
0:11:57.807,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Over time, people do what you pay them to do.

215
0:12:01.736,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid

216
0:12:06.453,000 --> 0:12:09,000
on your capital that they've invested,

217
0:12:09.777,000 --> 0:12:1,000
based on the short-term returns,

218
0:12:11.744,000 --> 0:12:13,000
you're going to get short-term decisions.

219
0:12:15.999,000 --> 0:12:16,000
A lot more to be said about that.

220
0:12:17.636,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Become a catalyst of change.

221
0:12:19.406,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Teach others, learn about it, talk about it.

222
0:12:24.263,000 --> 0:12:27,000
The movie is a movie version of the slideshow

223
0:12:27.692,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining.

224
0:12:31.694,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And it comes out in May.

225
0:12:34.437,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.

226
0:12:40.106,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Consider sending somebody to Nashville.

227
0:12:44.39,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Pick well.

228
0:12:46.381,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow --

229
0:12:50.851,000 --> 0:12:54,000
re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced

230
0:12:55.63,000 --> 0:12:57,000
with a generic approach,

231
0:12:57.724,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.

232
0:13:00.447,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And it's how they link together.

233
0:13:02.072,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer

234
0:13:06.683,000 --> 0:13:09,000
for a group of people that are nominated by different folks

235
0:13:10.542,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to come and then give it en masse,

236
0:13:12.795,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in communities all across the country,

237
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week,

238
0:13:19.689,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to keep it right on the cutting edge.

239
0:13:22.744,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process,

240
0:13:26.649,000 --> 0:13:3,000
posted with tools and limited-use copyrights,

241
0:13:31.508,000 --> 0:13:36,000
so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.

242
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Applause)

243
0:13:40.17,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Where did anybody get the idea

244
0:13:41.684,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?

245
0:13:44.06,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican,

246
0:13:46.174,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat.

247
0:13:48.935,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We need Republicans as well.

248
0:13:50.464,000 --> 0:13:52,000
This used to be a bipartisan issue,

249
0:13:52.497,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and I know that in this group it really is.

250
0:13:54.978,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Become politically active.

251
0:13:56.554,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.

252
0:13:59.753,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions --

253
0:14:05.326,000 --> 0:14:07,000
global warming pollution -- and trading it.

254
0:14:07.365,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system,

255
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:13,000
it's not a closed system.

256
0:14:13.692,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation,

257
0:14:17.763,000 --> 0:14:19,000
then everybody who's on a board of directors --

258
0:14:20.01,000 --> 0:14:22,000
how many people here serve on the board of directors

259
0:14:23.023,000 --> 0:14:24,000
of a corporation?

260
0:14:25.415,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Once it's a closed system,

261
0:14:26.865,000 --> 0:14:32,000
you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO

262
0:14:33.126,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions

263
0:14:37.277,000 --> 0:14:38,000
that can be avoided.

264
0:14:38.61,000 --> 0:14:4,000
The market will work to solve this problem --

265
0:14:43.949,000 --> 0:14:45,000
if we can accomplish this.

266
0:14:47.434,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.

267
0:14:50.843,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We have to change the minds of the American people.

268
0:14:53.375,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Because presently, the politicians do not have permission

269
0:14:56.158,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to do what needs to be done.

270
0:14:58.355,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes

271
0:15:03.833,000 --> 0:15:05,000
mediating between wealth and power the way it once did.

272
0:15:06.811,000 --> 0:15:11,000
It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads.

273
0:15:12.395,000 --> 0:15:13,000
We have to buy a lot of those ads.

274
0:15:15.221,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.

275
0:15:19.555,000 --> 0:15:21,000
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse,"

276
0:15:22.448,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but again, those of you who are good at branding,

277
0:15:24.799,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I need your help on this.

278
0:15:26.768,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me,

279
0:15:30.892,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is whether the combination of an opposable thumb

280
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and a neocortex is a viable combination.

281
0:15:36.947,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Laughter)

282
0:15:38.825,000 --> 0:15:39,000
That's really true.

283
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
I said the other night, and I'll repeat now:

284
0:15:46.584,000 --> 0:15:48,000
this is not a political issue.

285
0:15:48.773,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan.

286
0:15:54.336,000 --> 0:15:57,000
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.

287
0:15:58.421,000 --> 0:15:59,000
This is an opportunity.

288
0:15:59.921,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here,

289
0:16:04.797,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to bring more coherence to them.

290
0:16:07.495,000 --> 0:16:08,000
We are one.

291
0:16:09.065,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

292
0:16:11.424,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Applause)

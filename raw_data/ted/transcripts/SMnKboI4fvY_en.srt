1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I really love color.

2
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I notice it everywhere and in everything.

3
0:00:21.68,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My family makes fun of me

4
0:00:23.52,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because I like to use colors with elusive-sounding names,

5
0:00:27.04,000 --> 0:00:29,000
like celadon ...

6
0:00:29.2,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:30.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
ecru ...

8
0:00:33.08,000 --> 0:00:34,000
carmine.

9
0:00:36.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, if you haven't noticed, I am black, thank you --

10
0:00:40.08,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:41.12,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and when you grow up in a segregated city as I have,

12
0:00:43.6,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like Chicago,

13
0:00:44.84,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you're conditioned to believe that color and race can never be separate.

14
0:00:51.04,000 --> 0:00:53,000
There's hardly a day that goes by

15
0:00:53.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that somebody is not reminding you of your color.

16
0:00:58.88,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Racism is my city's vivid hue.

17
0:01:03.76,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, we can all agree that race is a socially constructed phenomenon,

18
0:01:09.12,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but it's often hard to see it in our everyday existence.

19
0:01:12.52,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Its pervasiveness is everywhere.

20
0:01:15.52,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The neighborhoods I grew up in

21
0:01:17.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
were filled with a kind of culturally coded beauty.

22
0:01:20.44,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Major commercial corridors were lined with brightly painted storefronts

23
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that competed for black consumer dollars.

24
0:01:27.76,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The visual mash-ups of corner stores and beauty supply houses,

25
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:33,000
currency exchanges,

26
0:01:34.08,000 --> 0:01:38,000
are where I actually, inadvertently learned the foundational principles

27
0:01:38.2,000 --> 0:01:42,000
of something I would later come to know is called color theory.

28
0:01:44.52,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I can remember being pretty intimidated by this term in college --

29
0:01:48.24,000 --> 0:01:49,000
color theory.

30
0:01:49.84,000 --> 0:01:51,000
All these stuffy old white guys with their treatises

31
0:01:52.72,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and obscure terminologies.

32
0:01:56.28,000 --> 0:02:,000
I'd mastered each one of their color palettes and associated principles.

33
0:02:02.84,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Color theory essentially boils down to the art and science

34
0:02:06.68,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of using color to form compositions and spaces.

35
0:02:11.44,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's not so complicated.

36
0:02:15.48,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This was my bible in college.

37
0:02:19.4,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Josef Albers posited a theory about the color red,

38
0:02:24.76,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and it always has stuck with me.

39
0:02:27.36,000 --> 0:02:33,000
He argues that the iconic color of a cola can is red,

40
0:02:33.56,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and that in fact all of us can agree that it's red

41
0:02:36.44,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but the kinds of reds that we imagine

42
0:02:38.96,000 --> 0:02:41,000
are as varied as the number of people in this room.

43
0:02:43.64,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So imagine that.

44
0:02:44.92,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This color that we've all been taught since kindergarten is primary --

45
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
red, yellow, blue --

46
0:02:50.52,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in fact is not primary,

47
0:02:52.92,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is not irreducible,

48
0:02:54.72,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is not objective but quite subjective.

49
0:02:59.48,000 --> 0:03:,000
What?

50
0:03:00.72,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

51
0:03:02.36,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Albers called this "relational."

52
0:03:06.6,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Relational.

53
0:03:08.52,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so it was the first time

54
0:03:09.92,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that I was able to see my own neighborhood as a relational context.

55
0:03:16.28,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Each color is affected by its neighbor.

56
0:03:21.56,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Each other is affected by its neighbor.

57
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In the 1930s,

58
0:03:32.4,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the United States government created

59
0:03:35.44,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the Federal Housing Administration,

60
0:03:37.68,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which in turn created a series of maps

61
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which were using a color-coding system to determine which neighborhoods

62
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
should and should not receive federal housing loans.

63
0:03:52.32,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Their residential security map was its own kind of color palette,

64
0:03:56.8,000 --> 0:04:,000
and in fact was more influential than all of those color palettes

65
0:04:01.4,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that I had been studying in college combined.

66
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Banks would not lend to people who lived in neighborhoods like mine.

67
0:04:11.48,000 --> 0:04:12,000
That's me in D86.

68
0:04:14.36,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Their cartographers were literally coloring in these maps

69
0:04:18.72,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and labeling that color "hazardous."

70
0:04:23.2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Red was the new black,

71
0:04:26.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and black neighborhoods were colored.

72
0:04:31.959,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The problem persists today,

73
0:04:33.44,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and we've seen it most recently in the foreclosure crisis.

74
0:04:37.4,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In Chicago, this is best symbolized by these Xs

75
0:04:40.92,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that are emblazoned on the fronts of vacated houses

76
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:44,000
on the South and West Side.

77
0:04:47.64,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The reality is that someone else's color palettes were determining

78
0:04:52.6,000 --> 0:04:55,000
my physical and artistic existence.

79
0:04:57.96,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Ridiculous.

80
0:05:00.2,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I decided that I'd create my own color palette

81
0:05:03.24,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and speak to the people who live where I do

82
0:05:05.88,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and alter the way that color had been defined for us.

83
0:05:09.88,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It was a palette that I didn't have to search far for

84
0:05:13.12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and look for in a treatise,

85
0:05:14.56,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because I already knew it.

86
0:05:17.92,000 --> 0:05:21,000
What kind of painter emerges from this reality?

87
0:05:25.84,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What color is urban?

88
0:05:29.08,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What color is ghetto?

89
0:05:32.08,000 --> 0:05:33,000
What color is privilege?

90
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What color is gang-related?

91
0:05:38.28,000 --> 0:05:39,000
What color is gentrification?

92
0:05:41.56,000 --> 0:05:42,000
What color is Freddie Gray?

93
0:05:45.88,000 --> 0:05:46,000
What color is Mike Brown?

94
0:05:49.96,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Finally, I'd found a way

95
0:05:52.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to connect my racialized understanding of color

96
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with my theoretical understanding of color.

97
0:05:59.28,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And I gave birth to my third baby:

98
0:06:02.08,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"Color(ed) Theory."

99
0:06:03.64,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

100
0:06:06.28,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"Color(ed) Theory" was a two-year artistic project

101
0:06:09.24,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in which I applied my own color palette to my own neighborhoods

102
0:06:14.04,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in my own way.

103
0:06:18.76,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Now, if I walked down 79th Street right now

104
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and I asked 50 people for the name of the slightly greener shade of cyan,

105
0:06:30.12,000 --> 0:06:31,000
they would look at me sideways.

106
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But if I say, "What color is Ultra Sheen?" --

108
0:06:36.2,000 --> 0:06:37,000
oh, a smile emerges,

109
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
stories about their grandmother's bathroom ensue.

110
0:06:42.08,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I mean, who needs turquoise when you have Ultra Sheen?

111
0:06:45.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Who needs teal when you have Ultra Sheen?

112
0:06:49.32,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Who needs ultramarine when you have ...

113
0:06:53.32,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Audience) Ultra Sheen.

114
0:06:55.4,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:57.08,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is exactly how I derived my palette.

116
0:07:00.6,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I would ask friends and family

117
0:07:03.92,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and people with backgrounds that were similar to mine

118
0:07:06.6,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for those stories and memories.

119
0:07:08.56,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The stories weren't always happy

120
0:07:10.8,000 --> 0:07:13,000
but the colors always resonated more than the product itself.

121
0:07:16.08,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I took those theories to the street.

122
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Ultra Sheen."

123
0:07:22.44,000 --> 0:07:24,000
"Pink Oil Moisturizer."

124
0:07:26.2,000 --> 0:07:28,000
If you're from Chicago, "Harold's Chicken Shack."

125
0:07:29.08,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

126
0:07:30.64,000 --> 0:07:33,000
"Currency Exchange + Safe Passage."

127
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"Flamin' Red Hots."

128
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Loose Squares" ...

129
0:07:40.84,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and "Crown Royal Bag."

130
0:07:46.76,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I painted soon-to-be-demolished homes

131
0:07:49.24,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in a much-maligned area called Englewood.

132
0:07:54.08,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We'd gather up as much paint as I could fit in my trunk,

133
0:07:57.32,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I'd call my most trusted art homies,

134
0:07:59.8,000 --> 0:08:01,000
my amazing husband always by my side,

135
0:08:02.8,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and we'd paint every inch of the exteriors in monochromatic fashion.

136
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I wanted to understand scale in a way that I hadn't before.

137
0:08:12.28,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I wanted to apply the colors to the biggest canvas I could imagine ...

138
0:08:17.08,000 --> 0:08:18,000
houses.

139
0:08:18.44,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So I'd obsessively drive up and down familiar streets that I'd grown up on,

140
0:08:23.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I'd cross-reference these houses with the city's data portal

141
0:08:27.2,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to make sure that they'd been tagged for demolition --

142
0:08:29.92,000 --> 0:08:31,000
unsalvageable, left for dead.

143
0:08:34.52,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I really wanted to understand what it meant to just let color rule,

144
0:08:39.24,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to trust my instincts,

145
0:08:40.96,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to stop asking for permission.

146
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
No meetings with city officials,

147
0:08:45.44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
no community buy-in,

148
0:08:47.44,000 --> 0:08:5,000
just let color rule

149
0:08:50.52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in my desire to paint different pictures about the South Side.

150
0:09:02.2,000 --> 0:09:08,000
These houses sit in stark contrast to their fully lined counterparts.

151
0:09:10.44,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We'd paint to make them stand out like Monopoly pieces

152
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in these environments.

153
0:09:18.32,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And we'd go on these early Sunday mornings

154
0:09:21.12,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and keep going until we ran out of that paint or until someone complained.

155
0:09:30.52,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"Hey, did you paint that?"

156
0:09:33.88,000 --> 0:09:36,000
a driver asked as I was taking this image one day.

157
0:09:37.96,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Me, nervously:

158
0:09:39.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"Yes?"

159
0:09:41.2,000 --> 0:09:42,000
His face changed.

160
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"Aw, I thought Prince was coming."

161
0:09:45.56,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

162
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:49,000
He had grown up on this block,

163
0:09:50.68,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and so you could imagine when he drove past

164
0:09:52.76,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and saw one of its last remaining houses mysteriously change colors overnight,

165
0:09:57.68,000 --> 0:10:,000
it was clearly not a Crown Royal bag involved,

166
0:10:00.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
it was a secret beacon from Prince.

167
0:10:03.4,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

168
0:10:07.32,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And though that block was almost all but erased,

169
0:10:12.12,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it was the idea that Prince could pop up in unexpected places

170
0:10:18.12,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and give free concerts in areas that the music industry and society

171
0:10:22.32,000 --> 0:10:24,000
had deemed were not valuable anymore.

172
0:10:26.36,000 --> 0:10:27,000
For him,

173
0:10:29.44,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the idea that just the image of this house

174
0:10:33.6,000 --> 0:10:36,000
was enough to bring Prince there

175
0:10:36.8,000 --> 0:10:37,000
meant that it was possible.

176
0:10:38.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In that moment,

177
0:10:40.52,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that little patch of Eggleston had become synonymous with royalty.

178
0:10:45.48,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And for however briefly,

179
0:10:47.48,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Eric Bennett's neighborhood had regained its value.

180
0:10:52.32,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So we traded stories despite being strangers

181
0:10:54.76,000 --> 0:10:56,000
about which high school we'd gone to

182
0:10:57.28,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and where we'd grown up,

183
0:10:59.04,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and Mrs. So-and-so's candy store --

184
0:11:01.48,000 --> 0:11:04,000
of being kids on the South Side.

185
0:11:04.56,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And once I revealed

186
0:11:05.84,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that in fact this project had absolutely nothing to do with Prince,

187
0:11:09.04,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Eric nodded in seeming agreement,

188
0:11:11.24,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and as we parted ways and he drove off,

189
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
he said, "But he could still come!"

190
0:11:16.92,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

191
0:11:19.08,000 --> 0:11:23,000
He had assumed full ownership of this project

192
0:11:23.68,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and was not willing to relinquish it,

193
0:11:25.52,000 --> 0:11:26,000
even to me, its author.

194
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
That, for me, was success.

195
0:11:32.72,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I wish I could tell you that this project transformed the neighborhood

196
0:11:37.84,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and all the indices that we like to rely on:

197
0:11:40.76,000 --> 0:11:45,000
increased jobs, reduced crime, no alcoholism --

198
0:11:46.04,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but in fact it's more gray than that.

199
0:11:49.2,000 --> 0:11:52,000
"Color(ed) Theory" catalyzed new conversations

200
0:11:52.24,000 --> 0:11:53,000
about the value of blackness.

201
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"Color(ed) Theory" made unmistakably visible the uncomfortable questions

202
0:12:02.36,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that institutions and governments have to ask themselves

203
0:12:05.32,000 --> 0:12:06,000
about why they do what they do.

204
0:12:08.36,000 --> 0:12:13,000
They ask equally difficult questions of myself and my neighborhood counterparts

205
0:12:13.92,000 --> 0:12:15,000
about our value systems

206
0:12:16.12,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and what our path to collective agency needs to be.

207
0:12:21.12,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Color gave me freedom in a way that didn't wait for permission

208
0:12:25.84,000 --> 0:12:27,000
or affirmation or inclusion.

209
0:12:29.44,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Color was something that I could rule now.

210
0:12:34.24,000 --> 0:12:38,000
One of the neighborhood members and paint crew members said it best

211
0:12:38.48,000 --> 0:12:4,000
when he said, "This didn't change the neighborhood,

212
0:12:41.44,000 --> 0:12:44,000
it changed people's perceptions about what's possible for their neighborhood,"

213
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
in big and small ways.

214
0:12:47.52,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Passersby would ask me, "Why are you painting that house

215
0:12:50.2,000 --> 0:12:52,000
when you know the city's just going to come and tear it down?"

216
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
At the time, I had no idea,

217
0:12:55.6,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I just knew that I had to do something.

218
0:12:58.4,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I would give anything to better understand color as both a medium

219
0:13:03.68,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and as an inescapable way that I am identified in society.

220
0:13:08.72,000 --> 0:13:11,000
If I have any hope of making the world better,

221
0:13:12.2,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I have to love and leverage both of these ways that I'm understood,

222
0:13:17.24,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and therein lies the value and the hue.

223
0:13:21.12,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Thank you.

224
0:13:22.36,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Applause and cheers)

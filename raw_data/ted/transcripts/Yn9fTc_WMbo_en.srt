1
0:00:16.41,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My name's Seth Priebatsch. I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.

2
0:00:19.118,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm a proud Princeton dropout.

3
0:00:20.61,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Also proud to have relocated here to Boston,

4
0:00:22.688,000 --> 0:00:23,000
where I actually grew up.

5
0:00:24.259,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Applause) Yeah, Boston.

6
0:00:26.063,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Easy wins, I should just name the counties that we've got around here.

7
0:00:29.389,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm also fairly determined to try and build

8
0:00:31.604,000 --> 0:00:32,000
a game layer on top of the world.

9
0:00:33.217,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This is sort of a new concept and it's really important,

10
0:00:35.901,000 --> 0:00:38,000
because while the last decade was the decade of social,

11
0:00:39.022,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the decade where the framework in which we connect with other people was built,

12
0:00:42.827,000 --> 0:00:46,000
this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built,

13
0:00:47.174,000 --> 0:00:49,000
where the motivations we use to actually influence behavior

14
0:00:50.126,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and the framework in which that is constructed,

15
0:00:52.365,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is decided upon, and that's really important.

16
0:00:54.508,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I say I want to build a game layer on top of the world,

17
0:00:57.111,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but that's not quite true,

18
0:00:58.386,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because it's already under construction; it's already happening.

19
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And it looks like this right now.

20
0:01:03.444,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It looks like the Web did back in 1997, right?

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's not very good. It's cluttered.

22
0:01:08.21,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's filled with lots of different things that, in short, aren't that fun.

23
0:01:12.124,000 --> 0:01:15,000
There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs,

24
0:01:15.392,000 --> 0:01:17,000
coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes

25
0:01:18.056,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that actually do use game dynamics and are building the game layer --

26
0:01:21.941,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they just suck.

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They're not very well-designed.

28
0:01:25.349,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:26.417,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So that's unfortunate.

30
0:01:27.985,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But luckily, as my favorite action hero, Bob the Builder, says,

31
0:01:32.167,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"We can do better. We can build this better."

32
0:01:34.769,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And the tools, the resources that we use to build a game layer,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
are game dynamics themselves.

34
0:01:40.093,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And so the crux of this presentation is going to go through

35
0:01:42.886,000 --> 0:01:43,000
four really important game dynamics,

36
0:01:44.648,000 --> 0:01:46,000
really interesting things, that, if you use consciously,

37
0:01:47.457,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you can use to influence behavior,

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
both for good, for bad, for in-between.

39
0:01:52.641,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Hopefully for good.

40
0:01:53.964,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But this is the important stage in which that framework will get built,

41
0:01:57.988,000 --> 0:02:,000
and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now.

42
0:02:01.109,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Before we jump into that, there's a question of:

43
0:02:03.39,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Why is this important?

44
0:02:04.565,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I'm making this claim

45
0:02:05.743,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that there's a game layer on top of the world,

46
0:02:07.917,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and it's very important that we build it properly.

47
0:02:10.279,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The reason it's so important is that, in the last decade,

48
0:02:12.973,000 --> 0:02:14,000
what we've seen has been building the social layer,

49
0:02:15.883,000 --> 0:02:17,000
has been this framework for connections,

50
0:02:18.375,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and construction on that layer is over, it's finished.

51
0:02:21.963,000 --> 0:02:22,000
There's still a lot to explore,

52
0:02:23.465,000 --> 0:02:25,000
still a lot of people trying to figure out social

53
0:02:25.78,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and how we leverage this and how we use this,

54
0:02:27.906,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but the framework itself is done,

55
0:02:29.713,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and it's called Facebook.

56
0:02:32.175,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And that's OK, right? A lot of people are very happy with Facebook.

57
0:02:35.57,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I like it quite a lot.

58
0:02:37.183,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They've created this thing called the Open Graph,

59
0:02:39.51,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and they own all of our connections.

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They own half a billion people.

61
0:02:42.891,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So when you want to build on the social layer,

62
0:02:45.099,000 --> 0:02:48,000
the framework has been decided; it is the Open Graph API.

63
0:02:48.335,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And if you're happy with that, fantastic.

64
0:02:50.369,000 --> 0:02:52,000
If you're not, too bad. There's nothing you can do.

65
0:02:53.547,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And that's a real thing.

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I mean, we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and makes it productive down the road.

68
0:03:03.371,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So, the social layer is all about these connections.

69
0:03:06.495,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The game layer is all about influence.

70
0:03:08.931,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's not about adding a social fabric to the web

71
0:03:11.199,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and connecting you to other people

72
0:03:12.85,000 --> 0:03:13,000
everywhere you are and everywhere you go,

73
0:03:14.828,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it's actually about using dynamics, using forces,

74
0:03:17.148,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to influence the behavior of where you are, what you do there,

75
0:03:20.3,000 --> 0:03:21,000
how you do it.

76
0:03:21.477,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That's really, really powerful.

77
0:03:22.995,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And it's going to be more important than the social layer,

78
0:03:25.751,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and affect our lives more deeply and perhaps more invisibly.

79
0:03:28.67,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So it's incredibly critical that at this moment,

80
0:03:31.492,000 --> 0:03:32,000
while it's just getting constructed,

81
0:03:33.236,000 --> 0:03:35,000
while the frameworks like Facebook or Open Graph

82
0:03:35.566,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are being created for the game-layer equivalent,

83
0:03:37.86,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that we think about it very consciously,

84
0:03:39.808,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and that we do it in a way that is open, available,

85
0:03:42.22,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and can be leveraged for good.

86
0:03:43.733,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So that's what I want to talk about for game dynamics,

87
0:03:46.287,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because construction has just begun,

88
0:03:48.034,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and the more consciously we can think about this,

89
0:03:50.407,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the better we'll be able to use it for anything we want.

90
0:03:53.495,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So like I said, the way you go through and build on the game layer

91
0:03:56.665,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is not with glass and steel and cement.

92
0:03:59.816,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the resources we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land

93
0:04:03.051,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that we have.

94
0:04:04.231,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The resources are mindshare,

95
0:04:05.604,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and the tools, the raw materials, are these game dynamics.

96
0:04:08.412,000 --> 0:04:1,000
With that, a couple game dynamics to talk about.

97
0:04:11.137,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Back at SCVNGR, we like to joke

98
0:04:12.686,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that with seven game dynamics, you can get anyone to do anything.

99
0:04:15.782,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Today, I'm going to show you four,

100
0:04:17.444,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this, still.

101
0:04:20.946,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:23.101,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So the first one, it's a very simple game dynamic.

103
0:04:25.637,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's called the appointment dynamic.

104
0:04:27.453,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's a dynamic in which to succeed,

105
0:04:29.284,000 --> 0:04:31,000
players have to do something at a predefined time,

106
0:04:31.689,000 --> 0:04:32,000
generally at a predefined place.

107
0:04:33.395,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes,

108
0:04:35.695,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because you think, "Other people can be using forces

109
0:04:38.459,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that will manipulate how I interact:

110
0:04:40.359,000 --> 0:04:41,000
what I do, where I do it, when I do it."

111
0:04:42.36,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This sort of "loss of free will" that occurs in games

112
0:04:44.872,000 --> 0:04:45,000
can be frightening.

113
0:04:46.135,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So with each dynamic, I'm going to give three examples:

114
0:04:48.744,000 --> 0:04:5,000
one that shows how it's already being used in the real world,

115
0:04:51.634,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so you can rationalize it a bit;

116
0:04:53.284,000 --> 0:04:55,000
one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game --

117
0:04:56.126,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I think everything is a game,

118
0:04:57.542,000 --> 0:05:,000
but this is more what you'd think of as a game played on a board

119
0:05:00.581,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or on a computer screen;

120
0:05:01.758,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and one of how it can be used for good,

121
0:05:03.649,000 --> 0:05:05,000
so you can see that these forces can be very powerful.

122
0:05:06.231,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So the first one, the most famous appointment dynamic in the world,

123
0:05:09.438,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is something called, "Happy Hour."

124
0:05:11.656,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I had just recently dropped out of Princeton

125
0:05:14.162,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and actually ended up for the first time in a bar,

126
0:05:16.679,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I saw these happy hour things all over the place.

127
0:05:19.473,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And this is simply an appointment dynamic: come here at a certain time,

128
0:05:22.901,000 --> 0:05:23,000
get your drinks half off.

129
0:05:24.123,000 --> 0:05:27,000
To win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.

130
0:05:27.691,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This game dynamic is so powerful,

131
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it doesn't just influence our behavior; it's influenced our entire culture.

132
0:05:32.914,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That's a really scary thought,

133
0:05:34.374,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully.

134
0:05:37.135,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It also exists in more conventional game forms.

135
0:05:39.354,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now.

136
0:05:41.529,000 --> 0:05:42,000
If you haven't, I recommend playing it.

137
0:05:43.439,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You won't do anything else for the rest of your day.

138
0:05:45.932,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Farmville has more active users than Twitter.

139
0:05:48.084,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's incredibly powerful,

140
0:05:49.315,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time

141
0:05:52.456,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to water your fake crops, or they wilt.

142
0:05:55.416,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats,

143
0:05:58.652,000 --> 0:05:59,000
when they say your crops wilt

144
0:06:00.485,000 --> 0:06:02,000
after eight hours, or after six hours, or after 24 hours,

145
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day.

146
0:06:07.851,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They will return, like clockwork, at different times.

147
0:06:10.493,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So if they wanted the world to end, if they wanted productivity to stop,

148
0:06:13.907,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they could make it a 30-minute cycle,

149
0:06:15.701,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and no one could do anything else, right?

150
0:06:17.719,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:19.259,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That's a little scary.

152
0:06:20.751,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But this could also be used for good.

153
0:06:23.037,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This local company called Vitality

154
0:06:24.839,000 --> 0:06:27,000
has created a product to help people take their medicine on time.

155
0:06:27.998,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That's an appointment.

156
0:06:29.175,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's something that people don't do very well.

157
0:06:31.374,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They have these GlowCaps which flash and email you

158
0:06:33.794,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and do cool things to remind you to take your medicine.

159
0:06:36.421,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This isn't a game yet, but really should be.

160
0:06:38.591,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You should get points for doing it on time

161
0:06:40.673,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and lose points for not doing it on time.

162
0:06:42.663,000 --> 0:06:44,000
They should recognize they've built an appointment dynamic,

163
0:06:45.458,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and leverage the games.

164
0:06:46.633,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways.

165
0:06:49.424,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We're going to jump onto the next one.

166
0:06:51.97,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Influence and status.

167
0:06:53.259,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is one of the most famous game dynamics, used all over the place.

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's used in your wallets, right now.

169
0:06:59.389,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We all want that credit card on the far left, because it's black.

170
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And you see someone at CVS or --

171
0:07:05.125,000 --> 0:07:06,000
not CVS -- like, Christian Dior --

172
0:07:06.816,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

173
0:07:08.86,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I don't know. I don't have a black card; I've got a debit card.

174
0:07:12.152,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

175
0:07:13.961,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So they whip it out and you see that black card, and:

176
0:07:16.588,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"I want that because it means they're cooler than I am,

177
0:07:19.199,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and I need that."

178
0:07:20.374,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And this is used in games as well.

179
0:07:22.088,000 --> 0:07:25,000
"Modern Warfare," one of the most successful selling games of all time.

180
0:07:25.485,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I'm only a level four, but I desperately want to be a level 10,

181
0:07:28.51,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because they've got that cool red badge,

182
0:07:30.451,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else.

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And that's very powerful to me.

184
0:07:34.85,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Status is really good motivator.

185
0:07:36.983,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's also used in more conventional settings,

186
0:07:39.147,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and can be used more consciously there.

187
0:07:41.052,000 --> 0:07:43,000
School -- and remember, I made it through one year,

188
0:07:44.029,000 --> 0:07:46,000
so I think I'm qualified to talk on school --

189
0:07:46.67,000 --> 0:07:49,000
is a game; it's just not a terribly well-designed game.

190
0:07:49.797,000 --> 0:07:51,000
There are levels. There are C. There are B. There's A.

191
0:07:52.355,000 --> 0:07:55,000
There are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status?

192
0:07:55.447,000 --> 0:07:59,000
If we called valedictorian a "White Knight Paladin level 20,"

193
0:07:59.851,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I think people would probably work a lot harder.

194
0:08:02.132,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:04.156,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Applause)

196
0:08:05.93,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So school is a game,

197
0:08:07.62,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and there has been lots of experimentation on how we do this properly.

198
0:08:10.959,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But let's use it consciously.

199
0:08:12.372,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Why have games you can lose? Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?

200
0:08:15.649,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That sucks. Why not level-up?

201
0:08:17.196,000 --> 0:08:19,000
At Princeton, they've actually experimented with this,

202
0:08:19.775,000 --> 0:08:21,000
with quizzes where you gain experience points,

203
0:08:21.966,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and you level up from B to an A.

204
0:08:23.721,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And it's very powerful.

205
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It can be used in interesting ways.

206
0:08:28.172,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The third one I'll talk about is the progression dynamic,

207
0:08:30.91,000 --> 0:08:32,000
where you have to make progress, move through different steps

208
0:08:33.841,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in a very granular fashion.

209
0:08:35.523,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This is used all over the place, including LinkedIn,

210
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
where I am an unwhole individual.

211
0:08:40.578,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,

212
0:08:43.882,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and that bothers me.

213
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And this is so deep-seated in our psyche

214
0:08:48.359,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that when we're presented with a progress bar

215
0:08:50.506,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and presented with easy, granular steps to take

216
0:08:53.07,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to try and complete that progress bar, we will do it.

217
0:08:55.681,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We will find a way to move that blue line

218
0:08:57.675,000 --> 0:08:59,000
all the way to the right edge of the screen.

219
0:09:00.172,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This is used in conventional games as well.

220
0:09:02.332,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I mean, this is a Paladin level 10,

221
0:09:04.549,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and that's a Paladin level 20.

222
0:09:06.177,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And if you were going to fight Orcs on the fields of Mordor

223
0:09:09.766,000 --> 0:09:1,000
against the Ra's Al Ghul,

224
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
you'd probably want to be the bigger one, right?

225
0:09:13.57,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I would.

226
0:09:15.261,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And so people work very hard to level-up.

227
0:09:17.796,000 --> 0:09:2,000
"World of Warcraft" is one of the most successful games of all time.

228
0:09:21.05,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The average player spends some six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it,

229
0:09:24.702,000 --> 0:09:27,000
their most dedicated players -- it's like a full-time job, it's insane.

230
0:09:28.324,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And they have these systems where you can level-up.

231
0:09:30.79,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful.

232
0:09:34.121,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It can also be used in very compelling ways for good.

233
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:

234
0:09:39.206,000 --> 0:09:42,000
How do you use games to drive traffic and business to local businesses,

235
0:09:42.638,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to something that is very key to the economy?

236
0:09:44.808,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And here, we have a game that people play.

237
0:09:47.126,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They go places, do challenges, earn points.

238
0:09:49.174,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it,

239
0:09:51.782,000 --> 0:09:54,000
where, by going to the same place over and over, doing challenges,

240
0:09:54.914,000 --> 0:09:55,000
engaging with the business,

241
0:09:56.232,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right,

242
0:09:59.418,000 --> 0:10:,000
and unlock rewards.

243
0:10:00.596,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This is powerful enough that we can see it hooks people into these dynamics,

244
0:10:04.536,000 --> 0:10:06,000
pulls them back to the same local businesses,

245
0:10:06.658,000 --> 0:10:07,000
creates loyalty, creates engagement,

246
0:10:08.416,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses.

247
0:10:12.367,000 --> 0:10:15,000
These progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world.

248
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The final one I want to talk about -- and it's a great one to end on --

249
0:10:19.637,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is this concept of communal discovery,

250
0:10:21.518,000 --> 0:10:25,000
a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something.

251
0:10:25.8,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Communal discovery is powerful

252
0:10:27.65,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because it leverages the network that is society

253
0:10:30.69,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to solve problems.

254
0:10:33.071,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This is used in some famous consumer web stories like Digg,

255
0:10:36.873,000 --> 0:10:37,000
which I'm sure you've all heard of.

256
0:10:38.582,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Digg is a communal dynamic

257
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to try to find and source the best news, the most interesting stories.

258
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And they made this into a game, initially.

259
0:10:46.284,000 --> 0:10:49,000
They had a leader board where, if you recommended the best stories,

260
0:10:49.472,000 --> 0:10:5,000
you would get points.

261
0:10:50.848,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And that really motivated people to find the best stories.

262
0:10:53.624,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But it became so powerful, there was actually a cabal,

263
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
a group of people, the top seven on the leader board,

264
0:10:59.683,000 --> 0:11:02,000
who would work together to make sure they maintained that position,

265
0:11:02.886,000 --> 0:11:03,000
recommending people's stories.

266
0:11:04.355,000 --> 0:11:06,000
The game became more powerful than the goal.

267
0:11:06.592,000 --> 0:11:09,000
They ended up shutting down the leader board because, while it was effective,

268
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories,

269
0:11:13.188,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and started having people work to maintain leadership.

270
0:11:15.759,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So we have to use this one carefully.

271
0:11:17.55,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly,

272
0:11:19.929,000 --> 0:11:21,000
where the game is not the Monopoly you're playing,

273
0:11:22.342,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but the cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk.

274
0:11:25.695,000 --> 0:11:28,000
There, they're just looking for a sticker that says "Boardwalk,"

275
0:11:28.933,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but it can also be used to find real things.

276
0:11:31.015,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is the DARPA balloon challenge,

277
0:11:32.772,000 --> 0:11:35,000
where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said,

278
0:11:36.137,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest,

279
0:11:38.591,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and the winner will get $40,000."

280
0:11:40.261,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The winner was a group out of MIT,

281
0:11:42.132,000 --> 0:11:44,000
where they created sort of a pyramid scheme, a network,

282
0:11:44.752,000 --> 0:11:47,000
where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000,

283
0:11:48.205,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut.

284
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And in 12 hours, they were able to find all these balloons,

285
0:11:54.175,000 --> 0:11:55,000
all across the country.

286
0:11:55.665,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Really powerful dynamic.

287
0:11:57.413,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And so, I've got about 20 seconds left,

288
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
so if I'm going to leave you with anything,

289
0:12:02.332,000 --> 0:12:03,000
last decade was the decade of social.

290
0:12:04.138,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This next decade is the decade of games.

291
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare.

292
0:12:09.151,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We can influence behavior.

293
0:12:10.42,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It's very powerful. It's very exciting.

294
0:12:12.307,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Let's all build it together, let's do it well and have fun playing.

295
0:12:15.688,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Applause)

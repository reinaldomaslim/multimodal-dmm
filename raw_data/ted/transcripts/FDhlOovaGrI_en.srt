1
0:00:12.806,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Imagine that you invented a device

2
0:00:14.905,000 --> 0:00:15,000
that can record my memories,

3
0:00:16.601,000 --> 0:00:18,000
my dreams, my ideas,

4
0:00:18.662,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and transmit them to your brain.

5
0:00:20.755,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That would be a game-changing technology, right?

6
0:00:23.854,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But in fact, we already possess this device,

7
0:00:26.916,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and it's called human communication system

8
0:00:29.584,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and effective storytelling.

9
0:00:31.874,000 --> 0:00:33,000
To understand how this device works,

10
0:00:34.358,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we have to look into our brains.

11
0:00:36.797,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And we have to formulate the question in a slightly different manner.

12
0:00:40.407,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now we have to ask

13
0:00:42.309,000 --> 0:00:44,000
how these neuron patterns in my brain

14
0:00:44.949,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that are associated with my memories and ideas

15
0:00:48.175,000 --> 0:00:5,000
are transmitted into your brains.

16
0:00:51.702,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And we think there are two factors that enable us to communicate.

17
0:00:55.094,000 --> 0:00:59,000
First, your brain is now physically coupled to the sound wave

18
0:00:59.173,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that I'm transmitting to your brain.

19
0:01:01.672,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And second, we developed a common neural protocol

20
0:01:05.074,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that enabled us to communicate.

21
0:01:07.459,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So how do we know that?

22
0:01:09.292,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In my lab in Princeton,

23
0:01:11.209,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we bring people to the fMRI scanner and we scan their brains

24
0:01:14.738,000 --> 0:01:17,000
while they are either telling or listening to real-life stories.

25
0:01:18.662,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And to give you a sense of the stimulus we are using,

26
0:01:21.31,000 --> 0:01:24,000
let me play 20 seconds from a story that we used,

27
0:01:25.318,000 --> 0:01:27,000
told by a very talented storyteller,

28
0:01:27.666,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Jim O'Grady.

29
0:01:30.244,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Audio) Jim O'Grady: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good,

30
0:01:33.601,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and then I start to make it better --

31
0:01:35.915,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:38.423,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by adding an element of embellishment.

33
0:01:41.502,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Reporters call this "making shit up."

34
0:01:44.834,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:47.735,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And they recommend against crossing that line.

36
0:01:52.208,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But I had just seen the line crossed between a high-powered dean

37
0:01:56.836,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and assault with a pastry.

38
0:01:58.286,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I kinda liked it."

39
0:01:59.802,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Uri Hasson: OK, so now let's look into your brain

40
0:02:02.2,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and see what's happening when you listen to these kinds of stories.

41
0:02:05.452,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And let's start simple -- let's start with one listener and one brain area:

42
0:02:09.52,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the auditory cortex that processes the sounds that come from the ear.

43
0:02:13.033,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And as you can see, in this particular brain area,

44
0:02:15.501,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the responses are going up and down as the story is unfolding.

45
0:02:19.017,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now we can take these responses

46
0:02:20.634,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and compare them to the responses in other listeners

47
0:02:23.459,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in the same brain area.

48
0:02:24.958,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And we can ask:

49
0:02:26.149,000 --> 0:02:29,000
How similar are the responses across all listeners?

50
0:02:30.018,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So here you can see five listeners.

51
0:02:32.983,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And we start to scan their brains before the story starts,

52
0:02:36.46,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when they're simply lying in the dark and waiting for the story to begin.

53
0:02:40.023,000 --> 0:02:41,000
As you can see,

54
0:02:41.201,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the brain area is going up and down in each one of them,

55
0:02:43.983,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but the responses are very different,

56
0:02:45.782,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and not in sync.

57
0:02:47.473,000 --> 0:02:49,000
However, immediately as the story is starting,

58
0:02:50.203,000 --> 0:02:51,000
something amazing is happening.

59
0:02:52.857,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story and I know it's good,

60
0:02:55.81,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and then I start to make it --

61
0:02:57.362,000 --> 0:03:,000
UH: Suddenly, you can see that the responses in all of the subjects

62
0:03:00.683,000 --> 0:03:01,000
lock to the story,

63
0:03:01.859,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and now they are going up and down in a very similar way

64
0:03:05.312,000 --> 0:03:06,000
across all listeners.

65
0:03:06.89,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And in fact, this is exactly what is happening now in your brains

66
0:03:09.963,000 --> 0:03:11,000
when you listen to my sound speaking.

67
0:03:12.86,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We call this effect "neural entrainment."

68
0:03:16.374,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And to explain to you what is neural entrainment,

69
0:03:18.71,000 --> 0:03:2,000
let me first explain what is physical entrainment.

70
0:03:22.076,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So, we'll look and see five metronomes.

71
0:03:24.85,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Think of these five metronomes as five brains.

72
0:03:27.87,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And similar to the listeners before the story starts,

73
0:03:30.644,000 --> 0:03:31,000
these metronomes are going to click,

74
0:03:32.481,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but they're going to click out of phase.

75
0:03:35.059,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Clicking)

76
0:03:39.479,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now see what will happen when I connect them together

77
0:03:42.504,000 --> 0:03:44,000
by placing them on these two cylinders.

78
0:03:45.88,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Clicking)

79
0:03:49.125,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now these two cylinders start to rotate.

80
0:03:51.761,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This rotation vibration is going through the wood

81
0:03:54.914,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and is going to couple all the metronomes together.

82
0:03:57.943,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And now listen to the click.

83
0:03:59.579,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Synchronized clicking)

84
0:04:09.834,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This is what you call physical entrainment.

85
0:04:12.482,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now let's go back to the brain and ask:

86
0:04:14.749,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What's driving this neural entrainment?

87
0:04:16.917,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Is it simply the sounds that the speaker is producing?

88
0:04:19.726,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Or maybe it's the words.

89
0:04:21.073,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Or maybe it's the meaning that the speaker is trying to convey.

90
0:04:24.743,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So to test it, we did the following experiment.

91
0:04:27.527,000 --> 0:04:3,000
First, we took the story and played it backwards.

92
0:04:30.752,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And that preserved many of the original auditory features,

93
0:04:33.902,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but removed the meaning.

94
0:04:35.939,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And it sounds something like that.

95
0:04:37.634,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Audio) JO: (Unintelligible)

96
0:04:43.296,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And we flashed colors in the two brains

97
0:04:45.672,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to indicate brain areas that respond very similarly across people.

98
0:04:49.608,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And as you can see,

99
0:04:50.786,000 --> 0:04:53,000
this incoming sound induced entrainment or alignment in all of the brains

100
0:04:54.578,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in auditory cortices that process the sounds,

101
0:04:57.334,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but it didn't spread deeper into the brain.

102
0:05:00.051,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now we can take these sounds and build words out of it.

103
0:05:03.479,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So if we take Jim O'Grady and scramble the words,

104
0:05:06.159,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we'll get a list of words.

105
0:05:07.423,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Audio) JO: ... an animal ... assorted facts ...

106
0:05:09.709,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and right on ... pie man ... potentially ... my stories

107
0:05:12.625,000 --> 0:05:14,000
UH: And you can see that these words start to induce alignment

108
0:05:15.591,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in early language areas, but not more than that.

109
0:05:18.22,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now we can take the words and start to build sentences out of them.

110
0:05:23.561,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Audio) JO: And they recommend against crossing that line.

111
0:05:28.021,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He says: "Dear Jim, Good story. Nice details.

112
0:05:32.369,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Didn't she only know about him through me?"

113
0:05:34.545,000 --> 0:05:37,000
UH: Now you can see that the responses in all the language areas

114
0:05:37.704,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that process the incoming language

115
0:05:39.419,000 --> 0:05:41,000
become aligned or similar across all listeners.

116
0:05:42.218,000 --> 0:05:46,000
However, only when we use the full, engaging, coherent story

117
0:05:46.919,000 --> 0:05:48,000
do the responses spread deeper into the brain

118
0:05:49.168,000 --> 0:05:5,000
into higher-order areas,

119
0:05:50.723,000 --> 0:05:53,000
which include the frontal cortex and the parietal cortex,

120
0:05:53.848,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and make all of them respond very similarly.

121
0:05:56.46,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And we believe that these responses in higher-order areas are induced

122
0:05:59.753,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or become similar across listeners

123
0:06:01.903,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because of the meaning conveyed by the speaker,

124
0:06:04.667,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and not by words or sound.

125
0:06:06.635,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And if we are right, there's a strong prediction over here

126
0:06:09.374,000 --> 0:06:11,000
if I tell you the exact same ideas

127
0:06:11.76,000 --> 0:06:13,000
using two very different sets of words,

128
0:06:14.428,000 --> 0:06:16,000
your brain responses will still be similar.

129
0:06:17.499,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And to test it, we did the following experiment in my lab.

130
0:06:21.142,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We took the English story

131
0:06:22.974,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and translated it to Russian.

132
0:06:25.134,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now you have two different sounds and linguistic systems

133
0:06:29.382,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that convey the exact same meaning.

134
0:06:31.7,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And you play the English story to the English listeners

135
0:06:35.372,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and the Russian story to the Russian listeners,

136
0:06:37.748,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and we can compare their responses across the groups.

137
0:06:40.817,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And when we did that, we didn't see responses that are similar

138
0:06:44.412,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in auditory cortices in language,

139
0:06:46.717,000 --> 0:06:48,000
because the language and sound are very different.

140
0:06:49.119,000 --> 0:06:51,000
However, you can see that the responses in high-order areas

141
0:06:51.921,000 --> 0:06:53,000
were still similar across these two groups.

142
0:06:55.068,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We believe this is because they understood the story in a very similar way,

143
0:06:59.184,000 --> 0:07:03,000
as we confirmed, using a test after the story ended.

144
0:07:04.321,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And we think that this alignment is necessary for communication.

145
0:07:08.032,000 --> 0:07:1,000
For example, as you can tell,

146
0:07:10.682,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I am not a native English speaker.

147
0:07:12.733,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I grew up with another language,

148
0:07:14.638,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and the same might be for many of you in the audience.

149
0:07:17.316,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And still, we can communicate.

150
0:07:19.339,000 --> 0:07:2,000
How come?

151
0:07:20.514,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We think we can communicate because we have this common code

152
0:07:23.617,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that presents meaning.

153
0:07:25.921,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So far, I've only talked about what's happening in the listener's brain,

154
0:07:29.391,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in your brain, when you're listening to talks.

155
0:07:31.662,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But what's happening in the speaker's brain, in my brain,

156
0:07:34.385,000 --> 0:07:35,000
when I'm speaking to you?

157
0:07:36.216,000 --> 0:07:37,000
To look in the speaker's brain,

158
0:07:38.097,000 --> 0:07:41,000
we asked the speaker to go into the scanner,

159
0:07:41.217,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we scan his brain

160
0:07:42.843,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and then compare his brain responses to the brain responses of the listeners

161
0:07:46.874,000 --> 0:07:47,000
listening to the story.

162
0:07:48.7,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You have to remember that producing speech and comprehending speech

163
0:07:52.934,000 --> 0:07:53,000
are very different processes.

164
0:07:54.681,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Here we're asking: How similar are they?

165
0:07:58.164,000 --> 0:07:59,000
To our surprise,

166
0:07:59.595,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we saw that all these complex patterns within the listeners

167
0:08:04.49,000 --> 0:08:06,000
actually came from the speaker brain.

168
0:08:07.221,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So production and comprehension rely on very similar processes.

169
0:08:10.93,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And we also found

170
0:08:12.526,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the stronger the similarity between the listener's brain

171
0:08:16.256,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and the speaker's brain,

172
0:08:17.779,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the better the communication.

173
0:08:19.708,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So I know that if you are completely confused now,

174
0:08:23.697,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and I do hope that this is not the case,

175
0:08:25.742,000 --> 0:08:27,000
your brain responses are very different than mine.

176
0:08:28.159,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But I also know that if you really understand me now,

177
0:08:31.29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
then your brain ... and your brain ... and your brain

178
0:08:34.205,000 --> 0:08:35,000
are really similar to mine.

179
0:08:37.793,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Now, let's take all this information together and ask:

180
0:08:40.912,000 --> 0:08:43,000
How can we use it to transmit a memory that I have

181
0:08:44.273,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from my brain to your brains?

182
0:08:47.037,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So we did the following experiment.

183
0:08:49.648,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We let people watch, for the first time in their life,

184
0:08:52.245,000 --> 0:08:56,000
a TV episode from the BBC series "Sherlock," while we scanned their brains.

185
0:08:56.403,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And then we asked them to go back to the scanner

186
0:08:59.228,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and tell the story to another person that never watched the movie.

187
0:09:03.151,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So let's be specific.

188
0:09:04.835,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Think about this exact scene,

189
0:09:06.906,000 --> 0:09:08,000
when Sherlock is entering the cab in London

190
0:09:09.514,000 --> 0:09:11,000
driven by the murderer he is looking for.

191
0:09:12.398,000 --> 0:09:14,000
With me, as a viewer,

192
0:09:14.918,000 --> 0:09:17,000
there is a specific brain pattern in my brain when I watch it.

193
0:09:19.179,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now, the exact same pattern, I can reactivate in my brain again

194
0:09:22.975,000 --> 0:09:25,000
by telling the word: Sherlock, London, murderer.

195
0:09:27.369,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And when I'm transmitting these words to your brains now,

196
0:09:30.503,000 --> 0:09:32,000
you have to reconstruct it in your mind.

197
0:09:33.012,000 --> 0:09:37,000
In fact, we see that pattern emerging now in your brains.

198
0:09:37.585,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And we were really surprised to see

199
0:09:40.124,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that the pattern you have now in your brains

200
0:09:42.403,000 --> 0:09:43,000
when I'm describing to you these scenes

201
0:09:44.339,000 --> 0:09:47,000
would be very similar to the pattern I had when I watched this movie

202
0:09:48.185,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a few months ago in the scanner.

203
0:09:50.347,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This starts to tell you about the mechanism

204
0:09:52.475,000 --> 0:09:54,000
by which we can tell stories and transmit information.

205
0:09:55.733,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Because, for example,

206
0:09:57.633,000 --> 0:10:,000
now you're listening really hard and trying to understand what I'm saying.

207
0:10:01.169,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And I know that it's not easy.

208
0:10:02.743,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But I hope that at one point in the talk we clicked, and you got me.

209
0:10:06.803,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And I think that in a few hours, a few days, a few months,

210
0:10:10.725,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you're going to meet someone at a party,

211
0:10:12.893,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and you're going to tell him about this lecture,

212
0:10:16.465,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and suddenly it will be as if he is standing now here with us.

213
0:10:20.127,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now you can see how we can take this mechanism

214
0:10:23.001,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and try to transmit memories and knowledge across people,

215
0:10:26.956,000 --> 0:10:28,000
which is wonderful, right?

216
0:10:29.027,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But our ability to communicate relies on our ability

217
0:10:32.218,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to have common ground.

218
0:10:34.808,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Because, for example,

219
0:10:36.037,000 --> 0:10:39,000
if I'm going to use the British synonym

220
0:10:39.828,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"hackney carriage" instead of "cab,"

221
0:10:42.23,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I know that I'm going to be misaligned with most of you in the audience.

222
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:48,000
This alignment depends not only on our ability

223
0:10:48.935,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to understand the basic concept;

224
0:10:50.993,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it also depends on our ability to develop common ground and understanding

225
0:10:55.812,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and shared belief systems.

226
0:10:57.623,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Because we know that in many cases,

227
0:10:59.481,000 --> 0:11:03,000
people understand the exact same story in very different ways.

228
0:11:04.46,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So to test it in the lab, we did the following experiment.

229
0:11:08.089,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We took a story by J.D. Salinger,

230
0:11:11.044,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in which a husband lost track of his wife in the middle of a party,

231
0:11:15.403,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and he's calling his best friend, asking, "Did you see my wife?"

232
0:11:19.836,000 --> 0:11:2,000
For half of the subjects,

233
0:11:21.067,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we said that the wife was having an affair with the best friend.

234
0:11:25.232,000 --> 0:11:26,000
For the other half,

235
0:11:26.407,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we said that the wife is loyal and the husband is very jealous.

236
0:11:32.127,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This one sentence before the story started

237
0:11:34.839,000 --> 0:11:36,000
was enough to make the brain responses

238
0:11:37.164,000 --> 0:11:4,000
of all the people that believed the wife was having an affair

239
0:11:40.232,000 --> 0:11:42,000
be very similar in these high-order areas

240
0:11:42.693,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and different than the other group.

241
0:11:44.939,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And if one sentence is enough to make your brain similar

242
0:11:48.636,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to people that think like you

243
0:11:50.263,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and very different than people that think differently than you,

244
0:11:53.24,000 --> 0:11:56,000
think how this effect is going to be amplified in real life,

245
0:11:56.741,000 --> 0:11:58,000
when we are all listening to the exact same news item

246
0:11:59.657,000 --> 0:12:02,000
after being exposed day after day after day

247
0:12:03.429,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to different media channels, like Fox News or The New York Times,

248
0:12:07.265,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that give us very different perspectives on reality.

249
0:12:11.556,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So let me summarize.

250
0:12:13.529,000 --> 0:12:15,000
If everything worked as planned tonight,

251
0:12:15.642,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I used my ability to vocalize sound to be coupled to your brains.

252
0:12:19.965,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And I used this coupling

253
0:12:21.492,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to transmit my brain patterns associated with my memories and ideas

254
0:12:25.357,000 --> 0:12:26,000
into your brains.

255
0:12:27.201,000 --> 0:12:3,000
In this, I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism

256
0:12:31.023,000 --> 0:12:32,000
by which we communicate.

257
0:12:32.682,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And we know that in the future it will enable us to improve

258
0:12:35.673,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and facilitate communication.

259
0:12:38.111,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But these studies also reveal

260
0:12:40.535,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that communication relies on a common ground.

261
0:12:43.845,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And we have to be really worried as a society

262
0:12:46.331,000 --> 0:12:5,000
if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people

263
0:12:50.391,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that are slightly different than us

264
0:12:52.532,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because we let a few very strong media channels

265
0:12:55.944,000 --> 0:12:56,000
take control of the mic,

266
0:12:57.509,000 --> 0:13:,000
and manipulate and control the way we all think.

267
0:13:01.308,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm only a scientist.

268
0:13:04.233,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But maybe one way to do it

269
0:13:06.717,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is to go back to the more natural way of communication,

270
0:13:09.388,000 --> 0:13:1,000
which is a dialogue,

271
0:13:11.014,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in which it's not only me speaking to you now,

272
0:13:13.994,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but a more natural way of talking,

273
0:13:16.234,000 --> 0:13:19,000
in which I am speaking and I am listening,

274
0:13:19.535,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and together we are trying to come to a common ground and new ideas.

275
0:13:24.279,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Because after all,

276
0:13:25.461,000 --> 0:13:28,000
the people we are coupled to define who we are.

277
0:13:29.149,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And our desire to be coupled to another brain

278
0:13:31.562,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is something very basic that starts at a very early age.

279
0:13:36.103,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So let me finish with an example from my own private life

280
0:13:41.044,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that I think is a good example of how coupling to other people

281
0:13:45.379,000 --> 0:13:47,000
is really going to define who we are.

282
0:13:48.294,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This my son Jonathan at a very early age.

283
0:13:51.392,000 --> 0:13:55,000
See how he developed a vocal game together with my wife,

284
0:13:55.566,000 --> 0:14:,000
only from the desire and pure joy of being coupled to another human being.

285
0:14:01.556,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Both vocalizing)

286
0:14:14.915,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Laughter)

287
0:14:17.267,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Now, think how the ability of my son

288
0:14:21.088,000 --> 0:14:23,000
to be coupled to us and other people in his life

289
0:14:23.874,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is going to shape the man he is going to become.

290
0:14:26.756,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And think how you change on a daily basis

291
0:14:29.195,000 --> 0:14:33,000
from the interaction and coupling to other people in your life.

292
0:14:34.562,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So keep being coupled to other people.

293
0:14:37.157,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Keep spreading your ideas,

294
0:14:38.73,000 --> 0:14:41,000
because the sum of all of us together, coupled,

295
0:14:41.998,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is greater than our parts.

296
0:14:43.616,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Thank you.

297
0:14:44.806,000 --> 0:14:49,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.228,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I'm a city planner, an urban designer,

2
0:00:17.518,000 --> 0:00:19,000
former arts advocate,

3
0:00:19.59,000 --> 0:00:22,000
trained in architecture and art history,

4
0:00:23.383,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I want to talk to you today not about design

5
0:00:26.517,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but about America

6
0:00:28.953,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and how America can be more economically resilient,

7
0:00:33.158,000 --> 0:00:35,000
how America can be healthier,

8
0:00:35.483,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and how America can be

9
0:00:37.136,000 --> 0:00:39,000
more environmentally sustainable.

10
0:00:39.754,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I realize this is a global forum,

11
0:00:42.172,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but I think I need to talk about America

12
0:00:44.241,000 --> 0:00:45,000
because there is a history,

13
0:00:45.824,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in some places, not all,

14
0:00:47.511,000 --> 0:00:49,000
of American ideas being appropriated,

15
0:00:49.961,000 --> 0:00:51,000
being emulated, for better or for worse,

16
0:00:52.493,000 --> 0:00:53,000
around the world.

17
0:00:53.834,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And the worst idea we've ever had

18
0:00:55.985,000 --> 0:00:57,000
is suburban sprawl.

19
0:00:58.352,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's being emulated in many places as we speak.

20
0:01:01.723,000 --> 0:01:03,000
By suburban sprawl, I refer to the reorganization

21
0:01:04.386,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of the landscape and the creation of the landscape

22
0:01:06.79,000 --> 0:01:1,000
around the requirement of automobile use,

23
0:01:11.126,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom

24
0:01:13.769,000 --> 0:01:16,000
has become a gas-belching,

25
0:01:17.52,000 --> 0:01:19,000
time-wasting and life-threatening

26
0:01:20.12,000 --> 0:01:21,000
prosthetic device

27
0:01:21.553,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that many of us need just to,

28
0:01:23.189,000 --> 0:01:24,000
most Americans, in fact, need,

29
0:01:24.777,000 --> 0:01:26,000
just to live their daily lives.

30
0:01:27.097,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And there's an alternative.

31
0:01:28.681,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You know, we say, half the world is living in cities.

32
0:01:30.269,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Well, in America, that living in cities,

33
0:01:32.21,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for many of them, they're living in cities still

34
0:01:33.868,000 --> 0:01:35,000
where they're dependent on that automobile.

35
0:01:36.134,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And what I work for, and to do,

36
0:01:39.113,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is to make our cities more walkable.

37
0:01:41.799,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But I can't give design arguments for that

38
0:01:44.322,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that will have as much impact

39
0:01:46.011,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as the arguments that I've learned

40
0:01:47.927,000 --> 0:01:5,000
from the economists, the epidemiologists

41
0:01:51.444,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the environmentalists.

42
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So these are the three arguments that I'm going

43
0:01:54.421,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to give you quickly today.

44
0:01:57.532,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When I was growing up in the '70s,

45
0:01:59.016,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the typical American spent one tenth of their income,

46
0:02:02.651,000 --> 0:02:05,000
American family, on transportation.

47
0:02:05.89,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Since then, we've doubled the number of roads

48
0:02:08.475,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in America, and we now spend one fifth

49
0:02:11.252,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of our income on transportation.

50
0:02:13.913,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Working families, which are defined as

51
0:02:15.974,000 --> 0:02:16,000
earning between 20,000 and 50,000 dollars

52
0:02:17.898,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a year in America

53
0:02:19.857,000 --> 0:02:21,000
are spending more now on transportation

54
0:02:22.361,000 --> 0:02:24,000
than on housing, slightly more,

55
0:02:24.599,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because of this phenomenon called "drive till you qualify,"

56
0:02:27.832,000 --> 0:02:29,000
finding homes further and further and further

57
0:02:30.25,000 --> 0:02:32,000
from the city centers and from their jobs,

58
0:02:33.177,000 --> 0:02:35,000
so that they're locked in this, two, three hours,

59
0:02:35.702,000 --> 0:02:37,000
four hours a day of commuting.

60
0:02:37.899,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And these are the neighborhoods, for example,

61
0:02:39.373,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in the Central Valley of California

62
0:02:41.795,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst

63
0:02:44.902,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and when the price of gas went up;

64
0:02:47.124,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they were decimated.

65
0:02:49.392,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And in fact, these are many

66
0:02:50.658,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of the half-vacant communities that you see today.

67
0:02:53.261,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage,

68
0:02:56.442,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it goes underwater, and you have to pay

69
0:02:58.515,000 --> 0:03:01,000
twice as much for all the driving that you're doing.

70
0:03:02.38,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So we know what it's done to our society

71
0:03:05.1,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and all the extra work we have to do

72
0:03:07.431,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to support our cars.

73
0:03:09.2,000 --> 0:03:1,000
What happens when a city decides

74
0:03:10.932,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it's going to set other priorities?

75
0:03:13.206,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And probably the best example we have here

76
0:03:15.178,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in America is Portland, Oregon.

77
0:03:17.589,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Portland made a bunch of decisions in the 1970s

78
0:03:20.928,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that began to distinguish it

79
0:03:22.626,000 --> 0:03:24,000
from almost every other American city.

80
0:03:25.162,000 --> 0:03:27,000
While most other cities were growing

81
0:03:27.28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl,

82
0:03:30.415,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they instituted an urban growth boundary.

83
0:03:33.09,000 --> 0:03:35,000
While most cities were reaming out their roads,

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
removing parallel parking and trees

85
0:03:37.505,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in order to flow more traffic,

86
0:03:39.706,000 --> 0:03:42,000
they instituted a skinny streets program.

87
0:03:43.439,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And while most cities were investing in more roads

88
0:03:47.353,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and more highways, they actually invested

89
0:03:50.262,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in bicycling and in walking.

90
0:03:52.739,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And they spent 60 million dollars on bike facilities,

91
0:03:56.804,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which seems like a lot of money,

92
0:03:58.237,000 --> 0:04:,000
but it was spent over about 30 years,

93
0:04:00.753,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so two million dollars a year -- not that much --

94
0:04:03.122,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and half the price of the one cloverleaf

95
0:04:05.447,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that they decided to rebuild in that city.

96
0:04:08.266,000 --> 0:04:09,000
These changes and others like them changed

97
0:04:10.235,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the way that Portlanders live,

98
0:04:12.197,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and their vehicle-miles traveled per day,

99
0:04:14.358,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the amount that each person drives,

100
0:04:15.917,000 --> 0:04:17,000
actually peaked in 1996,

101
0:04:18.23,000 --> 0:04:2,000
has been dropping ever since,

102
0:04:20.331,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and they now drive 20 percent less

103
0:04:22.395,000 --> 0:04:23,000
than the rest of the country.

104
0:04:23.828,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The typical Portland citizen drives

105
0:04:26.584,000 --> 0:04:29,000
four miles less, and 11 minutes less per day

106
0:04:30.552,000 --> 0:04:32,000
than they did before.

107
0:04:32.874,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The economist Joe Cortright did the math

108
0:04:34.861,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and he found out that those four miles

109
0:04:36.379,000 --> 0:04:37,000
plus those 11 minutes

110
0:04:37.811,000 --> 0:04:38,000
adds up to fully three and a half percent

111
0:04:39.733,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of all income earned in the region.

112
0:04:42.263,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So if they're not spending that money on driving --

113
0:04:44.139,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and by the way, 85 percent of the money

114
0:04:45.752,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we spend on driving leaves the local economy --

115
0:04:48.346,000 --> 0:04:49,000
if they're not spending that money on driving,

116
0:04:50.221,000 --> 0:04:51,000
what are they spending it on?

117
0:04:51.992,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Well, Portland is reputed to have

118
0:04:53.669,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the most roof racks per capita,

119
0:04:56.591,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the most independent bookstores per capita,

120
0:04:59.431,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the most strip clubs per capita.

121
0:05:02.675,000 --> 0:05:04,000
These are all exaggerations, slight exaggerations

122
0:05:05.311,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of a fundamental truth, which is Portlanders

123
0:05:06.95,000 --> 0:05:09,000
spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds

124
0:05:10.148,000 --> 0:05:12,000
than the rest of America.

125
0:05:12.174,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Actually, Oregonians spend more on alcohol

126
0:05:14.489,000 --> 0:05:15,000
than most other states,

127
0:05:15.829,000 --> 0:05:16,000
which may be a good thing or a bad thing,

128
0:05:17.394,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but it makes you glad they're driving less.

129
0:05:19.393,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:21.766,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But actually, they're spending most of it in their homes,

131
0:05:25.102,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and home investment is about as local

132
0:05:27.66,000 --> 0:05:29,000
an investment as you can get.

133
0:05:29.783,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But there's a whole other Portland story,

134
0:05:31.194,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which isn't part of this calculus,

135
0:05:32.739,000 --> 0:05:34,000
which is that young, educated people

136
0:05:35.626,000 --> 0:05:37,000
have been moving to Portland in droves,

137
0:05:38.078,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so that between the last two censuses,

138
0:05:40.596,000 --> 0:05:42,000
they had a 50-percent increase

139
0:05:42.878,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in college-educated millennials,

140
0:05:44.742,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which is five times what you saw anywhere else

141
0:05:46.926,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in the country, or, I should say, of the national average.

142
0:05:50.202,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So on the one hand, a city saves money for its residents

143
0:05:54.515,000 --> 0:05:56,000
by being more walkable and more bikeable,

144
0:05:57.095,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but on the other hand, it also is the cool kind of city

145
0:05:59.93,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that people want to be in these days.

146
0:06:02.748,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So the best economic strategy

147
0:06:04.141,000 --> 0:06:05,000
you can have as a city

148
0:06:05.544,000 --> 0:06:08,000
is not the old way of trying to attract corporations

149
0:06:09.258,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and trying to have a biotech cluster

150
0:06:11.59,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or a medical cluster,

151
0:06:13.684,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or an aerospace cluster,

152
0:06:15.093,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but to become a place where people want to be.

153
0:06:18.193,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And millennials, certainly, these engines of entrepreneurship,

154
0:06:21.671,000 --> 0:06:23,000
64 percent of whom decide first

155
0:06:24.512,000 --> 0:06:25,000
where they want to live,

156
0:06:25.791,000 --> 0:06:27,000
then they move there, then they look for a job,

157
0:06:27.807,000 --> 0:06:29,000
they will come to your city.

158
0:06:30.752,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The health argument is a scary one,

159
0:06:33.613,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and you've probably heard part of this argument before.

160
0:06:36.107,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Again, back in the '70s, a lot's changed since then,

161
0:06:39.074,000 --> 0:06:42,000
back in the '70s, one in 10 Americans was obese.

162
0:06:42.184,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now one out of three Americans is obese,

163
0:06:45.783,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and a second third of the population is overweight.

164
0:06:49.65,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Twenty-five percent of young men

165
0:06:51.529,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and 40 percent of young women are too heavy

166
0:06:53.45,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to enlist in our own military forces.

167
0:06:57.101,000 --> 0:06:59,000
According to the Center for Disease Control,

168
0:06:59.479,000 --> 0:07:02,000
fully one third of all children born after 2000

169
0:07:03.276,000 --> 0:07:04,000
will get diabetes.

170
0:07:04.976,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We have the first generation of children in America

171
0:07:06.949,000 --> 0:07:09,000
who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents.

172
0:07:10.819,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I believe that this American healthcare crisis

173
0:07:13.03,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that we've all heard about

174
0:07:14.468,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is an urban design crisis,

175
0:07:17.084,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and that the design of our cities lies at the cure.

176
0:07:19.896,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Because we've talked a long time about diet,

177
0:07:22.461,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and we know that diet impacts weight,

178
0:07:25.215,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and weight of course impacts health.

179
0:07:27.527,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But we've only started talking about inactivity,

180
0:07:30.298,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and how inactivity born of our landscape,

181
0:07:33.49,000 --> 0:07:35,000
inactivity that comes from the fact that we live

182
0:07:35.82,000 --> 0:07:36,000
in a place where there is no longer any such thing

183
0:07:37.689,000 --> 0:07:4,000
as a useful walk, is driving our weight up.

184
0:07:41.285,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And we finally have the studies,

185
0:07:42.859,000 --> 0:07:44,000
one in Britain called "Gluttony versus sloth"

186
0:07:45.545,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that tracked weight against diet

187
0:07:48.246,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and tracked weight against inactivity,

188
0:07:50.151,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and found a much higher, stronger correlation

189
0:07:52.854,000 --> 0:07:54,000
between the latter two.

190
0:07:54.902,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Dr. James Levine at, in this case,

191
0:07:56.919,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the aptly-named Mayo Clinic

192
0:07:59.112,000 --> 0:08:03,000
put his test subjects in electronic underwear,

193
0:08:03.651,000 --> 0:08:04,000
held their diet steady,

194
0:08:05.644,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and then started pumping the calories in.

195
0:08:07.648,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Some people gained weight,

196
0:08:09.145,000 --> 0:08:1,000
some people didn't gain weight.

197
0:08:10.522,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work,

198
0:08:13.988,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they were shocked to learn that the only difference

199
0:08:15.692,000 --> 0:08:16,000
between the subjects that they could figure out

200
0:08:17.574,000 --> 0:08:18,000
was the amount they were moving,

201
0:08:19.458,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and that in fact those who gained weight

202
0:08:21.098,000 --> 0:08:24,000
were sitting, on average, two hours more per day

203
0:08:24.85,000 --> 0:08:25,000
than those who didn't.

204
0:08:26.166,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So we have these studies that tie

205
0:08:28.109,000 --> 0:08:3,000
weight to inactivity, but even more,

206
0:08:30.423,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we now have studies that tie weight to where you live.

207
0:08:32.938,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Do you live in a more walkable city

208
0:08:34.571,000 --> 0:08:35,000
or do you live in a less walkable city,

209
0:08:36.007,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or where in your city do you live?

210
0:08:37.931,000 --> 0:08:39,000
In San Diego, they used Walk Score --

211
0:08:40.596,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Walk Score rates every address in America

212
0:08:42.953,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and soon the world

213
0:08:44.592,000 --> 0:08:46,000
in terms of how walkable it is --

214
0:08:46.981,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods

215
0:08:49.864,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and less walkable neighborhoods.

216
0:08:51.557,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well guess what? If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood,

217
0:08:54.359,000 --> 0:08:56,000
you were 35 percent likely to be overweight.

218
0:08:56.63,000 --> 0:08:58,000
If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood,

219
0:08:58.953,000 --> 0:09:,000
you were 60 percent likely to be overweight.

220
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So we have study after study now

221
0:09:02.998,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that's tying where you live

222
0:09:05.053,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to your health, particularly as in America,

223
0:09:07.44,000 --> 0:09:09,000
the biggest health crisis we have is this one

224
0:09:09.57,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that's stemming from environmental-induced inactivity.

225
0:09:14.294,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And I learned a new word last week.

226
0:09:16.017,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They call these neighborhoods "obesageneric."

227
0:09:19.647,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I may have that wrong, but you get the idea.

228
0:09:22.878,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Now that's one thing, of course.

229
0:09:24.645,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Briefly mentioning, we have an asthma epidemic

230
0:09:27.12,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in this country.

231
0:09:28.247,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You probably haven't thought that much about it.

232
0:09:29.905,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma,

233
0:09:32.626,000 --> 0:09:34,000
three times what it was in the '90s,

234
0:09:35.531,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and it's almost all coming from car exhaust.

235
0:09:38.422,000 --> 0:09:4,000
American pollution does not come

236
0:09:40.434,000 --> 0:09:42,000
from factories anymore, it comes from tailpipes,

237
0:09:42.742,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and the amount that people are driving in your city,

238
0:09:44.999,000 --> 0:09:46,000
your urban VMT, is a good prediction

239
0:09:47.447,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of the asthma problems in your city.

240
0:09:49.949,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And then finally, in terms of driving,

241
0:09:52.164,000 --> 0:09:54,000
there's the issue of the single-largest killer

242
0:09:55.07,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of healthy adults, and one of the largest killers

243
0:09:57.712,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of all people, is car crashes.

244
0:09:59.806,000 --> 0:10:,000
And we take car crashes for granted.

245
0:10:01.308,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We figure it's a natural risk

246
0:10:03.143,000 --> 0:10:04,000
of being on the road.

247
0:10:04.725,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But in fact, here in America, 12 people

248
0:10:07.898,000 --> 0:10:08,000
out of every 100,000

249
0:10:09.254,000 --> 0:10:11,000
die every year from car crashes.

250
0:10:11.352,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We're pretty safe here.

251
0:10:12.821,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Well, guess what? In England, it's seven per 100,000.

252
0:10:15.207,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's Japan, it's four per 100,000.

253
0:10:17.045,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Do you know where it's three per 100,000?

254
0:10:19.614,000 --> 0:10:2,000
New York City.

255
0:10:21.339,000 --> 0:10:23,000
San Francisco, the same thing. Portland, the same thing.

256
0:10:23.995,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Oh, so cities make us safer

257
0:10:26.055,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because we're driving less?

258
0:10:28.224,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Tulsa: 14 per 100,000.

259
0:10:30.643,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Orlando: 20 per 100,000.

260
0:10:33.884,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It's not whether you're in the city or not,

261
0:10:35.601,000 --> 0:10:36,000
it's how is your city designed?

262
0:10:37.287,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Was it designed around cars or around people?

263
0:10:41.119,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Because if your city is designed around cars,

264
0:10:42.889,000 --> 0:10:46,000
it's really good at smashing them into each other.

265
0:10:47.748,000 --> 0:10:5,000
That's part of a much larger health argument.

266
0:10:51.483,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Finally, the environmental argument is fascinating,

267
0:10:53.752,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because the environmentalists turned on a dime

268
0:10:55.993,000 --> 0:10:56,000
about 10 years ago.

269
0:10:57.512,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The environmental movement in America

270
0:10:58.988,000 --> 0:11:01,000
has historically been an anti-city movement

271
0:11:02.016,000 --> 0:11:03,000
from Jefferson on.

272
0:11:03.527,000 --> 0:11:05,000
"Cities are pestilential to the health,

273
0:11:05.882,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to the liberties, to the morals of man.

274
0:11:07.873,000 --> 0:11:09,000
If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities,

275
0:11:09.983,000 --> 0:11:1,000
as they do in Europe, we shall become as corrupt

276
0:11:11.899,000 --> 0:11:12,000
as they are in Europe

277
0:11:13.314,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and take to eating one another as they do there."

278
0:11:15.976,000 --> 0:11:17,000
He apparently had a sense of humor.

279
0:11:18.707,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And then the American environmental movement

280
0:11:20.76,000 --> 0:11:22,000
has been a classically Arcadian movement.

281
0:11:22.87,000 --> 0:11:24,000
To become more environmental, we move into the country,

282
0:11:24.983,000 --> 0:11:26,000
we commune with nature, we build suburbs.

283
0:11:27.651,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But, of course, we've seen what that does.

284
0:11:31.674,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The carbon mapping of America,

285
0:11:33.88,000 --> 0:11:34,000
where is the CO2 being emitted,

286
0:11:35.767,000 --> 0:11:36,000
for many years only

287
0:11:37.696,000 --> 0:11:39,000
hammered this argument in more strongly.

288
0:11:40.223,000 --> 0:11:42,000
If you look at any carbon map, because we map it per square mile,

289
0:11:43.064,000 --> 0:11:44,000
any carbon map of the U.S.,

290
0:11:44.579,000 --> 0:11:47,000
it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.,

291
0:11:47.722,000 --> 0:11:49,000
hottest in the cities, cooler in the suburbs,

292
0:11:50.178,000 --> 0:11:53,000
dark, peaceful in the countryside.

293
0:11:53.746,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Until some economists said, you know,

294
0:11:55.685,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is that the right way to measure CO2?

295
0:11:58.131,000 --> 0:11:59,000
There are only so many people in this country at any given time,

296
0:12:00.117,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and we can choose to live where perhaps

297
0:12:02.204,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we would have a lighter impact.

298
0:12:03.843,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And they said, let's measure CO2 per household,

299
0:12:06.636,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and when they did that, the maps just flipped,

300
0:12:09.24,000 --> 0:12:12,000
coolest in the center city, warmer in the suburbs,

301
0:12:12.259,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and red hot in these exurban

302
0:12:14.935,000 --> 0:12:16,000
"drive till you qualify" neighborhoods.

303
0:12:17.707,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So a fundamental shift, and now you have

304
0:12:19.66,000 --> 0:12:21,000
environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser

305
0:12:22.424,000 --> 0:12:24,000
saying we are a destructive species.

306
0:12:24.991,000 --> 0:12:26,000
If you love nature, the best thing you can do

307
0:12:27.157,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is stay the heck away from it,

308
0:12:29.425,000 --> 0:12:31,000
move to a city, and the denser the better,

309
0:12:31.979,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and the denser cities like Manhattan

310
0:12:34.483,000 --> 0:12:36,000
are the cities that perform the best.

311
0:12:36.819,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline

312
0:12:40.968,000 --> 0:12:44,000
at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '20s,

313
0:12:45.284,000 --> 0:12:48,000
consuming half of the electricity of Dallas.

314
0:12:48.758,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But of course, we can do better.

315
0:12:50.76,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Canadian cities, they consume half the gasoline of American cities.

316
0:12:53.872,000 --> 0:12:57,000
European cities consume half as much again.

317
0:12:57.966,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So obviously, we can do better,

318
0:13:00.162,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and we want to do better, and we're all trying to be green.

319
0:13:03.531,000 --> 0:13:05,000
My final argument in this topic is that

320
0:13:05.977,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I think we're trying to be green the wrong way,

321
0:13:09.631,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and I'm one of many people who believes that

322
0:13:11.807,000 --> 0:13:14,000
this focus on gadgets,

323
0:13:14.879,000 --> 0:13:16,000
on accessorizing --

324
0:13:17.57,000 --> 0:13:19,000
What can I add to my house,

325
0:13:19.589,000 --> 0:13:21,000
what can I add to what I've already got

326
0:13:21.701,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to make my lifestyle more sustainable? --

327
0:13:24.164,000 --> 0:13:25,000
has kind of dominated the discussion.

328
0:13:26.105,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So I'm not immune to this.

329
0:13:27.959,000 --> 0:13:28,000
My wife and I built a new house

330
0:13:29.494,000 --> 0:13:31,000
on an abandoned lot in Washington, D.C.,

331
0:13:32.493,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and we did our best to clear the shelves

332
0:13:34.595,000 --> 0:13:36,000
of the sustainability store.

333
0:13:36.65,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We've got the solar photovoltaic system,

334
0:13:38.885,000 --> 0:13:4,000
solar hot water heater, dual-flush toilets,

335
0:13:41.334,000 --> 0:13:42,000
bamboo floors.

336
0:13:43.242,000 --> 0:13:46,000
A log burning in my German high-tech stove

337
0:13:46.614,000 --> 0:13:48,000
apparently, supposedly, contributes less carbon

338
0:13:49.303,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to the atmosphere than were it left alone

339
0:13:50.984,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to decompose in the forest.

340
0:13:53.096,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Yet all of these innovations --

341
0:13:55.876,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That's what they said in the brochure.

342
0:13:57.763,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Laughter)

343
0:13:58.991,000 --> 0:14:,000
All of these innovations together

344
0:14:01.131,000 --> 0:14:04,000
contribute a fraction of what we contribute

345
0:14:04.215,000 --> 0:14:05,000
by living in a walkable neighborhood

346
0:14:06.12,000 --> 0:14:09,000
three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city.

347
0:14:09.891,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We've changed all our light bulbs to energy-savers,

348
0:14:12.09,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and you should do the same thing,

349
0:14:13.44,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but changing all your light bulbs to energy-savers

350
0:14:15.82,000 --> 0:14:16,000
saves as much energy in a year

351
0:14:17.452,000 --> 0:14:19,000
as moving to a walkable city does in a week.

352
0:14:20.386,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And we don't want to have this argument.

353
0:14:21.735,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Politicians and marketers are afraid

354
0:14:23.943,000 --> 0:14:26,000
of marketing green as a "lifestyle choice."

355
0:14:27.676,000 --> 0:14:29,000
You don't want to tell Americans, God forbid,

356
0:14:30.593,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that they have to change their lifestyle.

357
0:14:32.454,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life

358
0:14:35.618,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more,

359
0:14:38.135,000 --> 0:14:41,000
something that would be better than what we have right now?

360
0:14:41.466,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Well, the gold standard of quality of life rankings,

361
0:14:43.977,000 --> 0:14:44,000
it's called the Mercer Survey.

362
0:14:45.966,000 --> 0:14:46,000
You may have heard of it.

363
0:14:47.166,000 --> 0:14:5,000
They rank hundreds of nations worldwide

364
0:14:50.348,000 --> 0:14:52,000
according to 10 criteria that they believe add up

365
0:14:52.761,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to quality of life: health, economics, education,

366
0:14:57.86,000 --> 0:15:,000
housing, you name it.

367
0:15:01.162,000 --> 0:15:03,000
There's six more. Short talk.

368
0:15:03.55,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Laughter)

369
0:15:05.339,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And it's very interesting to see that

370
0:15:07.986,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the highest-ranking American city, Honolulu,

371
0:15:10.275,000 --> 0:15:13,000
number 28, is followed by kind of the usual suspects

372
0:15:14.037,000 --> 0:15:17,000
of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities.

373
0:15:17.976,000 --> 0:15:18,000
The driving cities in the Sun Belt,

374
0:15:19.698,000 --> 0:15:22,000
the Dallases and the Phoenixes and, sorry, Atlanta,

375
0:15:22.867,000 --> 0:15:25,000
these cities are not appearing on the list.

376
0:15:26.019,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But who's doing even better?

377
0:15:27.837,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The Canadian cities like Vancouver,

378
0:15:30.173,000 --> 0:15:32,000
where again, they're burning half the fuel.

379
0:15:32.497,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German,

380
0:15:35.308,000 --> 0:15:36,000
like Dusseldorf or Vienna,

381
0:15:37.24,000 --> 0:15:39,000
where they're burning, again, half as much fuel.

382
0:15:39.67,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And you see this alignment, this strange alignment.

383
0:15:42.525,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Is being more sustainble

384
0:15:44.413,000 --> 0:15:46,000
what gives you a higher quality of life?

385
0:15:46.841,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I would argue the same thing

386
0:15:49.478,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that makes you more sustainble

387
0:15:51.459,000 --> 0:15:53,000
is what gives you a higher quality of life,

388
0:15:53.509,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and that's living in a walkable neighborhood.

389
0:15:56.5,000 --> 0:16:,000
So sustainability, which includes our wealth

390
0:16:00.979,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and our health

391
0:16:02.753,000 --> 0:16:06,000
may not be a direct function of our sustainability.

392
0:16:07.205,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But particularly here in America,

393
0:16:09.662,000 --> 0:16:11,000
we are polluting so much

394
0:16:12.103,000 --> 0:16:14,000
because we're throwing away our time

395
0:16:14.779,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and our money and our lives on the highway,

396
0:16:17.353,000 --> 0:16:19,000
then these two problems would seem to share

397
0:16:19.577,000 --> 0:16:21,000
the same solution, which is to make our cities

398
0:16:22.211,000 --> 0:16:23,000
more walkable.

399
0:16:23.554,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Doing so isn't easy, but it can be done,

400
0:16:26.201,000 --> 0:16:27,000
it has been done,

401
0:16:27.629,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and it's being done now in more than a few cities,

402
0:16:30.193,000 --> 0:16:32,000
around the globe and in our country.

403
0:16:32.729,000 --> 0:16:35,000
I take some solace from Winston Churchill,

404
0:16:35.791,000 --> 0:16:36,000
who put it this way:

405
0:16:37.161,000 --> 0:16:38,000
"The Americans can be counted on

406
0:16:38.939,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to do the right thing

407
0:16:40.214,000 --> 0:16:42,000
once they have exhausted the alternatives." (Laughter)

408
0:16:42.963,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Thank you.

409
0:16:44.959,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Applause)

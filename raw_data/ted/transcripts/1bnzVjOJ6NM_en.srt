1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
One out of two of you women

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
will be impacted by cardiovascular disease

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in your lifetime.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So this is the leading killer of women.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's a closely held secret

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
for reasons I don't know.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In addition to making this personal --

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
so we're going to talk about your relationship with your heart

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and all women's relationship with their heart --

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
we're going to wax into the politics.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Because the personal, as you know, is political.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And not enough is being done about this.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And as we have watched women

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
conquer breast cancer

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
through the breast cancer campaign,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
this is what we need to do now with heart.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Since 1984,

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
more women die in the U.S. than men.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So where we used to think of heart disease

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as being a man's problem primarily --

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which that was never true,

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 1950s and '60s,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and it was in all the textbooks.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's certainly what I learned when I was training.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
If we were to remain sexist, and that was not right,

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but if we were going to go forward and be sexist,

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it's actually a woman's disease.

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So it's a woman's disease now.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And one of the things that you see

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is that male line,

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the mortality is going down, down, down, down, down.

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And you see the female line since 1984,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the gap is widening.

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
More and more women, two, three, four times more women,

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
dying of heart disease than men.

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And that's too short of a time period

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
for all the different risk factors that we know

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to change.

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So what this really suggested to us

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
at the national level

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
was that diagnostic and therapeutic strategies,

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
which had been developed in men, by men, for men

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for the last 50 years --

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and they work pretty well in men, don't they? --

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
weren't working so well for women.

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So that was a big wake-up call

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in the 1980's.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Heart disease kills more women

49
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
at all ages

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
than breast cancer.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the breast cancer campaign --

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
again, this is not a competition.

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We're trying to be as good as the breast cancer campaign.

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We need to be as good as the breast cancer campaign

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to address this crisis.

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now sometimes when people see this,

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I hear this gasp.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We can all think of someone,

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
often a young woman,

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
who has been impacted by breast cancer.

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We often can't think of a young woman

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
who has heart disease.

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I'm going to tell you why.

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Heart disease kills people,

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
often very quickly.

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So the first time heart disease strikes in women and men,

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
half of the time it's sudden cardiac death --

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
no opportunity to say good-bye,

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
no opportunity to take her to the chemotherapy,

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
no opportunity to help her pick out a wig.

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Breast cancer,

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
mortality is down to four percent.

73
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that is the 40 years

74
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that women have advocated.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan stood up

76
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and said, "I'm a breast cancer survivor,"

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it was okay to talk about it.

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And then physicians have gone to bat.

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We've done the research.

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We have effective therapies now.

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Women are living longer than ever.

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That has to happen in heart disease, and it's time.

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's not happening, and it's time.

84
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We owe an incredible debt of gratitude

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to these two women.

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
As Barbara depicted

87
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in one of her amazing movies, "Yentl,"

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
she portrayed a young woman

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
who wanted an education.

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And she wanted to study the Talmud.

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And so how did she get educated then?

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
She had to impersonate a man.

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
She had to look like a man.

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
She had to make other people believe that she looked like a man

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and she could have the same rights

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that the men had.

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Bernadine Healy, Dr. Healy,

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
was a cardiologist.

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And right around that time, in the 1980's,

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that we saw women and heart disease deaths

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
going up, up, up, up, up,

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
she wrote an editorial

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in the New England Journal of Medicine

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and said, the Yentl syndrome.

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Women are dying of heart disease,

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
two, three, four times more than men.

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Mortality is not going down, it's going up.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And she questioned,

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
she hypothesized,

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is this a Yentl syndrome?

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And here's what the story is.

112
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Is it because women don't look like men,

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
they don't look like that male-pattern heart disease

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that we've spent the last 50 years understanding

115
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and getting really good diagnostics

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and really good therapeutics,

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and therefore, they're not recognized for their heart disease.

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And they're just passed.

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They don't get treated, they don't get detected,

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they don't get the benefit of all the modern medicines.

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Doctor Healy then subsequently became

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the first female director

123
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of our National Institutes of Health.

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And this is the biggest biomedical enterprise research

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in the world.

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And it funds a lot of my research.

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It funds research all over the place.

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It was a very big deal

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
for her to become director.

130
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And she started,

131
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in the face of a lot of controversy,

132
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the Women's Health Initiative.

133
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And every woman in the room here

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
has benefited from that Women's Health Initiative.

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It told us about hormone replacement therapy.

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's informed us about osteoporosis.

137
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It informed us about breast cancer, colon cancer in women.

138
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So a tremendous fund of knowledge

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
despite, again,

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that so many people told her not to do it,

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it was too expensive.

142
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And the under-reading was women aren't worth it.

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
She was like, "Nope. Sorry. Women are worth it."

144
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well there was a little piece of that Women's Health Initiative

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that went to National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which is the cardiology part of the NIH.

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And we got to do the WISE study --

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and the WISE stands for Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation --

149
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I have chaired this study for the last 15 years.

150
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It was a study to specifically ask,

151
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
what's going on with women?

152
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Why are more and more women dying

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of ischemic heart disease?

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So in the WISE, 15 years ago,

155
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
we started out and said, "Well wow, there's a couple of key observations

156
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and we should probably follow up on that."

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And our colleagues in Washington, D.C.

158
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
had recently published

159
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that when women have heart attacks and die,

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
compared to men who have heart attacks and die --

161
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and again, this is millions of people,

162
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
happening every day --

163
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
women, in their fatty plaque --

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and this is their coronary artery,

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
so the main blood supply going into the heart muscle --

166
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
women erode,

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
men explode.

168
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You're going to find some interesting analogies

169
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
in this physiology.

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So I'll describe the male-pattern heart attack first.

172
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Hollywood heart attack. Ughhhh.

173
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Horrible chest pain.

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
EKG goes pbbrrhh,

175
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so the doctors can see this hugely abnormal EKG.

176
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There's a big clot in the middle of the artery.

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And they go up to the cath lab

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and boom, boom, boom get rid of the clot.

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That's a man heart attack.

180
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Some women have those heart attacks,

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but a whole bunch of women have this kind of heart attack,

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where it erodes,

183
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
doesn't completely fill with clot, symptoms are subtle,

184
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
EKG findings are different --

185
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
female-pattern.

186
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So what do you think happens to these gals?

187
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They're often not recognized, sent home.

188
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I'm not sure what it was. Might have been gas.

189
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So we picked up on that

190
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and we said, "You know, we now have the ability

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to look inside human beings

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
with these special catheters called IVUS:

193
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
intravascular ultrasound."

194
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And we said, "We're going to hypothesize

195
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that the fatty plaque in women

196
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is actually probably different,

197
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and deposited differently, than men."

198
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And because of the common knowledge

199
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of how women and men get fat.

200
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
When we watch people become obese,

201
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
where do men get fat?

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Right here, it's just a focal -- right there.

203
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Where do women get fat?

204
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
All over.

205
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Cellulite here, cellulite here.

206
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So we said, "Look, women look like they're pretty good

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
about putting kind of the garbage away,

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
smoothly putting it away.

209
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Men just have to dump it in a single area."

210
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So we said, "Let's look at these."

211
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And so the yellow is the fatty plaque,

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and panel A is a man.

213
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And you can see, it's lumpy bumpy.

214
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
He's got a beer belly in his coronary arteries.

215
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Panel B is the woman, very smooth.

216
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
She's just laid it down nice and tidy.

217
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Laughter)

218
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And if you did that angiogram,

219
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
which is the red,

220
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you can see the man's disease.

221
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So 50 years

222
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of honing and crafting these angiograms,

223
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
we easily recognize

224
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
male-pattern disease.

225
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Kind of hard to see that female-pattern disease.

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So that was a discovery.

227
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now what are the implications of that?

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Well once again, women get the angiogram

229
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and nobody can tell that they have a problem.

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So we are working now on a non-invasive --

231
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
again, these are all invasive studies.

232
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Ideally you would love to do all this non-invasively.

233
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And again, 50 years

234
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
of good non-invasive stress testing,

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
we're pretty good at recognizing male-pattern disease

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
with stress tests.

237
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So this is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

238
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We're doing this at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute

239
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
in the Women's Heart Center.

240
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We selected this for the research.

241
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
This is not in your community hospital,

242
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but we would hope to translate this.

243
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And we're about two and a half years

244
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
into a five-year study.

245
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This was the only modality

246
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that can see the inner lining of the heart.

247
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And if you look carefully, you can see

248
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that there's a black blush right there.

249
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And that is microvascular obstruction.

250
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The syndrome, the female-pattern

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
now is called microvascular coronary dysfunction, or obstruction.

252
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The second reason we really liked MRI

253
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
is that there's no radiation.

254
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So unlike the CAT scans, X-rays, thalliums,

255
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
for women

256
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
whose breast is in the way

257
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
of looking at the heart,

258
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
every time we order something that has even a small amount of radiation,

259
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we say, "Do we really need that test?"

260
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So we're very excited about M.R.

261
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You can't go and order it yet,

262
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but this is an area of active inquiry

263
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
where actually studying women

264
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is going to advance the field for women and men.

265
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
What are the downstream consequences

266
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
then, when female-pattern heart disease

267
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is not recognized?

268
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is a figure

269
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
from an editorial that I published

270
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
in the European Heart Journal this last summer.

271
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And it was just a pictogram

272
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to sort of show

273
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
why more women are dying of heart disease,

274
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
despite these good treatments

275
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that we know and we have work.

276
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And when the woman

277
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
has male-pattern disease --

278
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
so she looks like Barbara in the movie --

279
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
they get treated.

280
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And when you have female-pattern and you look like a woman,

281
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as Barbara does here with her husband,

282
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
they don't get the treatment.

283
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
These are our life-saving treatments.

284
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And those little red boxes are deaths.

285
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So those are the consequences.

286
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And that is female-pattern

287
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and why we think the Yentl syndrome

288
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
actually is explaining

289
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
a lot of these gaps.

290
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
There's been wonderful news also

291
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
about studying women,

292
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
finally, in heart disease.

293
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And one of the the cutting-edge areas

294
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that we're just incredibly excited about

295
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is stem cell therapy.

296
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If you ask, what is the big difference

297
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
between women and men physiologically?

298
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Why are there women and men?

299
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Because women bring new life into the world.

300
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
That's all stem cells.

301
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So we hypothesized

302
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that female stem cells might be better

303
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
at identifying the injury,

304
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
doing some cellular repair

305
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
or even producing new organs,

306
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
which is one of the things

307
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that we're trying to do with stem cell therapy.

308
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
These are female and male stem cells.

309
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And if you had an injured organ,

310
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
if you had a heart attack

311
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and we wanted to repair that injured area,

312
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
do you want those robust,

313
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
plentiful stem cells on the top?

314
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Or do you want these guys,

315
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that look like they're out to lunch?

316
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

317
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And some of our investigative teams

318
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
have demonstrated

319
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that female stem cells --

320
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and this is in animals

321
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and increasingly we're showing this in humans --

322
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that female stem cells,

323
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
when put even into a male body,

324
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
do better than male stem cells

325
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
going into a male body.

326
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
One of the things that we say

327
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
about all of this female physiology --

328
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
because again, as much as we're talking about women and heart disease,

329
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
women do, on average,

330
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
have better longevity than men --

331
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
is that unfolding the secrets of female physiology

332
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and understanding that

333
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
is going to help men and women.

334
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So this is not a zero-sum game in anyway.

335
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Okay, so here's where we started.

336
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And remember, paths crossed in 1984,

337
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and more and more women

338
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
were dying of cardiovascular disease.

339
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
What has happened in the last 15 years with this work?

340
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We are bending the curve.

341
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We're bending the curve.

342
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So just like the breast cancer story,

343
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
doing research, getting awareness going,

344
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
it works, you just have to get it going.

345
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Now are we happy with this?

346
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We still have two to three more women dying for every man.

347
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And I would propose,

348
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with the better longevity

349
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
that women have overall,

350
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that women probably should theoretically do better,

351
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
if we could just get treated.

352
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So this is where we are,

353
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but we have a long row to hoe.

354
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We've worked on this for 15 years.

355
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And I've told you, we've been working on male-pattern heart disease

356
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
for 50 years.

357
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So we're 35 years behind.

358
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And we'd like to think it's not going to take 35 years.

359
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And in fact, it probably won't.

360
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But we cannot stop now.

361
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Too many lives are at stake.

362
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So what do we need to do?

363
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You now, hopefully, have a more personal relationship

364
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
with your heart.

365
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Women have heard the call

366
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
for breast cancer

367
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and they have come out

368
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
for awareness campaigns.

369
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
The women are very good about getting mammograms now.

370
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And women do fundraising.

371
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Women participate.

372
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
They have put their money where their mouth is

373
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and they have done advocacy and they have joined campaigns.

374
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
This is what we need to do with heart disease now.

375
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And it's political.

376
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Women's health, from a federal funding standpoint,

377
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
sometimes it's popular,

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
sometimes it's not so popular.

379
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So we have these feast and famine cycles.

380
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
So I implore you

381
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
to join the Red Dress Campaign

382
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
in this fundraising.

383
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Breast cancer, as we said,

384
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
kills women,

385
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
but heart disease kills a whole bunch more.

386
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So if we can be as good as breast cancer

387
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and give women this new charge,

388
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
we have a lot of lives to save.

389
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So thank you for your attention.

390
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Applause)

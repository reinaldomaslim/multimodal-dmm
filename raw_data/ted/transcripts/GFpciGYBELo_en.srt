1
0:00:11.63,000 --> 0:00:18,000
great to be here with everyone it a

2
0:00:16.71,000 --> 0:00:21,000
really important conversation today I

3
0:00:18.63,000 --> 0:00:22,000
think because I don't know about you

4
0:00:21.75,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Whitney but they've been Knights in the

5
0:00:23.4,000 --> 0:00:27,000
last couple weeks where I just haven't

6
0:00:26.01,000 --> 0:00:29,000
slept that well right there's just a lot

7
0:00:28.289,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of stress there's a lot of worry that's

8
0:00:29.88,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a lot of uncertainty and and so forth

9
0:00:32.61,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and that meet with you ask absolutely I

10
0:00:36.6,000 --> 0:00:41,000
feel like my sleep has been a little

11
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
less than ideal lately for sure probably

12
0:00:42.03,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for a lot of you out there too I'd

13
0:00:43.379,000 --> 0:00:48,000
imagine

14
0:00:44.149,000 --> 0:00:51,000
yeah no indeed so though we're very

15
0:00:49.32,000 --> 0:00:56,000
lucky to have with us today like the

16
0:00:51.93,000 --> 0:00:57,000
perfect speaker for this he's professor

17
0:00:56.61,000 --> 0:01:01,000
of neuroscience and psychology at

18
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Berkeley in California and director of

19
0:01:01.8,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the center for human sleep science

20
0:01:04.229,000 --> 0:01:11,000
author of a book three years ago why we

21
0:01:08.939,000 --> 0:01:12,000
sleep and last year gave a TED talk

22
0:01:11.729,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who's been seen nearly ten million times

23
0:01:13.799,000 --> 0:01:18,000
now so it's a it's a treat to invite ya

24
0:01:16.409,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Matt Walker thanks Whitney

25
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:21,000
you'll be back right Whitney I'll be

26
0:01:20.64,000 --> 0:01:27,000
back with questions from from your in a

27
0:01:22.89,000 --> 0:01:28,000
bit hello Matt how are you I am good

28
0:01:27.9,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Chris and how are you doing and thank

29
0:01:29.61,000 --> 0:01:35,000
you so much for having me on well thank

30
0:01:33.36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
you it's very good to have you here I

31
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:39,000
mean I guess I guess that's going to be

32
0:01:38.28,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the first question on top of people's

33
0:01:39.9,000 --> 0:01:46,000
minds is you know is there a case that

34
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:5,000
sleep matters now more than ever I think

35
0:01:46.97,000 --> 0:01:52,000
firstly it's important for me to to not

36
0:01:51.18,000 --> 0:01:55,000
necessarily feed into people's anxiety

37
0:01:53.939,000 --> 0:01:56,000
regarding sleep I know as you mentioned

38
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
there asleep is difficult for some

39
0:01:57.57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
people when anxiety is high and of

40
0:01:59.85,000 --> 0:02:03,000
course that's never more so at present

41
0:02:02.369,000 --> 0:02:04,000
so what I would say is that if anything

42
0:02:03.899,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that we're talking about feels as though

43
0:02:05.34,000 --> 0:02:08,000
it's a trigger feel free just to come

44
0:02:07.409,000 --> 0:02:11,000
back at a time that feels better in

45
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
terms of that anxiety level

46
0:02:11.67,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in terms of sleep and covered 19 right

47
0:02:15.12,000 --> 0:02:18,000
now we don't necessarily have any

48
0:02:16.98,000 --> 0:02:2,000
evidence to suggest that there is some

49
0:02:19.02,000 --> 0:02:23,000
kind of a link between those two but

50
0:02:21.39,000 --> 0:02:25,000
certainly what we know is that there is

51
0:02:23.94,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a very intimate relationship between

52
0:02:25.86,000 --> 0:02:29,000
your sleep health and your immune health

53
0:02:28.35,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I'll give you just a couple of examples

54
0:02:30.39,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and there was a study some years ago

55
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that demonstrated that individuals who

56
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
reported getting less than seven hours

57
0:02:37.68,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of sleep and had almost a three-fold

58
0:02:40.62,000 --> 0:02:44,000
increase likelihood of becoming infected

59
0:02:42.87,000 --> 0:02:46,000
by the rhinovirus which is what we all

60
0:02:45.18,000 --> 0:02:48,000
think of as the common cold relative to

61
0:02:47.67,000 --> 0:02:51,000
those who are getting eight hours of

62
0:02:49.14,000 --> 0:02:54,000
sleep or more there was another study in

63
0:02:52.11,000 --> 0:02:57,000
over 50,000 women and what they found

64
0:02:55.05,000 --> 0:03:,000
was that individuals who were getting 5

65
0:02:57.75,000 --> 0:03:03,000
hours of sleep or less had a 70%

66
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:05,000
increased risk for developing pneumonia

67
0:03:03.81,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which is a respiratory lung infection

68
0:03:06.72,000 --> 0:03:1,000
relative to those who are getting 8

69
0:03:08.67,000 --> 0:03:12,000
hours of sleep or more um but I think

70
0:03:11.37,000 --> 0:03:15,000
perhaps one of the most striking results

71
0:03:13.62,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in this relationship between sleep and

72
0:03:15.63,000 --> 0:03:18,000
immune health was a study where they

73
0:03:17.73,000 --> 0:03:2,000
demonstrated if you're not getting

74
0:03:19.35,000 --> 0:03:23,000
sufficient sleep in the week before you

75
0:03:21.54,000 --> 0:03:26,000
get your flu shot you produce less than

76
0:03:24.18,000 --> 0:03:29,000
50% of the normal antibody response

77
0:03:27.29,000 --> 0:03:33,000
therefore rendering that vaccination

78
0:03:30.14,000 --> 0:03:35,000
significantly less effective do I think

79
0:03:33.57,000 --> 0:03:38,000
particularly actually on that last point

80
0:03:35.76,000 --> 0:03:41,000
at some point we will develop a vaccine

81
0:03:38.58,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for kovat 19:00 and then the question

82
0:03:41.88,000 --> 0:03:45,000
becomes is the same thing true if you're

83
0:03:44.34,000 --> 0:03:48,000
not getting the sleep that you need in

84
0:03:46.8,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the week before you get your Co vid shot

85
0:03:49.28,000 --> 0:03:54,000
will that immunisation become

86
0:03:52.77,000 --> 0:03:55,000
significantly less effective I actually

87
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
think that's an important question that

88
0:03:56.01,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we will need to answer in the future ok

89
0:03:59.31,000 --> 0:04:04,000
so no specific evidence how could there

90
0:04:02.73,000 --> 0:04:08,000
be this is a fairly there's a new threat

91
0:04:05.25,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to humanity but given that you know in a

92
0:04:08.94,000 --> 0:04:11,000
way the you know if someone gets

93
0:04:10.44,000 --> 0:04:14,000
infected there follows this sort of epic

94
0:04:12.81,000 --> 0:04:17,000
battle between a virus and their immune

95
0:04:14.67,000 --> 0:04:19,000
system it's it's obvious common sense to

96
0:04:17.85,000 --> 0:04:22,000
give your immune system every shot it

97
0:04:20.37,000 --> 0:04:24,000
can and every chance it can and in many

98
0:04:23.04,000 --> 0:04:26,000
other cases sleep is known to

99
0:04:25.2,000 --> 0:04:28,000
do that so they haven't really met

100
0:04:26.46,000 --> 0:04:3,000
matters now it's up there I think it I

101
0:04:29.04,000 --> 0:04:32,000
think certainly from immune health

102
0:04:30.93,000 --> 0:04:34,000
perspective we know that sleep

103
0:04:32.22,000 --> 0:04:37,000
essentially sharpens every tool in that

104
0:04:35.4,000 --> 0:04:4,000
box sleep essentially restocks the

105
0:04:38.1,000 --> 0:04:42,000
weaponry in your immune Arsenal giving

106
0:04:41.37,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you the greatest chance to fight off

107
0:04:43.05,000 --> 0:04:49,000
infection and I think as of at least

108
0:04:45.57,000 --> 0:04:5,000
April 2020 we don't have that evidence

109
0:04:49.08,000 --> 0:04:52,000
yet I know that there are a number of

110
0:04:50.88,000 --> 0:04:53,000
studies however that are looking at that

111
0:04:52.71,000 --> 0:04:56,000
even some of the sleep tracking

112
0:04:54.66,000 --> 0:04:58,000
companies are trying to rally efforts

113
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:02,000
around that and examine this right now

114
0:04:59.01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so we will have the data I'm sure well a

115
0:05:02.31,000 --> 0:05:06,000
little later in this interview we're

116
0:05:03.51,000 --> 0:05:08,000
going to dig into how to sleep better I

117
0:05:07.05,000 --> 0:05:11,000
know you've got a lot of interesting

118
0:05:09.21,000 --> 0:05:13,000
advice in that regard but before we go

119
0:05:11.55,000 --> 0:05:13,000
there let's let's spend a bit more time

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
thinking about the different ways that

121
0:05:14.46,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it can be really helpful now because

122
0:05:18.15,000 --> 0:05:22,000
paradoxically and we actually many of us

123
0:05:20.1,000 --> 0:05:26,000
have in theory at any rate more time to

124
0:05:22.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
sleep that we've ever had and so boy if

125
0:05:26.34,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we could put that to use how else how

126
0:05:28.53,000 --> 0:05:31,000
else could it help us just during our

127
0:05:30.39,000 --> 0:05:34,000
waking day and the things that we're

128
0:05:32.37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
having to focus on now

129
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:4,000
sleepers seems to provide a benefit to

130
0:05:38.82,000 --> 0:05:43,000
almost every major organ system in the

131
0:05:41.1,000 --> 0:05:45,000
body and many of the operations of the

132
0:05:44.13,000 --> 0:05:48,000
mind and perhaps I'll just give two

133
0:05:45.96,000 --> 0:05:5,000
examples within the mind one of the

134
0:05:48.81,000 --> 0:05:53,000
things that we know sleep is essentially

135
0:05:51.68,000 --> 0:05:56,000
incredibly beneficial for is learning

136
0:05:53.88,000 --> 0:05:58,000
memory and even creativity and when it

137
0:05:56.97,000 --> 0:06:01,000
comes to memory sleep is important in

138
0:05:59.04,000 --> 0:06:04,000
perhaps at least three ways firstly we

139
0:06:02.04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
know that you need sleep before learning

140
0:06:04.41,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to actually prepare your brain a little

141
0:06:07.08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
bit like a a dry sponge ready to

142
0:06:09.87,000 --> 0:06:14,000
initially absorb new memories and lay

143
0:06:12.18,000 --> 0:06:16,000
down those new memory traces but that's

144
0:06:14.94,000 --> 0:06:18,000
not enough you not only need to sleep

145
0:06:16.92,000 --> 0:06:19,000
before learning to imprint those

146
0:06:19.2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
memories into the brain

147
0:06:20.4,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you also needs leave after learning to

148
0:06:24.21,000 --> 0:06:27,000
essentially cement those new memories

149
0:06:26.25,000 --> 0:06:31,000
into the neural architecture of the

150
0:06:27.93,000 --> 0:06:32,000
brain so that you don't forget um and

151
0:06:31.25,000 --> 0:06:35,000
certainly there's very good evidence for

152
0:06:33.45,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that in fact sleep almost performs a

153
0:06:35.46,000 --> 0:06:38,000
file transfer mechanism where it takes

154
0:06:37.8,000 --> 0:06:4,000
memories and shifts

155
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
them from a sort of a short-term

156
0:06:40.99,000 --> 0:06:44,000
vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent

157
0:06:43.3,000 --> 0:06:49,000
long-term storage site within the brain

158
0:06:45.61,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and that's what we used to think that

159
0:06:49.3,000 --> 0:06:53,000
sleep was beneficial for taking

160
0:06:51.79,000 --> 0:06:54,000
individual memories and holding onto

161
0:06:53.74,000 --> 0:06:57,000
them as it were future proofing that

162
0:06:55.78,000 --> 0:06:59,000
information but we've since discovered

163
0:06:58.48,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that sleep is actually much more

164
0:07:00.61,000 --> 0:07:05,000
intelligent than that leap will actually

165
0:07:03.61,000 --> 0:07:08,000
take new memories and start to integrate

166
0:07:06.52,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and associate them with pre-existing

167
0:07:08.8,000 --> 0:07:14,000
stores of information so it's almost a

168
0:07:12.52,000 --> 0:07:17,000
little bit like memory alchemy at night

169
0:07:15.34,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so that you wake up the next day with a

170
0:07:18.07,000 --> 0:07:25,000
revised mind wide web of associations

171
0:07:21.67,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and that leads to remarkable states of

172
0:07:25.35,000 --> 0:07:29,000
creativity there's lots of good examples

173
0:07:27.85,000 --> 0:07:31,000
for this that he's in that laboratory

174
0:07:29.95,000 --> 0:07:34,000
showing that um sleep can inspire almost

175
0:07:32.53,000 --> 0:07:37,000
a three-fold increase in creative

176
0:07:35.41,000 --> 0:07:39,000
insights and it's probably the reason

177
0:07:37.78,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that you know you've you've never been

178
0:07:39.52,000 --> 0:07:43,000
told to stay awake on a problem but

179
0:07:42.55,000 --> 0:07:46,000
instead you're you're told to sleep on a

180
0:07:44.17,000 --> 0:07:48,000
problem and I think that phrase seems to

181
0:07:46.78,000 --> 0:07:5,000
exist in almost every language that I've

182
0:07:48.79,000 --> 0:07:52,000
inquired about today which means that

183
0:07:51.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
this creative benefit of sleep

184
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:58,000
transcends cultural boundaries comment

185
0:07:56.17,000 --> 0:07:59,000
across the globe that is one of the most

186
0:07:58.57,000 --> 0:08:,000
mind-boggling things to hear about how

187
0:08:00.04,000 --> 0:08:03,000
you can be worried about something or

188
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
puzzled about something and you wake up

189
0:08:03.73,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in the middle of the night and suddenly

190
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you know possibilities pop into place

191
0:08:08.95,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the answer is there and that the fact

192
0:08:12.55,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that you look in one way it's kind of

193
0:08:14.53,000 --> 0:08:16,000
knowing because it means your

194
0:08:15.28,000 --> 0:08:2,000
unconscious mind has been there somehow

195
0:08:17.35,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you know with I guess pre associating

196
0:08:20.8,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and doing things that you were supposed

197
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to do all by yourself and it's not fair

198
0:08:23.89,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but in other ways it's this is it's

199
0:08:25.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
super core and so you're saying that

200
0:08:27.52,000 --> 0:08:32,000
there's like how the three times the

201
0:08:30.55,000 --> 0:08:34,000
creative output very curious as to how

202
0:08:33.46,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that's measured but I mean that that's

203
0:08:35.14,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that's an amazing pain if you if you

204
0:08:37.39,000 --> 0:08:4,000
have enough if you have enough sleep

205
0:08:38.729,000 --> 0:08:42,000
yeah so there's a lovely study done by

206
0:08:41.32,000 --> 0:08:44,000
some German researchers a couple of

207
0:08:43.15,000 --> 0:08:47,000
years ago and the way that they did this

208
0:08:45.22,000 --> 0:08:5,000
they gave people a series of problems

209
0:08:47.62,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that had a hidden embedded rule into it

210
0:08:50.59,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and they never told them about that rule

211
0:08:52.63,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but through exposure perhaps gradually

212
0:08:55.42,000 --> 0:09:01,000
you can divine that hidden insight that

213
0:08:59.17,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is sort of locked into that problem and

214
0:09:02.019,000 --> 0:09:05,000
then they bring them back and then they

215
0:09:03.88,000 --> 0:09:07,000
test them at some point later to see if

216
0:09:05.949,000 --> 0:09:09,000
the lightbulb moment has gone on for

217
0:09:08.47,000 --> 0:09:12,000
those individuals and they've defined

218
0:09:10.839,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that sort of creative solution that

219
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
hidden rule and you can do that after

220
0:09:16.06,000 --> 0:09:2,000
being awake or you can do that after

221
0:09:17.8,000 --> 0:09:22,000
being asleep and that's how they can

222
0:09:20.11,000 --> 0:09:25,000
start to tease apart is it just time

223
0:09:23.17,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that the brain needs for creativity is

224
0:09:25.42,000 --> 0:09:3,000
it time awake or instead is it time

225
0:09:28.269,000 --> 0:09:32,000
asleep and it was time asleep that

226
0:09:30.67,000 --> 0:09:35,000
seemed to give to the brain this sort of

227
0:09:32.769,000 --> 0:09:36,000
creative genius ability and I think

228
0:09:36.519,000 --> 0:09:39,000
something else you mentioned there

229
0:09:37.66,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that's interesting too it's not just

230
0:09:40.29,000 --> 0:09:46,000
creativity but sleep can also I think

231
0:09:44.05,000 --> 0:09:48,000
change our emotional and mood state sort

232
0:09:46.93,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of feeling better the next day and

233
0:09:48.759,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that's what we're now starting to learn

234
0:09:50.92,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is is another function of sleep for the

235
0:09:53.38,000 --> 0:09:59,000
mind that sleep and provides almost a

236
0:09:56.829,000 --> 0:10:01,000
form of overnight therapy that sleep

237
0:09:59.62,000 --> 0:10:04,000
will take those difficult stressful

238
0:10:02.61,000 --> 0:10:08,000
situations or problems and sleep almost

239
0:10:05.5,000 --> 0:10:1,000
acts like a nocturnal soothing balm just

240
0:10:08.949,000 --> 0:10:12,000
sort of taking the sharp edges off our

241
0:10:11.23,000 --> 0:10:16,000
emotional experiences so that we come

242
0:10:13.569,000 --> 0:10:18,000
back the next day and we don't feel as

243
0:10:16.839,000 --> 0:10:2,000
challenged or as triggered by those

244
0:10:19.089,000 --> 0:10:24,000
events anymore um so it's not

245
0:10:21.519,000 --> 0:10:26,000
necessarily I think time that heals all

246
0:10:24.88,000 --> 0:10:28,000
wounds it's time with a night of sleep

247
0:10:27.1,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that provides that form of emotional

248
0:10:29.25,000 --> 0:10:33,000
convalescence and that's perhaps

249
0:10:32.079,000 --> 0:10:36,000
particularly important in this modern

250
0:10:34.18,000 --> 0:10:39,000
era I think there's a lovely quote by

251
0:10:36.42,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the American entrepreneur Joseph E

252
0:10:39.25,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Cosman and he said the best bridge

253
0:10:41.709,000 --> 0:10:46,000
between despair and hope is a good night

254
0:10:44.92,000 --> 0:10:48,000
of sleep and I think that's particularly

255
0:10:47.29,000 --> 0:10:5,000
prescient right now I mean you could let

256
0:10:49.6,000 --> 0:10:52,000
me imagine that a lot of people right

257
0:10:51.009,000 --> 0:10:55,000
now wrestling with various mental health

258
0:10:52.98,000 --> 0:10:59,000
issues that are possibly exacerbated by

259
0:10:55.389,000 --> 0:11:,000
the day that we're in and I guess what

260
0:10:59.98,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I'm here saying is don't forget the

261
0:11:01.329,000 --> 0:11:06,000
simplest therapy of all which is just

262
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:08,000
enough that that that in itself

263
0:11:06.769,000 --> 0:11:11,000
yes sleep I think we're learning

264
0:11:08.75,000 --> 0:11:14,000
performs a form of emotional first aid

265
0:11:12.199,000 --> 0:11:17,000
as it were and it reminds me actually of

266
0:11:14.899,000 --> 0:11:19,000
another lovely phrase by charlotte

267
0:11:18.17,000 --> 0:11:22,000
brontë who said that a ruffled mind

268
0:11:20.3,000 --> 0:11:25,000
makes for a restless pillow and i think

269
0:11:22.94,000 --> 0:11:27,000
we've all had that experience of feeling

270
0:11:25.339,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that have triggered that that day and we

271
0:11:28.49,000 --> 0:11:32,000
just know that sleep isn't necessarily

272
0:11:30.17,000 --> 0:11:36,000
going to come at night it's probably

273
0:11:32.69,000 --> 0:11:38,000
also the reason sorry just gone no

274
0:11:36.649,000 --> 0:11:4,000
you're going yeah I was just going to

275
0:11:39.259,000 --> 0:11:43,000
say I think it's it's part of the the

276
0:11:41.06,000 --> 0:11:47,000
reason that we're finding that sleep is

277
0:11:43.579,000 --> 0:11:5,000
so tied into psychiatric disorders and

278
0:11:47.54,000 --> 0:11:52,000
mental health conditions in the past 20

279
0:11:50.87,000 --> 0:11:54,000
years for example we've not been able to

280
0:11:52.55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
discover a single psychiatric condition

281
0:11:55.009,000 --> 0:12:,000
in which sleep is normal so I think

282
0:11:58.009,000 --> 0:12:02,000
sleep has a very powerful story to tell

283
0:12:00.35,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in our understanding and probably

284
0:12:02.18,000 --> 0:12:08,000
treatment of serious mental illness I

285
0:12:05.829,000 --> 0:12:08,000
mean there's another issue that I

286
0:12:08.209,000 --> 0:12:11,000
suspect a lot of people are wrestling

287
0:12:09.769,000 --> 0:12:14,000
with right now is that a lot of people's

288
0:12:11.48,000 --> 0:12:18,000
response to being isolated and feeling a

289
0:12:15.649,000 --> 0:12:19,000
bit stressed is to imagine more and more

290
0:12:18.5,000 --> 0:12:22,000
delicious things to eat and cook people

291
0:12:20.6,000 --> 0:12:26,000
you know we will we go to comfort food

292
0:12:23.17,000 --> 0:12:28,000
is is and so some people you know what

293
0:12:26.72,000 --> 0:12:29,000
if they're they wrestle with weight

294
0:12:28.55,000 --> 0:12:31,000
issues even more now they're normal

295
0:12:30.23,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I think you've argued that sleep has a

296
0:12:32.029,000 --> 0:12:4,000
role to play in in the battle against

297
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:42,000
gaining weight it does and you know I

298
0:12:40.31,000 --> 0:12:43,000
think very understandably right now that

299
0:12:42.56,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that may also be relevant

300
0:12:44.089,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we know that helpless mechanism plays

301
0:12:46.91,000 --> 0:12:51,000
out where if were not sleeping well we

302
0:12:50.029,000 --> 0:12:55,000
can start to gain weight the first piece

303
0:12:52.519,000 --> 0:12:57,000
of evidence concerns hormones and to

304
0:12:55.639,000 --> 0:12:59,000
specific hormones that control our

305
0:12:57.62,000 --> 0:13:02,000
hunger levels those two hormones are

306
0:13:00.05,000 --> 0:13:05,000
called leptin and ghrelin and I often

307
0:13:03.439,000 --> 0:13:06,000
say that they almost sound like hobbits

308
0:13:05.93,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but I promise you they're not they're

309
0:13:07.279,000 --> 0:13:12,000
actually sort of real hormones now

310
0:13:10.31,000 --> 0:13:15,000
leptin when it's released is the signal

311
0:13:13.13,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to your brain to say you're full you're

312
0:13:15.47,000 --> 0:13:18,000
satiated you don't want to eat it

313
0:13:17.75,000 --> 0:13:19,000
anymore

314
0:13:18.76,000 --> 0:13:22,000
whereas ghrelin does the opposite it

315
0:13:20.68,000 --> 0:13:24,000
says you're not full you're not

316
0:13:22.96,000 --> 0:13:28,000
satisfied with your food you should eat

317
0:13:24.97,000 --> 0:13:31,000
more and when we start to understand in

318
0:13:29.2,000 --> 0:13:34,000
opposite directions we lose the signal

319
0:13:32.32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that says you're full and you're

320
0:13:34.6,000 --> 0:13:39,000
satisfied with your meal which is leptin

321
0:13:36.76,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but we increase the hormone that says no

322
0:13:39.79,000 --> 0:13:42,000
you're actually hungry even though

323
0:13:41.41,000 --> 0:13:46,000
you've just eaten you you should eat

324
0:13:43.63,000 --> 0:13:48,000
more and so as a consequence people who

325
0:13:47.08,000 --> 0:13:51,000
are underslept can start to eat

326
0:13:48.94,000 --> 0:13:53,000
somewhere between two to four hundred

327
0:13:51.18,000 --> 0:13:56,000
extra calories per day when you look at

328
0:13:53.98,000 --> 0:13:58,000
some of these studies umm it's not by

329
0:13:57.04,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the way just that you start to eat more

330
0:13:59.2,000 --> 0:14:03,000
it's also that when you are under slept

331
0:14:01.78,000 --> 0:14:06,000
your preference for different food

332
0:14:03.94,000 --> 0:14:08,000
groups actually shift and so you start

333
0:14:07.27,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to desire more heavy-hitting

334
0:14:09.63,000 --> 0:14:14,000
carbohydrates and more simple processed

335
0:14:12.37,000 --> 0:14:17,000
sugary foods rather than those more

336
0:14:15.52,000 --> 0:14:19,000
healthy macro ingredients which also

337
0:14:17.74,000 --> 0:14:23,000
sort of sets you on a path towards a

338
0:14:19.81,000 --> 0:14:25,000
more we call obesogenic profile but it

339
0:14:23.86,000 --> 0:14:28,000
also actually changes how your brain

340
0:14:26.17,000 --> 0:14:31,000
operates in response to food and we did

341
0:14:29.47,000 --> 0:14:33,000
a study a couple of years ago where we

342
0:14:31.54,000 --> 0:14:35,000
give people good night of sleep or we

343
0:14:33.88,000 --> 0:14:37,000
kept them awake for a night and then we

344
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
place them inside an MRI scanner and we

345
0:14:38.17,000 --> 0:14:41,000
showed them different types of food

346
0:14:40.03,000 --> 0:14:46,000
groups and things that were very

347
0:14:41.65,000 --> 0:14:47,000
desirable ice cream chocolate etc or an

348
0:14:46.06,000 --> 0:14:49,000
sort of healthy leafy greens and what we

349
0:14:48.61,000 --> 0:14:51,000
found is that when people were not

350
0:14:50.05,000 --> 0:14:54,000
getting the sleep that they needed the

351
0:14:52.54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
sort of the deep hedonic centers of the

352
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:59,000
brain were actually ramped up in

353
0:14:57.04,000 --> 0:15:01,000
response desire to desirable foods and

354
0:14:59.83,000 --> 0:15:03,000
they started to want those more

355
0:15:01.42,000 --> 0:15:06,000
unhealthy foods and this in part was

356
0:15:03.91,000 --> 0:15:07,000
because the the frontal lobe in their

357
0:15:06.61,000 --> 0:15:1,000
brain which almost acts like this sort

358
0:15:08.86,000 --> 0:15:13,000
of CEO of the brain regulating and

359
0:15:11.47,000 --> 0:15:15,000
controlling our impulses and our our

360
0:15:13.87,000 --> 0:15:17,000
emotions that was actually switched off

361
0:15:16.18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
by a lack of sleep and so now you start

362
0:15:18.43,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to reach for those unhealthy food

363
0:15:21.22,000 --> 0:15:26,000
choices but I think we can think of that

364
0:15:24.01,000 --> 0:15:3,000
more positively and say perhaps sleep

365
0:15:26.98,000 --> 0:15:31,000
can actually be a tool in your box that

366
0:15:30.04,000 --> 0:15:34,000
can enable you to

367
0:15:32.56,000 --> 0:15:35,000
manage your weight more efficiently

368
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
incorrectly and so getting that extra

369
0:15:36.52,000 --> 0:15:4,000
sleep should lead to and that's what we

370
0:15:38.35,000 --> 0:15:44,000
see in the data hopefully a profile of

371
0:15:41.2,000 --> 0:15:45,000
body weight yeah I suspect speaking

372
0:15:44.56,000 --> 0:15:47,000
personally there's no amount of sleep I

373
0:15:46.09,000 --> 0:15:57,000
could have that could make me lust after

374
0:15:47.8,000 --> 0:15:58,000
broccoli but actually chargrilled was a

375
0:15:57.4,000 --> 0:16:,000
bit of olive oil and salt it's not so

376
0:15:58.99,000 --> 0:16:,000
bad

377
0:16:01.72,000 --> 0:16:05,000
so someone listen to this I mean if you

378
0:16:04.42,000 --> 0:16:07,000
were trying to take a positive stance of

379
0:16:05.8,000 --> 0:16:08,000
this isolation time or whatever thought

380
0:16:07.839,000 --> 0:16:11,000
you know I'm gonna make this a time of

381
0:16:09.36,000 --> 0:16:13,000
learning and of creativity and so forth

382
0:16:12.19,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I mean that's a possibility of someone

383
0:16:13.839,000 --> 0:16:15,000
what what you're saying is don't forget

384
0:16:15.13,000 --> 0:16:18,000
you're gonna do that don't forget to

385
0:16:16.72,000 --> 0:16:2,000
make sleep a key part of that program

386
0:16:18.82,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that's gonna help on every account

387
0:16:21.24,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that's right it is a time like no other

388
0:16:24.64,000 --> 0:16:3,000
were I think we have in some ways more

389
0:16:28.18,000 --> 0:16:33,000
sleep opportunity time and in fact there

390
0:16:31.39,000 --> 0:16:35,000
was a recent report out and it's not a

391
0:16:33.97,000 --> 0:16:36,000
scientific report so we have to be

392
0:16:35.56,000 --> 0:16:39,000
careful not to over interpret it and

393
0:16:37.54,000 --> 0:16:41,000
they looked at 68,000 Americans and

394
0:16:40.03,000 --> 0:16:44,000
using sleep tracker data sort of

395
0:16:42.19,000 --> 0:16:47,000
wearable track of data and they looked

396
0:16:44.83,000 --> 0:16:51,000
at the change in sleep since March 13th

397
0:16:47.71,000 --> 0:16:54,000
which was when the president mandated a

398
0:16:52.12,000 --> 0:16:57,000
national state of emergency and what

399
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:59,000
they demonstrated or suggested was that

400
0:16:57.22,000 --> 0:17:03,000
since then there's actually been almost

401
0:16:59.08,000 --> 0:17:06,000
a 20% increase in sleep time on average

402
0:17:03.85,000 --> 0:17:07,000
as a nation here in the United States

403
0:17:06.31,000 --> 0:17:09,000
now again I think we have to be very

404
0:17:08.56,000 --> 0:17:11,000
careful it could be that people are just

405
0:17:09.76,000 --> 0:17:13,000
sort of sitting in bed and you know

406
0:17:12.339,000 --> 0:17:17,000
working or watching television in the

407
0:17:14.62,000 --> 0:17:19,000
evening but even if it's half that

408
0:17:17.589,000 --> 0:17:22,000
amount I think what it may tell us is

409
0:17:19.78,000 --> 0:17:25,000
that this time is very strange era that

410
0:17:23.47,000 --> 0:17:27,000
will appear again right now as unmasked

411
0:17:26.47,000 --> 0:17:31,000
what is otherwise a chronic persistent

412
0:17:28.449,000 --> 0:17:33,000
debt in our sleep and finally you know

413
0:17:32.05,000 --> 0:17:37,000
when you remove the breaks on sleep you

414
0:17:34.36,000 --> 0:17:39,000
can see that sleep flourishes in return

415
0:17:37.09,000 --> 0:17:41,000
now I'm not suggesting that that's true

416
0:17:39.7,000 --> 0:17:42,000
of everyone I think when we look at that

417
0:17:41.17,000 --> 0:17:45,000
data more closely we'll probably see two

418
0:17:43.48,000 --> 0:17:46,000
clouds of data one

419
0:17:45.64,000 --> 0:17:48,000
out of data where people are perhaps

420
0:17:47.17,000 --> 0:17:5,000
sleeping more but then there will be

421
0:17:48.91,000 --> 0:17:51,000
this opposite cloud where people

422
0:17:50.77,000 --> 0:17:53,000
actually are sleeping significantly less

423
0:17:52.78,000 --> 0:17:56,000
because of the things that we've spoken

424
0:17:54.67,000 --> 0:17:58,000
about anxiety about the virus itself

425
0:17:57.01,000 --> 0:18:,000
concerns for example about whether they

426
0:17:59.32,000 --> 0:18:03,000
all hold their jobs and people of course

427
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:06,000
magically have lost their job and so I

428
0:18:03.82,000 --> 0:18:08,000
think we'll see shifts but that seems to

429
0:18:06.34,000 --> 0:18:1,000
be an interesting trend it's interesting

430
0:18:09.64,000 --> 0:18:13,000
I was having a conversation with friends

431
0:18:11.2,000 --> 0:18:15,000
last night about how surprising the

432
0:18:13.78,000 --> 0:18:17,000
final health statistics coming out of

433
0:18:15.79,000 --> 0:18:22,000
this whole thing may look because if

434
0:18:18.04,000 --> 0:18:24,000
people they have mostly be being

435
0:18:22.84,000 --> 0:18:25,000
isolated so they're not catching all the

436
0:18:24.43,000 --> 0:18:27,000
other diseases they might be getting I

437
0:18:25.99,000 --> 0:18:3,000
think I think flu stats are way down

438
0:18:27.72,000 --> 0:18:33,000
compared to a typical year at this point

439
0:18:31.03,000 --> 0:18:36,000
probably because of the isolation less

440
0:18:34.3,000 --> 0:18:38,000
road deaths less who knows what else I

441
0:18:36.94,000 --> 0:18:41,000
mean just possibly the there'll be some

442
0:18:39.07,000 --> 0:18:44,000
compensation for the horrifying death

443
0:18:42.28,000 --> 0:18:46,000
rates that we're going to see from kovat

444
0:18:44.32,000 --> 0:18:48,000
but it's you know it's so interesting

445
0:18:47.11,000 --> 0:18:51,000
trying to put those pieces together and

446
0:18:49.06,000 --> 0:18:53,000
here's here's what is also interesting

447
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
to me like one of the key symptoms of

448
0:18:54.04,000 --> 0:19:,000
this virus is to make people incredibly

449
0:18:57.39,000 --> 0:19:04,000
tired like a fever and incredibly tired

450
0:19:00.64,000 --> 0:19:07,000
and I I've like it's striking to me that

451
0:19:04.48,000 --> 0:19:09,000
in principle we see those things as this

452
0:19:08.47,000 --> 0:19:11,000
is awful things that happen that though

453
0:19:09.97,000 --> 0:19:12,000
those are the viruses weapons actually

454
0:19:11.56,000 --> 0:19:15,000
that in a way they're not right there

455
0:19:13.03,000 --> 0:19:18,000
are bodies weapons to try to beat the

456
0:19:15.73,000 --> 0:19:21,000
virus we have a fever to try and burn it

457
0:19:18.34,000 --> 0:19:23,000
off you I think that's medically correct

458
0:19:22.12,000 --> 0:19:26,000
that's the body's natural response with

459
0:19:23.89,000 --> 0:19:26,000
a lot of hydrogens and home and with

460
0:19:26.68,000 --> 0:19:28,000
sleep

461
0:19:27.52,000 --> 0:19:29,000
should we just view like if you if

462
0:19:29.5,000 --> 0:19:3,000
you're having symptoms and you're

463
0:19:30.46,000 --> 0:19:33,000
feeling really tired

464
0:19:31.42,000 --> 0:19:35,000
does it help at all to say this isn't

465
0:19:33.85,000 --> 0:19:36,000
the bug this is me and to listen to your

466
0:19:35.65,000 --> 0:19:39,000
body into it and so just and to get or

467
0:19:37.57,000 --> 0:19:41,000
the sleep you down more can I think it's

468
0:19:40.45,000 --> 0:19:43,000
a beautiful example and it's another

469
0:19:42.4,000 --> 0:19:45,000
demonstration of that relationship that

470
0:19:44.32,000 --> 0:19:48,000
we spoke about I think everyone knows

471
0:19:46.39,000 --> 0:19:5,000
that when you get sick or you get a

472
0:19:48.4,000 --> 0:19:52,000
common cold what you really want to do

473
0:19:50.62,000 --> 0:19:55,000
is just curl up in bed and and sort of

474
0:19:53.38,000 --> 0:19:57,000
sleep sleep it off as it were and in

475
0:19:56.56,000 --> 0:19:58,000
fact we understand that relationship

476
0:19:57.97,000 --> 0:20:01,000
that when you

477
0:19:59.5,000 --> 0:20:05,000
I'm infected there are a set of change

478
0:20:02.89,000 --> 0:20:07,000
the immune factor that only go to were

479
0:20:05.86,000 --> 0:20:1,000
to try and fight these infections but

480
0:20:08.47,000 --> 0:20:13,000
they actually will signal to sleep that

481
0:20:11.41,000 --> 0:20:16,000
sleep in it's in in terms of its

482
0:20:14.05,000 --> 0:20:19,000
duration is needed in greater amounts in

483
0:20:17.08,000 --> 0:20:22,000
fact there are immune factors that are

484
0:20:19.09,000 --> 0:20:24,000
sleeps stimulating factors because the

485
0:20:22.12,000 --> 0:20:27,000
body knows that the best effort sort of

486
0:20:24.58,000 --> 0:20:3,000
the most empowered custom that it can

487
0:20:27.88,000 --> 0:20:33,000
call up in its weaponry defense against

488
0:20:31.42,000 --> 0:20:35,000
infection is this thing called sleep and

489
0:20:33.88,000 --> 0:20:36,000
that's why we actually feel as though we

490
0:20:36.16,000 --> 0:20:39,000
want to sleep more it's not just because

491
0:20:37.72,000 --> 0:20:4,000
we're at home and we're not at work and

492
0:20:39.76,000 --> 0:20:42,000
we have the chance to sleep more it's

493
0:20:41.47,000 --> 0:20:45,000
that your immune system is actually

494
0:20:43.36,000 --> 0:20:47,000
co-opting and bringing sleep into the

495
0:20:45.94,000 --> 0:20:49,000
equation to help fight that infection

496
0:20:48.13,000 --> 0:20:54,000
because sleep is so powerful in that

497
0:20:50.47,000 --> 0:20:56,000
regard they're given all these reasons

498
0:20:54.25,000 --> 0:21:,000
why we need more sleep now than ever

499
0:20:56.56,000 --> 0:21:01,000
behaves talk to us about how how to get

500
0:21:00.52,000 --> 0:21:03,000
it what are you're putting on top tips

501
0:21:01.9,000 --> 0:21:03,000
on how someone can get a really great

502
0:21:03.7,000 --> 0:21:07,000
night's sleep

503
0:21:04.68,000 --> 0:21:1,000
yeah I think beyond the typical what we

504
0:21:08.32,000 --> 0:21:13,000
call sleep hygiene factors such as

505
0:21:11.19,000 --> 0:21:17,000
controlling your light in the evening

506
0:21:13.45,000 --> 0:21:21,000
making your room a cool place also being

507
0:21:17.77,000 --> 0:21:24,000
mindful of caffeine and all like give

508
0:21:22.21,000 --> 0:21:27,000
three tips for what to do if you've had

509
0:21:25.75,000 --> 0:21:29,000
a bad night of sleep and then if you're

510
0:21:27.91,000 --> 0:21:32,000
still struggling with sleep three tips

511
0:21:30.28,000 --> 0:21:36,000
for perhaps how to better manage that um

512
0:21:33.04,000 --> 0:21:39,000
so firstly if you're coming off a bad

513
0:21:36.67,000 --> 0:21:4,000
night of sleep the first thing and this

514
0:21:39.22,000 --> 0:21:43,000
may sound counterintuitive particularly

515
0:21:41.02,000 --> 0:21:45,000
coming from someone like me is not to

516
0:21:43.51,000 --> 0:21:47,000
sleep in the next day you resist the

517
0:21:45.73,000 --> 0:21:52,000
urge to sleep in wake up at your normal

518
0:21:48.19,000 --> 0:21:57,000
time and there are two reasons for that

519
0:21:52.78,000 --> 0:22:,000
firstly your body has a 24-hour clock

520
0:21:57.58,000 --> 0:22:04,000
and it expects regularity and it thrives

521
0:22:01.72,000 --> 0:22:07,000
best on regularity and if you start to

522
0:22:04.96,000 --> 0:22:09,000
change your wakeup time you will confuse

523
0:22:07.78,000 --> 0:22:12,000
that 24-hour clock so try not to confuse

524
0:22:10.9,000 --> 0:22:14,000
it wake up at the same time even a

525
0:22:13.36,000 --> 0:22:16,000
a bad night of sleep the other reason is

526
0:22:15.4,000 --> 0:22:19,000
that if you sleep in late you're

527
0:22:17.23,000 --> 0:22:21,000
probably not going to feel sleepy until

528
0:22:19.809,000 --> 0:22:23,000
later that following evening so once

529
0:22:21.82,000 --> 0:22:26,000
again you start to drift forward in time

530
0:22:24.39,000 --> 0:22:29,000
the second piece of advice that relates

531
0:22:27.61,000 --> 0:22:31,000
to that don't necessarily go to bed any

532
0:22:30.37,000 --> 0:22:34,000
earlier than you would otherwise

533
0:22:32.559,000 --> 0:22:37,000
because sometimes if you do that even if

534
0:22:35.14,000 --> 0:22:4,000
you're feeling quite sleepy you can then

535
0:22:38.049,000 --> 0:22:43,000
lie in bed and you can start to toss and

536
0:22:40.99,000 --> 0:22:44,000
turn so try to push through until your

537
0:22:43.42,000 --> 0:22:47,000
standard bedtime that following evening

538
0:22:45.72,000 --> 0:22:51,000
the final piece of advice after a bad

539
0:22:48.309,000 --> 0:22:55,000
night of sleep is resist the urge to nap

540
0:22:51.91,000 --> 0:22:57,000
during the day now if you are healthy

541
0:22:55.99,000 --> 0:22:59,000
good sleeper and you can nap regularly

542
0:22:58,000 --> 0:23:01,000
then naps are just fine but if you are

543
0:23:00.04,000 --> 0:23:02,000
struggling with sleep and have had a bad

544
0:23:01.6,000 --> 0:23:04,000
night of sleep

545
0:23:02.53,000 --> 0:23:06,000
try not to nap especially late in the

546
0:23:04.87,000 --> 0:23:09,000
afternoon because you can think of naps

547
0:23:07.51,000 --> 0:23:12,000
in that situation almost like snacking

548
0:23:10.03,000 --> 0:23:14,000
before a main meal if you have a snack

549
0:23:12.61,000 --> 0:23:16,000
you're not going to have the same

550
0:23:14.08,000 --> 0:23:19,000
appetite to try and sort of consume that

551
0:23:17.23,000 --> 0:23:22,000
main meal and the same is true if you

552
0:23:19.419,000 --> 0:23:25,000
start to snack with a nap just before

553
0:23:22.57,000 --> 0:23:28,000
your main sleep so try to resist that

554
0:23:25.77,000 --> 0:23:31,000
what to do if you are still struggling

555
0:23:28.57,000 --> 0:23:33,000
with sleep I think the first thing is if

556
0:23:32.53,000 --> 0:23:38,000
you're in bed and you've been awake for

557
0:23:34.48,000 --> 0:23:42,000
let's say 20 or 30 minutes perhaps the

558
0:23:39.07,000 --> 0:23:44,000
advice is take a break stop trying to

559
0:23:42.58,000 --> 0:23:46,000
fight sleep because typically the harder

560
0:23:44.77,000 --> 0:23:48,000
that we try to force ourselves to sleep

561
0:23:47.26,000 --> 0:23:51,000
the more stressed and anxious that we

562
0:23:48.91,000 --> 0:23:53,000
become and the further that we push

563
0:23:51.52,000 --> 0:23:55,000
sleep away from us and you know it's

564
0:23:54.49,000 --> 0:23:59,000
it's a little bit like trying to

565
0:23:55.72,000 --> 0:24:01,000
remember a name where you're sort of the

566
0:23:59.799,000 --> 0:24:03,000
harder you think the the less likely it

567
0:24:02.14,000 --> 0:24:07,000
is that you are to recall that name

568
0:24:03.97,000 --> 0:24:09,000
don't try to step away from that again I

569
0:24:07.78,000 --> 0:24:11,000
think the advice here would be you would

570
0:24:10.57,000 --> 0:24:14,000
never sit at the dinner table waiting to

571
0:24:12.37,000 --> 0:24:16,000
get hungry so why would you lie in bed

572
0:24:14.65,000 --> 0:24:18,000
waiting to get sleepy and the answer is

573
0:24:16.96,000 --> 0:24:21,000
that you shouldn't I'll just get out of

574
0:24:18.82,000 --> 0:24:23,000
bed go and do something different in dim

575
0:24:22.15,000 --> 0:24:26,000
light read a book listen to a podcast

576
0:24:23.98,000 --> 0:24:26,000
only return to bed when you're sleepy

577
0:24:26.169,000 --> 0:24:28,000
and that way you'll read

578
0:24:27.19,000 --> 0:24:32,000
the association that your bed is the

579
0:24:29.11,000 --> 0:24:35,000
place of sleep refusing listen to a few

580
0:24:32.95,000 --> 0:24:39,000
TED Talks I will put you to sleep okay

581
0:24:35.22,000 --> 0:24:41,000
yeah yeah my voice I think and my inane

582
0:24:40.75,000 --> 0:24:44,000
words are usually the best sort of

583
0:24:42.16,000 --> 0:24:47,000
soporific name known to err to women and

584
0:24:44.83,000 --> 0:24:48,000
men and I think the last two pieces of

585
0:24:47.2,000 --> 0:24:52,000
advice beyond and that really is a

586
0:24:49.24,000 --> 0:24:54,000
powerful one is is just please stop give

587
0:24:52.84,000 --> 0:24:55,000
yourself a break and stop trying that

588
0:24:54.37,000 --> 0:24:57,000
can be really helpful because you know

589
0:24:56.11,000 --> 0:25:,000
otherwise if you're in bed you're

590
0:24:57.73,000 --> 0:25:01,000
stressed and ruminated you're teaching

591
0:25:00.16,000 --> 0:25:06,000
your brain that this thing called the

592
0:25:02.02,000 --> 0:25:09,000
bed is the place with where instead we

593
0:25:06.61,000 --> 0:25:1,000
train it to when you return understand

594
0:25:09.91,000 --> 0:25:12,000
that the bed is the place where you

595
0:25:11.29,000 --> 0:25:15,000
always sleep when you have confidence in

596
0:25:13.18,000 --> 0:25:19,000
sleeping the last two pieces of advice

597
0:25:15.87,000 --> 0:25:21,000
have a winddown routine I think many of

598
0:25:20.02,000 --> 0:25:24,000
us have this idea that's the perhaps

599
0:25:22.33,000 --> 0:25:26,000
should be like a light switch that we

600
0:25:24.34,000 --> 0:25:28,000
get into bed and we can just go from a

601
0:25:26.41,000 --> 0:25:3,000
one to a zero that it's a binary that we

602
0:25:28.6,000 --> 0:25:32,000
can just switch off and instantly fall

603
0:25:30.61,000 --> 0:25:34,000
asleep the typically is not like that

604
0:25:33.16,000 --> 0:25:37,000
sleep is much more like trying to land a

605
0:25:35.38,000 --> 0:25:4,000
plane that you've got to gradually give

606
0:25:37.57,000 --> 0:25:43,000
it time to descend down onto that terra

607
0:25:40.6,000 --> 0:25:45,000
firma of good sleep and the faster that

608
0:25:43.72,000 --> 0:25:47,000
you're going in terms of the mind the

609
0:25:45.97,000 --> 0:25:49,000
longer that you need to give and the

610
0:25:48.46,000 --> 0:25:54,000
mind to sort of gradually come back down

611
0:25:50.56,000 --> 0:25:56,000
into sleep do the Wow meditation is

612
0:25:54.88,000 --> 0:25:58,000
useful also taking a hot bath or a

613
0:25:57.31,000 --> 0:26:01,000
shower having some kind of ritual and

614
0:25:59.38,000 --> 0:26:05,000
that's useful by the way not just

615
0:26:01.69,000 --> 0:26:07,000
because a hot bath will relax you but we

616
0:26:05.77,000 --> 0:26:1,000
also have this science and sleep called

617
0:26:08.35,000 --> 0:26:12,000
the warm bath effect where as you come

618
0:26:11.2,000 --> 0:26:14,000
out of the bath and although the blood

619
0:26:13.15,000 --> 0:26:18,000
has come to the surface of your skin and

620
0:26:15.16,000 --> 0:26:2,000
when you get out you radiate all of the

621
0:26:18.34,000 --> 0:26:22,000
heat out of your body so your core body

622
0:26:20.71,000 --> 0:26:24,000
temperature actually drops and that's

623
0:26:23.29,000 --> 0:26:26,000
actually good for sleep it helps you

624
0:26:25.06,000 --> 0:26:3,000
fall asleep faster and stay asleep and

625
0:26:27.07,000 --> 0:26:31,000
more deeply the last quick point I would

626
0:26:30.16,000 --> 0:26:33,000
make if you are struggling with sleep

627
0:26:31.72,000 --> 0:26:35,000
and it's a simple tip that can be

628
0:26:33.34,000 --> 0:26:38,000
effective remove all clock faces from

629
0:26:36.61,000 --> 0:26:4,000
the bedroom it's fine to have an alarm

630
0:26:39.04,000 --> 0:26:44,000
clock but try to

631
0:26:40.69,000 --> 0:26:45,000
take away any information about time

632
0:26:44.11,000 --> 0:26:49,000
because if you're struggling with sleep

633
0:26:46.03,000 --> 0:26:52,000
knowing that it's 2:15 a.m. or 4 a.m.

634
0:26:49.54,000 --> 0:26:54,000
it's not going to help you so remove

635
0:26:52.06,000 --> 0:26:56,000
those from the bedroom the last thing I

636
0:26:54.73,000 --> 0:26:58,000
would note by the way is that if these

637
0:26:56.17,000 --> 0:27:,000
things are not working well for you and

638
0:26:59.02,000 --> 0:27:03,000
this is tip from a wonderful sleep

639
0:27:00.76,000 --> 0:27:05,000
clinician called Michael grander 5

640
0:27:03.88,000 --> 0:27:06,000
minute an athletic coach trying to give

641
0:27:05.86,000 --> 0:27:08,000
you tips for improvement but you have a

642
0:27:07.81,000 --> 0:27:11,000
sprained ankle

643
0:27:09.12,000 --> 0:27:14,000
then nothing I can tell you is going to

644
0:27:12.43,000 --> 0:27:16,000
be useful until you fix that that

645
0:27:14.56,000 --> 0:27:18,000
sprained ankle and what I mean here is

646
0:27:16.66,000 --> 0:27:19,000
that if these things aren't working for

647
0:27:18.67,000 --> 0:27:21,000
you it could be that you have an

648
0:27:20.26,000 --> 0:27:25,000
underlying sleep disorder and if that's

649
0:27:22.27,000 --> 0:27:28,000
the case these tips really aren't going

650
0:27:25.27,000 --> 0:27:3,000
to be effective until you go and connect

651
0:27:28.93,000 --> 0:27:31,000
with the doctor and see if you have an

652
0:27:30.73,000 --> 0:27:37,000
underlying sleep disorder that has been

653
0:27:32.92,000 --> 0:27:38,000
undiagnosed Whitney oh there are a lot

654
0:27:37.93,000 --> 0:27:4,000
of people chiming in with questions all

655
0:27:39.82,000 --> 0:27:42,000
over the world and like there are a

656
0:27:41.89,000 --> 0:27:43,000
number of our viewers who are really

657
0:27:43.45,000 --> 0:27:46,000
appreciating what you're saying and are

658
0:27:44.68,000 --> 0:27:47,000
struggling with sleep themselves and and

659
0:27:46.81,000 --> 0:27:5,000
one of the questions we've seen is

660
0:27:48.19,000 --> 0:27:53,000
around stress as it relates to our sleep

661
0:27:51.55,000 --> 0:27:56,000
cycles and our dreams also just what

662
0:27:54.01,000 --> 0:27:59,000
impact can stress have on the kinds of

663
0:27:56.68,000 --> 0:28:03,000
dreams we have and and are our sleep

664
0:27:59.02,000 --> 0:28:05,000
cycles in general so stress within the

665
0:28:03.73,000 --> 0:28:06,000
body causes a number of different

666
0:28:05.71,000 --> 0:28:08,000
changes one of the things that stress

667
0:28:07.69,000 --> 0:28:11,000
will do is elevate a hormone called

668
0:28:09.67,000 --> 0:28:14,000
cortisol which it's often thought of as

669
0:28:12.58,000 --> 0:28:18,000
not just an activating hormone but also

670
0:28:15.13,000 --> 0:28:2,000
a stress-related hormone and typically

671
0:28:18.58,000 --> 0:28:21,000
as we try to fall asleep

672
0:28:20.29,000 --> 0:28:24,000
cortisol should actually be decreasing

673
0:28:22.45,000 --> 0:28:26,000
beautifully and it should fall to almost

674
0:28:24.61,000 --> 0:28:29,000
its lowest point right around the time

675
0:28:27.1,000 --> 0:28:32,000
when we're trying to fall asleep and so

676
0:28:29.98,000 --> 0:28:34,000
if were stressed and if you in fact look

677
0:28:32.29,000 --> 0:28:36,000
at the disorder of insomnia people start

678
0:28:35.05,000 --> 0:28:39,000
to decline in their cortisol like a

679
0:28:36.91,000 --> 0:28:4,000
healthy sleeper would do but just around

680
0:28:39.16,000 --> 0:28:43,000
the bedroom period where you're starting

681
0:28:41.47,000 --> 0:28:44,000
to think about going to sleep cortisol

682
0:28:43.18,000 --> 0:28:47,000
actually starts to spike back up again

683
0:28:45.43,000 --> 0:28:49,000
and that can prevent people from falling

684
0:28:47.71,000 --> 0:28:5,000
asleep it's what we call sleep onset

685
0:28:49.59,000 --> 0:28:53,000
insomnia

686
0:28:51.62,000 --> 0:28:56,000
cortisol is one of the ingredients that

687
0:28:54.38,000 --> 0:28:59,000
can impact our sleep in our sleep cycles

688
0:28:57.05,000 --> 0:29:01,000
the other factor is the nervous system

689
0:29:00.23,000 --> 0:29:04,000
in the body and in fact we have two

690
0:29:02.03,000 --> 0:29:05,000
branches of your automatic nervous

691
0:29:04.37,000 --> 0:29:08,000
system we have the fight-or-flight

692
0:29:06.02,000 --> 0:29:11,000
wrench and then we have the more calming

693
0:29:08.84,000 --> 0:29:12,000
what we call the rest or digest branch

694
0:29:11.09,000 --> 0:29:15,000
of the nervous system and when we become

695
0:29:13.37,000 --> 0:29:17,000
stressed and anxious we shift over more

696
0:29:15.95,000 --> 0:29:19,000
into that sort of fight or flight

697
0:29:18.02,000 --> 0:29:23,000
situation of the nervous system and we

698
0:29:20.9,000 --> 0:29:25,000
also know that that means the depa

699
0:29:23.48,000 --> 0:29:27,000
am pinned down in order to stay asleep I

700
0:29:26.45,000 --> 0:29:3,000
think some people have had that

701
0:29:27.89,000 --> 0:29:32,000
experience were that if mentally or even

702
0:29:30.5,000 --> 0:29:34,000
in your eyes you feel tired and you know

703
0:29:33.59,000 --> 0:29:37,000
that you're tired but there's just

704
0:29:35.3,000 --> 0:29:4,000
something about you know your heart rate

705
0:29:37.67,000 --> 0:29:42,000
and just the bodily stress despite the

706
0:29:40.55,000 --> 0:29:45,000
mind being tired that is preventing your

707
0:29:42.92,000 --> 0:29:47,000
body from falling asleep how do we think

708
0:29:45.86,000 --> 0:29:49,000
about changing those well as I mentioned

709
0:29:48.29,000 --> 0:29:51,000
you know the hot bath effect can help

710
0:29:49.94,000 --> 0:29:53,000
meditation they'll has also been proven

711
0:29:52.19,000 --> 0:29:56,000
to be very useful meditation that

712
0:29:54.77,000 --> 0:29:57,000
actually tries to shift you over into

713
0:29:56.57,000 --> 0:30:,000
that more quiescent state of the nervous

714
0:29:58.73,000 --> 0:30:02,000
system and in people with insomnia and

715
0:30:00.94,000 --> 0:30:04,000
mindfulness meditation techniques have

716
0:30:03.41,000 --> 0:30:07,000
proven useful it reduces the time it

717
0:30:05.69,000 --> 0:30:09,000
takes them to actually fall asleep so

718
0:30:08.27,000 --> 0:30:11,000
those are some of the ways that we can

719
0:30:09.74,000 --> 0:30:13,000
think about both how the stress impacts

720
0:30:12.05,000 --> 0:30:17,000
our sleep and perhaps how we can try to

721
0:30:14.179,000 --> 0:30:19,000
combat it and and to the point about

722
0:30:17.69,000 --> 0:30:2,000
dreams do you find that stress also has

723
0:30:19.79,000 --> 0:30:24,000
an impact on the types of dreams that we

724
0:30:21.47,000 --> 0:30:26,000
have it does seem to have a relationship

725
0:30:25.64,000 --> 0:30:29,000
and perhaps the best demonstration of

726
0:30:27.29,000 --> 0:30:31,000
this is an extreme form of that which is

727
0:30:29.66,000 --> 0:30:33,000
a condition called PTSD or

728
0:30:31.55,000 --> 0:30:36,000
post-traumatic stress disorder where

729
0:30:33.71,000 --> 0:30:38,000
people have incredibly difficult

730
0:30:36.559,000 --> 0:30:41,000
traumatic experiences and stress and

731
0:30:39.17,000 --> 0:30:43,000
what we commonly see there is a

732
0:30:41.75,000 --> 0:30:45,000
consequence of repetitive nightmares

733
0:30:43.73,000 --> 0:30:48,000
in fact it forms part of the diagnostic

734
0:30:46.49,000 --> 0:30:51,000
criteria for you to receive a diagnosis

735
0:30:49.55,000 --> 0:30:55,000
of PTSD so there is certainly some think

736
0:30:52.309,000 --> 0:30:57,000
about our emotional waking life that

737
0:30:55.7,000 --> 0:31:,000
sort of bleeds over it's almost the red

738
0:30:58.22,000 --> 0:31:03,000
thread narrative that transitions into

739
0:31:01.67,000 --> 0:31:04,000
our sleeping life and specifically our

740
0:31:03.62,000 --> 0:31:07,000
dreaming life

741
0:31:05.02,000 --> 0:31:11,000
and we do know however a study published

742
0:31:08.04,000 --> 0:31:13,000
some years ago now demonstrating that if

743
0:31:11.14,000 --> 0:31:15,000
people are dreaming are particularly

744
0:31:13.09,000 --> 0:31:17,000
dreaming about some of those difficult

745
0:31:15.31,000 --> 0:31:2,000
traumatic experiences it can actually be

746
0:31:17.89,000 --> 0:31:21,000
beneficial that it leads to clinical

747
0:31:20.32,000 --> 0:31:26,000
resolution of things such as depression

748
0:31:22.44,000 --> 0:31:28,000
and trauma and bereavement so there is a

749
0:31:26.59,000 --> 0:31:3,000
relationship between our waking life in

750
0:31:29.2,000 --> 0:31:32,000
our Dreaming life when it comes to

751
0:31:30.61,000 --> 0:31:34,000
emotional health and we do think that

752
0:31:32.56,000 --> 0:31:38,000
sleep and particularly dream sleep plays

753
0:31:34.99,000 --> 0:31:4,000
a form of a sort of mental health in

754
0:31:39.13,000 --> 0:31:45,000
that regard and sort of dissipating and

755
0:31:41.68,000 --> 0:31:46,000
removing some of that emotional stress

756
0:31:45.24,000 --> 0:31:48,000
that definitely explains some of the

757
0:31:47.17,000 --> 0:31:49,000
unusual dreams I've been having and I

758
0:31:48.43,000 --> 0:31:51,000
imagine it'll be helpful for some of our

759
0:31:49.9,000 --> 0:31:52,000
viewers who have also been having odd

760
0:31:51.58,000 --> 0:31:55,000
dreams so I'll be back later with other

761
0:31:53.44,000 --> 0:32:,000
other questions that's good

762
0:31:56.34,000 --> 0:32:03,000
talk a bit Matt about just that the role

763
0:32:00.82,000 --> 0:32:04,000
of greens on sleep and like so many

764
0:32:04.09,000 --> 0:32:08,000
people the news is so interesting right

765
0:32:05.59,000 --> 0:32:11,000
now your instinct is to take your phone

766
0:32:08.98,000 --> 0:32:12,000
or whatever to your bedside you know

767
0:32:12.1,000 --> 0:32:15,000
check it check out the news lastly at

768
0:32:13.87,000 --> 0:32:17,000
night whatever is there evidence about

769
0:32:15.73,000 --> 0:32:22,000
this about whether that's advisable or

770
0:32:18.46,000 --> 0:32:24,000
not so I think there is a feeling in the

771
0:32:23.14,000 --> 0:32:26,000
sleep science community of course that

772
0:32:24.91,000 --> 0:32:27,000
the invasion of technology into the

773
0:32:26.71,000 --> 0:32:3,000
bedroom hasn't necessarily been a good

774
0:32:28.87,000 --> 0:32:33,000
thing technology has done wonderful

775
0:32:30.85,000 --> 0:32:35,000
things for us is the enhancement and

776
0:32:34.03,000 --> 0:32:39,000
improvement of our sleep one of them I

777
0:32:36.13,000 --> 0:32:41,000
think at this stage it's probably not I

778
0:32:39.49,000 --> 0:32:44,000
think in the future it actually will be

779
0:32:41.49,000 --> 0:32:48,000
but you mentioned the sort of the use of

780
0:32:44.89,000 --> 0:32:5,000
of screens and phones in perhaps the

781
0:32:48.55,000 --> 0:32:53,000
hour before bed or even once we get into

782
0:32:51.73,000 --> 0:32:55,000
bed I don't think that's advisable

783
0:32:53.94,000 --> 0:32:57,000
firstly there is a concern about the

784
0:32:56.59,000 --> 0:33:,000
blue light that comes from some of these

785
0:32:58.9,000 --> 0:33:03,000
devices and that blue light will

786
0:33:01.24,000 --> 0:33:05,000
typically stamp the breaks on the

787
0:33:04.33,000 --> 0:33:08,000
release of a hormone that we call

788
0:33:05.92,000 --> 0:33:11,000
melatonin and melatonin is a hormone

789
0:33:09.25,000 --> 0:33:14,000
that signals to your brain and your body

790
0:33:11.97,000 --> 0:33:16,000
that it's nighttime that its darkness

791
0:33:14.71,000 --> 0:33:2,000
and we need that signal of darkness

792
0:33:17.74,000 --> 0:33:22,000
to enable the healthy timing of our

793
0:33:20.74,000 --> 0:33:25,000
sleep and in some ways we are a dark

794
0:33:22.99,000 --> 0:33:27,000
deprived Society in this modern era but

795
0:33:26.53,000 --> 0:33:29,000
if you look at the evidence there is

796
0:33:28.27,000 --> 0:33:32,000
some evidence that those screens can

797
0:33:30.22,000 --> 0:33:34,000
actually change our sleep patterns but

798
0:33:32.44,000 --> 0:33:36,000
more recently I think that that's been

799
0:33:34.3,000 --> 0:33:39,000
debated what I do think perhaps is the

800
0:33:37.12,000 --> 0:33:41,000
greater impact of technology is less so

801
0:33:39.94,000 --> 0:33:45,000
with the blue light coming from these

802
0:33:41.59,000 --> 0:33:49,000
devices but more so the the the

803
0:33:46.5,000 --> 0:33:52,000
activation the physiological activation

804
0:33:49.809,000 --> 0:33:54,000
that these devices trigger and we know

805
0:33:53.41,000 --> 0:33:57,000
firstly that if you're using your phone

806
0:33:55.57,000 --> 0:34:,000
it can cause something called sleep

807
0:33:57.9,000 --> 0:34:02,000
procrastination if it was actually a

808
0:34:00.79,000 --> 0:34:04,000
thing where you get into bed you are

809
0:34:02.98,000 --> 0:34:05,000
tired you're sleepy you could easily

810
0:34:04.84,000 --> 0:34:08,000
fall asleep but you think well I'll just

811
0:34:06.94,000 --> 0:34:1,000
am I'll just check Facebook one less

812
0:34:09.34,000 --> 0:34:13,000
time or I'll just send that quick tweet

813
0:34:11.32,000 --> 0:34:15,000
and I'll just sort of go online and

814
0:34:13.899,000 --> 0:34:17,000
order a few of those things that I need

815
0:34:16,000 --> 0:34:2,000
and then you look up and it's 30 minutes

816
0:34:17.98,000 --> 0:34:21,000
later and now you're deficient by half

817
0:34:20.23,000 --> 0:34:24,000
an hour in terms of your sleep the other

818
0:34:22.659,000 --> 0:34:27,000
thing that these devices can do though

819
0:34:24.669,000 --> 0:34:3,000
is on the back end of sleep if we bring

820
0:34:28.359,000 --> 0:34:33,000
those devices into the bedroom a lot of

821
0:34:31,000 --> 0:34:36,000
us I think the first thing that we do

822
0:34:33.97,000 --> 0:34:37,000
when we wake up in the morning is we

823
0:34:36.22,000 --> 0:34:41,000
swipe right and then all of a sudden

824
0:34:38.35,000 --> 0:34:44,000
this sort of tsunami of anxiety comes

825
0:34:41.23,000 --> 0:34:47,000
flooding in and that trains our brain to

826
0:34:44.95,000 --> 0:34:49,000
essentially expect that sort of stress

827
0:34:48.04,000 --> 0:34:53,000
every single morning it's what we call

828
0:34:50.07,000 --> 0:34:55,000
anticipatory anxiety and I think a good

829
0:34:53.679,000 --> 0:34:57,000
example of this would be if you have to

830
0:34:55.99,000 --> 0:34:59,000
wake up for an early morning flight and

831
0:34:58.119,000 --> 0:35:02,000
you know that it's critical but you have

832
0:35:00.04,000 --> 0:35:05,000
a job interview there's just something

833
0:35:02.41,000 --> 0:35:09,000
about your sleep not as it's intrusive

834
0:35:05.29,000 --> 0:35:12,000
and having your phone next to your bed

835
0:35:09.46,000 --> 0:35:15,000
is a sort of a diet version of that and

836
0:35:12.31,000 --> 0:35:17,000
sort of a li te version of that but it's

837
0:35:15.52,000 --> 0:35:2,000
still present and it still affects sleep

838
0:35:17.59,000 --> 0:35:23,000
so if you can a good piece of advice is

839
0:35:20.83,000 --> 0:35:25,000
try not to check your phone for let's

840
0:35:24.07,000 --> 0:35:29,000
say just the first five minutes of the

841
0:35:26.53,000 --> 0:35:31,000
day if you can just sort of hold off and

842
0:35:29.32,000 --> 0:35:33,000
you can push that distance of

843
0:35:31.69,000 --> 0:35:35,000
a little bit further so you don't train

844
0:35:33.91,000 --> 0:35:37,000
your brain to think okay every night

845
0:35:36.19,000 --> 0:35:4,000
when I go to bed the first thing I'm

846
0:35:38.38,000 --> 0:35:43,000
going to be doing is receiving anxiety

847
0:35:40.509,000 --> 0:35:46,000
in the morning you mentioned melatonin

848
0:35:43.48,000 --> 0:35:49,000
some people are aware by it as a natural

849
0:35:46.65,000 --> 0:35:54,000
remedy do recommend its use for some

850
0:35:50.23,000 --> 0:35:57,000
people for anyway well man Onan isn't

851
0:35:54.849,000 --> 0:35:59,000
actually a sleep inducing chemical at

852
0:35:57.97,000 --> 0:36:03,000
least so far looking at the data it's a

853
0:36:00.819,000 --> 0:36:07,000
sleep timing hormone so it helps us

854
0:36:04.329,000 --> 0:36:11,000
regulate when the brain is told to go to

855
0:36:08.799,000 --> 0:36:12,000
sleep to think of melatonin your to

856
0:36:11.47,000 --> 0:36:15,000
consider let's see the hundred meter

857
0:36:13.089,000 --> 0:36:18,000
race at the Olympics melatonin is the

858
0:36:16.21,000 --> 0:36:21,000
starting official that sort of begins

859
0:36:18.789,000 --> 0:36:22,000
the gun that starts the great sleep race

860
0:36:21.339,000 --> 0:36:24,000
but that's starting official with the

861
0:36:23.619,000 --> 0:36:26,000
sort of the starting pistol they don't

862
0:36:25.269,000 --> 0:36:3,000
participate in the sleep race itself

863
0:36:27.309,000 --> 0:36:32,000
that's a different set of chemicals so

864
0:36:30.579,000 --> 0:36:33,000
if you're transitioning between

865
0:36:32.619,000 --> 0:36:35,000
different time zones

866
0:36:33.849,000 --> 0:36:37,000
that's certainly when melatonin can be

867
0:36:36.4,000 --> 0:36:4,000
useful to help sort of give your signal

868
0:36:38.619,000 --> 0:36:44,000
sorry give the brain the signal back of

869
0:36:41.38,000 --> 0:36:47,000
when it should be night and day for most

870
0:36:45.279,000 --> 0:36:49,000
people though melatonin isn't

871
0:36:47.5,000 --> 0:36:52,000
necessarily efficacious for improving

872
0:36:49.869,000 --> 0:36:54,000
their sleep as we get older and the

873
0:36:53.47,000 --> 0:36:57,000
amount of melatonin that we start to

874
0:36:55.69,000 --> 0:36:59,000
release does actually decrease in total

875
0:36:58.329,000 --> 0:37:02,000
across the night and that's where I

876
0:37:00.609,000 --> 0:37:04,000
think some of the evidence is actually

877
0:37:03.089,000 --> 0:37:08,000
interesting it does seem to provide a

878
0:37:05.41,000 --> 0:37:11,000
benefit the one thing I would note is at

879
0:37:08.95,000 --> 0:37:12,000
least here in America what has to be a

880
0:37:11.619,000 --> 0:37:17,000
little bit careful because melatonin is

881
0:37:13.66,000 --> 0:37:2,000
not regulated by the FDA and because

882
0:37:18.43,000 --> 0:37:23,000
it's over-the-counter there was a study

883
0:37:20.68,000 --> 0:37:25,000
that looked at different brand print

884
0:37:24.099,000 --> 0:37:28,000
sort of vendors of Merit only if it is

885
0:37:26.559,000 --> 0:37:29,000
that relative to what it said on the

886
0:37:28.299,000 --> 0:37:33,000
bottle there was somewhere between

887
0:37:29.769,000 --> 0:37:34,000
eighty percent less um or almost four

888
0:37:33.549,000 --> 0:37:37,000
hundred and sixty percent more a

889
0:37:35.319,000 --> 0:37:4,000
melatonin relative to what was suggested

890
0:37:38.14,000 --> 0:37:43,000
so I think one needs to be a little bit

891
0:37:40.63,000 --> 0:37:44,000
careful for that what would be the dose

892
0:37:43.329,000 --> 0:37:47,000
well it's usually a lot less

893
0:37:45.46,000 --> 0:37:49,000
most people some people will take five

894
0:37:48.13,000 --> 0:37:51,000
milligrams or ten milligram thinking

895
0:37:49.81,000 --> 0:37:53,000
that more is better which is very

896
0:37:51.64,000 --> 0:37:55,000
natural thing to do with with

897
0:37:54.28,000 --> 0:37:58,000
supplements that's not really the case

898
0:37:56.17,000 --> 0:38:01,000
with melatonin that he's have shown that

899
0:37:58.51,000 --> 0:38:03,000
really the the effect if there is one is

900
0:38:01.69,000 --> 0:38:05,000
best at something like point five

901
0:38:03.91,000 --> 0:38:09,000
milligrams or even less than that though

902
0:38:06.4,000 --> 0:38:12,000
okay Matt is that just two to four when

903
0:38:10.39,000 --> 0:38:14,000
you're changing time zones or is that do

904
0:38:12.64,000 --> 0:38:18,000
you think that's possibly effective for

905
0:38:15.13,000 --> 0:38:21,000
someone to take regularly well I think

906
0:38:19.15,000 --> 0:38:25,000
if you are perhaps someone who is a

907
0:38:21.76,000 --> 0:38:26,000
night owl so what we have are what we

908
0:38:25.45,000 --> 0:38:29,000
call chrono types there are you an

909
0:38:27.52,000 --> 0:38:31,000
evening type are you a morning type are

910
0:38:29.589,000 --> 0:38:34,000
you somewhere in between and in some

911
0:38:32.29,000 --> 0:38:36,000
ways that's actually quite genetically

912
0:38:34.869,000 --> 0:38:37,000
determined so you don't really get a

913
0:38:36.91,000 --> 0:38:4,000
choice so much as to whether you're a

914
0:38:38.65,000 --> 0:38:43,000
morning type or an evening type now in

915
0:38:41.83,000 --> 0:38:46,000
evening types I would like to go to bed

916
0:38:44.26,000 --> 0:38:49,000
late and wake up late their melatonin

917
0:38:47.14,000 --> 0:38:53,000
rise doesn't normally start to begin

918
0:38:49.589,000 --> 0:38:55,000
until let's say ten eleven even midnight

919
0:38:53.46,000 --> 0:38:58,000
so for those individuals who are trying

920
0:38:56.349,000 --> 0:39:01,000
to drag themselves back if they have to

921
0:38:59.32,000 --> 0:39:03,000
you know go to work early in the morning

922
0:39:01.39,000 --> 0:39:06,000
and then they need to get to bed earlier

923
0:39:03.849,000 --> 0:39:08,000
than they would otherwise one can try to

924
0:39:06.49,000 --> 0:39:1,000
see if melatonin is beneficial but if

925
0:39:08.89,000 --> 0:39:12,000
you're young and you're healthy

926
0:39:10.74,000 --> 0:39:14,000
melatonin doesn't necessarily seem to be

927
0:39:13.42,000 --> 0:39:17,000
very effective in terms of helping your

928
0:39:15.22,000 --> 0:39:2,000
sleep what about any other sort of quote

929
0:39:17.92,000 --> 0:39:23,000
natural sleep aids from I don't know

930
0:39:20.349,000 --> 0:39:28,000
chamomile tea to alcohol and any other

931
0:39:23.98,000 --> 0:39:29,000
suggestions so for camomile tea we don't

932
0:39:28.78,000 --> 0:39:31,000
have any good evidence people have

933
0:39:30.25,000 --> 0:39:35,000
looked at this and it doesn't seem to

934
0:39:32.47,000 --> 0:39:37,000
necessarily benefit there may be some

935
0:39:35.43,000 --> 0:39:4,000
ingredients in chamomile that could have

936
0:39:38.32,000 --> 0:39:42,000
a benefit but right now no really good

937
0:39:40.69,000 --> 0:39:45,000
strong evidence that at least I've seen

938
0:39:42.57,000 --> 0:39:48,000
you mentioned alcohol and I'm glad you

939
0:39:45.7,000 --> 0:39:53,000
did because alcohol is perhaps I'm the

940
0:39:48.73,000 --> 0:39:56,000
most used sleep aid rather relative to

941
0:39:54.25,000 --> 0:39:58,000
at least prescription sleep aids and

942
0:39:57.43,000 --> 0:40:,000
it's very natural that people

943
0:39:59.109,000 --> 0:40:03,000
have a nightcap and they'll say it

944
0:40:00.73,000 --> 0:40:05,000
really helps me fall asleep faster

945
0:40:03.569,000 --> 0:40:09,000
unfortunately alcohol is the enemy of

946
0:40:06.43,000 --> 0:40:12,000
sleep and alcohol will hurt your sleep

947
0:40:10.029,000 --> 0:40:15,000
in at least 3 different ways but the

948
0:40:12.73,000 --> 0:40:17,000
alcohol is a class of drugs that we call

949
0:40:15.19,000 --> 0:40:2,000
the sedatives and sedation is not sleep

950
0:40:18.579,000 --> 0:40:22,000
but when we have a drink in the evening

951
0:40:20.92,000 --> 0:40:24,000
or a couple of drinks we mistake the

952
0:40:22.779,000 --> 0:40:27,000
former for the latter and alcohol will

953
0:40:25.869,000 --> 0:40:29,000
actually simply just numb the cortex so

954
0:40:28.45,000 --> 0:40:32,000
you're just sedating yourself if I were

955
0:40:30.549,000 --> 0:40:34,000
to look at the electrical signature of

956
0:40:32.89,000 --> 0:40:35,000
your sleep when you've had a normal

957
0:40:35.17,000 --> 0:40:38,000
healthy night of sleep I'd compare it to

958
0:40:36.88,000 --> 0:40:4,000
when you've had alcohol it's not the

959
0:40:38.71,000 --> 0:40:44,000
same it's a different electrical profile

960
0:40:41.079,000 --> 0:40:47,000
and the other two dangers regarding

961
0:40:45.069,000 --> 0:40:49,000
alcohol and sleep is that firstly even

962
0:40:47.799,000 --> 0:40:51,000
if you think you fall asleep faster you

963
0:40:50.019,000 --> 0:40:54,000
typically will wake up many more times

964
0:40:52.359,000 --> 0:40:56,000
throughout the night what we call sleep

965
0:40:54.67,000 --> 0:40:58,000
fragmentation do you wake up the next

966
0:40:56.92,000 --> 0:41:01,000
day and you don't feel as restored by

967
0:40:59.289,000 --> 0:41:03,000
your sleep because your duration of

968
0:41:02.049,000 --> 0:41:07,000
sleep the quantity of sleep that you've

969
0:41:03.97,000 --> 0:41:09,000
had may be quite similar but the quality

970
0:41:07.45,000 --> 0:41:13,000
of that sleep in terms of its continuity

971
0:41:10.119,000 --> 0:41:16,000
is actually significantly worse the

972
0:41:14.14,000 --> 0:41:18,000
final thing about alcohol is that it's

973
0:41:16.42,000 --> 0:41:2,000
actually very good at blocking your

974
0:41:18.369,000 --> 0:41:21,000
dream sleep what we call your rapid eye

975
0:41:20.47,000 --> 0:41:24,000
movement sleep and we know that REM

976
0:41:22.119,000 --> 0:41:27,000
sleep is in for number of different

977
0:41:25.299,000 --> 0:41:3,000
funds including mental health and and/or

978
0:41:27.819,000 --> 0:41:31,000
emotional stability so that's really why

979
0:41:30.519,000 --> 0:41:34,000
people if they are struggling with sleep

980
0:41:32.499,000 --> 0:41:36,000
and they should re are away from trying

981
0:41:35.17,000 --> 0:41:38,000
to use alcohol it's not a sleep aid at

982
0:41:37.299,000 --> 0:41:4,000
all it's actually going to harm your

983
0:41:38.68,000 --> 0:41:43,000
sleep and would you make the same

984
0:41:41.19,000 --> 0:41:49,000
comments about sleeping pills is that

985
0:41:43.96,000 --> 0:41:52,000
sedation not real belief inducing um it

986
0:41:49.69,000 --> 0:41:54,000
is that is the case the the sleeping

987
0:41:53.499,000 --> 0:41:56,000
pills typically that are prescribed

988
0:41:55.119,000 --> 0:41:59,000
right now are a class of drugs that in

989
0:41:57.13,000 --> 0:42:03,000
fact we call the sedative hypnotics once

990
0:41:59.829,000 --> 0:42:05,000
again their action is they act on the

991
0:42:03.13,000 --> 0:42:08,000
same receptor in the brain that alcohol

992
0:42:05.98,000 --> 0:42:09,000
does now the way that they sort of

993
0:42:08.2,000 --> 0:42:12,000
stimulate and tickle that receptor as it

994
0:42:10.749,000 --> 0:42:14,000
were is a little bit different but

995
0:42:12.67,000 --> 0:42:17,000
in general that's what they're doing -

996
0:42:14.77,000 --> 0:42:18,000
they're trying to sort of downscale the

997
0:42:17.92,000 --> 0:42:22,000
activity in your cortex sort of knock

998
0:42:19.69,000 --> 0:42:24,000
out your cortex as it were and what it's

999
0:42:23.079,000 --> 0:42:28,000
again you look at the electrical profile

1000
0:42:25.42,000 --> 0:42:33,000
is not the same as normal naturalistic

1001
0:42:28.18,000 --> 0:42:35,000
sleep that's right you know sorry please

1002
0:42:33.819,000 --> 0:42:36,000
go on just go say that that's the

1003
0:42:36.099,000 --> 0:42:39,000
mentioned prescription drugs and that's

1004
0:42:37.63,000 --> 0:42:41,000
the same for over-the-counter sleep aids

1005
0:42:39.49,000 --> 0:42:44,000
that even if they they do get you to

1006
0:42:42.4,000 --> 0:42:46,000
sleep you you they're just not I mean is

1007
0:42:45.25,000 --> 0:42:48,000
there any any value to them at all or

1008
0:42:47.38,000 --> 0:42:5,000
should you just shun them that they're

1009
0:42:48.609,000 --> 0:42:51,000
just an illusion that they're giving you

1010
0:42:50.38,000 --> 0:42:54,000
leave you're not they're not actually

1011
0:42:52,000 --> 0:42:57,000
giving you the beneficiary benefits of

1012
0:42:54.52,000 --> 0:42:59,000
sleep yeah I think that that seems to be

1013
0:42:57.64,000 --> 0:43:02,000
the case and it's the reason that back

1014
0:42:59.799,000 --> 0:43:05,000
in 2015 or 16 the American College of

1015
0:43:03.19,000 --> 0:43:08,000
Physicians made really quite a landmark

1016
0:43:05.89,000 --> 0:43:1,000
recommendation they suggested that based

1017
0:43:09.04,000 --> 0:43:13,000
on the evidence looking at the magnitude

1018
0:43:11.53,000 --> 0:43:15,000
of the benefit that these sleeping pills

1019
0:43:13.359,000 --> 0:43:17,000
have relative to placebo and some of the

1020
0:43:15.849,000 --> 0:43:19,000
concerns the health and safety concerns

1021
0:43:17.589,000 --> 0:43:21,000
regarding these sleeping pills that they

1022
0:43:19.93,000 --> 0:43:22,000
must no longer be the first-line

1023
0:43:21.79,000 --> 0:43:26,000
treatment recommendation for people with

1024
0:43:23.68,000 --> 0:43:28,000
insomnia instead the suggestion was a

1025
0:43:27.45,000 --> 0:43:34,000
treatment called cognitive behavioral

1026
0:43:29.53,000 --> 0:43:36,000
therapy for insomnia or CBT I and it is

1027
0:43:34.809,000 --> 0:43:38,000
this remarkable behavioral and therapy

1028
0:43:37.329,000 --> 0:43:4,000
and cognitive therapy that's been

1029
0:43:39.04,000 --> 0:43:43,000
developed over the past ten or fifteen

1030
0:43:41.079,000 --> 0:43:45,000
years and it seems to be if you put it

1031
0:43:43.42,000 --> 0:43:47,000
sort of head-to-head with sleeping pills

1032
0:43:45.76,000 --> 0:43:5,000
I'm almost like a Coke Pepsi challenge

1033
0:43:47.859,000 --> 0:43:51,000
and it is just as effective as sleeping

1034
0:43:50.829,000 --> 0:43:54,000
pills in the short-term but what's

1035
0:43:52.66,000 --> 0:43:55,000
beneficial is that when you stop working

1036
0:43:54.849,000 --> 0:43:57,000
with that therapist and it can take

1037
0:43:56.349,000 --> 0:44:,000
somewhere between six to eight weeks to

1038
0:43:58.089,000 --> 0:44:03,000
course-correct and retrain the brain to

1039
0:44:00.46,000 --> 0:44:05,000
good sleep it's very effective i'm you

1040
0:44:03.13,000 --> 0:44:08,000
continue on with those benefits up to a

1041
0:44:06.13,000 --> 0:44:09,000
year recent studies up to five years

1042
0:44:08.14,000 --> 0:44:12,000
whereas when you are taking sleeping

1043
0:44:09.94,000 --> 0:44:13,000
pills and you stop not only do you

1044
0:44:12.43,000 --> 0:44:15,000
typically go back to the bad sleep that

1045
0:44:14.589,000 --> 0:44:17,000
you are having sometimes for some

1046
0:44:16.21,000 --> 0:44:19,000
patients you can have what's called

1047
0:44:17.859,000 --> 0:44:21,000
rebound insomnia which is where your

1048
0:44:20.17,000 --> 0:44:24,000
sleep can be even worse - right now if

1049
0:44:22.66,000 --> 0:44:25,000
people are struggling with sleep they

1050
0:44:24.609,000 --> 0:44:27,000
should really seek out

1051
0:44:26.48,000 --> 0:44:29,000
this treatment called cognitive

1052
0:44:28.1,000 --> 0:44:31,000
behavioral therapy for insomnia

1053
0:44:29.81,000 --> 0:44:32,000
that's the first-line recommended

1054
0:44:31.52,000 --> 0:44:34,000
treatment that we have to sleep

1055
0:44:33.02,000 --> 0:44:36,000
difficulties are related to insomnia

1056
0:44:35.18,000 --> 0:44:39,000
Whitney coming to your just a sec but

1057
0:44:36.95,000 --> 0:44:39,000
just to follow up on this I'm in it I

1058
0:44:39.2,000 --> 0:44:42,000
feel like there are still just

1059
0:44:40.64,000 --> 0:44:44,000
occasional circumstances where those

1060
0:44:42.59,000 --> 0:44:46,000
over-the-counter pills may be useful I

1061
0:44:45.23,000 --> 0:44:49,000
mean I you know when I'm hosting a TED

1062
0:44:47.15,000 --> 0:44:52,000
conference my mind when I go to bed is

1063
0:44:49.7,000 --> 0:44:54,000
though buzzy it's like there's no chance

1064
0:44:52.46,000 --> 0:44:57,000
I will sleep at all for hours and I've

1065
0:44:55.67,000 --> 0:44:59,000
certainly felt like anecdotally I found

1066
0:44:57.92,000 --> 0:45:01,000
it essential for a couple of those

1067
0:45:00.08,000 --> 0:45:04,000
nights to take an over-the-counter drug

1068
0:45:02.02,000 --> 0:45:07,000
and at least least get some tip you wake

1069
0:45:04.61,000 --> 0:45:08,000
up at least on the day feeling refresh

1070
0:45:07.34,000 --> 0:45:11,000
whereas when I haven't done that I've

1071
0:45:09.44,000 --> 0:45:13,000
woken up feeling like I just cannot hope

1072
0:45:12.05,000 --> 0:45:17,000
is it are there any circumstances where

1073
0:45:14.24,000 --> 0:45:19,000
you also one of uses appropriate um

1074
0:45:17.93,000 --> 0:45:21,000
suddenly right now people in terms of

1075
0:45:20.06,000 --> 0:45:24,000
prescription sleep medications and there

1076
0:45:22.28,000 --> 0:45:27,000
is still a time in a place for those but

1077
0:45:24.86,000 --> 0:45:29,000
even there it's really recommended for a

1078
0:45:27.47,000 --> 0:45:33,000
short term period nothing more than a

1079
0:45:30.68,000 --> 0:45:34,000
handful of weeks at best and then we

1080
0:45:33.98,000 --> 0:45:36,000
should look at alternative treatments

1081
0:45:35.27,000 --> 0:45:39,000
but certainly I do sort of sympathize

1082
0:45:37.16,000 --> 0:45:4,000
and and have empathy with that you know

1083
0:45:39.41,000 --> 0:45:42,000
I've experienced that myself and

1084
0:45:41.05,000 --> 0:45:45,000
particularly with things like jet lag I

1085
0:45:43.25,000 --> 0:45:48,000
certainly will use melatonin to see if I

1086
0:45:45.95,000 --> 0:45:5,000
can help and you know if things like

1087
0:45:48.32,000 --> 0:45:52,000
chamomile or melatonin and do make you

1088
0:45:51.32,000 --> 0:45:54,000
feel better than what I would say is

1089
0:45:53.21,000 --> 0:45:56,000
that perhaps the placebo effect is one

1090
0:45:55.28,000 --> 0:45:59,000
of the most reliable effects in all of

1091
0:45:56.99,000 --> 0:46:,000
pharmacology so if you do feel as though

1092
0:45:59.6,000 --> 0:46:02,000
it's working then perhaps and keep on

1093
0:46:01.58,000 --> 0:46:04,000
with that at least with the caveats that

1094
0:46:03.44,000 --> 0:46:06,000
we've spoken about regarding

1095
0:46:05.26,000 --> 0:46:08,000
non-regulated over-the-counter

1096
0:46:06.89,000 --> 0:46:08,000
supplements no more than half a

1097
0:46:09.05,000 --> 0:46:13,000
milligram

1098
0:46:09.44,000 --> 0:46:14,000
sounds like witness right there are some

1099
0:46:13.37,000 --> 0:46:16,000
questions online about technology and

1100
0:46:15.14,000 --> 0:46:18,000
the impact that can have on your sleep

1101
0:46:16.82,000 --> 0:46:19,000
specifically seeing a couple of

1102
0:46:18.56,000 --> 0:46:21,000
questions about artificial light and how

1103
0:46:20.24,000 --> 0:46:24,000
that might disrupt our sleep cycles and

1104
0:46:21.95,000 --> 0:46:26,000
then how we can use technology to

1105
0:46:24.59,000 --> 0:46:29,000
benefit our sleep like acts and that

1106
0:46:27.23,000 --> 0:46:34,000
sort of thing yes so we discussed a

1107
0:46:30.5,000 --> 0:46:37,000
little bit about this of blue and those

1108
0:46:35.03,000 --> 0:46:39,000
a study done at Harvard Medical School a

1109
0:46:37.52,000 --> 0:46:39,000
couple of years ago and what they found

1110
0:46:39.14,000 --> 0:46:42,000
was that

1111
0:46:39.77,000 --> 0:46:43,000
people who were using an iPad for one

1112
0:46:42.74,000 --> 0:46:45,000
hour before bed relative to someone who

1113
0:46:44.69,000 --> 0:46:49,000
is just reading a book in standard light

1114
0:46:46.61,000 --> 0:46:52,000
um firstly the use of that iPad I'm

1115
0:46:49.96,000 --> 0:46:55,000
delayed the release of melatonin that

1116
0:46:53.03,000 --> 0:46:58,000
darkness signaling hormone by two to

1117
0:46:56.48,000 --> 0:47:02,000
three hours it all also decreased the

1118
0:46:58.94,000 --> 0:47:04,000
amount of melatonin by about 50% v zero

1119
0:47:03.1,000 --> 0:47:07,000
it also seemed to disrupt the amount of

1120
0:47:05.93,000 --> 0:47:08,000
rapid eye movement sleep like those

1121
0:47:07.55,000 --> 0:47:1,000
people were getting and what was also

1122
0:47:09.44,000 --> 0:47:13,000
interesting in that study is that when

1123
0:47:11.27,000 --> 0:47:16,000
they stopped using the iPad before bed

1124
0:47:13.52,000 --> 0:47:18,000
there was almost a blast radius effect

1125
0:47:16.34,000 --> 0:47:2,000
where their sleep was still disrupted

1126
0:47:18.98,000 --> 0:47:22,000
for a couple of nights after it took

1127
0:47:20.6,000 --> 0:47:27,000
sort of a wild has almost wash out the

1128
0:47:23.3,000 --> 0:47:29,000
effect of that iPad use but as I said

1129
0:47:27.8,000 --> 0:47:31,000
there's been some more recent reports

1130
0:47:30.13,000 --> 0:47:34,000
that seem to suggest that perhaps those

1131
0:47:32.78,000 --> 0:47:37,000
devices in terms of the blue light may

1132
0:47:35.12,000 --> 0:47:39,000
not necessarily be as powerful impacting

1133
0:47:38,000 --> 0:47:42,000
I think it's more about the

1134
0:47:39.14,000 --> 0:47:44,000
psychological the cognitive activating

1135
0:47:42.1,000 --> 0:47:48,000
impacts that those devices have and

1136
0:47:44.63,000 --> 0:47:49,000
perhaps less so those the amount of blue

1137
0:47:48.17,000 --> 0:47:53,000
light and by the way I should note that

1138
0:47:50.23,000 --> 0:47:57,000
it is particularly light in the blue

1139
0:47:53.81,000 --> 0:47:58,000
part of the visible spectrum so if you

1140
0:47:57.38,000 --> 0:48:,000
are going to have light in the evening

1141
0:47:59.12,000 --> 0:48:02,000
and the advice is by the way in the last

1142
0:48:00.89,000 --> 0:48:05,000
hour before bed not just about

1143
0:48:02.93,000 --> 0:48:08,000
technology and screens try to dim down

1144
0:48:06.29,000 --> 0:48:11,000
half the lights in your house and you'll

1145
0:48:09.32,000 --> 0:48:14,000
be surprised at how sleepy that can make

1146
0:48:11.75,000 --> 0:48:16,000
you feel I think that's one of certainly

1147
0:48:14.33,000 --> 0:48:18,000
the the pieces of advice not just

1148
0:48:16.88,000 --> 0:48:19,000
technology in terms of light it's also

1149
0:48:18.71,000 --> 0:48:22,000
just the light that we have the

1150
0:48:20.48,000 --> 0:48:26,000
pollution that we have in her moment

1151
0:48:22.91,000 --> 0:48:29,000
itself I'll come back

1152
0:48:27.23,000 --> 0:48:33,000
with last questions from the audience

1153
0:48:30.16,000 --> 0:48:34,000
that's how much how much sleep should

1154
0:48:33.23,000 --> 0:48:39,000
people actually have is there a

1155
0:48:34.73,000 --> 0:48:41,000
prescribed our number do currently the

1156
0:48:40.099,000 --> 0:48:44,000
recommendation is for people to get

1157
0:48:42.05,000 --> 0:48:47,000
somewhere between seven to nine hours of

1158
0:48:44.69,000 --> 0:48:5,000
sleep and and there certainly is a range

1159
0:48:47.829,000 --> 0:48:53,000
it's not necessarily a one-size-fits-all

1160
0:48:51.07,000 --> 0:48:55,000
very similar to perhaps you know the

1161
0:48:53.93,000 --> 0:48:57,000
standard recommendations for calories I

1162
0:48:55.91,000 --> 0:49:,000
could say that you know it's for the

1163
0:48:58.28,000 --> 0:49:02,000
average adult it's two thousand or two

1164
0:49:00.92,000 --> 0:49:04,000
thousand five hundred calories a day but

1165
0:49:02.96,000 --> 0:49:06,000
depending on who you are your physiology

1166
0:49:05.089,000 --> 0:49:09,000
what you've been doing that day that

1167
0:49:07.22,000 --> 0:49:11,000
will vary but right now for the average

1168
0:49:09.68,000 --> 0:49:13,000
adult the suggestion is somewhere

1169
0:49:11.48,000 --> 0:49:15,000
between seven to nine hours I think the

1170
0:49:13.97,000 --> 0:49:18,000
CDC suggests that there is a minimum of

1171
0:49:16.369,000 --> 0:49:2,000
seven hours in terms of a requirement

1172
0:49:18.98,000 --> 0:49:21,000
but again it's going to be different for

1173
0:49:20.9,000 --> 0:49:23,000
different people that will always be

1174
0:49:22.22,000 --> 0:49:26,000
those edge cases are sort of the tail

1175
0:49:24.02,000 --> 0:49:28,000
ends of the bell curve distribution as

1176
0:49:26.27,000 --> 0:49:3,000
it were but that's a good I think range

1177
0:49:28.82,000 --> 0:49:31,000
to shoot for I mean do you think there

1178
0:49:31.04,000 --> 0:49:35,000
are outliers in other margaret

1179
0:49:32.78,000 --> 0:49:38,000
thatcher's and my wife's of this world

1180
0:49:35.39,000 --> 0:49:4,000
who only need five hours sleep there are

1181
0:49:38.81,000 --> 0:49:43,000
outliers and in fact there's been some

1182
0:49:41.359,000 --> 0:49:45,000
recent work looking at what we call

1183
0:49:43.849,000 --> 0:49:48,000
these short sleepers and there are

1184
0:49:46.19,000 --> 0:49:5,000
specific genes there are a couple of

1185
0:49:48.89,000 --> 0:49:54,000
genes in fact that have now been

1186
0:49:50.3,000 --> 0:49:57,000
discovered that seemed to be related to

1187
0:49:55.01,000 --> 0:49:59,000
just innate short sleepers people who

1188
0:49:57.68,000 --> 0:50:01,000
sleep somewhere between five to six

1189
0:49:59.69,000 --> 0:50:04,000
hours a night and that really does seem

1190
0:50:01.88,000 --> 0:50:06,000
to be all they uni can play around with

1191
0:50:05.66,000 --> 0:50:08,000
the circumstances you can bring them

1192
0:50:07.099,000 --> 0:50:11,000
into the laboratory you can take away

1193
0:50:08.69,000 --> 0:50:12,000
technology you can take away light you

1194
0:50:11.119,000 --> 0:50:15,000
can take away all cues that could

1195
0:50:13.43,000 --> 0:50:17,000
otherwise influence their sleep and

1196
0:50:15.44,000 --> 0:50:2,000
really sort of strip away everything but

1197
0:50:18.109,000 --> 0:50:24,000
their natural sleep expression and still

1198
0:50:21.14,000 --> 0:50:26,000
even when you give them you know a 10 12

1199
0:50:24.109,000 --> 0:50:28,000
hour period of time in bears an extreme

1200
0:50:26.18,000 --> 0:50:3,000
example they still only sleep

1201
0:50:28.339,000 --> 0:50:32,000
consistently somewhere between five to

1202
0:50:30.74,000 --> 0:50:35,000
six hours a night so we definitely know

1203
0:50:33.26,000 --> 0:50:38,000
that there is a very small select

1204
0:50:36.02,000 --> 0:50:4,000
proportion of the population that is a

1205
0:50:38.569,000 --> 0:50:42,000
short sleeper of course

1206
0:50:40.17,000 --> 0:50:45,000
when I say that many people say well I

1207
0:50:42.75,000 --> 0:50:47,000
think I'm I'm probably one of those but

1208
0:50:45.65,000 --> 0:50:5,000
statistically the likelihood is is a hat

1209
0:50:48.69,000 --> 0:50:53,000
quite low if that's that's helpful

1210
0:50:51.27,000 --> 0:50:55,000
well I'm certainly relieved a bit to

1211
0:50:54.39,000 --> 0:50:57,000
hear at least that that's a possibility

1212
0:50:55.68,000 --> 0:50:59,000
because I'm married to someone who seems

1213
0:50:57.78,000 --> 0:51:02,000
to never sleep anything like seven or

1214
0:51:00.059,000 --> 0:51:07,000
eight hours and and seems to be full of

1215
0:51:02.97,000 --> 0:51:07,000
energy on many days but I've been

1216
0:51:07.14,000 --> 0:51:13,000
worried about her since ever since I

1217
0:51:08.49,000 --> 0:51:16,000
heard your gentle thank you thank you

1218
0:51:13.25,000 --> 0:51:19,000
tried to encourage you to speak but this

1219
0:51:16.5,000 --> 0:51:21,000
is actually a paradox Matt in that some

1220
0:51:20.01,000 --> 0:51:24,000
of your findings are so you know

1221
0:51:21.9,000 --> 0:51:25,000
powerful on the the potential risks to

1222
0:51:24.48,000 --> 0:51:27,000
ask of not enough sleep but we haven't

1223
0:51:26.76,000 --> 0:51:28,000
had time to talk about let's help you

1224
0:51:27.78,000 --> 0:51:32,000
talk about risk of Alzheimer's you know

1225
0:51:29.609,000 --> 0:51:38,000
risk of many other things can go up risk

1226
0:51:33.329,000 --> 0:51:4,000
of heart disease and so forth did so

1227
0:51:39.27,000 --> 0:51:42,000
that people could literally at line

1228
0:51:40.5,000 --> 0:51:44,000
awake lie awake worrying about what they

1229
0:51:42.72,000 --> 0:51:45,000
just heard from Matt Walker like how you

1230
0:51:44.67,000 --> 0:51:48,000
know you yourself have sometimes done

1231
0:51:46.349,000 --> 0:51:5,000
that right you've had these new you know

1232
0:51:48.869,000 --> 0:51:51,000
discoveries and have woken up in the

1233
0:51:50.7,000 --> 0:51:53,000
night and been worried about the fact

1234
0:51:52.41,000 --> 0:51:56,000
that not only what you discovered but I

1235
0:51:54.42,000 --> 0:51:57,000
am awake now and this may be affecting

1236
0:51:56.46,000 --> 0:52:01,000
me as does that happen

1237
0:51:58.41,000 --> 0:52:03,000
yeah it does you know and firstly I'm no

1238
0:52:01.799,000 --> 0:52:07,000
bit of cardboard cutout of sleep

1239
0:52:04.349,000 --> 0:52:11,000
perfection I've struggled with bouts of

1240
0:52:07.859,000 --> 0:52:13,000
insomnia during my life and I'm probably

1241
0:52:12.18,000 --> 0:52:15,000
the worst of all individuals knowing

1242
0:52:14.28,000 --> 0:52:17,000
what I know you know I'm sitting there

1243
0:52:15.93,000 --> 0:52:18,000
as you mentioned and I'm wide awake and

1244
0:52:18.21,000 --> 0:52:21,000
I'm thinking well you know my

1245
0:52:19.92,000 --> 0:52:23,000
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is not

1246
0:52:21.869,000 --> 0:52:26,000
shutting down and not releasing you know

1247
0:52:24.51,000 --> 0:52:28,000
this specific sleep chemical I know that

1248
0:52:27.329,000 --> 0:52:3,000
you know Alzheimer's proteins in my

1249
0:52:29.19,000 --> 0:52:32,000
brain may be building it and at that

1250
0:52:30.569,000 --> 0:52:33,000
point you know I almost become like the

1251
0:52:32.64,000 --> 0:52:35,000
Woody Allen neurotic of the sleep world

1252
0:52:34.5,000 --> 0:52:38,000
and I'm dead in the water for the next

1253
0:52:36.329,000 --> 0:52:41,000
two hours in terms of sleep so you know

1254
0:52:38.73,000 --> 0:52:43,000
I joke about that but you know I've

1255
0:52:41.43,000 --> 0:52:46,000
definitely had my bouts and

1256
0:52:43.77,000 --> 0:52:51,000
relationships with insomnia before so I

1257
0:52:46.65,000 --> 0:52:53,000
am very I'm very thoughtful about that

1258
0:52:52.12,000 --> 0:52:56,000
and how you give a message of the

1259
0:52:54.04,000 --> 0:52:58,000
importance of sleep understanding that

1260
0:52:56.83,000 --> 0:53:,000
it could be triggering and I think you

1261
0:52:58.96,000 --> 0:53:02,000
know some of the information that can be

1262
0:53:01.12,000 --> 0:53:06,000
given in the talk or in the book could

1263
0:53:03.16,000 --> 0:53:11,000
almost be taken as a asleep or else a

1264
0:53:06.6,000 --> 0:53:14,000
scenario and that was never my intent I

1265
0:53:11.52,000 --> 0:53:17,000
think when I was writing the book

1266
0:53:14.8,000 --> 0:53:18,000
several years ago now I think if you

1267
0:53:18.07,000 --> 0:53:25,000
looked at the public there was still

1268
0:53:19.33,000 --> 0:53:28,000
this dense of sleep you know so what the

1269
0:53:25.39,000 --> 0:53:3,000
evidence was just so important that you

1270
0:53:28.66,000 --> 0:53:31,000
know I felt as though we were at a stage

1271
0:53:30.4,000 --> 0:53:34,000
where we thought of sleep as an

1272
0:53:32.34,000 --> 0:53:36,000
inconvenience and all I really wanted to

1273
0:53:35.08,000 --> 0:53:39,000
do was try to perhaps change some of

1274
0:53:37.21,000 --> 0:53:4,000
that belief to say leap is not an

1275
0:53:39.31,000 --> 0:53:43,000
inconvenience sleep is actually an

1276
0:53:40.87,000 --> 0:53:44,000
investment sleep is an investment in

1277
0:53:43.36,000 --> 0:53:46,000
your physical health as well as your

1278
0:53:44.95,000 --> 0:53:48,000
mental health and so that was really

1279
0:53:47.2,000 --> 0:53:52,000
sort of the goal I was trying to offer

1280
0:53:49.59,000 --> 0:53:54,000
but I understand that it can be

1281
0:53:52.27,000 --> 0:53:57,000
triggering I think you know I struggle

1282
0:53:55.15,000 --> 0:53:58,000
to to wrestle with those tensions I feel

1283
0:53:57.64,000 --> 0:54:,000
as though it's important that people

1284
0:53:58.99,000 --> 0:54:02,000
like the World Health Organization or

1285
0:54:00.67,000 --> 0:54:05,000
the CDC not be gun-shy in terms of

1286
0:54:03.85,000 --> 0:54:07,000
giving us the information regarding

1287
0:54:06.37,000 --> 0:54:1,000
risks in terms of our physical and

1288
0:54:08.77,000 --> 0:54:12,000
mental health and so I do feel it's

1289
0:54:11.2,000 --> 0:54:15,000
important that the science of sleep is

1290
0:54:12.94,000 --> 0:54:16,000
is given to the public but I also

1291
0:54:15.7,000 --> 0:54:19,000
understand that it can be complicated

1292
0:54:17.86,000 --> 0:54:21,000
and triggering for some people there's

1293
0:54:20.26,000 --> 0:54:25,000
someone who hears this right now and

1294
0:54:22.63,000 --> 0:54:27,000
wakes up tomorrow at 2:30 a.m.

1295
0:54:25.33,000 --> 0:54:28,000
pressing about the fact that they're not

1296
0:54:27.7,000 --> 0:54:29,000
getting enough sleep and what that may

1297
0:54:28.99,000 --> 0:54:31,000
be doing to them give them some

1298
0:54:30.64,000 --> 0:54:34,000
practical advice what should you do if

1299
0:54:32.95,000 --> 0:54:36,000
you wake up consumed with anxiety in the

1300
0:54:34.72,000 --> 0:54:39,000
middle of the night so there again I

1301
0:54:37.48,000 --> 0:54:43,000
think it's it's Reavers case of firstly

1302
0:54:40.06,000 --> 0:54:46,000
try not to worry about it too much being

1303
0:54:43.72,000 --> 0:54:49,000
kind and giving yourself the break from

1304
0:54:46.54,000 --> 0:54:52,000
sleep not sitting there tossing or lying

1305
0:54:50.35,000 --> 0:54:54,000
there and tossing and turning just

1306
0:54:52.81,000 --> 0:54:56,000
understand that tonight is not my night

1307
0:54:54.91,000 --> 0:54:58,000
perhaps I can just step away from sleep

1308
0:54:57.67,000 --> 0:55:02,000
let me get up

1309
0:54:59.17,000 --> 0:55:05,000
let me not continue to reinforce to my

1310
0:55:03.19,000 --> 0:55:05,000
brain that almost like a dentist's chair

1311
0:55:05.29,000 --> 0:55:07,000
when

1312
0:55:05.8,000 --> 0:55:09,000
go to a dentist sure I've typically

1313
0:55:07.72,000 --> 0:55:11,000
learned that things don't usually go

1314
0:55:10.45,000 --> 0:55:13,000
well there and because it's a

1315
0:55:12.1,000 --> 0:55:16,000
reinforcing sort of self-fulfilling

1316
0:55:13.99,000 --> 0:55:18,000
prophecy don't let the same thing happen

1317
0:55:16.54,000 --> 0:55:21,000
to your bed and the way that you can

1318
0:55:19.63,000 --> 0:55:23,000
prevent that is if you are struggling if

1319
0:55:21.79,000 --> 0:55:26,000
you are tossing turning the best advice

1320
0:55:24.22,000 --> 0:55:29,000
is get out of bed do something different

1321
0:55:26.89,000 --> 0:55:3,000
only return when you're sleepy and that

1322
0:55:29.26,000 --> 0:55:33,000
way gradually you'll feel better you'll

1323
0:55:31.09,000 --> 0:55:36,000
feel confident about your bedroom and

1324
0:55:33.73,000 --> 0:55:38,000
the bed being this place of restful

1325
0:55:36.24,000 --> 0:55:42,000
confidence ly rather than this trigger

1326
0:55:39.31,000 --> 0:55:44,000
for rumination anxiety and wakefulness

1327
0:55:42.81,000 --> 0:55:46,000
wonderful thank you Whitney

1328
0:55:45.12,000 --> 0:55:48,000
there are so many questions out there

1329
0:55:47.38,000 --> 0:55:5,000
are many of which we won't get to but we

1330
0:55:48.85,000 --> 0:55:51,000
should find a way to to get some of

1331
0:55:50.86,000 --> 0:55:53,000
these great questions in front of you

1332
0:55:52.36,000 --> 0:55:56,000
mat so that you can answer them but I

1333
0:55:54.13,000 --> 0:55:58,000
think the the one that I just like to

1334
0:55:56.41,000 --> 0:55:59,000
ask here is about physical exercise

1335
0:55:58.69,000 --> 0:56:02,000
we're seeing a lot of people just

1336
0:55:59.86,000 --> 0:56:03,000
wondering how they can use exercise to

1337
0:56:03.13,000 --> 0:56:08,000
help with their sleep

1338
0:56:04.83,000 --> 0:56:09,000
the relationship that I think is is

1339
0:56:08.44,000 --> 0:56:13,000
quite powerful we know that physical

1340
0:56:10.54,000 --> 0:56:16,000
activity during the day does seem to

1341
0:56:14.29,000 --> 0:56:2,000
have an improvement effect on your sleep

1342
0:56:17.08,000 --> 0:56:22,000
at night particularly in terms of the

1343
0:56:20.47,000 --> 0:56:23,000
quality of your sleep there is some

1344
0:56:22.93,000 --> 0:56:26,000
evidence that it can improve the

1345
0:56:24.25,000 --> 0:56:29,000
quantity of your sleep but physical

1346
0:56:27.37,000 --> 0:56:31,000
performance and physical activity or

1347
0:56:30.01,000 --> 0:56:34,000
even just necessarily it doesn't have to

1348
0:56:32.17,000 --> 0:56:36,000
be that you need to go out for a 10-mile

1349
0:56:34.33,000 --> 0:56:39,000
run even lower level of physical

1350
0:56:36.58,000 --> 0:56:41,000
activity beyond sort of 20 or 30 minutes

1351
0:56:39.37,000 --> 0:56:43,000
deems to have a beneficial impact on

1352
0:56:41.95,000 --> 0:56:45,000
subsequent sleep at night by the way the

1353
0:56:44.32,000 --> 0:56:48,000
relationship is also present in the

1354
0:56:46.18,000 --> 0:56:5,000
opposite direction when you start to

1355
0:56:48.34,000 --> 0:56:53,000
sleep well your motivation to actually

1356
0:56:51.13,000 --> 0:56:56,000
go out and exercise the next day is

1357
0:56:53.56,000 --> 0:56:59,000
increased and also your ability to

1358
0:56:56.26,000 --> 0:57:01,000
physically perform exercise is also

1359
0:56:59.68,000 --> 0:57:02,000
improved at a number of different levels

1360
0:57:01.69,000 --> 0:57:05,000
as well so there is that relationship

1361
0:57:03.61,000 --> 0:57:08,000
and it's actually bi-directional

1362
0:57:06.42,000 --> 0:57:1,000
wonderful and last question for me as

1363
0:57:08.62,000 --> 0:57:12,000
well I mean you started your TED talk

1364
0:57:10.45,000 --> 0:57:15,000
with a spectacular claim that lack of

1365
0:57:13.06,000 --> 0:57:17,000
sleep had a big impact on sexual

1366
0:57:15.88,000 --> 0:57:19,000
performance that if a man

1367
0:57:17.68,000 --> 0:57:24,000
does it go the other way is is good sex

1368
0:57:20.86,000 --> 0:57:26,000
also great for good sleep though there

1369
0:57:25,000 --> 0:57:31,000
is a little bit of evidence to suggest

1370
0:57:27.4,000 --> 0:57:34,000
that physical intimacy with your partner

1371
0:57:31.66,000 --> 0:57:36,000
in that regard can actually enhance your

1372
0:57:34.78,000 --> 0:57:39,000
sleep some of that I think is just

1373
0:57:37.63,000 --> 0:57:42,000
related to the relaxation that comes

1374
0:57:39.79,000 --> 0:57:44,000
after following that physical intimacy

1375
0:57:42.79,000 --> 0:57:46,000
that it ramps down the fight-or-flight

1376
0:57:45.01,000 --> 0:57:49,000
branch of the nervous system and you go

1377
0:57:46.96,000 --> 0:57:5,000
gradually into this more rep a sort of

1378
0:57:49.27,000 --> 0:57:53,000
relaxation stage of the nervous system

1379
0:57:51.3,000 --> 0:57:56,000
some of the hormones that are released

1380
0:57:53.32,000 --> 0:58:,000
in to be beneficial things such as

1381
0:57:56.46,000 --> 0:58:03,000
oxytocin and we also know just that

1382
0:58:00.97,000 --> 0:58:04,000
people who are having physical intimacy

1383
0:58:03.46,000 --> 0:58:08,000
with themselves should we say has been

1384
0:58:05.74,000 --> 0:58:1,000
used as a technique for dealing with

1385
0:58:08.62,000 --> 0:58:12,000
insomnia though there is a little bit of

1386
0:58:11.11,000 --> 0:58:16,000
evidence in that regard and certainly I

1387
0:58:13.39,000 --> 0:58:18,000
think if it's satisfying for all that's

1388
0:58:16.72,000 --> 0:58:2,000
when we typically see a good benefit

1389
0:58:18.81,000 --> 0:58:25,000
well now let them tell you that ted

1390
0:58:21.28,000 --> 0:58:28,000
conversations aren't practical delight

1391
0:58:26.11,000 --> 0:58:31,000
to have you here thank you so much for

1392
0:58:28.48,000 --> 0:58:33,000
this conversation and we may we may have

1393
0:58:32.08,000 --> 0:58:36,000
some other questions to put to you to

1394
0:58:33.58,000 --> 0:58:38,000
post on our blog or something like that

1395
0:58:36.13,000 --> 0:58:41,000
from from the many other people who had

1396
0:58:39.04,000 --> 0:58:43,000
questions but but really thank you thank

1397
0:58:41.5,000 --> 0:58:44,000
you so much you're very welcome and I'd

1398
0:58:43.51,000 --> 0:58:46,000
be delighted to try and offer any

1399
0:58:45.46,000 --> 0:58:48,000
ongoing health and I can respond to more

1400
0:58:47.5,000 --> 0:58:5,000
questions and thank you again for

1401
0:58:49.15,000 --> 0:58:54,000
hosting me both here and on the Ted

1402
0:58:51.37,000 --> 0:58:56,000
stage last year thank you thank you

1403
0:58:54.72,000 --> 0:58:58,000
thank you Whitney who do we have

1404
0:58:56.56,000 --> 0:59:01,000
anything to say about the rest of this

1405
0:58:58.81,000 --> 0:59:03,000
week which I guess that's right we have

1406
0:59:02.53,000 --> 0:59:06,000
one more one more day of interviews

1407
0:59:04.21,000 --> 0:59:09,000
tomorrow's interview is with Elizabeth

1408
0:59:06.64,000 --> 0:59:11,000
Gilbert the acclaimed author and she's

1409
0:59:09.64,000 --> 0:59:14,000
going to give us some tips on how we can

1410
0:59:12.15,000 --> 0:59:17,000
really work through feelings of

1411
0:59:15.63,000 --> 0:59:18,000
overwhelmed during this time which i

1412
0:59:17.83,000 --> 0:59:2,000
think is something that a lot of us

1413
0:59:19.26,000 --> 0:59:23,000
experienced at one point or another

1414
0:59:20.89,000 --> 0:59:24,000
perhaps in a sort of an ongoing way

1415
0:59:23.37,000 --> 0:59:27,000
depending on on what your circumstance

1416
0:59:25.69,000 --> 0:59:29,000
might be and so I think that'll be

1417
0:59:27.37,000 --> 0:59:3,000
really a great help for us as we round

1418
0:59:29.92,000 --> 0:59:32,000
out the week

1419
0:59:30.84,000 --> 0:59:36,000
you know the very first episode of the

1420
0:59:33.13,000 --> 0:59:4,000
Ted interview was with Liz Gilbert and I

1421
0:59:36.9,000 --> 0:59:41,000
I just I found it to be astonishing that

1422
0:59:40.66,000 --> 0:59:45,000
like really astonishing as she said in

1423
0:59:42.52,000 --> 0:59:48,000
that interview I'm not her demographic

1424
0:59:46.08,000 --> 0:59:53,000
most of her books the targeted women or

1425
0:59:49.23,000 --> 0:59:55,000
seem to have been better but the way she

1426
0:59:53.1,000 --> 0:59:59,000
describes the emotional landscape we all

1427
0:59:56.14,000 --> 1:00:01,000
are facing I just found it so so

1428
1:00:00.01,000 --> 1:00:04,000
profound and so I actually cannot wait

1429
1:00:02.109,000 --> 1:00:06,000
for the conversation with with Liz

1430
1:00:04.69,000 --> 1:00:06,000
tomorrow she's holed up by herself I

1431
1:00:06.43,000 --> 1:00:1,000
spoke with her a couple days ago

1432
1:00:07.51,000 --> 1:00:12,000
but she's ready to come and many

1433
1:00:11.32,000 --> 1:00:14,000
thoughts on how to make use at this time

1434
1:00:12.76,000 --> 1:00:16,000
how to navigate it but I think you're

1435
1:00:15.13,000 --> 1:00:21,000
really in for a treat and do do share

1436
1:00:17.68,000 --> 1:00:23,000
notice of of that conversation thank you

1437
1:00:22.03,000 --> 1:00:27,000
everyone for listening it means a lot to

1438
1:00:24.4,000 --> 1:00:3,000
us that you come spend this time with us

1439
1:00:27.19,000 --> 1:00:33,000
build community with us learn with us as

1440
1:00:30.4,000 --> 1:00:33,000
we said before we'll say again we're all

1441
1:00:33.31,000 --> 1:00:37,000
in this together

1442
1:00:34.38,000 --> 1:00:4,000
thank you madam Whitney thank you all I

1443
1:00:37.8,000 --> 1:00:4,000
carry one

1
0:00:12.49,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to tell you today about an orca named Tahlequah.

2
0:00:17.361,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Tahlequah is also known as J35 to scientists,

3
0:00:21.258,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because she swims with the J Pod in the Salish Sea.

4
0:00:24.685,000 --> 0:00:27,000
These are the waters off of British Columbia and Washington State.

5
0:00:28.987,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now, last year, in July 2018,

6
0:00:32.175,000 --> 0:00:36,000
she was well along in her 17-month pregnancy,

7
0:00:36.415,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and scientists were very excited

8
0:00:38.43,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because no baby had survived in this pod for three long years.

9
0:00:44.464,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, orcas are also known as killer whales.

10
0:00:47.455,000 --> 0:00:51,000
They're profoundly social and profoundly intelligent beings.

11
0:00:52.354,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And scientists are very interested in their behavior,

12
0:00:55.858,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because in their social networks, they share habits, information

13
0:00:59.66,000 --> 0:01:,000
and even affection.

14
0:01:00.882,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They create true cultures of the ocean.

15
0:01:04.839,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But this pod has been in trouble.

16
0:01:08.066,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor has been way down in the region,

17
0:01:12.747,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and pollution has been up.

18
0:01:15.344,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But on July 24th, Tahlequah gave birth to a daughter,

19
0:01:20.754,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and scientists were so excited by this development.

20
0:01:24.691,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But unfortunately, the same day -- in fact, shortly after birth --

21
0:01:28.69,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the calf died.

22
0:01:31.077,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Well, what happened next electrified animal lovers

23
0:01:34.146,000 --> 0:01:35,000
across the world,

24
0:01:35.818,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because Tahlequah refused to let her baby slip off into the water.

25
0:01:40.453,000 --> 0:01:43,000
She kept it on her body and she swam with it.

26
0:01:43.745,000 --> 0:01:47,000
If it did fall off, she would dive and rescue it,

27
0:01:47.902,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and she battled stiff currents to do this.

28
0:01:51.218,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, she kept this behavior up

29
0:01:53.395,000 --> 0:01:55,000
for 17 days,

30
0:01:56.116,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and during this time, she swam over 1,000 miles.

31
0:02:00.024,000 --> 0:02:03,000
At that point, she let the little baby slip off into the water.

32
0:02:04.876,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So today, Tahlequah swims on with the J Pod,

33
0:02:09.279,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but her grief still moves me.

34
0:02:12.597,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I do believe that "grief" is the right word to use.

35
0:02:16.2,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I believe that grief is the right word to use

36
0:02:18.834,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for numerous animals who mourn the dead.

37
0:02:21.798,000 --> 0:02:23,000
They may be friends or mates or relatives.

38
0:02:25.127,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Because these visible cues, these behavioral cues,

39
0:02:28.473,000 --> 0:02:31,000
tell us something about an animal's emotional state.

40
0:02:32.589,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, for the last seven years,

41
0:02:34.069,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I've been working to document examples of animal grief --

42
0:02:37.737,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in birds, in mammals,

43
0:02:39.899,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in domesticated animals and in wild animals --

44
0:02:42.899,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and I believe in the reality of animal grief.

45
0:02:46.89,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, I say it this way

46
0:02:48.447,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because I need to acknowledge to you right up front

47
0:02:50.906,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that not all scientists agree with me.

48
0:02:53.287,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And part of the reason, I think,

49
0:02:55.464,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is because of what I call the "a-word."

50
0:02:58.592,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The a-word is anthropomorphism,

51
0:03:00.375,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and historically, it's been a big deterrent

52
0:03:02.4,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to recognizing animal emotions.

53
0:03:05.095,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, anthropomorphism is when we project onto other animals

54
0:03:09.319,000 --> 0:03:11,000
our capacities or our emotions.

55
0:03:12.634,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And we can all probably think of examples of this.

56
0:03:16.193,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Let's say we have a friend who tells us,

57
0:03:18.565,000 --> 0:03:21,000
"My cat understands everything I say."

58
0:03:22.355,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Or, "My dog, he's so sweet.

59
0:03:25.195,000 --> 0:03:27,000
he ran right across the yard this morning towards a squirrel,

60
0:03:28.157,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I know he just wants to play."

61
0:03:30.435,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Well, maybe.

62
0:03:32.744,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Or maybe not.

63
0:03:33.933,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I'm skeptical about claims like those.

64
0:03:37.202,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But animal grief is different,

65
0:03:39.221,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because we're not trying to read an animal's mind.

66
0:03:42.111,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We're looking at visible cues of behavior

67
0:03:44.538,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and trying to interpret them with some meaning.

68
0:03:47.406,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, it's true -- scientists often push back at me,

69
0:03:50.313,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and they'll say,

70
0:03:51.489,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"Ah, look, the animal might be stressed,

71
0:03:53.757,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or maybe the animal's just confused

72
0:03:55.558,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because his or her routine has been disrupted."

73
0:03:58.935,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But I think that this overworry about anthropomorphism

74
0:04:03.301,000 --> 0:04:05,000
misses a fundamental point.

75
0:04:05.828,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And that is that animals can care very deeply for each other,

76
0:04:09.659,000 --> 0:04:1,000
maybe they even love each other.

77
0:04:11.376,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And when they do,

78
0:04:12.763,000 --> 0:04:15,000
a survivor's heart can be pierced by a death.

79
0:04:17.013,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Let's face it:

80
0:04:18.274,000 --> 0:04:2,000
if we deny evolutionary continuity,

81
0:04:21.107,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we are really missing out on embracing part of ourselves.

82
0:04:25.603,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So yes, I believe in the reality of animal grief,

83
0:04:28.294,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and I also think that if we recognize it,

84
0:04:30.797,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we can make the world a better place for animals,

85
0:04:33.467,000 --> 0:04:35,000
a kinder place for animals.

86
0:04:36.362,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So let me tell you a little bit more about animal grief.

87
0:04:40.341,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I'm going to start in Kenya.

88
0:04:43.027,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You see here there's an elephant named Eleanor

89
0:04:45.979,000 --> 0:04:47,000
who came one day with bruised legs,

90
0:04:48.981,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and she collapsed.

91
0:04:50.886,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You see on the left

92
0:04:52.107,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that another female named Grace came to her right away

93
0:04:55.868,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and, using her own trunk, propped her up,

94
0:04:58.395,000 --> 0:04:59,000
tried to get her up on her feet.

95
0:05:00.207,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And she did succeed,

96
0:05:01.426,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but then Eleanor collapsed again.

97
0:05:04.236,000 --> 0:05:07,000
At this point, Grace became visibly distressed,

98
0:05:07.634,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and she prodded the body, and she vocalized.

99
0:05:11.906,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Eleanor collapsed again,

100
0:05:13.321,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and unfortunately, she did die.

101
0:05:16.036,000 --> 0:05:2,000
What you see on the right is a female from another family named Maui,

102
0:05:20.705,000 --> 0:05:22,000
who came after the death, and she stayed at the body.

103
0:05:23.602,000 --> 0:05:26,000
She held a vigil there, and she even rocked in distress

104
0:05:27.038,000 --> 0:05:28,000
over the body.

105
0:05:28.664,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So the scientists watching the elephants

106
0:05:31.191,000 --> 0:05:34,000
kept close observation on Eleanor's body

107
0:05:34.679,000 --> 0:05:35,000
for seven days.

108
0:05:36.308,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And during those seven days,

109
0:05:37.818,000 --> 0:05:39,000
a parade of elephants came

110
0:05:39.893,000 --> 0:05:4,000
from five different families.

111
0:05:42.266,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, some were just curious,

112
0:05:44.215,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but others carried out behaviors

113
0:05:45.781,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that I really believe should be classified as grief.

114
0:05:50.447,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So what does grief look like?

115
0:05:52.87,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It can be rocking, as I said, in distress.

116
0:05:55.916,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It can also be social withdrawal,

117
0:05:57.85,000 --> 0:06:01,000
when an animal just takes himself or herself away from friends

118
0:06:01.919,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and stays by themselves,

119
0:06:04.53,000 --> 0:06:06,000
or a failure to eat or sleep properly,

120
0:06:07.165,000 --> 0:06:1,000
sometimes a depressed posture or vocalization.

121
0:06:11.311,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It can be very helpful for those of us studying this

122
0:06:14.229,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to be able to compare the behavior of a survivor before death

123
0:06:18.607,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and after death,

124
0:06:19.852,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because that increases the rigor of our interpretation.

125
0:06:23.722,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I can explain this to you

126
0:06:25.15,000 --> 0:06:29,000
by talking about two ducks named Harper and Kohl.

127
0:06:30.217,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So we're into birds now.

128
0:06:32.403,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So Harper and Kohl were raised at a foie gras factory,

129
0:06:35.645,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and they were treated cruelly.

130
0:06:37.61,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Foie gras does involve force-feeding of birds.

131
0:06:40.971,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So this hurt their bodies, and their spirits were not in good shape, either.

132
0:06:44.662,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But thankfully, they were rescued by a farm sanctuary in upstate New York.

133
0:06:49.348,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And for four years, they stabilized, and they were fast friends.

134
0:06:53.087,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They often took themselves to a small pond on the property.

135
0:06:57.711,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Then, Kohl started to have really intractable pain in his legs,

136
0:07:01.785,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and it was clear to the sanctuary that he had to be euthanized humanely,

137
0:07:05.888,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and he was.

138
0:07:07.341,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But then the sanctuary workers did a brilliant thing,

139
0:07:09.952,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because they brought Harper to the body to see.

140
0:07:14.015,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And at first, Harper prodded the body of his friend,

141
0:07:17.074,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but then he laid himself over it,

142
0:07:20.327,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and he stayed there for over an hour with his friend.

143
0:07:23.996,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And in the weeks after,

144
0:07:26.961,000 --> 0:07:27,000
he had a hard time.

145
0:07:28.681,000 --> 0:07:31,000
He would go back to that same pond where he had been with Kohl,

146
0:07:31.853,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and he didn't want any other friends.

147
0:07:34.536,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And within two months, he died as well.

148
0:07:38.307,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now, I'm happy to say

149
0:07:39.637,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that not all grieving animals have this sorrowful outcome.

150
0:07:43.482,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Last summer, I flew to Boston to visit my adult daughter, Sarah.

151
0:07:48.375,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I was with my husband Charlie.

152
0:07:49.912,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I really needed a break from work.

153
0:07:53.508,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But I succumbed, and I checked my work email.

154
0:07:57.006,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You know how that is.

155
0:07:58.187,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And there was a communication about a dejected donkey.

156
0:08:03.153,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, as an anthropologist, this wasn't what I expected,

157
0:08:05.872,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but there it was, and I'm glad I read it.

158
0:08:07.924,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Because a donkey named Lena had gone to another farm sanctuary,

159
0:08:12.11,000 --> 0:08:14,000
this one in Alberta, Canada,

160
0:08:14.328,000 --> 0:08:16,000
as the only donkey there,

161
0:08:17.15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and had trouble making friends for that reason.

162
0:08:19.864,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But she eventually did make friends with an older horse named Jake,

163
0:08:23.091,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and for three years they were inseparable.

164
0:08:26.109,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But the reason the email came was that Jake, at age 32, the horse,

165
0:08:30.007,000 --> 0:08:33,000
had become gravely ill and had to be put down,

166
0:08:33.765,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and this is what was going on.

167
0:08:36.852,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is Lena standing on Jake's grave.

168
0:08:39.447,000 --> 0:08:42,000
She didn't want to come in at night. She didn't want to come in for food.

169
0:08:42.947,000 --> 0:08:43,000
She didn't want to come in for water.

170
0:08:44.826,000 --> 0:08:46,000
She pawed at the grave, she brayed in distress,

171
0:08:47.835,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and there she stood.

172
0:08:50.292,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So we talked and we brainstormed.

173
0:08:52.794,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What do you do for an animal like this?

174
0:08:55.18,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And we talked about the role of time,

175
0:08:57.519,000 --> 0:08:59,000
of extra love and kindness from people

176
0:09:00.21,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and of urging her to make a new friend.

177
0:09:03.048,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And here's where her trajectory does diverge from that of Harper the duck,

178
0:09:07.797,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because she did make a new friend,

179
0:09:09.722,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and sanctuary workers wrote back and said it worked out well.

180
0:09:14.052,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now sometimes, scientists supplement observation

181
0:09:17.501,000 --> 0:09:18,000
with hormonal analysis.

182
0:09:19.976,000 --> 0:09:21,000
There's an example of a group of scientists in Botswana,

183
0:09:22.831,000 --> 0:09:26,000
who took fecal material from baboons and compared two different groups.

184
0:09:27.404,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The first group were females who had witnessed a predator attack

185
0:09:31.536,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and lost someone in that attack,

186
0:09:34.049,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and the second group were females who had witnessed an attack

187
0:09:36.932,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but had not lost someone.

188
0:09:38.745,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And the stress hormones were way up in that first group.

189
0:09:41.895,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But here's the thing:

190
0:09:43.161,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the scientists didn't just call them "stressed baboons,"

191
0:09:45.924,000 --> 0:09:47,000
they called them "bereaved baboons,"

192
0:09:48.175,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and in part, that's because of the observations that they made.

193
0:09:52.184,000 --> 0:09:54,000
For example, this mother-daughter pair were very close,

194
0:09:55.178,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and then the daughter was killed by a lion.

195
0:09:58.118,000 --> 0:10:,000
The mother removed herself from all her friends,

196
0:10:00.828,000 --> 0:10:03,000
from her grooming networks, and just stayed by herself for weeks --

197
0:10:05.298,000 --> 0:10:06,000
bereavement --

198
0:10:06.75,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and she then slowly recovered.

199
0:10:11.055,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So we have bereaved baboons.

200
0:10:13.918,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Will science tell us someday about bereaved bees?

201
0:10:17.752,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Will we hear about frogs who mourn?

202
0:10:21.443,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I don't think so, and I think the reason is because animals really need

203
0:10:25.027,000 --> 0:10:28,000
one-to-one, close relationships for that to happen.

204
0:10:28.763,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I also know that circumstance matters, and personality matters.

205
0:10:33.389,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I have documented cats and dogs who grieve,

206
0:10:36.151,000 --> 0:10:37,000
our companion animals,

207
0:10:38.005,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but I also interacted with a woman who was extremely bothered

208
0:10:40.928,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because her dog wasn't grieving.

209
0:10:43.888,000 --> 0:10:46,000
She said to me, "The first dog in the house has died.

210
0:10:47.075,000 --> 0:10:5,000
The second animal does not seem concerned, the second dog.

211
0:10:50.157,000 --> 0:10:51,000
What is wrong with him?"

212
0:10:51.894,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:53.366,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And as I listened to her,

214
0:10:55.416,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I realized that this dog was now the only animal in the household,

215
0:10:59.139,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and as far as he was concerned, that was a pretty good deal.

216
0:11:03.079,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So circumstances matter.

217
0:11:06.716,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Now, in any case, animals are not going to grieve

218
0:11:09.406,000 --> 0:11:1,000
exactly like we do.

219
0:11:11.279,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We have human creativity.

220
0:11:13.06,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We paint our grief, dance our grief,

221
0:11:16.737,000 --> 0:11:17,000
write our grief.

222
0:11:18.562,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We also can grieve for people we've never met,

223
0:11:21.459,000 --> 0:11:23,000
across space and time.

224
0:11:23.53,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin

225
0:11:26.215,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial.

226
0:11:29.428,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Animals don't grieve exactly like we do,

227
0:11:31.764,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but this doesn't mean that their grief isn't real.

228
0:11:34.54,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It is real, and it's searing,

229
0:11:37.681,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and we can see it if we choose.

230
0:11:41.495,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Now, I've lost both my parents.

231
0:11:43.935,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I lost a very dear friend at a young age from AIDS.

232
0:11:48.22,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I believe most likely most of you here have lost someone.

233
0:11:52.958,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And I have found it a genuine comfort,

234
0:11:56.068,000 --> 0:12:,000
a solace, to know that we aren't the only beings on this earth

235
0:12:00.83,000 --> 0:12:02,000
who feel love and grief.

236
0:12:04.058,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And I think this is important.

237
0:12:06.173,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I also think we can take this a step further,

238
0:12:08.61,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and we can realize that the reality of animal grief

239
0:12:11.398,000 --> 0:12:14,000
can help us be better and do better for animals.

240
0:12:15.295,000 --> 0:12:17,000
This is already happening with Tahlequah,

241
0:12:17.822,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because the United States and Canada have renewed their talks with greater urgency

242
0:12:22.957,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for how to help the orcas,

243
0:12:24.505,000 --> 0:12:26,000
how to restore the Chinook salmon

244
0:12:26.582,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and how to help with the water pollution.

245
0:12:29.057,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We can also see that if grief is real,

246
0:12:31.809,000 --> 0:12:33,000
there's tremendous plausibility to the notion

247
0:12:34.383,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that animals feel a whole range of things.

248
0:12:37.868,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So we could look at joy, sadness, even hope.

249
0:12:42.292,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And if we do that,

250
0:12:44.248,000 --> 0:12:46,000
here's how we can start to think about the world.

251
0:12:46.559,000 --> 0:12:48,000
We can look at orcas and say,

252
0:12:48.962,000 --> 0:12:5,000
we know they grieve, we know they feel their lives,

253
0:12:51.692,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and we can refuse to confine them to small tanks in theme parks

254
0:12:57.133,000 --> 0:13:,000
and make them perform for our entertainment.

255
0:13:00.336,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Applause)

256
0:13:02.519,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

257
0:13:04.833,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We can look at elephants and say, yes, they grieve,

258
0:13:07.908,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and we can renew our efforts against international trophy hunting

259
0:13:11.676,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and against poaching.

260
0:13:13.239,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Applause)

261
0:13:15.301,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Thank you.

262
0:13:16.879,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And we can look at our closest living relatives, monkeys and apes,

263
0:13:20.319,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and know yes they grieve, they feel their lives,

264
0:13:23.309,000 --> 0:13:25,000
so they don't deserve to be confined

265
0:13:25.83,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in highly invasive biomedical experiments

266
0:13:29.163,000 --> 0:13:3,000
year after year.

267
0:13:31.393,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And, you know --

268
0:13:32.57,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Applause)

269
0:13:33.832,000 --> 0:13:36,000
the ducks Harper and Kohl, they tell us something too.

270
0:13:37.334,000 --> 0:13:4,000
They help us connect the dots and realize that what we eat

271
0:13:41.004,000 --> 0:13:43,000
affects how animals live.

272
0:13:43.27,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And it's not just foie gras, and it's not just ducks.

273
0:13:46.79,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We can think about pigs and chickens and cows in factory farms,

274
0:13:52.258,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and we can know.

275
0:13:53.44,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I can tell you the science is real that these animals feel, too.

276
0:13:57.412,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So every single time we choose a plant-based meal,

277
0:14:01.956,000 --> 0:14:04,000
we are contributing to reducing animal suffering.

278
0:14:06.379,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Applause)

279
0:14:09.294,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So yes, I believe in the reality of animal grief.

280
0:14:13.953,000 --> 0:14:15,000
I believe in the reality of animal love,

281
0:14:16.162,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and I think it is time for us humans

282
0:14:18.696,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to recognize that we don't own these things.

283
0:14:21.836,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And when we see that,

284
0:14:23.39,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we have an opportunity to make the world so much better for animals,

285
0:14:27.228,000 --> 0:14:29,000
a kinder world, a gentler world,

286
0:14:29.555,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and along the way, we might just save ourselves, too.

287
0:14:34.076,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Thank you so much.

288
0:14:35.592,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

289
0:14:37.217,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Thank you. Thank you.

290
0:14:39.004,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Applause)

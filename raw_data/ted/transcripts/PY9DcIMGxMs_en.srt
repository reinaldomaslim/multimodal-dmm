1
0:00:12.597,000 --> 0:00:13,000
One of my earliest memories

2
0:00:14.362,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is of trying to wake up one of my relatives and not being able to.

3
0:00:17.482,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And I was just a little kid, so I didn't really understand why,

4
0:00:20.459,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but as I got older,

5
0:00:21.793,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I realized we had drug addiction in my family,

6
0:00:23.96,000 --> 0:00:24,000
including later cocaine addiction.

7
0:00:25.818,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd been thinking about it a lot lately, partly because it's now exactly 100 years

8
0:00:30.621,000 --> 0:00:33,000
since drugs were first banned in the United States and Britain,

9
0:00:33.691,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and we then imposed that on the rest of the world.

10
0:00:36.23,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's a century since we made this really fateful decision

11
0:00:39.75,000 --> 0:00:43,000
to take addicts and punish them and make them suffer,

12
0:00:43.827,000 --> 0:00:47,000
because we believed that would deter them; it would give them an incentive to stop.

13
0:00:48.238,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And a few years ago, I was looking at some of the addicts in my life who I love,

14
0:00:53.231,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and trying to figure out if there was some way to help them.

15
0:00:56.644,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I realized there were loads of incredibly basic questions

16
0:00:59.918,000 --> 0:01:,000
I just didn't know the answer to,

17
0:01:01.752,000 --> 0:01:03,000
like, what really causes addiction?

18
0:01:04.192,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Why do we carry on with this approach that doesn't seem to be working,

19
0:01:07.632,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and is there a better way out there that we could try instead?

20
0:01:10.561,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So I read loads of stuff about it,

21
0:01:12.275,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I couldn't really find the answers I was looking for,

22
0:01:14.966,000 --> 0:01:17,000
so I thought, okay, I'll go and sit with different people around the world

23
0:01:18.526,000 --> 0:01:19,000
who lived this and studied this

24
0:01:20.214,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and talk to them and see if I could learn from them.

25
0:01:22.779,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I didn't realize I would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start,

26
0:01:26.28,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but I ended up going and meeting loads of different people,

27
0:01:29.188,000 --> 0:01:31,000
from a transgender crack dealer in Brownsville, Brooklyn,

28
0:01:31.967,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses

29
0:01:35.545,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to see if they like them --

30
0:01:36.855,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it turns out they do, but only in very specific circumstances --

31
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to the only country that's ever decriminalized all drugs,

32
0:01:42.755,000 --> 0:01:44,000
from cannabis to crack, Portugal.

33
0:01:45.134,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And the thing I realized that really blew my mind is,

34
0:01:47.735,000 --> 0:01:5,000
almost everything we think we know about addiction is wrong,

35
0:01:51.543,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and if we start to absorb the new evidence about addiction,

36
0:01:54.654,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I think we're going to have to change a lot more than our drug policies.

37
0:01:58.1,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But let's start with what we think we know, what I thought I knew.

38
0:02:01.525,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Let's think about this middle row here.

39
0:02:03.63,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Imagine all of you, for 20 days now, went off and used heroin three times a day.

40
0:02:07.416,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Some of you look a little more enthusiastic than others at this prospect.

41
0:02:10.885,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:11.914,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Don't worry, it's just a thought experiment.

43
0:02:14.18,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Imagine you did that, right?

44
0:02:16.243,000 --> 0:02:17,000
What would happen?

45
0:02:17.428,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, we have a story about what would happen that we've been told for a century.

46
0:02:21.245,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We think, because there are chemical hooks in heroin,

47
0:02:23.766,000 --> 0:02:24,000
as you took it for a while,

48
0:02:25.553,000 --> 0:02:27,000
your body would become dependent on those hooks,

49
0:02:28.131,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you'd start to physically need them,

50
0:02:29.919,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and at the end of those 20 days, you'd all be heroin addicts. Right?

51
0:02:33.267,000 --> 0:02:34,000
That's what I thought.

52
0:02:34.523,000 --> 0:02:37,000
First thing that alerted me to the fact that something's not right with this story

53
0:02:38.405,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is when it was explained to me.

54
0:02:40.083,000 --> 0:02:43,000
If I step out of this TED Talk today and I get hit by a car and I break my hip,

55
0:02:43.822,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I'll be taken to hospital and I'll be given loads of diamorphine.

56
0:02:47.159,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Diamorphine is heroin.

57
0:02:48.745,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's actually much better heroin than you're going to buy on the streets,

58
0:02:52.203,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because the stuff you buy from a drug dealer is contaminated.

59
0:02:55.159,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Actually, very little of it is heroin,

60
0:02:57.007,000 --> 0:02:59,000
whereas the stuff you get from the doctor is medically pure.

61
0:02:59.847,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And you'll be given it for quite a long period of time.

62
0:03:02.443,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There are loads of people in this room,

63
0:03:04.325,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you may not realize it, you've taken quite a lot of heroin.

64
0:03:07.31,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And anyone who is watching this anywhere in the world, this is happening.

65
0:03:10.887,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And if what we believe about addiction is right --

66
0:03:13.264,000 --> 0:03:15,000
those people are exposed to all those chemical hooks --

67
0:03:15.86,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What should happen? They should become addicts.

68
0:03:18.094,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This has been studied really carefully.

69
0:03:20.06,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It doesn't happen; you will have noticed if your grandmother had a hip replacement,

70
0:03:23.989,000 --> 0:03:25,000
she didn't come out as a junkie. (Laughter)

71
0:03:26.037,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And when I learned this, it seemed so weird to me,

72
0:03:29.65,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so contrary to everything I'd been told, everything I thought I knew,

73
0:03:33.18,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I just thought it couldn't be right, until I met a man called Bruce Alexander.

74
0:03:36.995,000 --> 0:03:38,000
He's a professor of psychology in Vancouver

75
0:03:39.617,000 --> 0:03:4,000
who carried out an incredible experiment

76
0:03:41.556,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I think really helps us to understand this issue.

77
0:03:43.942,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Professor Alexander explained to me,

78
0:03:45.704,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the idea of addiction we've all got in our heads, that story,

79
0:03:48.665,000 --> 0:03:5,000
comes partly from a series of experiments

80
0:03:50.716,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that were done earlier in the 20th century.

81
0:03:52.826,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They're really simple.

82
0:03:54.156,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You can do them tonight at home if you feel a little sadistic.

83
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
You get a rat and you put it in a cage, and you give it two water bottles:

84
0:04:00.741,000 --> 0:04:03,000
One is just water, and the other is water laced with either heroin or cocaine.

85
0:04:04.509,000 --> 0:04:07,000
If you do that, the rat will almost always prefer the drug water

86
0:04:07.541,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and almost always kill itself quite quickly.

87
0:04:09.703,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So there you go, right? That's how we think it works.

88
0:04:12.204,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In the '70s, Professor Alexander comes along and he looks at this experiment

89
0:04:15.8,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and he noticed something.

90
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:19,000
He said ah, we're putting the rat in an empty cage.

91
0:04:19.583,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's got nothing to do except use these drugs.

92
0:04:21.84,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Let's try something different.

93
0:04:23.379,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So Professor Alexander built a cage that he called "Rat Park,"

94
0:04:26.331,000 --> 0:04:28,000
which is basically heaven for rats.

95
0:04:28.871,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They've got loads of cheese, they've got loads of colored balls,

96
0:04:31.974,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they've got loads of tunnels.

97
0:04:33.382,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Crucially, they've got loads of friends. They can have loads of sex.

98
0:04:36.597,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And they've got both the water bottles, the normal water and the drugged water.

99
0:04:41.411,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But here's the fascinating thing:

100
0:04:44.12,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In Rat Park, they don't like the drug water.

101
0:04:47.602,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They almost never use it.

102
0:04:49.315,000 --> 0:04:51,000
None of them ever use it compulsively.

103
0:04:51.892,000 --> 0:04:52,000
None of them ever overdose.

104
0:04:53.317,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You go from almost 100 percent overdose when they're isolated

105
0:04:56.731,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to zero percent overdose when they have happy and connected lives.

106
0:04:59.981,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now, when he first saw this, Professor Alexander thought,

107
0:05:03.251,000 --> 0:05:06,000
maybe this is just a thing about rats, they're quite different to us.

108
0:05:06.514,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Maybe not as different as we'd like, but, you know --

109
0:05:09.015,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But fortunately, there was a human experiment

110
0:05:11.15,000 --> 0:05:14,000
into the exact same principle happening at the exact same time.

111
0:05:14.279,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It was called the Vietnam War.

112
0:05:16.281,000 --> 0:05:2,000
In Vietnam, 20 percent of all American troops were using loads of heroin,

113
0:05:20.888,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and if you look at the news reports from the time,

114
0:05:23.52,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they were really worried, because they thought, my God, we're going to have

115
0:05:27.202,000 --> 0:05:3,000
hundreds of thousands of junkies on the streets of the United States

116
0:05:30.426,000 --> 0:05:31,000
when the war ends; it made total sense.

117
0:05:32.366,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, those soldiers who were using loads of heroin were followed home.

118
0:05:35.676,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The Archives of General Psychiatry did a really detailed study,

119
0:05:38.654,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and what happened to them?

120
0:05:40.582,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It turns out they didn't go to rehab. They didn't go into withdrawal.

121
0:05:44.166,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Ninety-five percent of them just stopped.

122
0:05:47.476,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, if you believe the story about chemical hooks,

123
0:05:49.901,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that makes absolutely no sense, but Professor Alexander began to think

124
0:05:53.389,000 --> 0:05:55,000
there might be a different story about addiction.

125
0:05:55.72,000 --> 0:05:57,000
He said, what if addiction isn't about your chemical hooks?

126
0:05:58.585,000 --> 0:06:,000
What if addiction is about your cage?

127
0:06:01.255,000 --> 0:06:04,000
What if addiction is an adaptation to your environment?

128
0:06:04.393,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Looking at this,

129
0:06:05.547,000 --> 0:06:08,000
there was another professor called Peter Cohen in the Netherlands

130
0:06:08.669,000 --> 0:06:1,000
who said, maybe we shouldn't even call it addiction.

131
0:06:11.14,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Maybe we should call it bonding.

132
0:06:12.888,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Human beings have a natural and innate need to bond,

133
0:06:15.811,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and when we're happy and healthy, we'll bond and connect with each other,

134
0:06:19.389,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but if you can't do that,

135
0:06:22.043,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because you're traumatized or isolated or beaten down by life,

136
0:06:25.867,000 --> 0:06:28,000
you will bond with something that will give you some sense of relief.

137
0:06:29.19,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now, that might be gambling, that might be pornography,

138
0:06:31.786,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that might be cocaine, that might be cannabis,

139
0:06:33.962,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but you will bond and connect with something because that's our nature.

140
0:06:37.616,000 --> 0:06:39,000
That's what we want as human beings.

141
0:06:40.356,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And at first, I found this quite a difficult thing to get my head around,

142
0:06:43.868,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but one way that helped me to think about it is,

143
0:06:46.323,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I can see, I've got over by my seat a bottle of water, right?

144
0:06:49.736,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I'm looking at lots of you, and lots of you have bottles of water with you.

145
0:06:53.284,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Forget the drugs. Forget the drug war.

146
0:06:55.123,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Totally legally, all of those bottles of water could be bottles of vodka, right?

147
0:06:59.79,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We could all be getting drunk -- I might after this -- (Laughter) --

148
0:07:03.5,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but we're not.

149
0:07:04.676,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, because you've been able to afford the approximately gazillion pounds

150
0:07:08.177,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that it costs to get into a TED Talk, I'm guessing you guys could afford

151
0:07:11.582,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to be drinking vodka for the next six months.

152
0:07:13.96,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You wouldn't end up homeless.

153
0:07:15.931,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You're not going to do that, and the reason you're not going to do that

154
0:07:19.556,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is not because anyone's stopping you.

155
0:07:21.459,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's because you've got bonds and connections

156
0:07:23.676,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that you want to be present for.

157
0:07:25.224,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You've got work you love. You've got people you love.

158
0:07:27.725,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You've got healthy relationships.

159
0:07:29.77,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And a core part of addiction,

160
0:07:32.44,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I came to think, and I believe the evidence suggests,

161
0:07:34.941,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is about not being able to bear to be present in your life.

162
0:07:38.779,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, this has really significant implications.

163
0:07:41.142,000 --> 0:07:44,000
The most obvious implications are for the War on Drugs.

164
0:07:44.3,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In Arizona, I went out with a group of women

165
0:07:47.86,000 --> 0:07:5,000
who were made to wear t-shirts saying, "I was a drug addict,"

166
0:07:51.718,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and go out on chain gangs and dig graves while members of the public jeer at them,

167
0:07:56.495,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and when those women get out of prison, they're going to have criminal records

168
0:08:00.195,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that mean they'll never work in the legal economy again.

169
0:08:02.839,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, that's a very extreme example, obviously, in the case of the chain gang,

170
0:08:06.56,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but actually almost everywhere in the world

171
0:08:08.65,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we treat addicts to some degree like that.

172
0:08:10.674,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We punish them. We shame them. We give them criminal records.

173
0:08:13.556,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We put barriers between them reconnecting.

174
0:08:16.315,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There was a doctor in Canada, Dr. Gabor Maté, an amazing man,

175
0:08:19.318,000 --> 0:08:22,000
who said to me, if you wanted to design a system that would make addiction worse,

176
0:08:23.213,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you would design that system.

177
0:08:24.844,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, there's a place that decided to do the exact opposite,

178
0:08:27.724,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I went there to see how it worked.

179
0:08:29.581,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In the year 2000, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe.

180
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
One percent of the population was addicted to heroin, which is kind of mind-blowing,

181
0:08:36.999,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and every year, they tried the American way more and more.

182
0:08:39.791,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They punished people and stigmatized them and shamed them more,

183
0:08:42.768,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and every year, the problem got worse.

184
0:08:44.611,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And one day, the Prime Minister and the leader of the opposition got together,

185
0:08:48.346,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and basically said, look, we can't go on

186
0:08:50.349,000 --> 0:08:53,000
with a country where we're having ever more people becoming heroin addicts.

187
0:08:53.902,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Let's set up a panel of scientists and doctors

188
0:08:56.085,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to figure out what would genuinely solve the problem.

189
0:08:58.591,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And they set up a panel led by an amazing man called Dr. João Goulão,

190
0:09:01.864,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to look at all this new evidence,

191
0:09:03.514,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and they came back and they said,

192
0:09:05.11,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"Decriminalize all drugs from cannabis to crack, but" --

193
0:09:09.43,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and this is the crucial next step --

194
0:09:11.724,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"take all the money we used to spend on cutting addicts off,

195
0:09:15.369,000 --> 0:09:16,000
on disconnecting them,

196
0:09:16.79,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and spend it instead on reconnecting them with society."

197
0:09:20.454,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And that's not really what we think of as drug treatment

198
0:09:25.05,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in the United States and Britain.

199
0:09:26.932,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So they do do residential rehab,

200
0:09:28.537,000 --> 0:09:3,000
they do psychological therapy, that does have some value.

201
0:09:31.369,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But the biggest thing they did was the complete opposite of what we do:

202
0:09:34.776,000 --> 0:09:36,000
a massive program of job creation for addicts,

203
0:09:37.294,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and microloans for addicts to set up small businesses.

204
0:09:39.914,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So say you used to be a mechanic.

205
0:09:41.579,000 --> 0:09:43,000
When you're ready, they'll go to a garage, and they'll say,

206
0:09:44.4,000 --> 0:09:46,000
if you employ this guy for a year, we'll pay half his wages.

207
0:09:47.311,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The goal was to make sure that every addict in Portugal

208
0:09:50.068,000 --> 0:09:52,000
had something to get out of bed for in the morning.

209
0:09:52.473,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And when I went and met the addicts in Portugal,

210
0:09:55.668,000 --> 0:09:57,000
what they said is, as they rediscovered purpose,

211
0:09:57.946,000 --> 0:10:,000
they rediscovered bonds and relationships with the wider society.

212
0:10:01.075,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It'll be 15 years this year since that experiment began,

213
0:10:03.719,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the results are in:

214
0:10:05.386,000 --> 0:10:06,000
injecting drug use is down in Portugal,

215
0:10:07.268,000 --> 0:10:09,000
according to the British Journal of Criminology,

216
0:10:09.883,000 --> 0:10:11,000
by 50 percent, five-zero percent.

217
0:10:12.47,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Overdose is massively down, HIV is massively down among addicts.

218
0:10:16.17,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Addiction in every study is significantly down.

219
0:10:18.545,000 --> 0:10:21,000
One of the ways you know it's worked so well is that almost nobody in Portugal

220
0:10:22.408,000 --> 0:10:23,000
wants to go back to the old system.

221
0:10:24.113,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, that's the political implications.

222
0:10:26.001,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I actually think there's a layer of implications

223
0:10:29.024,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to all this research below that.

224
0:10:30.684,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We live in a culture where people feel really increasingly vulnerable

225
0:10:33.97,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to all sorts of addictions, whether it's to their smartphones

226
0:10:36.95,000 --> 0:10:37,000
or to shopping or to eating.

227
0:10:38.308,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Before these talks began -- you guys know this --

228
0:10:40.639,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we were told we weren't allowed to have our smartphones on,

229
0:10:43.503,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and I have to say, a lot of you looked an awful lot like

230
0:10:46.148,000 --> 0:10:48,000
addicts who were told their dealer was going to be unavailable

231
0:10:49.157,000 --> 0:10:5,000
for the next couple of hours. (Laughter)

232
0:10:51.086,000 --> 0:10:53,000
A lot of us feel like that, and it might sound weird to say,

233
0:10:53.957,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I've been talking about how disconnection is a major driver of addiction

234
0:10:57.374,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and weird to say it's growing,

235
0:10:58.827,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because you think we're the most connected society that's ever been, surely.

236
0:11:02.423,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But I increasingly began to think that the connections we have

237
0:11:05.48,000 --> 0:11:08,000
or think we have, are like a kind of parody of human connection.

238
0:11:08.504,000 --> 0:11:1,000
If you have a crisis in your life, you'll notice something.

239
0:11:11.365,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It won't be your Twitter followers who come to sit with you.

240
0:11:14.299,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It won't be your Facebook friends who help you turn it round.

241
0:11:17.181,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It'll be your flesh and blood friends who you have deep and nuanced

242
0:11:20.348,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and textured, face-to-face relationships with,

243
0:11:22.614,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and there's a study I learned about from Bill McKibben, the environmental writer,

244
0:11:27.173,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that I think tells us a lot about this.

245
0:11:29.38,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It looked at the number of close friends the average American believes

246
0:11:32.778,000 --> 0:11:33,000
they can call on in a crisis.

247
0:11:34.729,000 --> 0:11:36,000
That number has been declining steadily since the 1950s.

248
0:11:37.747,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The amount of floor space an individual has in their home

249
0:11:40.621,000 --> 0:11:42,000
has been steadily increasing,

250
0:11:42.688,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and I think that's like a metaphor

251
0:11:44.592,000 --> 0:11:45,000
for the choice we've made as a culture.

252
0:11:46.474,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We've traded floorspace for friends, we've traded stuff for connections,

253
0:11:51.349,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and the result is we are one of the loneliest societies there has ever been.

254
0:11:54.97,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And Bruce Alexander, the guy who did the Rat Park experiment, says,

255
0:11:58.161,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we talk all the time in addiction about individual recovery,

256
0:12:01.732,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and it's right to talk about that,

257
0:12:03.659,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but we need to talk much more about social recovery.

258
0:12:06.214,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Something's gone wrong with us, not just with individuals but as a group,

259
0:12:09.867,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and we've created a society where, for a lot of us,

260
0:12:12.3,000 --> 0:12:14,000
life looks a whole lot more like that isolated cage

261
0:12:14.785,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and a whole lot less like Rat Park.

262
0:12:16.856,000 --> 0:12:19,000
If I'm honest, this isn't why I went into it.

263
0:12:19.912,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I didn't go in to the discover the political stuff, the social stuff.

264
0:12:23.242,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I wanted to know how to help the people I love.

265
0:12:25.605,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And when I came back from this long journey and I'd learned all this,

266
0:12:28.868,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I looked at the addicts in my life,

267
0:12:31.6,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and if you're really candid, it's hard loving an addict,

268
0:12:36.13,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and there's going to be lots of people who know in this room.

269
0:12:39.012,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You are angry a lot of the time,

270
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and I think one of the reasons why this debate is so charged

271
0:12:45.285,000 --> 0:12:47,000
is because it runs through the heart of each of us, right?

272
0:12:48.109,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Everyone has a bit of them that looks at an addict and thinks,

273
0:12:51.08,000 --> 0:12:52,000
I wish someone would just stop you.

274
0:12:52.855,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And the kind of scripts we're told for how to deal with the addicts in our lives

275
0:12:56.641,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is typified by, I think,

276
0:12:57.837,000 --> 0:12:59,000
the reality show "Intervention," if you guys have ever seen it.

277
0:13:00.814,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I think everything in our lives is defined by reality TV,

278
0:13:03.512,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but that's another TED Talk.

279
0:13:04.981,000 --> 0:13:06,000
If you've ever seen the show "Intervention,"

280
0:13:07.193,000 --> 0:13:08,000
it's a pretty simple premise.

281
0:13:08.673,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Get an addict, all the people in their life, gather them together,

282
0:13:11.793,000 --> 0:13:14,000
confront them with what they're doing, and they say, if you don't shape up,

283
0:13:15.449,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we're going to cut you off.

284
0:13:16.811,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So what they do is they take the connection to the addict,

285
0:13:19.55,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and they threaten it, they make it contingent

286
0:13:21.67,000 --> 0:13:23,000
on the addict behaving the way they want.

287
0:13:24.072,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And I began to think, I began to see why that approach doesn't work,

288
0:13:27.823,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and I began to think that's almost like the importing of the logic of the Drug War

289
0:13:32.397,000 --> 0:13:33,000
into our private lives.

290
0:13:34.278,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So I was thinking, how could I be Portuguese?

291
0:13:37.97,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And what I've tried to do now, and I can't tell you I do it consistently

292
0:13:41.499,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and I can't tell you it's easy,

293
0:13:43.472,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is to say to the addicts in my life

294
0:13:45.98,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that I want to deepen the connection with them,

295
0:13:48.23,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to say to them, I love you whether you're using or you're not.

296
0:13:51.924,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I love you, whatever state you're in,

297
0:13:54.78,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and if you need me, I'll come and sit with you

298
0:13:57.195,000 --> 0:13:59,000
because I love you and I don't want you to be alone

299
0:13:59.819,000 --> 0:14:,000
or to feel alone.

300
0:14:01.839,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And I think the core of that message --

301
0:14:03.905,000 --> 0:14:05,000
you're not alone, we love you --

302
0:14:06.598,000 --> 0:14:09,000
has to be at every level of how we respond to addicts,

303
0:14:09.687,000 --> 0:14:11,000
socially, politically and individually.

304
0:14:12.334,000 --> 0:14:16,000
For 100 years now, we've been singing war songs about addicts.

305
0:14:16.606,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I think all along we should have been singing love songs to them,

306
0:14:20.53,000 --> 0:14:24,000
because the opposite of addiction is not sobriety.

307
0:14:24.802,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The opposite of addiction is connection.

308
0:14:28.657,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Thank you.

309
0:14:30.63,000 --> 0:14:37,000

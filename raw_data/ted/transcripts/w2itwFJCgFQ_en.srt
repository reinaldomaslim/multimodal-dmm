2
0:00:23.544,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So what does it mean for a machine to be athletic?

3
0:00:27.059,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We will demonstrate the concept of machine athleticism

4
0:00:29.908,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and the research to achieve it

5
0:00:31.628,000 --> 0:00:33,000
with the help of these flying machines called quadrocopters,

6
0:00:34.51,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or quads, for short.

7
0:00:38.291,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Quads have been around for a long time.

8
0:00:40.501,000 --> 0:00:43,000
They're so popular these days because they're mechanically simple.

9
0:00:44.255,000 --> 0:00:46,000
By controlling the speeds of these four propellers,

10
0:00:46.668,000 --> 0:00:48,000
these machines can roll, pitch, yaw,

11
0:00:49.437,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and accelerate along their common orientation.

12
0:00:52.179,000 --> 0:00:55,000
On board are also a battery, a computer,

13
0:00:55.401,000 --> 0:00:56,000
various sensors and wireless radios.

14
0:00:59.298,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Quads are extremely agile, but this agility comes at a cost.

15
0:01:03.762,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They are inherently unstable,

16
0:01:05.874,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and they need some form of automatic feedback control

17
0:01:08.469,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in order to be able to fly.

18
0:01:16.259,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So, how did it just do that?

19
0:01:19.497,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Cameras on the ceiling and a laptop

20
0:01:21.315,000 --> 0:01:23,000
serve as an indoor global positioning system.

21
0:01:24.301,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's used to locate objects in the space

22
0:01:26.364,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that have these reflective markers on them.

23
0:01:28.476,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This data is then sent to another laptop

24
0:01:30.538,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that is running estimation and control algorithms,

25
0:01:32.92,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which in turn sends commands to the quad,

26
0:01:34.898,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which is also running estimation and control algorithms.

27
0:01:41.864,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The bulk of our research is algorithms.

28
0:01:44.13,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's the magic that brings these machines to life.

29
0:01:48.291,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So how does one design the algorithms that create a machine athlete?

30
0:01:52.792,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We use something broadly called model-based design.

31
0:01:55.839,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We first capture the physics

32
0:01:57.229,000 --> 0:01:59,000
with a mathematical model of how the machines behave.

33
0:02:00.636,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We then use a branch of mathematics called control theory

34
0:02:04.61,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to analyze these models

35
0:02:06.291,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and also to synthesize algorithms for controlling them.

36
0:02:09.82,000 --> 0:02:12,000
For example, that's how we can make the quad hover.

37
0:02:12.868,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We first captured the dynamics with a set of differential equations.

38
0:02:16.182,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We then manipulate these equations with the help of control theory

39
0:02:19.658,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to create algorithms that stabilize the quad.

40
0:02:23.13,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Let me demonstrate the strength of this approach.

41
0:02:29.198,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Suppose that we want this quad to not only hover

42
0:02:31.855,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but to also balance this pole.

43
0:02:34.52,000 --> 0:02:35,000
With a little bit of practice,

44
0:02:36.318,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it's pretty straightforward for a human being to do this,

45
0:02:39.025,000 --> 0:02:42,000
although we do have the advantage of having two feet on the ground

46
0:02:42.24,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and the use of our very versatile hands.

47
0:02:44.804,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It becomes a little bit more difficult

48
0:02:47.566,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when I only have one foot on the ground

49
0:02:49.569,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and when I don't use my hands.

50
0:02:52.733,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Notice how this pole has a reflective marker on top,

51
0:02:55.319,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which means that it can be located in the space.

52
0:03:04.276,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Audience) Oh!

53
0:03:05.367,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Applause)

54
0:03:09.695,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Applause ends)

55
0:03:11.387,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You can notice that this quad is making fine adjustments

56
0:03:14.052,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to keep the pole balanced.

57
0:03:16.417,000 --> 0:03:18,000
How did we design the algorithms to do this?

58
0:03:19.027,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We added the mathematical model of the pole

59
0:03:21.132,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to that of the quad.

60
0:03:22.603,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Once we have a model of the combined quad-pole system,

61
0:03:25.605,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we can use control theory to create algorithms for controlling it.

62
0:03:30.538,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Here, you see that it's stable,

63
0:03:32.126,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and even if I give it little nudges,

64
0:03:34.819,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it goes back --

65
0:03:37.589,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to the nice, balanced position.

66
0:03:40.087,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We can also augment the model

67
0:03:41.501,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to include where we want the quad to be in space.

68
0:03:44.428,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Using this pointer, made out of reflective markers,

69
0:03:47.395,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I can point to where I want the quad to be in space

70
0:03:49.848,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a fixed distance away from me.

71
0:03:59.785,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:07.763,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The key to these acrobatic maneuvers is algorithms,

73
0:04:10.913,000 --> 0:04:12,000
designed with the help of mathematical models

74
0:04:13.23,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and control theory.

75
0:04:15.246,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Let's tell the quad to come back here

76
0:04:17.255,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and let the pole drop,

77
0:04:18.943,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and I will next demonstrate the importance

78
0:04:21.098,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of understanding physical models

79
0:04:23.111,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and the workings of the physical world.

80
0:04:37.462,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Notice how the quad lost altitude when I put this glass of water on it.

81
0:04:41.314,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Unlike the balancing pole,

82
0:04:42.741,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I did not include the mathematical model of the glass

83
0:04:45.78,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in the system.

84
0:04:47.111,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In fact, the system doesn't even know that the glass is there.

85
0:04:50.148,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Like before, I could use the pointer to tell the quad

86
0:04:52.91,000 --> 0:04:53,000
where I want it to be in space.

87
0:04:57.684,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Applause)

88
0:05:03.531,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Applause ends)

89
0:05:05.515,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Okay, you should be asking yourself,

90
0:05:07.278,000 --> 0:05:09,000
why doesn't the water fall out of the glass?

91
0:05:09.888,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Two facts.

92
0:05:10.942,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The first is that gravity acts on all objects in the same way.

93
0:05:15.051,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The second is that the propellers

94
0:05:16.854,000 --> 0:05:19,000
are all pointing in the same direction of the glass, pointing up.

95
0:05:20.642,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You put these two things together,

96
0:05:22.313,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the net result is that all side forces on the glass are small

97
0:05:25.892,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and are mainly dominated by aerodynamic effects,

98
0:05:28.193,000 --> 0:05:29,000
which at these speeds are negligible.

99
0:05:35.336,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that's why you don't need to model the glass.

100
0:05:37.694,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It naturally doesn't spill, no matter what the quad does.

101
0:05:44.5,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Audience) Oh!

102
0:05:50.34,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:55.159,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Applause ends)

104
0:05:57.94,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The lesson here

105
0:05:59.078,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others,

106
0:06:03.115,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and that understanding the physics of the problem

107
0:06:05.476,000 --> 0:06:07,000
tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard.

108
0:06:08.194,000 --> 0:06:1,000
In this instance, carrying a glass of water is easy.

109
0:06:10.728,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Balancing a pole is hard.

110
0:06:14.171,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We've all heard stories of athletes performing feats while physically injured.

111
0:06:18.466,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Can a machine also perform with extreme physical damage?

112
0:06:22.636,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Conventional wisdom says

113
0:06:24.145,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that you need at least four fixed motor propeller pairs in order to fly,

114
0:06:28.052,000 --> 0:06:3,000
because there are four degrees of freedom to control:

115
0:06:30.6,000 --> 0:06:31,000
roll, pitch, yaw and acceleration.

116
0:06:33.192,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Hexacopters and octocopters, with six and eight propellers,

117
0:06:36.437,000 --> 0:06:37,000
can provide redundancy,

118
0:06:37.92,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but quadrocopters are much more popular

119
0:06:39.909,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because they have the minimum number of fixed motor propeller pairs: four.

120
0:06:44.168,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Or do they?

121
0:06:52.827,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Audience) Oh!

122
0:06:54.407,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

123
0:07:01.334,000 --> 0:07:03,000
If we analyze the mathematical model of this machine

124
0:07:04.076,000 --> 0:07:06,000
with only two working propellers,

125
0:07:06.252,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we discover that there's an unconventional way to fly it.

126
0:07:19.98,000 --> 0:07:2,000
We relinquish control of yaw,

127
0:07:21.686,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but roll, pitch and acceleration can still be controlled

128
0:07:24.756,000 --> 0:07:27,000
with algorithms that exploit this new configuration.

129
0:07:33.668,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Mathematical models tell us exactly when and why this is possible.

130
0:07:37.981,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In this instance, this knowledge allows us to design

131
0:07:40.783,000 --> 0:07:42,000
novel machine architectures

132
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:46,000
or to design clever algorithms that gracefully handle damage,

133
0:07:46.972,000 --> 0:07:47,000
just like human athletes do,

134
0:07:48.696,000 --> 0:07:5,000
instead of building machines with redundancy.

135
0:07:52.688,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We can't help but hold our breath

136
0:07:54.369,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when we watch a diver somersaulting into the water,

137
0:07:57.068,000 --> 0:07:58,000
or when a vaulter is twisting in the air,

138
0:07:59.045,000 --> 0:08:,000
the ground fast approaching.

139
0:08:00.576,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Will the diver be able to pull off a rip entry?

140
0:08:03.144,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Will the vaulter stick the landing?

141
0:08:05.292,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Suppose we want this quad here to perform a triple flip

142
0:08:08.496,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and finish off at the exact same spot that it started.

143
0:08:11.736,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This maneuver is going to happen so quickly

144
0:08:13.879,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that we can't use position feedback to correct the motion during execution.

145
0:08:17.748,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There simply isn't enough time.

146
0:08:19.782,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Instead, what the quad can do is perform the maneuver blindly,

147
0:08:23.476,000 --> 0:08:25,000
observe how it finishes the maneuver,

148
0:08:25.708,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and then use that information to modify its behavior

149
0:08:28.209,000 --> 0:08:29,000
so that the next flip is better.

150
0:08:30.421,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Similar to the diver and the vaulter,

151
0:08:32.233,000 --> 0:08:33,000
it is only through repeated practice

152
0:08:34.152,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that the maneuver can be learned and executed

153
0:08:36.319,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to the highest standard.

154
0:08:45.1,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:46.393,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

156
0:08:51.164,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Striking a moving ball is a necessary skill in many sports.

157
0:08:55.127,000 --> 0:08:56,000
How do we make a machine do

158
0:08:56.643,000 --> 0:08:58,000
what an athlete does seemingly without effort?

159
0:09:09.547,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

160
0:09:16.143,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Applause)

161
0:09:20.5,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Applause ends)

162
0:09:22.542,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This quad has a racket strapped onto its head

163
0:09:25.192,000 --> 0:09:28,000
with a sweet spot roughly the size of an apple, so not too large.

164
0:09:29.017,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds,

165
0:09:31.846,000 --> 0:09:32,000
or 50 times per second.

166
0:09:33.602,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We first figure out where the ball is going.

167
0:09:36.414,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We then next calculate how the quad should hit the ball

168
0:09:39.059,000 --> 0:09:41,000
so that it flies to where it was thrown from.

169
0:09:41.95,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Third, a trajectory is planned that carries the quad

170
0:09:46.406,000 --> 0:09:49,000
from its current state to the impact point with the ball.

171
0:09:49.43,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Fourth, we only execute 20 milliseconds' worth of that strategy.

172
0:09:53.366,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Twenty milliseconds later, the whole process is repeated

173
0:09:56.183,000 --> 0:09:57,000
until the quad strikes the ball.

174
0:10:07.29,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

175
0:10:10.131,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Machines can not only perform dynamic maneuvers on their own,

176
0:10:13.578,000 --> 0:10:14,000
they can do it collectively.

177
0:10:15.441,000 --> 0:10:18,000
These three quads are cooperatively carrying a sky net.

178
0:10:27.589,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Applause)

179
0:10:32.372,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause ends)

180
0:10:33.985,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They perform an extremely dynamic and collective maneuver

181
0:10:38.35,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to launch the ball back to me.

182
0:10:40.042,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Notice that, at full extension, these quads are vertical.

183
0:10:48.486,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause)

184
0:10:50.258,000 --> 0:10:52,000
In fact, when fully extended,

185
0:10:52.425,000 --> 0:10:55,000
this is roughly five times greater than what a bungee jumper feels

186
0:10:55.712,000 --> 0:10:56,000
at the end of their launch.

187
0:11:03.203,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The algorithms to do this are very similar

188
0:11:05.686,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to what the single quad used to hit the ball back to me.

189
0:11:09.07,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Mathematical models are used to continuously re-plan

190
0:11:11.934,000 --> 0:11:13,000
a cooperative strategy 50 times per second.

191
0:11:16.506,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Everything we have seen so far has been about the machines and their capabilities.

192
0:11:20.789,000 --> 0:11:22,000
What happens when we couple this machine athleticism

193
0:11:23.805,000 --> 0:11:24,000
with that of a human being?

194
0:11:25.765,000 --> 0:11:28,000
What I have in front of me is a commercial gesture sensor

195
0:11:29.385,000 --> 0:11:3,000
mainly used in gaming.

196
0:11:30.694,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It can recognize what my various body parts

197
0:11:32.766,000 --> 0:11:33,000
are doing in real time.

198
0:11:34.71,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Similar to the pointer that I used earlier,

199
0:11:36.813,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we can use this as inputs to the system.

200
0:11:39.454,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We now have a natural way of interacting

201
0:11:41.85,000 --> 0:11:44,000
with the raw athleticism of these quads with my gestures.

202
0:12:22.715,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

203
0:12:36.354,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Interaction doesn't have to be virtual.

204
0:12:38.394,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It can be physical.

205
0:12:39.989,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Take this quad, for example.

206
0:12:41.893,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's trying to stay at a fixed point in space.

207
0:12:44.933,000 --> 0:12:47,000
If I try to move it out of the way, it fights me,

208
0:12:48.646,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and moves back to where it wants to be.

209
0:12:52.254,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We can change this behavior, however.

210
0:12:55.373,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We can use mathematical models

211
0:12:57.072,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to estimate the force that I'm applying to the quad.

212
0:13:00.205,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Once we know this force, we can also change the laws of physics,

213
0:13:03.443,000 --> 0:13:05,000
as far as the quad is concerned, of course.

214
0:13:07.942,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Here, the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid.

215
0:13:14.57,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We now have an intimate way of interacting with a machine.

216
0:13:18.593,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I will use this new capability to position

217
0:13:21.099,000 --> 0:13:23,000
this camera-carrying quad to the appropriate location

218
0:13:23.676,000 --> 0:13:25,000
for filming the remainder of this demonstration.

219
0:13:36.583,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So we can physically interact with these quads

220
0:13:38.99,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and we can change the laws of physics.

221
0:13:41.393,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Let's have a little bit of fun with this.

222
0:13:43.539,000 --> 0:13:44,000
For what you will see next,

223
0:13:44.932,000 --> 0:13:47,000
these quads will initially behave as if they were on Pluto.

224
0:13:48.906,000 --> 0:13:5,000
As time goes on, gravity will be increased

225
0:13:51.218,000 --> 0:13:53,000
until we're all back on planet Earth,

226
0:13:53.267,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but I assure you we won't get there.

227
0:13:55.462,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Okay, here goes.

228
0:14:04.897,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Laughter)

229
0:14:34.778,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Laughter)

230
0:14:37.858,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Applause)

231
0:14:41.76,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Whew!

232
0:14:47.045,000 --> 0:14:48,000
You're all thinking now,

233
0:14:48.296,000 --> 0:14:49,000
these guys are having way too much fun,

234
0:14:50.271,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and you're probably also asking yourself,

235
0:14:52.35,000 --> 0:14:54,000
why exactly are they building machine athletes?

236
0:14:56.286,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Some conjecture that the role of play in the animal kingdom

237
0:14:59.12,000 --> 0:15:01,000
is to hone skills and develop capabilities.

238
0:15:01.69,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Others think that it has more of a social role,

239
0:15:03.929,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that it's used to bind the group.

240
0:15:05.603,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Similarly, we use the analogy of sports and athleticism

241
0:15:08.963,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to create new algorithms for machines

242
0:15:11.042,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to push them to their limits.

243
0:15:13.35,000 --> 0:15:16,000
What impact will the speed of machines have on our way of life?

244
0:15:16.866,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Like all our past creations and innovations,

245
0:15:19.255,000 --> 0:15:21,000
they may be used to improve the human condition

246
0:15:22.082,000 --> 0:15:23,000
or they may be misused and abused.

247
0:15:24.595,000 --> 0:15:26,000
This is not a technical choice we are faced with;

248
0:15:26.921,000 --> 0:15:27,000
it's a social one.

249
0:15:28.332,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Let's make the right choice,

250
0:15:29.707,000 --> 0:15:31,000
the choice that brings out the best in the future of machines,

251
0:15:32.643,000 --> 0:15:34,000
just like athleticism in sports can bring out the best in us.

252
0:15:36.38,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Let me introduce you to the wizards behind the green curtain.

253
0:15:39.479,000 --> 0:15:42,000
They're the current members of the Flying Machine Arena research team.

254
0:15:42.837,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Applause)

255
0:15:47.267,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Federico Augugliaro, Dario Brescianini,

256
0:15:49.569,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Markus Hehn, Sergei Lupashin, Mark Muller and Robin Ritz.

257
0:15:53.018,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Look out for them. They're destined for great things.

258
0:15:55.566,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Thank you.

259
0:15:56.644,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Applause)

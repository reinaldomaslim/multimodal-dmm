Transcriber: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:13.697,000 --> 0:00:17,000
OK, I would like to introduce all of you beautiful, curious-minded people

3
0:00:18.359,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to my favorite animal in the world.

4
0:00:20.784,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This is the Peter Pan of the amphibian world.

5
0:00:23.926,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's an axolotl.

6
0:00:25.632,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a type of salamander,

7
0:00:27.13,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but it never fully grows up and climbs out of the water

8
0:00:29.975,000 --> 0:00:3,000
like other salamanders do.

9
0:00:32.178,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And this little guy has X-Man-style powers, right?

10
0:00:35.46,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So if it loses any limb,

11
0:00:37.285,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it can just completely regenerate.

12
0:00:39.544,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's amazing.

13
0:00:40.719,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And, I mean, look at it -- it's got a face with a permanent smile.

14
0:00:43.859,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:44.889,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's framed by feathery gills.

16
0:00:46.377,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's just ... how could you not love that?

17
0:00:48.445,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This particular type of axolotl, a very close relative,

18
0:00:52.381,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is known as an achoque.

19
0:00:54.01,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It is equally as cute,

20
0:00:55.515,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and it lives in just one place in a lake in the north of Mexico.

21
0:01:00.243,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's called Lake Pátzcuaro,

22
0:01:02.008,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and as you can see,

23
0:01:03.673,000 --> 0:01:05,000
it is stunningly beautiful.

24
0:01:06.222,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But unfortunately, it's been so overfished and so badly polluted

25
0:01:09.428,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that the achoque is dying out altogether.

26
0:01:12.639,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And this is something that's a scenario that's playing out all over the world.

27
0:01:16.478,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We're living through an extinction crisis,

28
0:01:19.287,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and species are particularly vulnerable when they're evolutionarily tailored

29
0:01:22.923,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to just one little niche or maybe one lake.

30
0:01:26.438,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But this is TED, right?

31
0:01:27.622,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So this is where I give you the big idea, the big solution.

32
0:01:30.455,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So how do you save one special weird species from going extinct?

33
0:01:34.628,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Well, the answer, at least my answer,

34
0:01:36.918,000 --> 0:01:38,000
isn't a grand technological intervention.

35
0:01:38.995,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's actually really simple.

36
0:01:40.394,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's that you find people who know all about this animal

37
0:01:43.805,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and you ask them and you listen to them

38
0:01:47.389,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and you work with them, if they're up for that.

39
0:01:51.492,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I want to tell you about how I've seen that in science,

40
0:01:54.258,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and in conservation in particular,

41
0:01:55.941,000 --> 0:01:57,000
if scientists don't team up with local people

42
0:01:58.801,000 --> 0:02:,000
who have really valuable knowledge

43
0:02:01.126,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but a practical wisdom that's not going to be published in any academic journal,

44
0:02:04.969,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they can really miss the point.

45
0:02:07.084,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Scientists and science as an enterprise can fall at the first hurdle

46
0:02:11.184,000 --> 0:02:15,000
if it rushes in knowing that it's the experts that know best.

47
0:02:15.419,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But when scientists shake off those academic constraints

48
0:02:18.276,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and really look to people who have a totally different

49
0:02:21.168,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but really important perspective on what they're trying to do,

50
0:02:24.177,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it can genuinely save the world,

51
0:02:25.929,000 --> 0:02:28,000
one wonderfully weird amphibian at a time.

52
0:02:29.54,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So, in the case of the achoque,

53
0:02:31.87,000 --> 0:02:33,000
these are the people you need on your team.

54
0:02:33.929,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:34.969,000 --> 0:02:36,000
These are the Sisters of the Immaculate Health.

56
0:02:37.786,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They are nuns who have a convent in Pátzcuaro, they live in Pátzcuaro,

57
0:02:41.602,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and they have a shared history with the achoque.

58
0:02:44.391,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And it is so mind-bogglingly wonderful

59
0:02:46.517,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that it drew me all the way there to make an audio documentary about them,

60
0:02:50.099,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and I even have the unflattering selfie

61
0:02:52.354,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to prove it.

62
0:02:53.97,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There is a room at the center of their convent, though,

63
0:02:56.916,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that looks like this.

64
0:02:58.093,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's very strange.

65
0:02:59.279,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's lined with all these tanks full of fresh water

66
0:03:01.867,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and hundreds of achoques.

67
0:03:04.194,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And that's because this creature, because of its regenerative abilities,

68
0:03:08.017,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's believed has healing powers if you consume it.

69
0:03:11.716,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So the sisters actually make and sell a medicine using achoques.

70
0:03:17.65,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I bought a bottle of it.

71
0:03:21.681,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So this is it.

72
0:03:23.336,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It tastes a bit like honey,

73
0:03:25.721,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but the sisters reckon it is good

74
0:03:27.568,000 --> 0:03:3,000
for all kinds of particularly respiratory ailments.

75
0:03:30.641,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So I just want you to have a listen, if you will, to a clip of Sister Ofelia.

76
0:03:34.608,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Audio) Sister Ofelia: (speaks in Spanish)

77
0:03:36.624,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Audio) (Interpreter voice-over) Our convent was founded by Dominican nuns

78
0:03:40.146,000 --> 0:03:42,000
here in Pátzcuaro in 1747.

79
0:03:43.957,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Sometime after that,

80
0:03:45.184,000 --> 0:03:48,000
our sisters started to make the achoque syrup.

81
0:03:48.391,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We didn't discover the properties of the achoque.

82
0:03:50.988,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That was the original people from around here, since ancient times.

83
0:03:56.248,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But we then started to make the syrup, too.

84
0:03:58.997,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The locals knew that,

85
0:04:00.204,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and they came to offer us the animals.

86
0:04:02.834,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Audio) Victoria Gill: I see.

87
0:04:04.267,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So the achoques are part of making that syrup.

88
0:04:07.193,000 --> 0:04:09,000
What does the syrup treat, and what is it for?

89
0:04:09.956,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Audio) SO: (speaks in Spanish)

90
0:04:13.09,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Audio) (Interpreter voice-over) It's good for coughs, asthma,

91
0:04:16.049,000 --> 0:04:18,000
bronchitis, the lungs and back pain.

92
0:04:18.912,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Audio) VG: And so you've harnessed that power

93
0:04:21.124,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in a syrup, in a medicine.

94
0:04:22.914,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Can you tell me how it's made?

95
0:04:26.371,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You're shaking your head and smiling. (Laughter)

96
0:04:30.608,000 --> 0:04:33,000
VG: Yeah, they're not up for sharing the centuries-old secret recipe.

97
0:04:33.902,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:34.973,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But the decline in the achoque

99
0:04:39.538,000 --> 0:04:42,000
actually nearly put a halt to that medicine production altogether,

100
0:04:43.402,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which is why the sisters started this.

101
0:04:45.717,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's the world's first achoque farm.

102
0:04:48.028,000 --> 0:04:5,000
All they wanted was a healthy, sustainable population

103
0:04:50.815,000 --> 0:04:52,000
so that they could continue to make that medicine,

104
0:04:53.194,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but what they created at the same time

105
0:04:55.21,000 --> 0:04:59,000
was a captive breeding program for a critically endangered species.

106
0:04:59.492,000 --> 0:05:,000
And fast forward a few years,

107
0:05:00.952,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and these scientists that you can see in this picture

108
0:05:03.47,000 --> 0:05:05,000
from Chester Zoo all the way over the in UK,

109
0:05:05.677,000 --> 0:05:06,000
not far from where I live,

110
0:05:06.995,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and from Michoacana University in Morelia in Mexico

111
0:05:10.15,000 --> 0:05:13,000
have persuaded the sisters -- it took years of careful diplomacy --

112
0:05:13.369,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to join them in a research partnership.

113
0:05:15.808,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So the nuns show the biologists

114
0:05:17.81,000 --> 0:05:21,000
how you rear perfectly healthy, very robust Pátzcuaro achoques,

115
0:05:22.472,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and the scientists have put some of their funding

116
0:05:24.808,000 --> 0:05:25,000
into tanks, filters and pumps

117
0:05:26.244,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in this strange, incongruous but amazing room.

118
0:05:30.355,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This is the kind of partnership that can save a species.

119
0:05:34.341,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But I don't think I see enough of this sort of thing,

120
0:05:36.95,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and I have been ludicrously lucky in my job.

121
0:05:39.278,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I've traveled to loads of places and just basically followed around

122
0:05:43.453,000 --> 0:05:46,000
brilliant people who are trying to use science to answer big questions

123
0:05:47.469,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and solve problems.

124
0:05:49.238,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I've hung out with scientists who have solved the mystery

125
0:05:52.129,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of the origin of the menopause by tracking killer whales

126
0:05:54.84,000 --> 0:05:55,000
off the north Pacific coast.

127
0:05:56.622,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I've followed around scientists

128
0:05:58.329,000 --> 0:06:,000
who've planted cameras in Antarctic penguin colonies,

129
0:06:01.193,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because they were looking to capture the impacts of climate change

130
0:06:04.378,000 --> 0:06:05,000
as it happens.

131
0:06:05.925,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But it's this team that really stuck with me,

132
0:06:09.173,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that really showed me the impact

133
0:06:10.784,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that these delicate but really important relationships can have.

134
0:06:15.966,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I think the reason that it stuck with me as well

135
0:06:18.441,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is because it's not common.

136
0:06:19.998,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And one of the reasons it's not common

137
0:06:22.411,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is because our traditional approach

138
0:06:25.603,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of the hierarchical system of academic achievement

139
0:06:28.266,000 --> 0:06:31,000
doesn't exactly encourage the type of humility

140
0:06:31.802,000 --> 0:06:33,000
where scientists will look to nonscientists

141
0:06:34.692,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and really ask for their input.

142
0:06:37.292,000 --> 0:06:39,000
In fact, I think we have a bit of a tradition,

143
0:06:39.809,000 --> 0:06:4,000
especially in the West,

144
0:06:40.996,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of a kind of academically blinkered hubris

145
0:06:43.618,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that has kept science historically an enterprise for the elite.

146
0:06:47.067,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I think although that's moved on,

147
0:06:48.983,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it continues to be its downfall on occasion.

148
0:06:53.673,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So here's my example from history

149
0:06:58.14,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and my takedown of a scientific hero.

150
0:07:02.458,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Sir Ernest Shackleton

151
0:07:03.968,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and his Trans-Antarctic Expedition more than a century ago,

152
0:07:07.891,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the celebrated ill-fated adventure.

153
0:07:10.329,000 --> 0:07:11,000
On his way there,

154
0:07:11.504,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Shackleton just didn't listen to the whalers in South Georgia.

155
0:07:14.525,000 --> 0:07:17,000
They knew that region, and they told him you won't get through the ice this year.

156
0:07:18.39,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's too widespread, it's too far north, it's too dangerous.

157
0:07:21.241,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And look what happened.

158
0:07:22.599,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I mean, granted, that great adventure,

159
0:07:24.9,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that story of heroic leadership that we still tell,

160
0:07:28.097,000 --> 0:07:3,000
where he saved every single one of his men,

161
0:07:30.223,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we wouldn't be telling that story if he'd just hightailed it for home

162
0:07:33.517,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and taken their advice.

163
0:07:34.699,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But it cost him his ship,

164
0:07:35.926,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I would imagine quite a lot of cold injuries among the team,

165
0:07:38.796,000 --> 0:07:39,000
a good few cases of PTSD

166
0:07:40.068,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and Mrs. Chippy, the ship's cat, had to be shot

167
0:07:42.815,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because the team couldn't afford any extra food as they fought to survive.

168
0:07:47.616,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, that was all a very long time ago,

169
0:07:50.32,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but as I've prepared for this talk,

170
0:07:52.302,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I've revisited some of the stories that I have covered,

171
0:07:55.532,000 --> 0:08:,000
where these really unusual collaborations made a real positive difference.

172
0:08:00.581,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So I spoke to former poachers

173
0:08:02.68,000 --> 0:08:04,000
whose knowledge of where they used to hunt illegally

174
0:08:05.181,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is now really important in conservation projects

175
0:08:08.411,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in those same places.

176
0:08:10.186,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I spoke to an amazing artist

177
0:08:12.004,000 --> 0:08:14,000
whose own experience of mental health struggles

178
0:08:14.676,000 --> 0:08:18,000
has actually paved the way for him to take a role in designing and creating

179
0:08:19.41,000 --> 0:08:22,000
a new, really innovative and beautiful mental health ward in a hospital.

180
0:08:24.341,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Most recently, I worked here, in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone,

181
0:08:27.486,000 --> 0:08:3,000
with a team of scientists that have been working there for decades.

182
0:08:30.782,000 --> 0:08:32,000
One of their experiments growing crops in that area

183
0:08:33.205,000 --> 0:08:35,000
has now turned into this.

184
0:08:35.353,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's Chernobyl's first vodka.

185
0:08:37.493,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:42.925,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's pretty good, too! I've tasted it.

187
0:08:45.917,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And this is actually, although it looks like a niche product,

188
0:08:48.839,000 --> 0:08:52,000
it's set to be the first consumer product to come out of the exclusion zone

189
0:08:53.527,000 --> 0:08:54,000
since the nuclear accident.

190
0:08:55.276,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And that's actually the result of years of conversation

191
0:08:58.455,000 --> 0:09:01,000
with local communities who still live on the periphery of that abandoned land

192
0:09:02.13,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and want to know when they can -- and if they can -- safely grow food

193
0:09:06.118,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and build businesses and rebuild their communities and their lives.

194
0:09:09.929,000 --> 0:09:11,000
This was a product of humility,

195
0:09:12.132,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of listening,

196
0:09:13.369,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I saw that in spades when I visited Pátzcuaro.

197
0:09:17.058,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So I watched as a decades-experienced conservation biologist

198
0:09:20.53,000 --> 0:09:21,000
called Gerardo Garcia

199
0:09:21.87,000 --> 0:09:22,000
listened and watched super carefully

200
0:09:23.86,000 --> 0:09:25,000
as a nun in a full habit and wimple and latex gloves

201
0:09:26.375,000 --> 0:09:29,000
showed him how, if you tap an achoque on the head really gently,

202
0:09:29.432,000 --> 0:09:32,000
it'll open its mouth so you can quickly get a DNA swab with a Q-tip.

203
0:09:32.691,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:34.204,000 --> 0:09:39,000
When scientists team up with, look to and defer to people

205
0:09:39.254,000 --> 0:09:42,000
who have a really valuable perspective on what they're trying to do

206
0:09:42.448,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but a totally different outlook,

207
0:09:44.038,000 --> 0:09:46,000
something really special can happen.

208
0:09:48.163,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now, there is a truly global and a very, very ambitious example of this

209
0:09:53.633,000 --> 0:09:56,000
called the International Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.

210
0:09:57.472,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now, that is not a snappy title, but stick with me.

211
0:10:00.336,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This organization includes more than 130 countries,

212
0:10:02.842,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and it's aiming to do nothing less than assess the state of the natural world

213
0:10:06.554,000 --> 0:10:08,000
across our entire planet.

214
0:10:08.629,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So it recently published this global assessment

215
0:10:10.874,000 --> 0:10:11,000
on the state of nature,

216
0:10:12.074,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and that could be the foundation for an international agreement

217
0:10:15.188,000 --> 0:10:18,000
where all of those nations could sign up to finally take action

218
0:10:18.414,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to tackle the biodiversity crisis that's happening on planet Earth

219
0:10:21.777,000 --> 0:10:22,000
right now.

220
0:10:23.682,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now, I know from trying to communicate, trying to report on reports like this,

221
0:10:28.008,000 --> 0:10:3,000
on assessments like this for a broad audience,

222
0:10:30.215,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that these big international groups can seem so high-level

223
0:10:34.471,000 --> 0:10:36,000
as to be kind of out of reach and nebulous,

224
0:10:37.301,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but there's a group of human beings at the center of them,

225
0:10:40.077,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the report's authors,

226
0:10:41.313,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who have this formidable task of bringing together

227
0:10:43.699,000 --> 0:10:45,000
all of that biological and ecological information

228
0:10:46.121,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that paints a clear and accurate picture

229
0:10:48.186,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of the state of the natural world.

230
0:10:50.853,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And 10 years before this panel even set out to do that,

231
0:10:53.617,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to put that assessment together,

232
0:10:55.223,000 --> 0:10:58,000
they created what's called a "cultural concept framework."

233
0:10:58.565,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is essentially a cultural concept translation dictionary

234
0:11:02.909,000 --> 0:11:06,000
for all of the different ways that we talk about the natural world.

235
0:11:07.226,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So it formally recognizes, for example,

236
0:11:09.433,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that "Mother Earth" and "nature" means the same thing.

237
0:11:13.516,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And what that means is that Indigenous and local knowledge

238
0:11:16.323,000 --> 0:11:17,000
can be brought into the same document

239
0:11:18.158,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and given the weight and merit that it deserves

240
0:11:20.67,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in that assessment of what state our natural environment is in.

241
0:11:26.866,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And that is absolutely critical,

242
0:11:28.689,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because an Inuit hunter might never publish in an academic journal,

243
0:11:33.221,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but I'll bet you she knows more about the changes to her home Arctic community

244
0:11:38.055,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because of climate change

245
0:11:39.548,000 --> 0:11:42,000
than a scientist who spent many years going to and from that region

246
0:11:43.562,000 --> 0:11:44,000
taking measurements.

247
0:11:45.496,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And collectively, Indigenous people are the caretakers

248
0:11:49.429,000 --> 0:11:54,000
of an estimated 25 percent of the entire global land surface,

249
0:11:54.841,000 --> 0:11:57,000
including some of the most biodiverse places on the planet.

250
0:11:58.65,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So imagine how much we're missing

251
0:12:01.788,000 --> 0:12:03,000
if we don't cross those cultural boundaries,

252
0:12:04.051,000 --> 0:12:05,000
or at least try to,

253
0:12:05.353,000 --> 0:12:07,000
when we're trying to figure out how the world works

254
0:12:07.804,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and how to protect it.

255
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Every single research proposal is a new opportunity to do exactly that.

256
0:12:15.479,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So what if, every time a research project was proposed,

257
0:12:19.108,000 --> 0:12:22,000
it had to include a suggestion of a person or a group of people --

258
0:12:22.885,000 --> 0:12:25,000
local farmers, Indigenous community leaders, nuns --

259
0:12:26.451,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that researchers wanted to bring into the fold,

260
0:12:28.876,000 --> 0:12:3,000
invite into their team and listen to?

261
0:12:32.267,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I just want to let Sister Ofelia give her view

262
0:12:34.837,000 --> 0:12:37,000
of why she is so particularly driven and dedicated

263
0:12:38.373,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to the survival of the achoque.

264
0:12:42.466,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Audio) VG: Sister Ofelia, do you think that saving this species from extinction,

265
0:12:47.289,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is that part of your work for God?

266
0:12:50.545,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Audio) SO: (speaks in Spanish)

267
0:12:55.281,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Audio) (Interpreter voice-over) It's the responsibility

268
0:12:57.954,000 --> 0:12:58,000
of every human being

269
0:12:59.132,000 --> 0:13:,000
not to harm those who live around us.

270
0:13:00.94,000 --> 0:13:02,000
That's all living things.

271
0:13:03.193,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We're all created not only just to survive but to be happy and to make others happy.

272
0:13:09.143,000 --> 0:13:13,000
All of us here are providing happiness by protecting this animal,

273
0:13:13.704,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and we're also making Him happy.

274
0:13:19.138,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Audio) (Nuns singing)

275
0:13:27.453,000 --> 0:13:3,000
VG: I feel like I should sort of slink off and let the nuns sing me out,

276
0:13:30.917,000 --> 0:13:31,000
because it sounds so lovely.

277
0:13:32.76,000 --> 0:13:33,000
But did you hear that?

278
0:13:34.053,000 --> 0:13:35,000
"We're providing happiness."

279
0:13:35.989,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Now, that's not a protocol you'd ever see outlined

280
0:13:38.365,000 --> 0:13:4,000
in any formal research project proposal --

281
0:13:40.697,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

282
0:13:41.776,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but it's the impetus behind what's become the most successful breeding program

283
0:13:45.986,000 --> 0:13:46,000
in the world

284
0:13:47.165,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of an animal that was on the very brink of being wiped out.

285
0:13:50.678,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And isn't that just wonderful?

286
0:13:53.471,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Thank you.

287
0:13:54.674,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

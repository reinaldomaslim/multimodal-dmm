1
0:00:13.04,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So a few years ago,

2
0:00:14.719,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I did something really brave,

3
0:00:17.68,000 --> 0:00:19,000
or some would say really stupid.

4
0:00:20.84,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I ran for Congress.

5
0:00:23.04,000 --> 0:00:26,000
For years, I had existed safely behind the scenes in politics

6
0:00:26.8,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as a fundraiser, as an organizer,

7
0:00:29.88,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but in my heart, I always wanted to run.

8
0:00:33.68,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The sitting congresswoman had been in my district since 1992.

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
She had never lost a race,

10
0:00:40.08,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and no one had really even run against her in a Democratic primary.

11
0:00:44.68,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But in my mind, this was my way

12
0:00:47.56,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to make a difference,

13
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to disrupt the status quo.

14
0:00:51.96,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The polls, however, told a very different story.

15
0:00:55.92,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My pollsters told me that I was crazy to run,

16
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that there was no way that I could win.

17
0:01:02.76,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But I ran anyway,

18
0:01:04.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and in 2012, I became an upstart in a New York City congressional race.

19
0:01:09.32,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I swore I was going to win.

20
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I had the endorsement from the New York Daily News,

21
0:01:15.64,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the Wall Street Journal snapped pictures of me on election day,

22
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and CNBC called it one of the hottest races in the country.

23
0:01:23.28,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I raised money from everyone I knew,

24
0:01:25.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
including Indian aunties

25
0:01:27.64,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that were just so happy an Indian girl was running.

26
0:01:31.24,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But on election day, the polls were right,

27
0:01:34.44,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I only got 19 percent of the vote,

28
0:01:37.92,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and the same papers that said I was a rising political star

29
0:01:41.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars

30
0:01:46.12,000 --> 0:01:51,000
on 6,321 votes.

31
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Don't do the math.

32
0:01:53.44,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It was humiliating.

33
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now, before you get the wrong idea,

34
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
this is not a talk about the importance of failure.

35
0:02:02.04,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Nor is it about leaning in.

36
0:02:04.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I tell you the story of how I ran for Congress

37
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because I was 33 years old

38
0:02:10.12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and it was the first time in my entire life

39
0:02:14.88,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that I had done something that was truly brave,

40
0:02:18.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
where I didn't worry about being perfect.

41
0:02:21.639,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I'm not alone:

42
0:02:23.12,000 --> 0:02:24,000
so many women I talk to tell me

43
0:02:24.88,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that they gravitate towards careers and professions

44
0:02:27.8,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that they know they're going to be great in,

45
0:02:29.92,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that they know they're going to be perfect in,

46
0:02:32.32,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and it's no wonder why.

47
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Most girls are taught to avoid risk and failure.

48
0:02:37.24,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We're taught to smile pretty,

49
0:02:39.04,000 --> 0:02:41,000
play it safe, get all A's.

50
0:02:42.32,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Boys, on the other hand,

51
0:02:44.04,000 --> 0:02:46,000
are taught to play rough, swing high,

52
0:02:46.84,000 --> 0:02:5,000
crawl to the top of the monkey bars and then just jump off headfirst.

53
0:02:52.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And by the time they're adults,

54
0:02:53.8,000 --> 0:02:57,000
whether they're negotiating a raise or even asking someone out on a date,

55
0:02:58.6,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they're habituated to take risk after risk.

56
0:03:02.52,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They're rewarded for it.

57
0:03:04.32,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's often said in Silicon Valley,

58
0:03:06.88,000 --> 0:03:1,000
no one even takes you seriously unless you've had two failed start-ups.

59
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:12,000
In other words,

60
0:03:13.44,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we're raising our girls to be perfect,

61
0:03:16.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and we're raising our boys to be brave.

62
0:03:21.08,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Some people worry about our federal deficit,

63
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but I, I worry about our bravery deficit.

64
0:03:30.24,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Our economy, our society, we're just losing out

65
0:03:33.72,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because we're not raising our girls to be brave.

66
0:03:36.92,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The bravery deficit is why women are underrepresented in STEM,

67
0:03:40.32,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress,

68
0:03:42.28,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and pretty much everywhere you look.

69
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck

70
0:03:49.2,000 --> 0:03:51,000
looked at how bright fifth graders handled an assignment

71
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that was too difficult for them.

72
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
She found that bright girls were quick to give up.

73
0:03:58.2,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The higher the IQ, the more likely they were to give up.

74
0:04:02.52,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Bright boys, on the other hand,

75
0:04:04.28,000 --> 0:04:06,000
found the difficult material to be a challenge.

76
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They found it energizing.

77
0:04:08.76,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They were more likely to redouble their efforts.

78
0:04:12.68,000 --> 0:04:13,000
What's going on?

79
0:04:14.52,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Well, at the fifth grade level,

80
0:04:16.04,000 --> 0:04:19,000
girls routinely outperform boys in every subject,

81
0:04:19.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
including math and science,

82
0:04:21.88,000 --> 0:04:23,000
so it's not a question of ability.

83
0:04:25.56,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The difference is in how boys and girls approach a challenge.

84
0:04:30.2,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And it doesn't just end in fifth grade.

85
0:04:32.8,000 --> 0:04:35,000
An HP report found that men will apply for a job

86
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
if they meet only 60 percent of the qualifications,

87
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but women, women will apply

88
0:04:42.76,000 --> 0:04:46,000
only if they meet 100 percent of the qualifications.

89
0:04:47.36,000 --> 0:04:48,000
100 percent.

90
0:04:49.72,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This study is usually invoked as evidence that, well,

91
0:04:53.08,000 --> 0:04:54,000
women need a little more confidence.

92
0:04:55.36,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But I think it's evidence

93
0:04:56.88,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that women have been socialized to aspire to perfection,

94
0:05:00.04,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and they're overly cautious.

95
0:05:01.6,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Applause)

96
0:05:04.44,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And even when we're ambitious,

97
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:08,000
even when we're leaning in,

98
0:05:09.32,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that socialization of perfection

99
0:05:11.56,000 --> 0:05:14,000
has caused us to take less risks in our careers.

100
0:05:15.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so those 600,000 jobs that are open right now

101
0:05:19.92,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in computing and tech,

102
0:05:21.8,000 --> 0:05:22,000
women are being left behind,

103
0:05:23.72,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and it means our economy is being left behind

104
0:05:26.4,000 --> 0:05:3,000
on all the innovation and problems women would solve

105
0:05:30.6,000 --> 0:05:32,000
if they were socialized to be brave

106
0:05:33.36,000 --> 0:05:36,000
instead of socialized to be perfect.

107
0:05:36.96,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Applause)

108
0:05:40.92,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So in 2012, I started a company to teach girls to code,

109
0:05:45.28,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and what I found is that by teaching them to code

110
0:05:48.36,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I had socialized them to be brave.

111
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Coding, it's an endless process of trial and error,

112
0:05:55.48,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of trying to get the right command in the right place,

113
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
with sometimes just a semicolon

114
0:06:01.12,000 --> 0:06:04,000
making the difference between success and failure.

115
0:06:04.84,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Code breaks and then it falls apart,

116
0:06:07.36,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and it often takes many, many tries

117
0:06:09.8,000 --> 0:06:11,000
until that magical moment

118
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
when what you're trying to build comes to life.

119
0:06:15.76,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It requires perseverance.

120
0:06:18.6,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It requires imperfection.

121
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We immediately see in our program

122
0:06:24.56,000 --> 0:06:26,000
our girls' fear of not getting it right,

123
0:06:26.92,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of not being perfect.

124
0:06:28.84,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Every Girls Who Code teacher tells me the same story.

125
0:06:32.04,000 --> 0:06:34,000
During the first week, when the girls are learning how to code,

126
0:06:35.04,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a student will call her over and she'll say,

127
0:06:38.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"I don't know what code to write."

128
0:06:40.08,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The teacher will look at her screen,

129
0:06:42.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and she'll see a blank text editor.

130
0:06:44.64,000 --> 0:06:46,000
If she didn't know any better, she'd think that her student

131
0:06:47.48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
spent the past 20 minutes just staring at the screen.

132
0:06:51.4,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But if she presses undo a few times,

133
0:06:54.6,000 --> 0:06:57,000
she'll see that her student wrote code and then deleted it.

134
0:06:58.84,000 --> 0:07:01,000
She tried, she came close,

135
0:07:02.12,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but she didn't get it exactly right.

136
0:07:05.04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Instead of showing the progress that she made,

137
0:07:07.68,000 --> 0:07:08,000
she'd rather show nothing at all.

138
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Perfection or bust.

139
0:07:14.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It turns out that our girls are really good at coding,

140
0:07:19.84,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but it's not enough just to teach them to code.

141
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:25,000
My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor at the University of Columbia

142
0:07:25.935,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and teaches intro to Java

143
0:07:27.72,000 --> 0:07:3,000
tells me about his office hours with computer science students.

144
0:07:32.12,000 --> 0:07:34,000
When the guys are struggling with an assignment,

145
0:07:34.4,000 --> 0:07:35,000
they'll come in and they'll say,

146
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Professor, there's something wrong with my code."

147
0:07:38.88,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The girls will come in and say,

148
0:07:40.4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Professor, there's something wrong with me."

149
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We have to begin to undo the socialization of perfection,

150
0:07:48.84,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but we've got to combine it with building a sisterhood

151
0:07:51.48,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that lets girls know that they are not alone.

152
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Because trying harder is not going to fix a broken system.

153
0:07:59.68,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I can't tell you how many women tell me,

154
0:08:01.96,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"I'm afraid to raise my hand,

155
0:08:03.76,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I'm afraid to ask a question,

156
0:08:05.92,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because I don't want to be the only one

157
0:08:08.32,000 --> 0:08:09,000
who doesn't understand,

158
0:08:10.36,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the only one who is struggling.

159
0:08:13.84,000 --> 0:08:15,000
When we teach girls to be brave

160
0:08:16.76,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and we have a supportive network cheering them on,

161
0:08:20.08,000 --> 0:08:23,000
they will build incredible things,

162
0:08:23.12,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and I see this every day.

163
0:08:26.52,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Take, for instance, two of our high school students

164
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
who built a game called Tampon Run --

165
0:08:31.56,000 --> 0:08:33,000
yes, Tampon Run --

166
0:08:34.04,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to fight against the menstruation taboo

167
0:08:36.48,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and sexism in gaming.

168
0:08:39.84,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Or the Syrian refugee

169
0:08:41.44,000 --> 0:08:44,000
who dared show her love for her new country

170
0:08:45.6,000 --> 0:08:49,000
by building an app to help Americans get to the polls.

171
0:08:50.76,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Or a 16-year-old girl who built an algorithm

172
0:08:55.039,000 --> 0:09:,000
to help detect whether a cancer is benign or malignant

173
0:09:00.12,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in the off chance that she can save her daddy's life

174
0:09:03.52,000 --> 0:09:05,000
because he has cancer.

175
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
These are just three examples of thousands,

176
0:09:12.12,000 --> 0:09:16,000
thousands of girls who have been socialized to be imperfect,

177
0:09:16.24,000 --> 0:09:18,000
who have learned to keep trying, who have learned perseverance.

178
0:09:19.217,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And whether they become coders

179
0:09:21.24,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé,

180
0:09:23.92,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they will not defer their dreams.

181
0:09:27.96,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And those dreams have never been more important for our country.

182
0:09:33.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
For the American economy, for any economy to grow,

183
0:09:36.48,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to truly innovate,

184
0:09:38.64,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we cannot leave behind half our population.

185
0:09:42.64,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We have to socialize our girls to be comfortable with imperfection,

186
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and we've got to do it now.

187
0:09:50.4,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We cannot wait for them to learn how to be brave like I did

188
0:09:54.64,000 --> 0:09:56,000
when I was 33 years old.

189
0:09:57.24,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We have to teach them to be brave in schools

190
0:09:59.6,000 --> 0:10:,000
and early in their careers,

191
0:10:01.36,000 --> 0:10:04,000
when it has the most potential to impact their lives

192
0:10:04.52,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and the lives of others,

193
0:10:06.56,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and we have to show them that they will be loved and accepted

194
0:10:11.36,000 --> 0:10:14,000
not for being perfect

195
0:10:14.44,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but for being courageous.

196
0:10:17.84,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And so I need each of you to tell every young woman you know --

197
0:10:21.68,000 --> 0:10:24,000
your sister, your niece, your employee, your colleague --

198
0:10:25.12,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to be comfortable with imperfection,

199
0:10:28.36,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because when we teach girls to be imperfect,

200
0:10:30.88,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and we help them leverage it,

201
0:10:33.48,000 --> 0:10:36,000
we will build a movement of young women who are brave

202
0:10:37.4,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and who will build a better world for themselves

203
0:10:40.8,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and for each and every one of us.

204
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Thank you.

205
0:10:46.4,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause)

206
0:10:51.08,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Thank you.

207
0:10:57.32,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you.

208
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It's such a powerful vision you have. You have a vision.

209
0:11:03.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Tell me how it's going.

210
0:11:05.44,000 --> 0:11:07,000
How many girls are involved now in your program?

211
0:11:07.72,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Reshma Saujani: Yeah. So in 2012, we taught 20 girls.

212
0:11:11.4,000 --> 0:11:14,000
This year we'll teach 40,000 in all 50 states.

213
0:11:14.96,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Applause)

214
0:11:16.24,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And that number is really powerful,

215
0:11:19.32,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because last year we only graduated 7,500 women in computer science.

216
0:11:24.64,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Like, the problem is so bad

217
0:11:27.24,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that we can make that type of change quickly.

218
0:11:30.6,000 --> 0:11:33,000
CA: And you're working with some of the companies in this room even,

219
0:11:33.84,000 --> 0:11:35,000
who are welcoming graduates from your program?

220
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:37,000
RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners,

221
0:11:38.04,000 --> 0:11:4,000
from Twitter to Facebook

222
0:11:40.12,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft to Pixar to Disney,

223
0:11:44.64,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I mean, every single company out there.

224
0:11:46.56,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And if you're not signed up, I'm going to find you,

225
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:5,000
because we need every single tech company

226
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to embed a Girls Who Code classroom in their office.

227
0:11:53.8,000 --> 0:11:55,000
CA: And you have some stories back from some of those companies

228
0:11:56.8,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that when you mix in more gender balance

229
0:11:58.729,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in the engineering teams, good things happen.

230
0:12:02.2,000 --> 0:12:03,000
RS: Great things happen.

231
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I mean, I think that it's crazy to me to think about the fact

232
0:12:06.96,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that right now 85 percent of all consumer purchases are made by women.

233
0:12:10.84,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Women use social media at a rate of 600 percent more than men.

234
0:12:13.92,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We own the Internet,

235
0:12:15.36,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and we should be building the companies of tomorrow.

236
0:12:17.84,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And I think when companies have diverse teams,

237
0:12:20.04,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and they have incredible women that are part of their engineering teams,

238
0:12:23.48,000 --> 0:12:25,000
they build awesome things, and we see it every day.

239
0:12:25.92,000 --> 0:12:28,000
CA: Reshma, you saw the reaction there. You're doing incredibly important work.

240
0:12:29.68,000 --> 0:12:32,000
This whole community is cheering you on. More power to you. Thank you.

241
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
RS: Thank you.

242
0:12:34.24,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Applause)

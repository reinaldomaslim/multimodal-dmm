1
0:00:12.815,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'd like to talk today

2
0:00:14.45,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about how we can change our brains

3
0:00:16.922,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and our society.

4
0:00:19.515,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Meet Joe.

5
0:00:21.69,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Joe's 32 years old and a murderer.

6
0:00:25.408,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I met Joe 13 years ago on the lifer wing

7
0:00:28.15,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at Wormwood Scrubs high-security prison in London.

8
0:00:31.97,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'd like you to imagine this place.

9
0:00:33.971,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It looks and feels like it sounds:

10
0:00:37.069,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Wormwood Scrubs.

11
0:00:39.451,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Built at the end of the Victorian Era

12
0:00:41.675,000 --> 0:00:42,000
by the inmates themselves,

13
0:00:43.187,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it is where England's most dangerous prisoners are kept.

14
0:00:46.387,000 --> 0:00:48,000
These individuals have committed acts

15
0:00:48.593,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of unspeakable evil.

16
0:00:50.763,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I was there to study their brains.

17
0:00:54.474,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I was part of a team of researchers

18
0:00:56.226,000 --> 0:00:57,000
from University College London,

19
0:00:57.903,000 --> 0:00:59,000
on a grant from the U.K. department of health.

20
0:01:00.658,000 --> 0:01:02,000
My task was to study a group of inmates

21
0:01:02.706,000 --> 0:01:04,000
who had been clinically diagnosed as psychopaths.

22
0:01:05.45,000 --> 0:01:06,000
That meant they were the most

23
0:01:07.175,000 --> 0:01:08,000
callous and the most aggressive

24
0:01:08.888,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of the entire prison population.

25
0:01:12.012,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What lay at the root of their behavior?

26
0:01:15.589,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Was there a neurological cause for their condition?

27
0:01:19.915,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And if there was a neurological cause,

28
0:01:22.758,000 --> 0:01:25,000
could we find a cure?

29
0:01:25.813,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So I'd like to speak about change, and especially about emotional change.

30
0:01:29.758,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Growing up, I was always intrigued

31
0:01:31.738,000 --> 0:01:34,000
by how people change.

32
0:01:34.802,000 --> 0:01:36,000
My mother, a clinical psychotherapist,

33
0:01:37.325,000 --> 0:01:39,000
would occasionally see patients at home

34
0:01:39.965,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the evening.

35
0:01:41.385,000 --> 0:01:42,000
She would shut the door to the living room,

36
0:01:42.919,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I imagined

37
0:01:44.924,000 --> 0:01:46,000
magical things happened in that room.

38
0:01:47.436,000 --> 0:01:48,000
At the age of five or six

39
0:01:49.117,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I would creep up in my pajamas

40
0:01:51.559,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and sit outside with my ear glued to the door.

41
0:01:54.368,000 --> 0:01:55,000
On more than one occasion, I fell asleep

42
0:01:55.815,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and they had to push me out of the way

43
0:01:57.275,000 --> 0:01:59,000
at the end of the session.

44
0:01:59.436,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I suppose that's how I found myself

45
0:02:02.335,000 --> 0:02:04,000
walking into the secure interview room

46
0:02:04.41,000 --> 0:02:08,000
on my first day at Wormwood Scrubs.

47
0:02:08.419,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Joe sat across a steel table

48
0:02:10.755,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and greeted me with this blank expression.

49
0:02:14.981,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The prison warden, looking equally indifferent,

50
0:02:17.859,000 --> 0:02:19,000
said, "Any trouble, just press the red buzzer,

51
0:02:20.506,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we'll be around as soon as we can."

52
0:02:22.945,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:25.903,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I sat down.

54
0:02:27.673,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The heavy metal door slammed shut behind me.

55
0:02:30.65,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I looked up at the red buzzer

56
0:02:32.744,000 --> 0:02:34,000
far behind Joe on the opposite wall.

57
0:02:34.843,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:37.489,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I looked at Joe.

59
0:02:39.251,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Perhaps detecting my concern,

60
0:02:41.328,000 --> 0:02:42,000
he leaned forward, and said,

61
0:02:42.684,000 --> 0:02:44,000
as reassuringly as he could,

62
0:02:44.911,000 --> 0:02:45,000
"Ah, don't worry about the buzzer,

63
0:02:46.291,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it doesn't work anyway."

64
0:02:48.544,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:55.472,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Over the subsequent months,

66
0:02:57.361,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we tested Joe and his fellow inmates,

67
0:03:01.446,000 --> 0:03:03,000
looking specifically at their ability

68
0:03:03.497,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to categorize different images of emotion.

69
0:03:08.481,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And we looked at their physical response

70
0:03:10.267,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to those emotions.

71
0:03:12.009,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So, for example, when most of us look

72
0:03:13.59,000 --> 0:03:15,000
at a picture like this of somebody looking sad,

73
0:03:16.515,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we instantly have a slight,

74
0:03:20.066,000 --> 0:03:21,000
measurable physical response:

75
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
increased heart rate, sweating of the skin.

76
0:03:25.298,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Whilst the psychopaths in our study were able

77
0:03:27.082,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to describe the pictures accurately,

78
0:03:29.096,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they failed to show the emotions required.

79
0:03:32.829,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They failed to show a physical response.

80
0:03:36.382,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It was as though they knew the words

81
0:03:38.433,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but not the music of empathy.

82
0:03:41.826,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So we wanted to look closer at this

83
0:03:43.61,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to use MRI to image their brains.

84
0:03:47.059,000 --> 0:03:5,000
That turned out to be not such an easy task.

85
0:03:50.166,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Imagine transporting a collection

86
0:03:51.995,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of clinical psychopaths across central London

87
0:03:54.69,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in shackles and handcuffs

88
0:03:56.829,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in rush hour,

89
0:03:58.955,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and in order to place each of them in an MRI scanner,

90
0:04:02.129,000 --> 0:04:03,000
you have to remove all metal objects,

91
0:04:04.11,000 --> 0:04:05,000
including shackles and handcuffs,

92
0:04:05.444,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and, as I learned, all body piercings.

93
0:04:09.799,000 --> 0:04:13,000
After some time, however, we had a tentative answer.

94
0:04:14.036,000 --> 0:04:16,000
These individuals were not just the victims

95
0:04:16.854,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of a troubled childhood.

96
0:04:18.906,000 --> 0:04:2,000
There was something else.

97
0:04:21.427,000 --> 0:04:24,000
People like Joe have a deficit in a brain area

98
0:04:25.047,000 --> 0:04:27,000
called the amygdala.

99
0:04:27.108,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The amygdala is an almond-shaped organ

100
0:04:29.132,000 --> 0:04:32,000
deep within each of the hemispheres of the brain.

101
0:04:32.455,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It is thought to be key to the experience of empathy.

102
0:04:36.94,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Normally, the more empathic a person is,

103
0:04:39.846,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the larger and more active their amygdala is.

104
0:04:42.891,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Our population of inmates

105
0:04:44.371,000 --> 0:04:45,000
had a deficient amygdala,

106
0:04:45.698,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which likely led to their lack of empathy

107
0:04:47.993,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and to their immoral behavior.

108
0:04:50.927,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So let's take a step back.

109
0:04:54.069,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Normally, acquiring moral behavior

110
0:04:56.692,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is simply part of growing up,

111
0:04:59.082,000 --> 0:05:01,000
like learning to speak.

112
0:05:01.283,000 --> 0:05:04,000
At the age of six months, virtually every one of us

113
0:05:04.574,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is able to differentiate between animate and inanimate objects.

114
0:05:08.531,000 --> 0:05:1,000
At the age of 12 months,

115
0:05:11.005,000 --> 0:05:14,000
most children are able to imitate

116
0:05:14.229,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the purposeful actions of others.

117
0:05:16.114,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So for example, your mother raises her hands

118
0:05:18.649,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to stretch, and you imitate her behavior.

119
0:05:21.388,000 --> 0:05:24,000
At first, this isn't perfect.

120
0:05:24.589,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I remember my cousin Sasha,

121
0:05:26.536,000 --> 0:05:28,000
two years old at the time,

122
0:05:28.699,000 --> 0:05:29,000
looking through a picture book

123
0:05:30.359,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand,

124
0:05:33.542,000 --> 0:05:35,000
licking one finger and flicking the page with the other hand.

125
0:05:35.647,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

126
0:05:37.961,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Bit by bit, we build the foundations of the social brain

127
0:05:41.887,000 --> 0:05:45,000
so that by the time we're three, four years old,

128
0:05:46.519,000 --> 0:05:47,000
most children, not all,

129
0:05:47.811,000 --> 0:05:48,000
have acquired the ability to understand

130
0:05:49.584,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the intentions of others,

131
0:05:51.187,000 --> 0:05:54,000
another prerequisite for empathy.

132
0:05:54.513,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The fact that this developmental progression

133
0:05:57.125,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is universal,

134
0:05:58.627,000 --> 0:05:59,000
irrespective of where you live in the world

135
0:06:00.603,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or which culture you inhabit,

136
0:06:03.229,000 --> 0:06:05,000
strongly suggests that the foundations

137
0:06:05.442,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of moral behavior are inborn.

138
0:06:08.566,000 --> 0:06:1,000
If you doubt this,

139
0:06:11.043,000 --> 0:06:14,000
try, as I've done, to renege on a promise you've made

140
0:06:14.819,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to a four-year-old.

141
0:06:16.896,000 --> 0:06:17,000
You will find that the mind of a four-year old

142
0:06:18.684,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is not naïve in the slightest.

143
0:06:20.188,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It is more akin to a Swiss army knife

144
0:06:23.213,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with fixed mental modules

145
0:06:25.244,000 --> 0:06:27,000
finely honed during development

146
0:06:27.718,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and a sharp sense of fairness.

147
0:06:30.835,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The early years are crucial.

148
0:06:33.493,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There seems to be a window of opportunity,

149
0:06:35.737,000 --> 0:06:37,000
after which mastering moral questions

150
0:06:38.203,000 --> 0:06:39,000
becomes more difficult,

151
0:06:39.685,000 --> 0:06:43,000
like adults learning a foreign language.

152
0:06:43.819,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's not to say it's impossible.

153
0:06:45.853,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A recent, wonderful study from Stanford University

154
0:06:48.962,000 --> 0:06:5,000
showed that people who have played

155
0:06:51.203,000 --> 0:06:53,000
a virtual reality game in which they took on

156
0:06:53.612,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the role of a good and helpful superhero

157
0:06:56.073,000 --> 0:06:58,000
actually became more caring and helpful

158
0:06:58.189,000 --> 0:07:,000
towards others afterwards.

159
0:07:00.692,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now I'm not suggesting

160
0:07:02.901,000 --> 0:07:05,000
we endow criminals with superpowers,

161
0:07:05.956,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but I am suggesting that we need to find ways

162
0:07:09.369,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to get Joe and people like him

163
0:07:11.247,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to change their brains and their behavior,

164
0:07:13.892,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for their benefit

165
0:07:15.667,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and for the benefit of the rest of us.

166
0:07:18.802,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So can brains change?

167
0:07:22.337,000 --> 0:07:24,000
For over 100 years,

168
0:07:24.921,000 --> 0:07:27,000
neuroanatomists and later neuroscientists

169
0:07:28.035,000 --> 0:07:31,000
held the view that after initial development in childhood,

170
0:07:31.855,000 --> 0:07:33,000
no new brain cells could grow

171
0:07:34.279,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in the adult human brain.

172
0:07:35.58,000 --> 0:07:36,000
The brain could only change

173
0:07:37.067,000 --> 0:07:38,000
within certain set limits.

174
0:07:39.049,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That was the dogma.

175
0:07:41.147,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But then, in the 1990s,

176
0:07:43.386,000 --> 0:07:44,000
studies starting showing,

177
0:07:45.082,000 --> 0:07:47,000
following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others,

178
0:07:47.819,000 --> 0:07:5,000
studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis,

179
0:07:51.154,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the birth of new brain cells

180
0:07:53.212,000 --> 0:07:56,000
in the adult mammalian brain,

181
0:07:56.281,000 --> 0:07:57,000
first in the olfactory bulb,

182
0:07:57.865,000 --> 0:07:59,000
which is responsible for our sense of smell,

183
0:07:59.946,000 --> 0:08:01,000
then in the hippocampus

184
0:08:01.985,000 --> 0:08:03,000
involving short-term memory,

185
0:08:04.029,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and finally in the amygdala itself.

186
0:08:07.312,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In order to understand

187
0:08:09.088,000 --> 0:08:1,000
how this process works,

188
0:08:11.047,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I left the psychopaths and joined a lab in Oxford

189
0:08:13.936,000 --> 0:08:16,000
specializing in learning and development.

190
0:08:17.198,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Instead of psychopaths, I studied mice,

191
0:08:20.968,000 --> 0:08:22,000
because the same pattern of brain responses

192
0:08:23.309,000 --> 0:08:26,000
appears across many different species of social animals.

193
0:08:27.039,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So if you rear a mouse in a standard cage,

194
0:08:31.621,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a shoebox, essentially, with cotton wool,

195
0:08:34.309,000 --> 0:08:35,000
alone and without much stimulation,

196
0:08:35.876,000 --> 0:08:36,000
not only does it not thrive,

197
0:08:37.487,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but it will often develop strange,

198
0:08:39.244,000 --> 0:08:4,000
repetitive behaviors.

199
0:08:40.818,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This naturally sociable animal

200
0:08:43.437,000 --> 0:08:45,000
will lose its ability to bond with other mice,

201
0:08:45.88,000 --> 0:08:49,000
even becoming aggressive when introduced to them.

202
0:08:50.075,000 --> 0:08:52,000
However, mice reared in what we called

203
0:08:52.137,000 --> 0:08:53,000
an enriched environment,

204
0:08:53.643,000 --> 0:08:55,000
a large habitation with other mice

205
0:08:55.854,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with wheels and ladders and areas to explore,

206
0:08:59.284,000 --> 0:09:,000
demonstrate neurogenesis,

207
0:09:00.869,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the birth of new brain cells,

208
0:09:03.169,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and as we showed, they also perform better

209
0:09:05.483,000 --> 0:09:07,000
on a range of learning and memory tasks.

210
0:09:08.2,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Now, they don't develop morality to the point of

211
0:09:10.63,000 --> 0:09:11,000
carrying the shopping bags of little old mice

212
0:09:12.39,000 --> 0:09:14,000
across the street,

213
0:09:14.611,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but their improved environment results in healthy,

214
0:09:17.354,000 --> 0:09:18,000
sociable behavior.

215
0:09:19.267,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Mice reared in a standard cage, by contrast,

216
0:09:22.21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
not dissimilar, you might say, from a prison cell,

217
0:09:24.675,000 --> 0:09:27,000
have dramatically lower levels of new neurons

218
0:09:27.976,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in the brain.

219
0:09:29.603,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It is now clear that the amygdala of mammals,

220
0:09:32.419,000 --> 0:09:33,000
including primates like us,

221
0:09:33.925,000 --> 0:09:35,000
can show neurogenesis.

222
0:09:36.437,000 --> 0:09:37,000
In some areas of the brain,

223
0:09:37.723,000 --> 0:09:4,000
more than 20 percent of cells are newly formed.

224
0:09:41.418,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We're just beginning to understand

225
0:09:43.677,000 --> 0:09:45,000
what exact function these cells have,

226
0:09:45.771,000 --> 0:09:47,000
but what it implies is that the brain is capable

227
0:09:48.697,000 --> 0:09:53,000
of extraordinary change way into adulthood.

228
0:09:53.89,000 --> 0:09:54,000
However, our brains are also

229
0:09:55.624,000 --> 0:09:58,000
exquisitely sensitive to stress in our environment.

230
0:09:59.264,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Stress hormones, glucocorticoids,

231
0:10:01.814,000 --> 0:10:02,000
released by the brain,

232
0:10:03.364,000 --> 0:10:06,000
suppress the growth of these new cells.

233
0:10:06.925,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The more stress, the less brain development,

234
0:10:09.473,000 --> 0:10:13,000
which in turn causes less adaptability

235
0:10:13.941,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and causes higher stress levels.

236
0:10:16.684,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is the interplay between nature and nurture

237
0:10:20.469,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in real time in front of our eyes.

238
0:10:24.174,000 --> 0:10:26,000
When you think about it,

239
0:10:26.241,000 --> 0:10:28,000
it is ironic that our current solution

240
0:10:28.616,000 --> 0:10:29,000
for people with stressed amygdalae

241
0:10:30.542,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is to place them in an environment

242
0:10:32.334,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that actually inhibits any chance of further growth.

243
0:10:36.663,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Of course, imprisonment is a necessary part

244
0:10:39.15,000 --> 0:10:41,000
of the criminal justice system

245
0:10:41.57,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and of protecting society.

246
0:10:43.335,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Our research does not suggest

247
0:10:44.972,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that criminals should submit their MRI scans

248
0:10:47.189,000 --> 0:10:48,000
as evidence in court

249
0:10:48.611,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and get off the hook because they've got a faulty amygdala.

250
0:10:52.269,000 --> 0:10:54,000
The evidence is actually the other way.

251
0:10:54.342,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Because our brains are capable of change,

252
0:10:57.193,000 --> 0:10:59,000
we need to take responsibility for our actions,

253
0:10:59.691,000 --> 0:11:,000
and they need to take responsibility

254
0:11:01.543,000 --> 0:11:04,000
for their rehabilitation.

255
0:11:04.971,000 --> 0:11:05,000
One way such rehabilitation might work

256
0:11:06.775,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is through restorative justice programs.

257
0:11:10.068,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here victims, if they choose to participate,

258
0:11:12.397,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and perpetrators meet face to face

259
0:11:14.638,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in safe, structured encounters,

260
0:11:17.338,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and the perpetrator is encouraged

261
0:11:19.168,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to take responsibility for their actions,

262
0:11:21.137,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and the victim plays an active role in the process.

263
0:11:24.366,000 --> 0:11:26,000
In such a setting, the perpetrator can see,

264
0:11:27.237,000 --> 0:11:29,000
perhaps for the first time,

265
0:11:29.572,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the victim as a real person

266
0:11:31.976,000 --> 0:11:32,000
with thoughts and feelings and a genuine

267
0:11:33.645,000 --> 0:11:34,000
emotional response.

268
0:11:35.483,000 --> 0:11:36,000
This stimulates the amygdala

269
0:11:37.374,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice

270
0:11:40.925,000 --> 0:11:43,000
than simple incarceration.

271
0:11:43.991,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Such programs won't work for everyone,

272
0:11:45.576,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but for many, it could be a way

273
0:11:48.265,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to break the frozen sea within.

274
0:11:52.626,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So what can we do now?

275
0:11:55.385,000 --> 0:11:57,000
How can we apply this knowledge?

276
0:11:57.897,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I'd like to leave you with

277
0:12:00.218,000 --> 0:12:01,000
three lessons that I learned.

278
0:12:01.963,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The first thing that I learned was that

279
0:12:04.133,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we need to change our mindset.

280
0:12:05.659,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Since Wormwood Scrubs was built 130 years ago,

281
0:12:08.808,000 --> 0:12:11,000
society has advanced in virtually every aspect,

282
0:12:11.923,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in the way we run our schools, our hospitals.

283
0:12:15.337,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Yet the moment we speak about prisons,

284
0:12:17.42,000 --> 0:12:19,000
it's as though we're back in Dickensian times,

285
0:12:20.316,000 --> 0:12:22,000
if not medieval times.

286
0:12:22.54,000 --> 0:12:24,000
For too long, I believe,

287
0:12:24.774,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we've allowed ourselves to be persuaded

288
0:12:28.439,000 --> 0:12:31,000
of the false notion that human nature cannot change,

289
0:12:31.481,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and as a society, it's costing us dearly.

290
0:12:35.144,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We know that the brain is capable of extraordinary change,

291
0:12:39.02,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and the best way to achieve that,

292
0:12:42.059,000 --> 0:12:44,000
even in adults, is to change and modulate

293
0:12:44.471,000 --> 0:12:45,000
our environment.

294
0:12:46.266,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The second thing I have learned

295
0:12:49.151,000 --> 0:12:51,000
is that we need to create an alliance

296
0:12:51.777,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of people who believe that science is integral

297
0:12:55.278,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to bringing about social change.

298
0:12:57.56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's easy enough for a neuroscientist to place

299
0:13:00.533,000 --> 0:13:02,000
a high-security inmate in an MRI scanner.

300
0:13:02.712,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Well actually, that turns out not to be so easy,

301
0:13:05.22,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but ultimately what we want to show

302
0:13:07.879,000 --> 0:13:1,000
is whether we're able to reduce the reoffending rates.

303
0:13:11.647,000 --> 0:13:13,000
In order to answer complex questions like that,

304
0:13:14.368,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we need people of different backgrounds --

305
0:13:17.019,000 --> 0:13:19,000
lab-based scientists and clinicians,

306
0:13:19.223,000 --> 0:13:21,000
social workers and policy makers,

307
0:13:21.613,000 --> 0:13:23,000
philanthropists and human rights activists —

308
0:13:24.236,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to work together.

309
0:13:26.162,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Finally, I believe we need

310
0:13:27.849,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to change our own amygdalae,

311
0:13:29.487,000 --> 0:13:31,000
because this issue goes to the heart

312
0:13:32.268,000 --> 0:13:33,000
not just of who Joe is,

313
0:13:34.039,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but who we are.

314
0:13:35.951,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We need to change our view of Joe

315
0:13:38.931,000 --> 0:13:41,000
as someone wholly irredeemable,

316
0:13:42.733,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because if we see Joe as wholly irredeemable,

317
0:13:46.243,000 --> 0:13:5,000
how is he going to see himself as any different?

318
0:13:50.523,000 --> 0:13:51,000
In another decade, Joe will be released

319
0:13:52.394,000 --> 0:13:54,000
from Wormwood Scrubs.

320
0:13:55.063,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Will he be among the 70 percent of inmates

321
0:13:57.98,000 --> 0:13:58,000
who end up reoffending

322
0:13:59.474,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and returning to the prison system?

323
0:14:02.256,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Wouldn't it be better if, while serving his sentence,

324
0:14:04.892,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Joe was able to train his amygdala,

325
0:14:06.818,000 --> 0:14:08,000
which would stimulate the growth of new brain cells

326
0:14:09.172,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and connections,

327
0:14:10.453,000 --> 0:14:12,000
so that he will be able to face the world

328
0:14:13.049,000 --> 0:14:15,000
once he gets released?

329
0:14:15.169,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Surely, that would be in the interest of all of us.

0:14:21.549,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

331
0:14:24.8,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Thank you. (Applause)

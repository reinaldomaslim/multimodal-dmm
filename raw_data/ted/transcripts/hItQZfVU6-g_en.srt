1
0:00:13.603,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Travel with me

2
0:00:14.817,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to some of the most beautiful spots in cities around the world:

3
0:00:19.452,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Rome's Spanish steps;

4
0:00:21.744,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the historic neighborhoods of Paris and Shanghai;

5
0:00:28.006,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the rolling landscape of Central Park;

6
0:00:31.43,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the tight-knit blocks of Tokyo or Fez;

7
0:00:37.509,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the wildly sloping streets of the favelas of Rio de Janeiro;

8
0:00:42.96,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the dizzying step wells of Jaipur;

9
0:00:48.127,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the arched pedestrian bridges of Venice.

10
0:00:53.165,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now let's go to some newer cities.

11
0:00:56.093,000 --> 0:01:,000
Six downtowns built across six continents in the 20th century.

12
0:01:01.763,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Why do none of these places have any of the charming characteristics

13
0:01:06.741,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of our older cities?

14
0:01:09.7,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Or let's go to six suburbs built on six continents in the 20th century.

15
0:01:16.054,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Why do none of them have any of the lyrical qualities

16
0:01:21.221,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that we associate with the places that we cherish the most?

17
0:01:27.196,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now, maybe you think I'm just being nostalgic --

18
0:01:30.641,000 --> 0:01:31,000
why does it matter?

19
0:01:31.829,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Who cares if there is this creeping sameness besetting our planet?

20
0:01:37.442,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Well, it matters because most people around the world

21
0:01:42.636,000 --> 0:01:44,000
are gravitating to urban areas globally.

22
0:01:46.434,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And how we design those urban areas could well determine

23
0:01:50.585,000 --> 0:01:52,000
whether we thrive or not as a species.

24
0:01:53.934,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So, we already know that people who live in transit-rich areas,

25
0:02:00.54,000 --> 0:02:01,000
live in apartment buildings,

26
0:02:02.145,000 --> 0:02:04,000
have a far lower carbon footprint

27
0:02:04.981,000 --> 0:02:05,000
than their suburban counterparts.

28
0:02:07.276,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So maybe one lesson from that is if you love nature,

29
0:02:10.434,000 --> 0:02:11,000
you shouldn't live in it.

30
0:02:11.707,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

31
0:02:15.157,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But I think the dry statistics

32
0:02:17.331,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of what's known as transit-oriented development

33
0:02:19.624,000 --> 0:02:2,000
only tells part of the story.

34
0:02:22.339,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Because cities, if they're going to attract people,

35
0:02:26.609,000 --> 0:02:27,000
have to be great.

36
0:02:28.306,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They have to be powerful magnets with distinctive appeal

37
0:02:32.641,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to bring in all those new green urbanites.

38
0:02:36.125,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And this is not just an aesthetic issue, mind you.

39
0:02:39.323,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is an issue of international consequence.

40
0:02:43.419,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Because today, every day,

41
0:02:46.982,000 --> 0:02:52,000
literally hundreds of thousands of people are moving into a city somewhere,

42
0:02:53.403,000 --> 0:02:54,000
mainly in the Global South.

43
0:02:56.641,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And when you think about that, ask yourself:

44
0:02:59.688,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Are they condemned to live in the same bland cities

45
0:03:02.339,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we built in the 20th century,

46
0:03:04.411,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or can we offer them something better?

47
0:03:07.736,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And to answer that question,

48
0:03:09.125,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you have to unpack how we got here in the first place.

49
0:03:13.287,000 --> 0:03:15,000
First: mass production.

50
0:03:15.857,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Just like consumer goods and chain stores,

51
0:03:19.334,000 --> 0:03:24,000
we mass-produce glass and steel and concrete and asphalt and drywall,

52
0:03:24.911,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and we deploy them in mind-numbingly similar ways across the planet.

53
0:03:31.165,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Second: regulation.

54
0:03:33.934,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So, take cars, for instance.

55
0:03:36.561,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Cars travel at very high speeds.

56
0:03:39.228,000 --> 0:03:4,000
They're susceptible to human error.

57
0:03:41.188,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So when we're asked, as architects, to design a new street,

58
0:03:44.816,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we have to look at drawings like this,

59
0:03:46.692,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that tell us how high a curb needs to be,

60
0:03:48.792,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that pedestrians need to be over here and vehicles over there,

61
0:03:51.95,000 --> 0:03:53,000
a loading zone here, a drop-off there.

62
0:03:54.823,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What the car really did in the 20th century

63
0:03:57.585,000 --> 0:04:,000
is it created this carved-up, segregated landscape.

64
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Or take the ladder fire truck -- you know, those big ladder trucks

65
0:04:06.885,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that are used to rescue people from burning buildings?

66
0:04:11.776,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Those have such a wide turning radius,

67
0:04:14.109,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that we have to deploy an enormous amount of pavement, of asphalt,

68
0:04:18.966,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to accommodate them.

69
0:04:22.633,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Or take the critically important wheelchair.

70
0:04:25.99,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A wheelchair necessitates a landscape of minimal slopes

71
0:04:30.196,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and redundant vertical circulation.

72
0:04:31.911,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So wherever there's a stair, there has to be an elevator or a ramp.

73
0:04:36.323,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Now, don't get me wrong, please -- I am all for pedestrian safety,

74
0:04:40.721,000 --> 0:04:41,000
firefighting

75
0:04:42.239,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and certainly, wheelchair access.

76
0:04:43.872,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Both of my parents were in wheelchairs at the end of their lives,

77
0:04:46.967,000 --> 0:04:47,000
so I understand very much that struggle.

78
0:04:49.419,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But we also have to acknowledge that all of these well-intentioned rules,

79
0:04:54.608,000 --> 0:04:57,000
they had the tremendous unintended consequence

80
0:04:57.95,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of making illegal the ways in which we used to build cities.

81
0:05:05.191,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Similarly illegal: at the end of the 19th century,

82
0:05:08.388,000 --> 0:05:09,000
right after the elevator was invented,

83
0:05:10.231,000 --> 0:05:13,000
we built these charming urban buildings,

84
0:05:13.403,000 --> 0:05:15,000
these lovely buildings, all over the world,

85
0:05:15.617,000 --> 0:05:16,000
from Italy to India.

86
0:05:17.752,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And they had maybe 10 or 12 apartments in them.

87
0:05:20.561,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They had one small elevator and a staircase that wrapped them

88
0:05:24.267,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and a light well.

89
0:05:25.903,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And not only were they charming buildings that were cost-effective,

90
0:05:29.999,000 --> 0:05:3,000
they were communal --

91
0:05:31.22,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you ran into your neighbor on that stairwell.

92
0:05:35.053,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well, you can't build this, either.

93
0:05:37.506,000 --> 0:05:41,000
By contrast, today, when we have to build a major new apartment building somewhere,

94
0:05:41.712,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we have to build lots and lots of elevators

95
0:05:43.966,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and lots of fire stairs,

96
0:05:45.895,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we have to connect them with these long, anonymous, dreary corridors.

97
0:05:52.524,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, developers -- when they're confronted with the cost

98
0:05:55.968,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of all of that common infrastructure,

99
0:05:58.326,000 --> 0:06:01,000
they have to spread that cost over more apartments,

100
0:06:01.467,000 --> 0:06:03,000
so they want to build bigger buildings.

101
0:06:04.022,000 --> 0:06:08,000
What that results in is the thud,

102
0:06:08.411,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the dull thud of the same apartment building being built

103
0:06:13.514,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in every city across the world.

104
0:06:17.166,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And this is not only creating physical sameness,

105
0:06:20.357,000 --> 0:06:22,000
it's creating social sameness,

106
0:06:22.65,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because these buildings are more expensive to build,

107
0:06:25.784,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and it helped to create an affordability crisis

108
0:06:28.442,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in cities all over the world, including places like Vancouver.

109
0:06:33.688,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, I said there was a third reason for all this sameness,

110
0:06:36.649,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and that's really a psychological one.

111
0:06:39.22,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's a fear of difference,

112
0:06:40.887,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and architects hear this all the time from their clients:

113
0:06:43.711,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"If I try that new idea, will I be sued?

114
0:06:48.165,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Will I be mocked?

115
0:06:50.546,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Better safe than sorry."

116
0:06:53.45,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And all of these things have conspired together

117
0:06:56.998,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to blanket our planet with a homogeneity that I think is deeply problematic.

118
0:07:03.66,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So how can we do the opposite?

119
0:07:05.549,000 --> 0:07:07,000
How can we go back to building cities

120
0:07:07.819,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that are physically and culturally varied again?

121
0:07:11.569,000 --> 0:07:13,000
How can we build cities of difference?

122
0:07:14.823,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I would argue that we should start

123
0:07:17.157,000 --> 0:07:2,000
by injecting into the global the local.

124
0:07:20.814,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This is already happening with food, for instance.

125
0:07:24.076,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You just look at the way in which craft beer has taken on corporate beer.

126
0:07:30.704,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Or, how many of you still eat Wonder Bread?

127
0:07:35.164,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I'd bet most of you don't.

128
0:07:37.196,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I bet you don't because you don't want processed food

129
0:07:39.953,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in your life.

130
0:07:41.151,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So if you don't want processed food,

131
0:07:43.117,000 --> 0:07:45,000
why would you want processed cities?

132
0:07:45.784,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Why would you want these mass-produced, bleached places

133
0:07:48.927,000 --> 0:07:5,000
where all of us have to live and work every day?

134
0:07:53.498,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

135
0:07:58.806,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So, technology was a big part of the problem in the 20th century.

136
0:08:03.528,000 --> 0:08:05,000
When we invented the automobile, what happened is,

137
0:08:06.101,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the world all bent towards the invention.

138
0:08:09.363,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And we recreated our landscape around it.

139
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In the 21st century,

140
0:08:14.649,000 --> 0:08:16,000
technology can be part of the solution --

141
0:08:17.434,000 --> 0:08:19,000
if it bends to the needs of the world.

142
0:08:21.73,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So what do I mean by that?

143
0:08:23.038,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Take the autonomous vehicle.

144
0:08:24.447,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I don't think the autonomous vehicle is exciting because it's a driverless car.

145
0:08:28.217,000 --> 0:08:29,000
That, to me, only implies

146
0:08:29.855,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that there's even more congestion on the roads, frankly.

147
0:08:34.013,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I think what's exciting about the autonomous vehicle is the promise --

148
0:08:37.896,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I want to stress the word "promise,"

149
0:08:39.878,000 --> 0:08:4,000
given the recent accident in Arizona --

150
0:08:42.577,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the promise that we could have these small, urban vehicles

151
0:08:45.91,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that could safely comingle with pedestrians and bicycles.

152
0:08:50.776,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That would enable us to design humane streets again,

153
0:08:54.736,000 --> 0:08:55,000
streets without curbs,

154
0:08:56.372,000 --> 0:08:59,000
maybe streets like the wooden walkways on Fire Island.

155
0:09:01.078,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Or maybe we could design streets with the cobblestone of the 21st century,

156
0:09:06.198,000 --> 0:09:09,000
something that captures kinetic energy, melts snow,

157
0:09:09.691,000 --> 0:09:11,000
helps you with your fitness when you walk.

158
0:09:13.72,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Or remember those big ladder fire trucks?

159
0:09:16.292,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What if we could replace them and all the asphalt that comes with them

160
0:09:20.188,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with drones and robots that could rescue people from burning buildings?

161
0:09:24.212,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And if you think that's outlandish, you'd be amazed to know

162
0:09:27.022,000 --> 0:09:3,000
how much of that technology is already being used today

163
0:09:30.49,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in rescue activity.

164
0:09:33.291,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But now I'd like you to really imagine with me.

165
0:09:36.966,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Imagine if we could design the hovercraft wheelchair.

166
0:09:42.299,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Right?

167
0:09:43.488,000 --> 0:09:46,000
An invention that would not only allow equal access,

168
0:09:47.252,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but would enable us to build the Italian hill town of the 21st century.

169
0:09:54.244,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I think you'd be amazed to know

170
0:09:56.569,000 --> 0:10:,000
that just a few of these inventions, responsive to human need,

171
0:10:01.38,000 --> 0:10:04,000
would completely transform the way we could build our cities.

172
0:10:06.253,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, I bet you're also thinking:

173
0:10:08.352,000 --> 0:10:11,000
"We don't have kinetic cobblestones or flying wheelchairs yet,

174
0:10:12.069,000 --> 0:10:15,000
so what can we do about this problem with today's technology?"

175
0:10:15.99,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And my inspiration for that question comes from a very different city,

176
0:10:20.736,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the city of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.

177
0:10:23.101,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I have clients there

178
0:10:24.288,000 --> 0:10:28,000
who have asked us to design a 21st-century open-air village

179
0:10:28.966,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that's sustainably heated using today's technology,

180
0:10:33.268,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in the heart of their downtown.

181
0:10:35.498,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And that's to cope with their frigid winters.

182
0:10:38.918,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And the project is both poetry and prose.

183
0:10:42.204,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The poetry is really about evoking the local:

184
0:10:46.085,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the mountainous terrain,

185
0:10:47.912,000 --> 0:10:5,000
using colors to pick up the spectacular light,

186
0:10:51.514,000 --> 0:10:54,000
understanding how to interpret the nomadic traditions

187
0:10:55.39,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that animate the nation of Mongolia.

188
0:10:59.427,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The prose has been the development of a catalogue of buildings,

189
0:11:03.204,000 --> 0:11:05,000
of small buildings that are fairly affordable,

190
0:11:06.117,000 --> 0:11:09,000
using local construction materials and technology

191
0:11:09.22,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that can still provide new forms of housing,

192
0:11:12.069,000 --> 0:11:13,000
new workspace,

193
0:11:13.794,000 --> 0:11:14,000
new shops

194
0:11:14.973,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and cultural buildings, like a theater or a museum --

195
0:11:17.501,000 --> 0:11:18,000
even a haunted house.

196
0:11:21.016,000 --> 0:11:22,000
While working on this in our office,

197
0:11:22.838,000 --> 0:11:26,000
we've realized that we're building upon the work of our colleagues,

198
0:11:26.907,000 --> 0:11:3,000
including architect Tatiana Bilbao, working in Mexico City;

199
0:11:32.22,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Pritzker laureate Alejandro Aravena, working in Chile;

200
0:11:36.474,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and recent Pritzker winner Balkrishna Doshi, working in India.

201
0:11:40.506,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And all of them are building spectacular new forms of affordable housing,

202
0:11:45.315,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but they're also building cities of difference,

203
0:11:47.839,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because they're building cities that respond to local communities,

204
0:11:51.934,000 --> 0:11:52,000
local climates

205
0:11:53.636,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and local construction methods.

206
0:11:57.369,000 --> 0:12:,000
We're doubling down on that idea, we're researching a new model

207
0:12:01.358,000 --> 0:12:04,000
for our growing cities with gentrification pressures,

208
0:12:05.184,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that could build upon that late-19th-century model

209
0:12:07.934,000 --> 0:12:08,000
with that center core,

210
0:12:09.434,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but a prototype that could shape-shift in response to local needs

211
0:12:15.153,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and local building materials.

212
0:12:18.906,000 --> 0:12:21,000
All of these ideas, to me, are nostalgia-free.

213
0:12:23.276,000 --> 0:12:25,000
They all tell me

214
0:12:25.307,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that we can build cities that can grow,

215
0:12:28.276,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but grow in a way that reflects the diverse residents

216
0:12:31.038,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that live in those cities;

217
0:12:33.395,000 --> 0:12:37,000
grow in a way that can accommodate all income groups,

218
0:12:38.379,000 --> 0:12:4,000
all colors, creeds, genders.

219
0:12:42.022,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We could build such spectacular cities that we could disincentivize sprawl

220
0:12:47.304,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and actually protect nature.

221
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We can grow cities that are high-tech,

222
0:12:53.834,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but also respond to the timeless cultural needs of the human spirit.

223
0:12:59.778,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I'm convinced that we can build cities of difference

224
0:13:03.238,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that help to create the global mosaic to which so many of us aspire.

225
0:13:07.786,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Thank you.

226
0:13:08.96,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.917,000 --> 0:00:15,000
On the red tiles in my family's den

2
0:00:16.083,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I would dance and sing to the made-for-TV movie "Gypsy,"

3
0:00:20.25,000 --> 0:00:22,000
starring Bette Midler.

4
0:00:22.417,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Singing) "I had a dream.

5
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
A wonderful dream, papa."

6
0:00:28.917,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I would sing it with the urgency and the burning desire of a nine-year-old

7
0:00:33.583,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who did, in fact, have a dream.

8
0:00:36.708,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My dream was to be an actress.

9
0:00:40.5,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And it's true that I never saw anyone who looked like me

10
0:00:43.875,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in television or in films,

11
0:00:45.417,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and sure, my family and friends and teachers all constantly warned me

12
0:00:50.542,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that people like me didn't make it in Hollywood.

13
0:00:56.417,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I was an American.

14
0:00:58.625,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I had been taught to believe that anyone could achieve anything,

15
0:01:03.083,000 --> 0:01:06,000
regardless of the color of their skin,

16
0:01:06.542,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the fact that my parents immigrated from Honduras,

17
0:01:09.333,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the fact that I had no money.

18
0:01:12.583,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I didn't need my dream to be easy,

19
0:01:15.792,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I just needed it to be possible.

20
0:01:19.833,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And when I was 15,

21
0:01:23.125,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I got my first professional audition.

22
0:01:26.25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It was a commercial for cable subscriptions

23
0:01:29.792,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or bail bonds, I don't really remember.

24
0:01:31.958,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:33.125,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What I do remember is that the casting director asked me,

26
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"Could you do that again, but just this time, sound more Latina."

27
0:01:44.917,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"Um, OK.

28
0:01:47.25,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So you want me to do it in Spanish?" I asked.

29
0:01:49.958,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"No, no, do it in English, just sound Latina."

30
0:01:56.917,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"Well, I am a Latina, so isn't this what a Latina sounds like?"

31
0:02:03.333,000 --> 0:02:05,000
There was a long and awkward silence,

32
0:02:05.958,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and then finally,

33
0:02:07.5,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"OK, sweetie, never mind, thank you for coming in, bye!"

34
0:02:11.125,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It took me most of the car ride home to realize that by "sound more Latina"

35
0:02:15.75,000 --> 0:02:18,000
she was asking me to speak in broken English.

36
0:02:19.083,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I couldn't figure out why the fact

37
0:02:21.125,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that I was an actual, real-life, authentic Latina

38
0:02:26.5,000 --> 0:02:27,000
didn't really seem to matter.

39
0:02:28.333,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Anyway, I didn't get the job.

40
0:02:30.208,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I didn't get a lot of the jobs people were willing to see me for:

41
0:02:34.042,000 --> 0:02:36,000
the gang-banger's girlfriend,

42
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the sassy shoplifter,

43
0:02:39.292,000 --> 0:02:41,000
pregnant chola number two.

44
0:02:41.625,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:43.167,000 --> 0:02:47,000
These were the kinds of roles that existed for someone like me.

46
0:02:47.5,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Someone they looked at and saw as too brown, too fat,

47
0:02:51.833,000 --> 0:02:54,000
too poor, too unsophisticated.

48
0:02:55.583,000 --> 0:02:56,000
These roles were stereotypes

49
0:02:57.583,000 --> 0:03:,000
and couldn't have been further from my own reality

50
0:03:01.25,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or from the roles I dreamt of playing.

51
0:03:03.875,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I wanted to play people who were complex and multidimensional,

52
0:03:07.833,000 --> 0:03:1,000
people who existed in the center of their own lives.

53
0:03:11.792,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Not cardboard cutouts that stood in the background of someone else's.

54
0:03:16.542,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But when I dared to say that to my manager --

55
0:03:19.458,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that's the person I pay to help me find opportunity --

56
0:03:23.167,000 --> 0:03:26,000
his response was,

57
0:03:26.208,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"Someone has to tell that girl she has unrealistic expectations."

58
0:03:33.625,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And he wasn't wrong.

59
0:03:35.708,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I mean, I fired him, but he wasn't wrong.

60
0:03:38.167,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:40.333,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Applause)

62
0:03:44.958,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Because whenever I did try to get a role that wasn't a poorly written stereotype,

63
0:03:50.167,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I would hear,

64
0:03:51.458,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"We're not looking to cast this role diversely."

65
0:03:54.583,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Or, "We love her, but she's too specifically ethnic."

66
0:03:59.125,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Or, "Unfortunately, we already have one Latino in this movie."

67
0:04:05.125,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I kept receiving the same message again and again and again.

68
0:04:11.167,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That my identity was an obstacle I had to overcome.

69
0:04:18.167,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And so I thought,

70
0:04:20.708,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"Come at me, obstacle.

71
0:04:22.542,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I'm an American. My name is America.

72
0:04:26.917,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I trained my whole life for this, I'll just follow the playbook,

73
0:04:31.166,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I'll work harder."

74
0:04:32.916,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And so I did, I worked my hardest

75
0:04:35.583,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to overcome all the things that people said were wrong with me.

76
0:04:39.375,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I stayed out of the sun so that my skin wouldn't get too brown,

77
0:04:42.708,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I straightened my curls into submission.

78
0:04:46.708,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I constantly tried to lose weight,

79
0:04:48.583,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I bought fancier and more expensive clothes.

80
0:04:51.333,000 --> 0:04:52,000
All so that when people looked at me,

81
0:04:53.25,000 --> 0:04:58,000
they wouldn't see a too fat, too brown, too poor Latina.

82
0:04:59.708,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They would see what I was capable of.

83
0:05:02.417,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And maybe they would give me a chance.

84
0:05:07.792,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And in an ironic twist of fate,

85
0:05:11.708,000 --> 0:05:15,000
when I finally did get a role that would make all my dreams come true,

86
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:22,000
it was a role that required me to be exactly who I was.

87
0:05:23.167,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Ana in "Real Women Have Curves"

88
0:05:26.583,000 --> 0:05:29,000
was a brown, poor, fat Latina.

89
0:05:32.125,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I had never seen anyone like her, anyone like me,

90
0:05:36.542,000 --> 0:05:4,000
existing in the center of her own life story.

91
0:05:40.958,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I traveled throughout the US

92
0:05:42.875,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and to multiple countries with this film

93
0:05:45.125,000 --> 0:05:5,000
where people, regardless of their age, ethnicity, body type,

94
0:05:50.583,000 --> 0:05:52,000
saw themselves in Ana.

95
0:05:53.167,000 --> 0:05:56,000
A 17-year-old chubby Mexican American girl

96
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
struggling against cultural norms to fulfill her unlikely dream.

97
0:06:02.75,000 --> 0:06:05,000
In spite of what I had been told my whole life,

98
0:06:06.292,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I saw firsthand that people actually did want to see stories about people like me.

99
0:06:12.583,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And that my unrealistic expectations

100
0:06:15.833,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to see myself authentically represented in the culture

101
0:06:19.917,000 --> 0:06:21,000
were other people’s expectations, too.

102
0:06:23.25,000 --> 0:06:24,000
"Real Women Have Curves"

103
0:06:24.75,000 --> 0:06:28,000
was a critical, cultural and financial success.

104
0:06:29.583,000 --> 0:06:32,000
"Great," I thought, "We did it!

105
0:06:33.75,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We proved our stories have value.

106
0:06:36.542,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Things are going to change now."

107
0:06:42.042,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But I watched as very little happened.

108
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
There was no watershed.

109
0:06:47.125,000 --> 0:06:5,000
No one in the industry was rushing to tell more stories

110
0:06:50.75,000 --> 0:06:55,000
about the audience that was hungry and willing to pay to see them.

111
0:06:58.792,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Four years later, when I got to play Ugly Betty,

112
0:07:03.75,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I saw the same phenomenon play out.

113
0:07:06.875,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"Ugly Betty" premiered in the US to 16 million viewers

114
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and was nominated for 11 Emmys in its first year.

115
0:07:16.792,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Applause)

116
0:07:21.25,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But in spite of "Ugly Betty's" success,

117
0:07:25.625,000 --> 0:07:28,000
there would not be another television show

118
0:07:29.083,000 --> 0:07:31,000
led by a Latina actress

119
0:07:31.458,000 --> 0:07:33,000
on American television for eight years.

120
0:07:36.667,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's been 12 years

121
0:07:38.625,000 --> 0:07:41,000
since I became the first and only Latina

122
0:07:42.25,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to ever win an Emmy in a lead category.

123
0:07:46.333,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That is not a point of pride.

124
0:07:48.708,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That is a point of deep frustration.

125
0:07:51.25,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Not because awards prove our worth,

126
0:07:54.042,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but because who we see thriving in the world

127
0:07:57.875,000 --> 0:07:59,000
teaches us how to see ourselves,

128
0:08:00.625,000 --> 0:08:02,000
how to think about our own value,

129
0:08:03.25,000 --> 0:08:05,000
how to dream about our futures.

130
0:08:05.958,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And anytime I begin to doubt that,

131
0:08:07.917,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I remember that there was a little girl, living in the Swat Valley of Pakistan.

132
0:08:13.042,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And somehow, she got her hands on some DVDs

133
0:08:15.958,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of an American television show

134
0:08:17.958,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in which she saw her own dream of becoming a writer reflected.

135
0:08:23.25,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In her autobiography, Malala wrote,

136
0:08:26.792,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"I had become interested in journalism

137
0:08:28.667,000 --> 0:08:31,000
after seeing how my own words could make a difference

138
0:08:32.042,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and also from watching the "Ugly Betty" DVDs

139
0:08:36.042,000 --> 0:08:39,000
about life at an American magazine."

140
0:08:39.083,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Applause)

141
0:08:46.167,000 --> 0:08:49,000
For 17 years of my career,

142
0:08:49.917,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I have witnessed the power our voices have

143
0:08:55.207,000 --> 0:08:58,000
when they can access presence in the culture.

144
0:08:59.292,000 --> 0:09:,000
I've seen it.

145
0:09:00.958,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I've lived it, we've all seen it.

146
0:09:03.708,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In entertainment, in politics,

147
0:09:06.917,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in business, in social change.

148
0:09:10.75,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We cannot deny it -- presence creates possibility.

149
0:09:16.917,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But for the last 17 years,

150
0:09:18.958,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I've also heard the same excuses

151
0:09:21.75,000 --> 0:09:24,000
for why some of us can access presence in the culture

152
0:09:25.667,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and some of us can't.

153
0:09:29.042,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Our stories don't have an audience,

154
0:09:30.792,000 --> 0:09:33,000
our experiences won't resonate in the mainstream,

155
0:09:34.208,000 --> 0:09:37,000
our voices are too big a financial risk.

156
0:09:39.625,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Just a few years ago, my agent called

157
0:09:42.25,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to explain to me why I wasn't getting a role in a movie.

158
0:09:45.25,000 --> 0:09:46,000
He said, "They loved you

159
0:09:47.25,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and they really, really do want to cast diversely,

160
0:09:50.917,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but the movie isn't financeable until they cast the white role first."

161
0:09:58.708,000 --> 0:10:,000
He delivered the message with a broken heart

162
0:10:01.417,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and with a tone that communicated, "I understand how messed up this is."

163
0:10:06.667,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But nonetheless, just like hundreds of times before,

164
0:10:12.625,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I felt the tears roll down my face.

165
0:10:15.875,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And the pang of rejection rise up in me

166
0:10:19.958,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and then the voice of shame scolding me,

167
0:10:22.292,000 --> 0:10:25,000
"You are a grown woman, stop crying over a job."

168
0:10:27.208,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I went through this process for years of accepting the failure as my own

169
0:10:31.292,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and then feeling deep shame that I couldn't overcome the obstacles.

170
0:10:36.75,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But this time, I heard a new voice.

171
0:10:39.75,000 --> 0:10:42,000
A voice that said, "I'm tired.

172
0:10:43.917,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I've had enough."

173
0:10:45.583,000 --> 0:10:46,000
A voice that understood

174
0:10:47.208,000 --> 0:10:51,000
my tears and my pain were not about losing a job.

175
0:10:52.417,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They were about what was actually being said about me.

176
0:10:56.125,000 --> 0:10:59,000
What had been said about me my whole life

177
0:11:00.042,000 --> 0:11:02,000
by executives and producers

178
0:11:03.042,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and directors and writers and agents and managers

179
0:11:06.083,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and teachers and friends and family.

180
0:11:09.042,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That I was a person of less value.

181
0:11:12.75,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I thought sunscreen and straightening irons

182
0:11:16.375,000 --> 0:11:2,000
would bring about change in this deeply entrenched value system.

183
0:11:22.5,000 --> 0:11:24,000
But what I realized in that moment

184
0:11:25.458,000 --> 0:11:3,000
was that I was never actually asking the system to change.

185
0:11:31.25,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I was asking it to let me in, and those aren't the same thing.

186
0:11:38.375,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I couldn't change what a system believed about me,

187
0:11:41.417,000 --> 0:11:44,000
while I believed what the system believed about me.

188
0:11:45.458,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And I did.

189
0:11:46.958,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I, like everyone around me,

190
0:11:48.875,000 --> 0:11:53,000
believed that it wasn't possible for me to exist in my dream as I was.

191
0:11:55.625,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And I went about trying to make myself invisible.

192
0:12:02.25,000 --> 0:12:06,000
What this revealed to me was that it is possible

193
0:12:06.708,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to be the person who genuinely wants to see change

194
0:12:11.75,000 --> 0:12:16,000
while also being the person whose actions keep things the way they are.

195
0:12:20.5,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And what it's led me to believe is that change isn't going to come

196
0:12:24.083,000 --> 0:12:26,000
by identifying the good guys and the bad guys.

197
0:12:27.042,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That conversation lets us all off the hook.

198
0:12:29.875,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Because most of us are neither one of those.

199
0:12:33.5,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Change will come

200
0:12:35.125,000 --> 0:12:36,000
when each of us has the courage

201
0:12:37.083,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to question our own fundamental values and beliefs.

202
0:12:41.333,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And then see to it that our actions lead to our best intentions.

203
0:12:48.542,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I am just one of millions of people

204
0:12:51.625,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who have been told that in order to fulfill my dreams,

205
0:12:55.5,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in order to contribute my talents to the world

206
0:12:57.708,000 --> 0:13:,000
I have to resist the truth of who I am.

207
0:13:02.042,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I for one, am ready to stop resisting

208
0:13:05.875,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and to start existing as my full and authentic self.

209
0:13:12.417,000 --> 0:13:14,000
If I could go back and say anything

210
0:13:15.083,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to that nine-year-old, dancing in the den, dreaming her dreams,

211
0:13:19.583,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I would say,

212
0:13:21.125,000 --> 0:13:23,000
my identity is not my obstacle.

213
0:13:24.292,000 --> 0:13:25,000
My identity is my superpower.

214
0:13:27.25,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Because the truth is,

215
0:13:29.625,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I am what the world looks like.

216
0:13:32.667,000 --> 0:13:34,000
You are what the world looks like.

217
0:13:35.667,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Collectively, we are what the world actually looks like.

218
0:13:40.792,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And in order for our systems to reflect that,

219
0:13:43.917,000 --> 0:13:45,000
they don't have to create a new reality.

220
0:13:47.833,000 --> 0:13:5,000
They just have to stop resisting the one we already live in.

221
0:13:52.667,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Thank you.

222
0:13:53.958,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.23,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So, in 2016,

2
0:00:17.158,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was commissioned to produce a photo essay

3
0:00:19.714,000 --> 0:00:22,000
about the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.

4
0:00:23.783,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And that's been going on since 2014.

5
0:00:27.664,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I accepted the commission

6
0:00:29.485,000 --> 0:00:33,000
with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women

7
0:00:33.95,000 --> 0:00:36,000
dealing with the crisis on a daily basis.

8
0:00:38.006,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was fortunate to meet two best friends,

9
0:00:41.927,000 --> 0:00:45,000
artists, activists and poets Amber Hasan and Shea Cobb,

10
0:00:46.919,000 --> 0:00:48,000
who took me around Flint.

11
0:00:49.695,000 --> 0:00:52,000
As a school bus driver, Shea Cobb became the central figure

12
0:00:53.405,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of the photo essay,

13
0:00:54.584,000 --> 0:00:55,000
along with her mother, Ms. Renée,

14
0:00:56.409,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and her eight-year-old daughter, Zion.

15
0:00:59.434,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I obsessively followed Shea's school bus routes.

16
0:01:03.546,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And when Shea wasn't driving the bus,

17
0:01:06.76,000 --> 0:01:09,000
she would be watching over Zion, making sure she was studying.

18
0:01:11.093,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I embedded myself in every intimate facet of Shea's life.

19
0:01:16.304,000 --> 0:01:18,000
When Shea took me to Zion's school,

20
0:01:19.216,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I saw the water fountains covered with signs that said,

21
0:01:22.653,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Contaminated. Do not drink,"

22
0:01:25.839,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I couldn't pick up my camera to photograph it.

23
0:01:29.006,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It rocked me to the core to see that in America,

24
0:01:33.022,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we can go from fountains that say "Whites" or "Blacks only,"

25
0:01:37.228,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to today seeing fountains that say,

26
0:01:39.665,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"Contaminated water. Do not drink."

27
0:01:42.942,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And somehow, that's acceptable?

28
0:01:47.212,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The residents in Flint have been forced to drink with,

29
0:01:50.952,000 --> 0:01:53,000
cook with and bathe with bottled water,

30
0:01:54.133,000 --> 0:01:57,000
while paying the highest water bills in the country

31
0:01:57.252,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for water that is infected with deadly legionella bacteria.

32
0:02:03.156,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It was natural for me to go to Flint,

33
0:02:05.426,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because industrial pollution, bacteria-contaminated water

34
0:02:09.961,000 --> 0:02:14,000
were all too familiar for me growing up in my hometown, Braddock, Pennsylvania,

35
0:02:15.712,000 --> 0:02:18,000
where my mother and I battled cancer

36
0:02:19.458,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and autoimmune disorders like lupus.

37
0:02:23.704,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Our 14-year collaboration, "The Notion of Family,"

38
0:02:27.331,000 --> 0:02:32,000
was created out of our struggle to survive environmental racism,

39
0:02:32.696,000 --> 0:02:34,000
healthcare inequity

40
0:02:34.784,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and chemical emissions that were being deregulated

41
0:02:38.444,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and released from the United States Steel Corporation,

42
0:02:42.389,000 --> 0:02:48,000
making Braddock the town with the highest asthma and infant mortality rates

43
0:02:49.143,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in the country.

44
0:02:51.291,000 --> 0:02:54,000
From the Monongahela River to the Flint River,

45
0:02:54.696,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in the words of W.E.B. Du Bois,

46
0:02:58.124,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"The town, the whole valley, has turned its back upon the river.

47
0:03:04.061,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It has used it as a sewer, as a drain,

48
0:03:06.878,000 --> 0:03:08,000
as a place for throwing their waste."

49
0:03:11.442,000 --> 0:03:15,000
General Motors has been cited for dumping chemicals in the Flint River

50
0:03:15.84,000 --> 0:03:16,000
for decades.

51
0:03:18.696,000 --> 0:03:22,000
When my photo essay "Flint is Family" came out in August of 2016,

52
0:03:23.513,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it was released to remind America

53
0:03:25.358,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that although Flint was no longer headline news,

54
0:03:28.942,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the water crisis was far from over.

55
0:03:32.077,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And, of course, I knew

56
0:03:33.474,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it was going to take more than a series of photographs on my part

57
0:03:37.641,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to bring relief to the people in Vehicle City.

58
0:03:43.517,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Shea and I bonded over our mothers and grandmothers.

59
0:03:46.509,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Amber and I bonded over our battles with lupus.

60
0:03:49.945,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Together, we decided to remain in each other's life

61
0:03:53.506,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and continue our creative efforts.

62
0:03:57.061,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In 2017, Shea and Amber cofounded artist collective The Sister Tour,

63
0:04:03.1,000 --> 0:04:06,000
whose mission is to provide a safe space for Flint artists.

64
0:04:08.282,000 --> 0:04:09,000
One year later,

65
0:04:09.457,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I mounted my solo exhibition, "Flint is Family,"

66
0:04:13.012,000 --> 0:04:16,000
here in New York City at Gavin Brown's Enterprise

67
0:04:16.673,000 --> 0:04:18,000
on West 127th Street.

68
0:04:20.419,000 --> 0:04:22,000
As the audience approaches the facade of the building,

69
0:04:23.442,000 --> 0:04:24,000
they see a 30-foot billboard.

70
0:04:25.903,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The 30-foot billboard is made of three large color negatives

71
0:04:29.45,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with the message "Water Is Life,"

72
0:04:31.903,000 --> 0:04:34,000
spelled out in Nestle water bottles by The Sister Tour.

73
0:04:36.442,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Nestle, the largest water-bottling company in the world,

74
0:04:40.823,000 --> 0:04:44,000
pumps 400 gallons of water per minute out of aquifers in Lake Michigan,

75
0:04:45.79,000 --> 0:04:46,000
nearly free of charge.

76
0:04:48.046,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The company also extracts millions of liters of water

77
0:04:51.577,000 --> 0:04:53,000
from First Nation reservations,

78
0:04:54.315,000 --> 0:04:57,000
while they have no access to clean water at all.

79
0:04:59.242,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This is a fundraiser print that I used to raise money

80
0:05:02.728,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to send The Sister Tour to different venues

81
0:05:05.744,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to educate people on the ongoing crisis.

82
0:05:09.079,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I also continued to keep it in the public eye

83
0:05:12.714,000 --> 0:05:13,000
by producing countdown flags

84
0:05:14.322,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that were raised on institutions across the country.

85
0:05:18.095,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This past June, Amber emailed me with the news

86
0:05:21.997,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that Michigan's attorney general dropped all criminal charges

87
0:05:25.306,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in the Flint Water Crisis investigation,

88
0:05:28.02,000 --> 0:05:3,000
where eight state and city employees

89
0:05:30.943,000 --> 0:05:33,000
were facing charges as serious as manslaughter.

90
0:05:35.871,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I could no longer idly stand by

91
0:05:38.45,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and wait for the government to do its job.

92
0:05:42.633,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Justice has been delayed,

93
0:05:45.553,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and justice has been denied.

94
0:05:48.149,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's been five years,

95
0:05:49.958,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and we're still waiting on justice for the men, women and children in Flint.

96
0:05:56.03,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I asked Amber, "What can I do?"

97
0:05:58.657,000 --> 0:06:03,000
She told me about a man named Moses West that she met in Puerto Rico,

98
0:06:04.619,000 --> 0:06:1,000
who invented a 26,000-pound atmospheric water generator.

99
0:06:12.363,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Amber took Moses to elected officials in the city of Flint.

100
0:06:17.617,000 --> 0:06:22,000
None of them seemed interested in bringing the machine for relief to Flint at all.

101
0:06:24.966,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Amber needed to get the machine from a military base in Texas

102
0:06:28.997,000 --> 0:06:29,000
all the way to Flint.

103
0:06:31.544,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Nobody in Flint had that kind of money lying around.

104
0:06:35.449,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And it was at that point that I decided

105
0:06:39.003,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to take the proceeds from my solo exhibition "Flint is Family,"

106
0:06:43.395,000 --> 0:06:48,000
along with the generous match grant from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation,

107
0:06:48.601,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and sent it to Moses West.

108
0:06:52.038,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This past July,

109
0:06:54.006,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Moses West and his atmospheric water generator arrived to Flint, Michigan,

110
0:06:59.245,000 --> 0:07:03,000
on North Saginaw between Marengo and Pulaski,

111
0:07:03.709,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and is actually still there right now, operating.

112
0:07:08.455,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This community that sits three miles from downtown

113
0:07:12.169,000 --> 0:07:14,000
has been stripped of its schools,

114
0:07:15.174,000 --> 0:07:17,000
access to healthy grocery stores

115
0:07:17.532,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and clean water.

116
0:07:19.252,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Socially, it's viewed as a violent, poor community.

117
0:07:22.889,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But I see something completely different.

118
0:07:27.142,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Moses, an officer, Ranger, veteran,

119
0:07:32.15,000 --> 0:07:36,000
was very clear about his water rescue mission:

120
0:07:37.964,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Bring relief of free, clean water to the people in Flint.

121
0:07:42.4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Teach them how to use the machine,

122
0:07:44.599,000 --> 0:07:45,000
teach them how to take care of it,

123
0:07:46.474,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and most importantly, take ownership of the machine.

124
0:07:50.585,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Tell everybody across the city to bring all their containers

125
0:07:54.569,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and come and take as much water as they can stock up on,

126
0:07:58.625,000 --> 0:08:,000
especially before the winter season hits;

127
0:08:01.212,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the machine doesn't extract moisture in freezing temperatures.

128
0:08:05.815,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This technology pulls air through a high-volume air filter.

129
0:08:11.556,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It mechanically creates condensation,

130
0:08:14.739,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which produces 2,000 gallons of water per day.

131
0:08:20.712,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Residents are free to walk up to the machine

132
0:08:22.791,000 --> 0:08:26,000
anywhere between 9am and 8pm daily

133
0:08:27.736,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and take as much as they want,

134
0:08:29.22,000 --> 0:08:33,000
alleviating them from standing in long lines for bottled water.

135
0:08:34.276,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I've been at the machine, interviewing people, asking them,

136
0:08:37.458,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"What does it mean to see Moses and his machine in [your] community?"

137
0:08:41.204,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And, "What has it been like living without access to clean water?"

138
0:08:46.173,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Alita told me,

139
0:08:47.943,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"It's a miracle that God gave Moses the knowledge and technology

140
0:08:53.38,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to provide us with pure drinking water."

141
0:08:57.842,000 --> 0:08:59,000
She also told me that prior to the machine coming,

142
0:09:00.836,000 --> 0:09:01,000
she had severe headaches,

143
0:09:02.517,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and the water made her so sick to her stomach,

144
0:09:05.295,000 --> 0:09:06,000
she couldn't eat.

145
0:09:08.345,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Tina told me that the lead-contaminated water

146
0:09:11.337,000 --> 0:09:12,000
made her hair fall out.

147
0:09:13.789,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Usually, she's weak and very light-headed.

148
0:09:17.934,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Since using the machine, she's had energy and strength.

149
0:09:24.911,000 --> 0:09:29,000
David, he was overwhelmed with joy that someone from Texas cared.

150
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
When he tasted the water, he thought to himself,

151
0:09:32.601,000 --> 0:09:35,000
"Now, this is the way God intended water to be."

152
0:09:37.522,000 --> 0:09:4,000
He brings three seven-gallon containers to refill

153
0:09:41.074,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to use at his barbecue stand.

154
0:09:45.014,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Through creativity and solidarity,

155
0:09:48.744,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Amber Hasan, Shea Cobb,

156
0:09:51.704,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Tuklor Senegal, The Sister Tour,

157
0:09:54.982,000 --> 0:09:56,000
myself, the people of Flint,

158
0:09:57.744,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Dexter Moon, Moses West and his atmospheric water generator

159
0:10:03.161,000 --> 0:10:08,000
have been able to provide 120,000 gallons

160
0:10:08.534,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of free, clean water.

161
0:10:10.646,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

162
0:10:17.146,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The people in Flint deserve access to clean water.

163
0:10:20.861,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Water is life.

164
0:10:22.736,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It is the spirit that binds us

165
0:10:25.236,000 --> 0:10:28,000
from sickness, death and destruction.

166
0:10:29.228,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Imagine how many millions of lives we could save

167
0:10:33.223,000 --> 0:10:37,000
if Moses's machine were in places like Newark, New Jersey,

168
0:10:37.64,000 --> 0:10:38,000
South Africa

169
0:10:39.169,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and India,

170
0:10:40.966,000 --> 0:10:43,000
with compassion instead of profit motives.

171
0:10:45.895,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I loaded my camera,

172
0:10:47.863,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I locked my focus,

173
0:10:49.323,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and I placed my finger over the shutter release,

174
0:10:51.847,000 --> 0:10:55,000
as Shea and Zion went to take their first sip of clean water.

175
0:10:57.215,000 --> 0:10:58,000
When the shutter released,

176
0:10:58.889,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I was overcome with a deep sense of joy and righteousness.

177
0:11:04.953,000 --> 0:11:06,000
When I sent Shea some of the photographs,

178
0:11:07.144,000 --> 0:11:08,000
she wrote,

179
0:11:08.53,000 --> 0:11:12,000
"Thank you again for the light that you bring to my city."

180
0:11:13.363,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I immediately replied,

181
0:11:15.663,000 --> 0:11:17,000
"The light was already there within you."

182
0:11:21.239,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's been four years since I've been photographing in Flint,

183
0:11:25.715,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and finally, I've been able to render a poetic justice.

184
0:11:32.048,000 --> 0:11:36,000
No matter how dark a situation may be,

185
0:11:36.096,000 --> 0:11:41,000
a camera can extract the light and turn a negative into a positive.

186
0:11:42.477,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Thank you.

187
0:11:43.651,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Applause)

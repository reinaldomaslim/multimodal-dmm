1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So, I'm in Chile,

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I have this picture up on my screen,

5
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and a woman comes up behind me.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?"

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.

9
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit."

10
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And, you know, "Excuse me!"

12
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I could sense

13
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that she thought I was speaking synecdochically.

14
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit."

16
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands

18
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
taking pictures of penguins.

19
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.

20
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, literally, a few minutes before that,

21
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I downloaded this scientific paper

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
about calculations on avian defecation,

23
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which is really quite interesting, because it turns out

24
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,"

25
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and you can learn an awful lot

26
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
about the physics of the avian rectum.

27
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca.

28
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
At this point, she stops me,

29
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and she says, "Who are you?

30
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Wha -- what do you do?"

31
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I was stuck,

32
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because I didn't have any way to describe what I do.

33
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so, in some sense,

34
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
this talk today

35
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is my answer to that.

36
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.

37
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And it's very hard for me to make sense of it,

38
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so I'm not sure that you can.

39
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes --

40
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
often at four in the morning.

41
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So, some people are afraid of what I do.

42
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,

43
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and in response, I have ordered

44
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a bulletproof pocket protector.

45
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'm not sure what these people think,

46
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because I don't speak Norsk.

47
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.

49
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I don't know, you know?

50
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So, one of the things that I love to do

51
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.

52
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Because archaeology gives us an opportunity

53
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to study past civilizations,

54
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and see where they succeeded

55
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and where they failed.

56
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Use science to, you know,

57
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?"

58
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And recently, I was in Easter Island,

59
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which is an incredibly beautiful place,

60
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
and an incredibly mysterious place,

61
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because no matter where you go in Easter Island,

62
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you're struck by these statues, called the moai.

63
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The place is 64 square miles.

64
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.

65
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Why on Earth? And if you haven't read

66
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Jared Diamond's book, "Collapse,"

67
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I totally recommend that you do.

68
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
He's got a great chapter about it.

69
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Basically, these people

70
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
committed ecological suicide

71
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in order to make more of these.

72
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And somewhere along the line, somebody said,

73
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"I know! Let's cut down the last tree

74
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and commit suicide, because

75
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we need more identical statues."

76
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And,

78
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
one thing that isn't a mystery, actually,

79
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --

80
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?

81
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.

82
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Where did they get that inspiration?

83
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then I met Yoyo,

84
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,

85
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and if you look at Yoyo's face,

86
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you kind of figure out where they got it.

87
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
There's many mysteries, these statues.

88
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,

89
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
how did they transport them?

90
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.

91
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.

92
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,

93
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and she has detailed records of every single statue.

94
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The one on the page here is the same that's up there.

95
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.

96
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So, this used to be completely smooth.

97
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,

98
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.

99
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But after 1,000 years out in the weather,

100
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
they look like this.

101
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,

102
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and we're going to do a very high-res digitization,

103
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
first because it's a way of preserving them.

104
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,

105
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
learn a few of the mysteries about them.

106
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
How long have they been standing in what positions?

107
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of

108
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
what caused them to be the way they are.

109
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,

110
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so you get a gratuitous picture

111
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of a moai with a comet.

112
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I also have an archaeological project going on

113
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in Egypt.

114
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.

115
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We're trying to get all of the permissions

116
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to get everything all set, to get it going.

117
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.

118
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.

119
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Another thing I do is I invent stuff.

120
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
In fact, I design nuclear reactors.

121
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Not a joke.

122
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This is the conventional

123
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
nuclear fuel cycle.

124
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The red line is what is done in

125
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.

126
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,

127
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
where you reprocess.

128
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now, this is the normal way it's done.

129
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's got the huge advantage that it

130
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
does not create carbon pollution.

131
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It has a lot of disadvantages:

132
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
each one of these steps is extremely expensive,

133
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's potentially dangerous

134
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and they have the interesting property that the step

135
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
cannot be performed in anyone's backyard,

136
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which is a problem.

137
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So, our reactor eliminates these steps,

138
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.

139
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.

140
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
There's -- no reactor's been even built

141
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States

142
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for 25 years.

143
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return

144
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
thing that we do.

145
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Changing into a totally different field,

146
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,

147
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
particularly in an area called metamaterials.

148
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
A metamaterial is an artificial material,

149
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,

150
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in a way that you couldn't otherwise.

151
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.

152
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,

153
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
this is how you would view it.

154
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light --

155
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
come in, and they just squish around the cell,

156
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and they come back the other side.

157
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.

158
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.

159
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Metamaterials, unfortunately --

160
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
A, it only works on microwave,

161
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.

162
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.

163
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's -- you know, today I'd like to say

164
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
it's a zero billion dollar business, but,

165
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
in fact, it's negative.

166
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work.

167
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.

168
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation

169
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing

170
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
diseases in developing countries.

171
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --

172
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.

173
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And these happen to be my eyes, by the way.

174
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now, I'm also very interested in cooking.

175
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence

176
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and went to a chef school in France.

177
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I used to work, also while at Microsoft,

178
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
at a leading restaurant in Seattle,

179
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
so I do a lot of cooking.

180
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I've been on a team that won

181
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the world championship of barbecue.

182
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods

183
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
like chili, or bouillabaisse.

184
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Various parts of the world will have a cult food

185
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that people get enormously attached to --

186
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.

187
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And I'm trying to use a very

188
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
scientific approach.

189
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So, this is my latest cooker,

190
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,

191
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that's because it is.

192
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --

193
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --

194
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you can make some terrific ribs.

195
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This is a high-speed centrifuge.

197
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You should all have one in your kitchen,

198
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
beside your Turbochef.

199
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times

200
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that of normal gravity,

201
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.

202
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You would not believe it!

203
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I perform a series of ghoulish experiments

204
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
on food --

205
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model

206
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so that one can predict exactly

207
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
what the internal cooking times are.

208
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.

209
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Theory is red,

210
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
black is experiment.

211
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So, I'm either really good at faking it,

212
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
or this particular model seems to work.

213
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So, another random thing I do

214
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,

215
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
or SETI.

216
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,"

217
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
which sort of popularized that.

218
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It turns out there are real people who go out

219
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.

220
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
In fact, almost everybody in the movie

221
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is based on a real character, a real person.

222
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So, the Jodie Foster character here

223
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is actually this woman, Jill Tarter,

224
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and Jill has dedicated her life to this.

225
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You know, a lot of people risk their lives

226
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in a brief act of heroism,

227
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
which is kind of cool,

228
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but Jill has

229
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
what I call slow heroism.

230
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
She is risking her professional life on something

231
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that her own calculations show

232
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.

233
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So, I like to support people that are risking their lives.

234
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.

235
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
My kids saw the movie,

236
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and afterwards they came to me and they said,

237
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"So, Dad, so -- so --

238
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that character -- that's Jill, right?"

239
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely."

240
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
"And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes."

241
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?

242
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Is that you?"

243
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on."

244
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So, the SETI Institute,

246
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen

247
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and a variety of other people,

248
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is building a dedicated radio telescope

249
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in Hat Creek, California,

250
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
so they can do this SETI work.

251
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,

252
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and the one person who always gets updated

253
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else

254
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is Jill, because I really don't want to miss

255
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
"the call."

256
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

257
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,

258
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!

259
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.

260
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.

261
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And I resemble that remark.

262
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,

263
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
which is the finding of them.

264
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions

265
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
looking for a dinosaur.

266
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.

267
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It's horrible conditions, because

268
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
wherever you have nice weather,

269
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
plants grow,

270
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.

271
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So, you always find dinosaurs

272
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in deserts or badlands,

273
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
areas that have very little plant growth

274
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and have flash floods in the spring.

275
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
You know, skiers pray for snow?

276
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Paleontologists pray for erosion.

277
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So, you hike around

278
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.

279
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
You hike around, you see something like this.

280
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.

281
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You've got this bentonite clay,

282
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
which is -- sort of swells up and expands.

283
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,

284
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and you look up close, and you say,

285
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?"

286
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,

287
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
from the shape, that these are skull fragments.

288
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And then when you look at this,

289
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
you say, "That's a tooth.

290
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's a big tooth."

291
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It's about the size of a banana.

292
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It has a big serration on the edge.

293
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.

294
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,

295
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago.

296
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.

297
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,

298
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and then, after buying the cast, I found my own,

299
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and I don't have room for two.

300
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
You know.

301
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs

302
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is that it is both an intellectual thing,

303
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
because you're trying to reconstruct the environment

304
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
of millions of years ago.

305
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It's something that can inform all sorts of science

306
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
in unexpected ways.

307
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The study of dinosaurs led to the realization

308
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that there's a problem with asteroid impact,

309
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
for example.

310
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
The study of dinosaurs may, literally,

311
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
one day save the planet.

312
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Study of the ancient climate is very important.

313
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,

314
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
had much higher CO2 than today,

315
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points

316
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
for the effects of CO2 on climate.

317
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
But, besides being intellectually

318
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and scientifically interesting, it's also very different

319
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.

320
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.

321
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod."

322
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,

323
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so we're not going to go into it further.

324
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Now, I'm also really big on photography.

325
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I travel all over the world taking pictures --

326
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
some of them good, most of them not.

327
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means

328
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
you've got to spend more time sorting through them.

329
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands

330
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
of king penguins on a beach.

331
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.

332
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I'd gone up to photograph Orcas,

333
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and we had looked for a week,

334
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and we hadn't seen a damn Orca.

335
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And the last day, the sun comes out,

336
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.

337
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And I get lots of pictures like this.

338
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Then, a little bit later,

339
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
I start getting some pictures like this.

340
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Now, to a human audience, I need to explain that

341
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,

342
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:1,000
this would be the centerfold.

343
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
It's true.

344
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So, there's more and more activity near the boat,

345
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and all of a sudden somebody shouts,

346
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
"What's that in the water?"

347
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy."

348
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

349
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex.

350
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Laughter)

351
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
The first thing you learn

352
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
is the overwhelming importance of hands.

353
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
They don't have them.

354
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Laughter)

355
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I think Paul Simon is in the audience,

356
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and he has --

357
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,

358
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
"Slip-Slidin' Away."

359
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:55,000
That's kind of what it's like.

360
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:

361
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
they curl their toes too.

362
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Laughter)

363
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So --

364
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?

365
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom

366
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
in finding a great thing, passion in life,

367
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and focusing all your energy on it,

368
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and I've never been able to do that.

369
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I just -- you know, because, yes,

370
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I'll focus passion on something,

371
0:16:27.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.

372
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And for a long time I fought this, and I thought,

373
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down."

374
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And you know, when I was at Microsoft,

375
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
that was so engrossing,

376
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and the whole industry was expanding so much,

377
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life.

378
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
But ultimately,

379
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
I decided

380
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,

381
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
but embrace it.

382
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And say, "Yeah, you know, I --

383
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,

384
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
but that's really what works for me."

385
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors

386
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
or metamaterials or whale sex,

387
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.

388
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
That's it, thank you.

389
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've been fascinated for a lifetime

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
by the beauty, form and function

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of giant bluefin tuna.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They're the largest of the tunas,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They actually are a fish

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that is endothermic --

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it's powered for ocean swimming.

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
powers its movements

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
with a lunate tail.

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so it reduces friction with the water.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is what one of nature's finest machines.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, bluefin

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
were revered by Man

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for all of human history.

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and it's evidenced

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in the art that we see

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
from thousands of years ago.

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They're on coins

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that date back 3,000 years.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This fish was revered by humankind.

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It was fished sustainably

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
till all of time,

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
except for our generation.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go --

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
there is a gold rush on Earth,

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and this is a gold rush for bluefin.

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There are traps that fish sustainably

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
up until recently.

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And yet, the type of fishing going on today,

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with pens, with enormous stakes,

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is really wiping bluefin

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
ecologically off the planet.

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now bluefin, in general,

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
goes to one place: Japan.

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Some of you may be guilty

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They're delectable muscle,

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
rich in fat --

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
absolutely taste delicious.

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The North American population

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is fished at about 2,000 ton.

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna --

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is fished at tremendous levels:

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The result is whether you're looking

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
at the West or the Eastern bluefin population,

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
there's been tremendous decline on both sides,

60
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
as much as 90 percent

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
if you go back with your baseline

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to 1950.

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
For that, bluefin have been given a status

64
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
equivalent to tigers, to lions,

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to certain African elephants

66
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and to pandas.

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
These fish have been proposed

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for an endangered species listing in the past two months.

69
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They were voted on and rejected

70
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
just two weeks ago,

71
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
despite outstanding science

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that shows from two committees

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.

74
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And if it's tunas you don't care about,

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
perhaps you might be interested

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that international long lines and pursing

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
chase down tunas and bycatch animals

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
such as leatherbacks, sharks,

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
marlin, albatross.

80
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
These animals and their demise

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
occurs in the tuna fisheries.

82
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The challenge we face

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is that we know very little about tuna,

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and everyone in the room knows what it looks like

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
when an African lion

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
takes down its prey.

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.

88
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
This tuna symbolizes

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
what's the problem for all of us in the room.

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to really study our oceans in a deep way.

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Technology has come of age

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that's allowing us to see the Earth from space

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and go deep into the seas remotely.

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And we've got to use these technologies immediately

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to get a better understanding

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
of how our ocean realm works.

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Most of us from the ship -- even I --

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We don't know where the structure is.

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We can't tell where are the watering holes

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
like we can on an African plain.

103
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We can't see the corridors,

104
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we can't see what it is

105
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that brings together a tuna,

106
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a leatherback and an albatross.

107
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We're only just beginning to understand

108
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
how the physical oceanography

109
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the biological oceanography

110
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
come together

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to create a seasonal force

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that actually causes the upwelling

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that might make a hot spot a hope spot.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The reasons these challenges are great

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the entire Pacific realm.

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and try to put a tag on it.

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,

121
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
getting up close to a blue whale

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
an engineering challenge

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
we've yet to really overcome.

125
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So the story of our team, a dedicated team,

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is fish and chips.

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We basically are taking

128
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the same satellite phone parts,

129
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We're putting them together in unusual ways,

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and this is taking us into the ocean realm

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
like never before.

133
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And for the first time,

134
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
using light and photons

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to measure sunrise and sunset.

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I have the privilege of being a partner

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

140
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,

141
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
put it behind glass,

142
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and we together

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.

144
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,

145
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
one of the only places on Earth

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you can see giant bluefin swim by.

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We can see in their beauty of form and function,

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
their ceaseless activity.

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They're flying through their space, ocean space.

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And we can bring two million people a year

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
into contact with this fish

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and show them its beauty.

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Here, for over 14 or 15 years,

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we've actually brought in

158
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.

159
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We'd been studying these fish,

160
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.

161
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What do they like to eat?

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
What is it that they're happy with?

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --

164
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And then, better yet,

166
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
we've got our own version of tuna whisperers,

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,

168
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
who can take a big tuna

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and in one motion,

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
put it into an envelope of water,

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so that we can actually work with the tuna

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and learn the techniques it takes

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to not injure this fish

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
who never sees a boundary in the open sea.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
who are going to take a tuna

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.

179
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,

180
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
its energy consumption.

181
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We're taking this data and building better models.

182
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view --

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I begin to wonder:

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?

185
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So take a look at that animal.

186
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.

187
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now, the activities from the lab

188
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.

189
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,

191
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
from Corsica to Spain.

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We've fished with many nations around the world

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in an effort to basically

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
put electronic computers

195
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
inside giant tunas.

196
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And I'm going to show you three clips,

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
because I tagged 1,100 tunas.

199
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.

201
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians

202
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
work together to keep this animal out of the ocean

203
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
for about four to five minutes.

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging,

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
putting in the computer,

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,

208
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we send this fish back into the sea.

209
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And when it goes, we're always happy.

210
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We see a flick of the tail.

211
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And from our data that gets collected,

212
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
when that tag comes back,

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
because a fisher returns it

214
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for a thousand-dollar reward,

215
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
we can get tracks beneath the sea

216
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
for up to five years now,

217
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
on a backboned animal.

218
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Now sometimes the tunas are really large,

219
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
such as this fish off Nantucket.

220
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But that's about half the size

221
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.

222
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It takes a human effort,

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
a team effort, to bring the fish in.

224
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
In this case, what we're going to do

225
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This tag rides on the tuna,

227
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
senses the environment around the tuna

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and actually will come off the fish,

229
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
detach, float to the surface

230
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites

231
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
position data estimated by math on the tag,

232
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
pressure data and temperature data.

233
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag

234
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is we get away from having to have a human interaction

235
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to recapture the tag.

236
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.

237
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
These tags have been engineered

238
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
by a variety of teams in North America.

239
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They are some of our finest instruments,

240
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
our new technology in the ocean today.

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
One community in general

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
has given more to help us than any other community.

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.

244
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,

245
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
every winter for over a decade,

246
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
held a party called Tag-A-Giant,

247
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and together, fishers worked with us

248
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to tag 800 to 900 fish.

249
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started:

251
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
take a mucus sample.

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,

254
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we can get information on gender,

255
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
checking the pop-up tag one more time,

256
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and then it's out in the ocean.

257
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And this is my favorite.

258
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,

259
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.

260
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.

261
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The warm is the Gulf Stream,

262
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.

263
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --

264
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but it can't get there. It's too cold.

265
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,

266
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
maybe comes back to home base,

267
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
goes in again

268
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina

269
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and then on to the Bahamas.

270
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.

271
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Three tunas tagged.

272
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.

273
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex --

274
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and there it is.

275
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
That is where the tuna spawn.

276
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So from data like this,

277
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we're able now to put the map up,

278
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and in this map

279
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you see thousands of positions

280
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
generated by this decade and a half of tagging.

281
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side

282
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
go to the eastern side.

283
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So two populations of tunas --

284
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag --

285
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that --

286
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and a second population.

287
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas --

288
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
are European tunas that go back to the Med.

289
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
On the hot spots -- the hope spots --

290
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
they're mixed populations.

291
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And so what we've done with the science

292
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is we're showing the International Commission,

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
building new models,

294
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model --

295
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to this day, used to reject

296
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the CITES treaty --

297
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that model isn't the right model.

298
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
This model, a model of overlap,

299
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is the way to move forward.

300
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So we can then predict

301
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
where management places should be.

302
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean

303
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
are places where the single species,

304
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the single population, can be captured.

305
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
These become forthright in places we need to protect.

306
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,

307
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,

308
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
because they manage their fisheries well,

309
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
they're doing a good job.

310
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
But in the international realm,

311
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,

312
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.

313
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.

314
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Now in a second project

315
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,

316
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
we took on the planet as a team,

317
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
those of us in the Census of Marine Life.

318
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,

319
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
we were able to actually go in, in our project --

320
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we're one of 17 field programs

321
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,

322
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
not just tunas.

323
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So what we've done

324
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,

325
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
met salmon shark on their home territory,

326
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
followed them catching salmon

327
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and then went in and figured out

328
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,

329
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
we can actually take up a salmon shark --

330
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
This is the cousin of the white shark --

331
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and very carefully --

332
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
note, I say "very carefully," --

333
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
we can actually keep it calm,

334
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck

335
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and then tag it with a satellite tag.

336
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home

337
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and send in a message.

338
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.

339
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag

340
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
jumping after salmon,

341
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
sending home its data.

342
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.

343
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution

344
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.

345
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Salmon sharks go down

346
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to the tropics to pup

347
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and come into Monterey.

348
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones

349
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there --

350
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and Sal Jorgensen.

351
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
They can throw out a target --

352
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
it's a carpet shaped like a seal --

353
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and in will come a white shark, a curious critter

354
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.

355
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
It's a several thousand-pound animal.

356
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And we'll wind in the target.

357
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And we'll place an acoustic tag

358
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that says, "OMSHARK 10165,"

359
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
or something like that, acoustically with a ping.

360
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And then we'll put on a satellite tag

361
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that will give us the long-distance journeys

362
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
with the light-based geolocation algorithms

363
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
solved on the computer that's on the fish.

364
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,

365
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and there they are: the white sharks of California

366
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.

367
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,

368
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
blue sharks.

369
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And now, together, what we can see

370
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
on this ocean of color that's temperature,

371
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.

372
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
We have white sharks and blue sharks.

373
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
For the first time,

374
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,

375
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
showing where the sharks go.

376
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:

377
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
three teams tagged 1,700 tunas,

378
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
bluefin, yellowfin and albacore

379
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
all at the same time --

380
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
carefully rehearsed tagging programs

381
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,

382
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
put in the tags that actually have the sensors,

383
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
stick out the tuna

384
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and then let them go.

385
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
They get returned, and when they get returned,

386
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
here on a NASA numerical ocean

387
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
you can see bluefin in blue

388
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
go across their corridor,

389
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
returning to the Western Pacific.

390
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals

391
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.

392
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
These elephant seals cover half an ocean,

393
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
take data down to 1,800 feet --

394
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
amazing data.

395
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters

396
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
wearing tuna tags, light-based tags,

397
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,

398
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
journeys of 35,000 nautical miles

399
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
we had never seen before.

400
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,

401
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
we can actually see these journeys.

402
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Same thing with Laysan albatross

403
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
who travel an entire ocean

404
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
on a trip sometimes,

405
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
up to the same zone the tunas use.

406
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
You can see why they might be caught.

407
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande

408
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
tagging leatherbacks

409
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
that go right past where we are.

410
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
And Scott Benson's team

411
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia

412
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
all the way to Monterey.

413
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
So what we can see on this moving ocean

414
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
is we can finally see where the predators are.

415
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces

416
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
as large as an ocean.

417
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And from this information,

418
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
we can begin to map the hope spots.

419
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So this is just three years of data right here --

420
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and there's a decade of this data.

421
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities

422
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
that these animals are going on.

423
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So what we're able to do with this information

424
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
is boil it down to hot spots,

425
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
4,000 deployments,

426
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
a huge herculean task,

427
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
2,000 tags

428
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
in an area, shown here for the first time,

429
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
off the California coast,

430
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
that appears to be a gathering place.

431
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And then for sort of an encore from these animals,

432
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
they're helping us.

433
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
They're carrying instruments

434
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.

435
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
They're taking information from our planet

436
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.

437
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Those are seals from many countries

438
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
being released

439
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
who are sampling underneath the ice sheets

440
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality

441
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
on both poles.

442
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.

443
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.

444
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And then, as these animals swim

445
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and give us the information

446
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
that's important to climate issues,

447
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
we also think it's critical

448
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
to get this information to the public,

449
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
to engage the public with this kind of data.

450
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
We did this with the Great Turtle Race --

451
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.

452
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And now with Google's Oceans,

453
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.

454
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And when we do and it swims,

455
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
we see this magnificent bathymetry

456
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
that the shark knows is there on its path

457
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
as it goes from California to Hawaii.

458
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
But maybe Mission Blue

459
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
can fill in that ocean that we can't see.

460
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.

461
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
We just need to put it together.

462
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
So in conclusion,

463
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
we know where Yellowstone is for North America;

464
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
it's off our coast.

465
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.

466
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue

467
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
is increasing the biologging capacity.

468
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
How is it that we can actually

469
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
take this type of activity elsewhere?

470
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
And then finally -- to basically get the message home --

471
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
maybe use live links

472
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.

473
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Make killer apps, if you will.

474
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
A lot of people are excited

475
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.

476
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.

477
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
That way we do away with a few internet myths.

478
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
So we can save the bluefin tuna.

479
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
We can save the white shark.

480
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
We have the science and technology.

481
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Hope is here. Yes we can.

482
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
We need just to apply this capacity

483
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
further in the oceans.

484
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:58,000
Thank you.

485
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
(Applause)

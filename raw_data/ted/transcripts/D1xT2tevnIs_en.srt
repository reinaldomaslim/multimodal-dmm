2
0:00:13.19,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to start by asking you a question:

3
0:00:15.697,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Is anyone familiar with the blue algae problem?

4
0:00:19.776,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Okay, so most of you are.

5
0:00:21.825,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I think we can all agree it's a serious issue.

6
0:00:24.871,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water,

7
0:00:28.763,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or swim in a blue algae-infested lake.

8
0:00:33.328,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Right?

9
0:00:34.703,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I hope you won't be disappointed,

10
0:00:36.779,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but today, I won't be talking about blue algae.

11
0:00:39.985,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Instead, I'll be talking about the main cause

12
0:00:43.81,000 --> 0:00:45,000
at the root of this issue,

13
0:00:46.775,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which I will be referring to as the phosphorus crisis.

14
0:00:50.17,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Why have I chosen to talk to you about the phosphorus crisis today?

15
0:00:54.078,000 --> 0:00:57,000
For the simple reason that nobody else is talking about it.

16
0:00:57.337,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And by the end of my presentation, I hope that the general public

17
0:01:01.604,000 --> 0:01:05,000
will be more aware of this crisis and this issue.

18
0:01:06.17,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, the problem is that if I ask,

19
0:01:09.534,000 --> 0:01:12,000
why do we find ourselves in this situation with blue algae?

20
0:01:12.588,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The answer is that it comes from how we farm.

21
0:01:16.262,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We use fertilizers in our farming, chemical fertilizers.

22
0:01:20.696,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Why do we use chemical fertilizers in agriculture?

23
0:01:23.103,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Basically, to help plants grow and to produce a better yield.

24
0:01:28.343,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The issue is that this is set to engender

25
0:01:30.787,000 --> 0:01:33,000
an environmental problem that is without precedent.

26
0:01:35.471,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Before going further, let me give you a crash course in plant biology.

27
0:01:39.037,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So, what does a plant need in order to grow?

28
0:01:41.502,000 --> 0:01:45,000
A plant, quite simply, needs light, it needs CO2,

29
0:01:46.052,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but even more importantly, it needs nutrients,

30
0:01:49.667,000 --> 0:01:52,000
which it draws from the soil.

31
0:01:53.282,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Several of these nutrients are essential chemical elements:

32
0:01:56.897,000 --> 0:01:59,000
phosphorus, nitrogen and calcium.

33
0:01:59.943,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So, the plant’s roots will extract these resources.

34
0:02:04.672,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Today I'll be focusing on a major problem that is linked to phosphorus.

35
0:02:08.536,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Why phosphorus in particular?

36
0:02:10.223,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Because it is the most problematic chemical element.

37
0:02:13.572,000 --> 0:02:15,000
By the end of my presentation, you will have seen

38
0:02:16.693,000 --> 0:02:19,000
what these problems are, and where we are today.

39
0:02:20.839,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Phosphorus is a chemical element

40
0:02:23.772,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that is essential to life. This is a very important point.

41
0:02:27.165,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I’d like everyone to understand precisely what the phosphorus issue is.

42
0:02:30.816,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Phosphorus is a key component in several molecules,

43
0:02:34.988,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in many of our molecules of life.

44
0:02:37.641,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Experts in the field will know

45
0:02:39.634,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that cellular communication is phosphorus-based --

46
0:02:42.597,000 --> 0:02:44,000
phosphorylation, dephosphorylation.

47
0:02:45.221,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Cell membranes are phosphorus-based: These are called phospholipids.

48
0:02:50.822,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The energy in all living things, ATP, is phosphorus-based.

49
0:02:55.572,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And more importantly still, phosphorus is a key component of DNA,

50
0:03:02.455,000 --> 0:03:06,000
something everyone is familiar with, and which is shown in this image.

51
0:03:07.055,000 --> 0:03:1,000
DNA is our genetic heritage.

52
0:03:10.339,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It is extremely important, and once again, phosphorus is a key player.

53
0:03:15.36,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, where do we find this phosphorus?

54
0:03:19.308,000 --> 0:03:22,000
As humans, where do we find it?

55
0:03:22.869,000 --> 0:03:23,000
As I explained earlier,

56
0:03:24.358,000 --> 0:03:28,000
plants extract phosphorus from the soil, through water.

57
0:03:29.147,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So, we humans get it from the things we eat:

58
0:03:32.722,000 --> 0:03:34,000
plants, vegetables, fruits,

59
0:03:35.397,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and also from eggs, meat and milk.

60
0:03:38.912,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It’s true that some humans eat better than others.

61
0:03:41.969,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Some are happier than others.

62
0:03:44.605,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And now, looking at this picture, which speaks for itself,

63
0:03:49.076,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we see modern agriculture,

64
0:03:50.892,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which I also refer to as intensive agriculture.

65
0:03:54.448,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Intensive agriculture is based on the use of chemical fertilizers.

66
0:03:58.904,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Without them, we would not manage to produce enough

67
0:04:01.932,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to feed the world's population.

68
0:04:04.96,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Speaking of humans, there are currently 7 billion of us on Earth.

69
0:04:08.738,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In less than 40 years, there will be 9 billion of us.

70
0:04:11.864,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the question is a simple one: Do we have enough phosphorus

71
0:04:15.254,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to feed our future generations?

72
0:04:19.134,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So, in order to understand these issues, where do we find our phosphorus?

73
0:04:23.216,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Let me explain.

74
0:04:24.997,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But first, let’s just suppose

75
0:04:27.844,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that we are using 100 percent of a given dose of phosphorus.

76
0:04:33.69,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Only 15 percent of this 100 percent goes to the plant. Eighty-five percent is lost.

77
0:04:42.278,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It goes into the soil, ending its journey in the lakes,

78
0:04:45.947,000 --> 0:04:48,000
resulting in lakes with extra phosphorus, which leads to the blue algae problem.

79
0:04:49.673,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So, you’ll see there’s a problem here, something that is illogical.

80
0:04:53.411,000 --> 0:04:57,000
A hundred percent of the phosphorus is used, but only 15 percent goes to the plant.

81
0:04:57.85,000 --> 0:04:58,000
You’re going to tell me it’s wasteful.

82
0:05:00.274,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Yes, it is. What is worse is that it is very expensive.

83
0:05:04.401,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Nobody wants to throw their money out the window,

84
0:05:07.783,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but unfortunately that's what is happening here.

85
0:05:10.513,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Eighty percent of each dose of phosphorus is lost.

86
0:05:15.049,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Modern agriculture depends on phosphorus.

87
0:05:20.701,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant, all the rest is lost,

88
0:05:25.3,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we have to add more and more.

89
0:05:27.221,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, where will we get this phosphorus from?

90
0:05:31.135,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Basically, we get it out of mines.

91
0:05:34.989,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This is the cover of an extraordinary article

92
0:05:37.516,000 --> 0:05:38,000
published in Nature in 2009,

93
0:05:39.273,000 --> 0:05:42,000
which really launched the discussion about the phosphorus crisis.

94
0:05:42.46,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Phosphorus, a nutrient essential to life, which is becoming increasingly scarce,

95
0:05:47.423,000 --> 0:05:48,000
yet nobody is talking about it.

96
0:05:49.246,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And everyone agrees: Politicians and scientists are in agreement

97
0:05:55.11,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that we are headed for a phosphorus crisis.

98
0:05:57.451,000 --> 0:06:,000
What you are seeing here is an open-pit mine in the U.S.,

99
0:06:00.899,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and to give you an idea of the dimensions of this mine,

100
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
if you look in the top right-hand corner, the little crane you can see,

101
0:06:07.554,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that is a giant crane.

102
0:06:09.369,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So that really puts it into perspective.

103
0:06:12.403,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So, we get phosphorus from mines.

104
0:06:14.601,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And if I make a comparison with oil,

105
0:06:17.809,000 --> 0:06:2,000
there’s an oil crisis, we talk about it, we talk about global warming,

106
0:06:21.18,000 --> 0:06:23,000
yet we never mention the phosphorus crisis.

107
0:06:23.204,000 --> 0:06:26,000
To come back to the oil problem, oil is something we can replace.

108
0:06:27.406,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We can use biofuels, or solar power,

109
0:06:31.768,000 --> 0:06:34,000
or hydropower, but phosphorus is an essential element,

110
0:06:35.532,000 --> 0:06:38,000
indispensable to life, and we can’t replace it.

111
0:06:41.106,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What is the current state of the world's phosphorus reserves?

112
0:06:44.769,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This graph gives you a rough idea of where we are today.

113
0:06:48.88,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The black line represents predictions for phosphorus reserves.

114
0:06:53.531,000 --> 0:06:55,000
In 2030, we’ll reach the peak.

115
0:06:56.155,000 --> 0:06:59,000
By the end of this century, it will all be gone.

116
0:06:59.661,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The dotted line shows where we are today.

117
0:07:03.976,000 --> 0:07:06,000
As you can see, they meet in 2030, I’ll be retired by then.

118
0:07:08.658,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But we are indeed heading for a major crisis,

119
0:07:12.227,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and I’d like people to become aware of this problem.

120
0:07:16.089,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Do we have a solution?

121
0:07:18.449,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What are we to do? We are faced with a paradox.

122
0:07:22.531,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Less and less phosphorus will be available.

123
0:07:25.118,000 --> 0:07:28,000
By 2050 there will be 9 billion of us,

124
0:07:28.484,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,

125
0:07:35.098,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we will need to produce twice as much food in 2050 than we do today.

126
0:07:39.841,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So, we will have less phosphorus, but we'll need to produce more food.

127
0:07:44.141,000 --> 0:07:45,000
What should we do?

128
0:07:46.199,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It truly is a paradoxical situation.

129
0:07:49.029,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Do we have a solution, or an alternative

130
0:07:51.777,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which will allow us to optimize phosphorus use?

131
0:07:54.745,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost.

132
0:08:00.365,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The solution I'm offering today is one that has existed for a very long time,

133
0:08:07.669,000 --> 0:08:09,000
even before plants existed on Earth,

134
0:08:10.407,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and it's a microscopic mushroom that is very mysterious,

135
0:08:13.885,000 --> 0:08:16,000
very simple, and yet also extremely complex.

136
0:08:17.933,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I've been fascinated by this little mushroom for over 16 years now.

137
0:08:22.621,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It has led me to further my research

138
0:08:26.466,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and to use it as a model for my laboratory research.

139
0:08:29.836,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This mushroom exists in symbiosis with the roots.

140
0:08:33.55,000 --> 0:08:38,000
By symbiosis, I mean a bidirectional and mutually beneficial association

141
0:08:38.937,000 --> 0:08:41,000
which is also called mycorrhiza.

142
0:08:44.085,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This slide illustrates the elements of a mycorrhiza.

143
0:08:47.142,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You’re looking at the root of wheat,

144
0:08:49.407,000 --> 0:08:52,000
one of the world’s most important plants.

145
0:08:53.501,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Normally, a root will find phosphorus all by itself.

146
0:08:56.34,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It will go in search of phosphorus,

147
0:08:58.372,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but only within the one millimeter which surrounds it.

148
0:09:02.044,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Beyond one millimeter, the root is ineffective.

149
0:09:05.119,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It cannot go further in its search for phosphorus.

150
0:09:07.444,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now, imagine this tiny, microscopic mushroom.

151
0:09:10.18,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It grows much faster,

152
0:09:12.441,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus.

153
0:09:15.237,000 --> 0:09:18,000
It can go beyond the root’s one-millimeter scope

154
0:09:18.616,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to seek out phosphorus.

155
0:09:20.703,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I haven’t invented anything at all;

156
0:09:22.759,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it's a biotechnology that has existed for 450 million years.

157
0:09:26.257,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And over time, this mushroom has evolved and adapted to seek out

158
0:09:30.17,000 --> 0:09:33,000
even the tiniest trace of phosphorus, and to put it to use,

159
0:09:33.663,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to make it available to the plant.

160
0:09:36.716,000 --> 0:09:39,000
What you’re seeing here, in the real world, is a carrot root,

161
0:09:41.289,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and the mushroom with its very fine filaments.

162
0:09:43.92,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Looking closer, we can see that this mushroom

163
0:09:46.327,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is very gentle in its penetration.

164
0:09:48.414,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It will proliferate between the root's cells,

165
0:09:52.103,000 --> 0:09:55,000
eventually penetrating a cell

166
0:09:55.596,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and starting to form a typical arbuscular structure,

167
0:10:00.6,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which will considerably increase the exchange interface

168
0:10:05.477,000 --> 0:10:07,000
between the plant and the mushroom.

169
0:10:08.036,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And it is through this structure that mutual exchanges will occur.

170
0:10:11.481,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It’s a win-win trade:

171
0:10:13.117,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I give you phosphorus, and you feed me.

172
0:10:15.992,000 --> 0:10:17,000
True symbiosis.

173
0:10:20.602,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now let's add a mycorrhiza plant

174
0:10:23.37,000 --> 0:10:26,000
into the diagram I used earlier.

175
0:10:26.63,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And instead of using a 100 percent dose, I’m going to reduce it to 25 percent.

176
0:10:31.707,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You’ll see that of this 25 percent, most will benefit the plant,

177
0:10:36.681,000 --> 0:10:37,000
more than 90 percent.

178
0:10:38.237,000 --> 0:10:41,000
A very small amount of phosphorus will remain in the soil.

179
0:10:41.817,000 --> 0:10:43,000
That's completely natural.

180
0:10:45.577,000 --> 0:10:48,000
What's more is that in certain cases, we don't even need to add phosphorus.

181
0:10:49.448,000 --> 0:10:51,000
If you recall the graphs I showed you earlier,

182
0:10:51.86,000 --> 0:10:54,000
85 percent of phosphorus is lost in the soil,

183
0:10:55.081,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and the plants are unable to access it.

184
0:10:58.326,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Even though it is present in the soil, it is in insoluble form.

185
0:11:02.134,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The plant is only able to seek out soluble forms.

186
0:11:05.144,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The mushroom is capable of dissolving this insoluble form

187
0:11:08.956,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and making it available for the plant to use.

188
0:11:12.397,000 --> 0:11:15,000
To further support my argument, here is a picture that speaks for itself.

189
0:11:15.948,000 --> 0:11:18,000
These are trials in a field of sorghum.

190
0:11:19.836,000 --> 0:11:23,000
On the left side, you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture,

191
0:11:24.348,000 --> 0:11:26,000
with a 100 percent phosphorus dose.

192
0:11:27.09,000 --> 0:11:3,000
On the other side, the dose was reduced to 50 percent,

193
0:11:30.303,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and just look at the yield.

194
0:11:31.836,000 --> 0:11:36,000
With only a half-dose, we achieved a better yield.

195
0:11:37.417,000 --> 0:11:41,000
This is to show you that this method works.

196
0:11:42.247,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And in some cases, in Cuba, Mexico and India,

197
0:11:46.816,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the dose can be reduced to 25 percent, and in several other cases,

198
0:11:50.103,000 --> 0:11:52,000
there's no need to add any phosphorus at all,

199
0:11:52.257,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because the mushrooms are so well adapted

200
0:11:54.701,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to finding phosphorus and drawing it from the soil.

201
0:11:57.897,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is an example of soy production in Canada.

202
0:12:03.735,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Mycorrhiza was used in one field but not in the other.

203
0:12:11.347,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And here, where blue indicates a better yield, and yellow a weaker yield.

204
0:12:20.763,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The black rectangle is the plot

205
0:12:23.586,000 --> 0:12:25,000
from which the mycorrhiza was added.

206
0:12:25.969,000 --> 0:12:28,000
In other words, as I already said, I have invented nothing.

207
0:12:29.337,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Mycorrhiza has existed for 450 million years,

208
0:12:32.087,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and it has even helped modern-day plant species to diversify.

209
0:12:36.346,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So, this it isn't something that is still undergoing lab tests.

210
0:12:40.905,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Mycorrhiza exists, it works,

211
0:12:43.321,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it's produced at an industrial scale and commercialized worldwide.

212
0:12:47.76,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The problem is that people are not aware of it.

213
0:12:51.07,000 --> 0:12:54,000
People like food producers and farmers are still not aware of this problem.

214
0:12:55.066,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We have a technology that works,

215
0:12:57.694,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and one that, if used correctly, will alleviate some of the pressure

216
0:13:04.791,000 --> 0:13:07,000
we are putting on the world's phosphorus reserves.

217
0:13:09.214,000 --> 0:13:13,000
In conclusion, I am a scientist and a dreamer.

218
0:13:14.368,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I'm passionate about this topic.

219
0:13:16.127,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So if you were to ask me what my retirement dream is,

220
0:13:19.415,000 --> 0:13:21,000
which will be at the moment we reach that phosphorus peak,

221
0:13:22.241,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it would be that we use one label, "Made with mycorrhiza,"

222
0:13:26.197,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and that my children and grandchildren

223
0:13:29.107,000 --> 0:13:32,000
buy products bearing that label too.

224
0:13:32.115,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Thank you for your attention.

225
0:13:33.815,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

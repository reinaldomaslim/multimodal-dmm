1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Growing up in northern Wisconsin,

2
0:00:14.841,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I've naturally developed a connection to the Mississippi River.

3
0:00:19.167,000 --> 0:00:2,000
When I was little,

4
0:00:20.365,000 --> 0:00:24,000
my sister and I would have contests to see who could spell

5
0:00:24.536,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i" the fastest.

6
0:00:29.115,000 --> 0:00:3,000
When I was in elementary school,

7
0:00:30.703,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I got to learn about the early explorers and their expeditions,

8
0:00:35.268,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Marquette and Joliet, and how they used the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River

9
0:00:39.102,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and its tributaries to discover the Midwest,

10
0:00:42.195,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and to map a trade route to the Gulf of Mexico.

11
0:00:46.466,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In graduate school,

12
0:00:47.934,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was fortunate to have the Mississippi River

13
0:00:50.419,000 --> 0:00:52,000
outside my research laboratory window

14
0:00:52.847,000 --> 0:00:54,000
at the University of Minnesota.

15
0:00:55.68,000 --> 0:00:58,000
During that five-year period, I got to know the Mississippi River.

16
0:00:59.425,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I got to know its temperamental nature

17
0:01:01.766,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and where it would flood its banks at one moment,

18
0:01:04.885,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and then shortly thereafter,

19
0:01:07.21,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you would see its dry shorelines.

20
0:01:10.218,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Today, as a physical organic chemist,

21
0:01:13.004,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm committed to use my training

22
0:01:15.059,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to help protect rivers, like the Mississippi,

23
0:01:18.269,000 --> 0:01:21,000
from excessive salt that can come from human activity.

24
0:01:22.374,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Because, you know,

25
0:01:23.573,000 --> 0:01:27,000
salt is something that can contaminate freshwater rivers.

26
0:01:28.422,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And freshwater rivers, they have only salt levels of .05 percent.

27
0:01:34.677,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And at this level, it's safe to drink.

28
0:01:38.296,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But the majority of the water on our planet is housed in our oceans,

29
0:01:42.3,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and ocean water has a salinity level of more than three percent.

30
0:01:46.346,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And if you drank that, you'd be sick very quick.

31
0:01:50.427,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So, if we are to compare the relative volume of ocean water

32
0:01:55.085,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to that of the river water that's on our planet,

33
0:01:58.387,000 --> 0:02:,000
and let's say we are able to put the ocean water

34
0:02:01.355,000 --> 0:02:03,000
into an Olympic-size swimming pool,

35
0:02:04.157,000 --> 0:02:08,000
then our planet's river water would fit in a one-gallon jug.

36
0:02:09.095,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So you can see it's a precious resource.

37
0:02:12.031,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But do we treat it like a precious resource?

38
0:02:14.888,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Or rather, do we treat it like that old rug

39
0:02:17.181,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that you put in your front doorway and wipe your feet off on it?

40
0:02:21.244,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Treating rivers like that old rug has severe consequences.

41
0:02:25.427,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Let's take a look.

42
0:02:27.022,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Let's see what just one teaspoon of salt can do.

43
0:02:31.53,000 --> 0:02:33,000
If we add one teaspoon of salt

44
0:02:33.818,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to this Olympic-size swimming pool of ocean water,

45
0:02:37.284,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the ocean water stays ocean water.

46
0:02:40.085,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But if we add that same one teaspoon of salt

47
0:02:42.339,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to this one-gallon jug of fresh river water,

48
0:02:45.355,000 --> 0:02:48,000
suddenly, it becomes too salty to drink.

49
0:02:49.149,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So the point here is,

50
0:02:50.395,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because rivers, the volume is so small compared to the oceans,

51
0:02:56.085,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it is especially vulnerable to human activity,

52
0:02:58.728,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we need to take care to protect them.

53
0:03:02.117,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So recently, I surveyed the literature

54
0:03:04.506,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to look at the river health around the world.

55
0:03:07.609,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I fully expected to see ailing river health

56
0:03:10.863,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in regions of water scarcity and heavy industrial development.

57
0:03:15.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I saw that in northern China and in India.

58
0:03:19.736,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But I was surprised when I read a 2018 article

59
0:03:24.17,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where there's 232 river-sampling sites

60
0:03:28.758,000 --> 0:03:3,000
sampled across the United States.

61
0:03:31.345,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And of those sites,

62
0:03:33.024,000 --> 0:03:36,000
37 percent had increasing salinity levels.

63
0:03:37.204,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What was more surprising

64
0:03:38.95,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is that the ones with the highest increases

65
0:03:41.807,000 --> 0:03:43,000
were found on the east part of the United States,

66
0:03:44.736,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and not the arid southwest.

67
0:03:47.48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The authors of this paper postulate

68
0:03:50.125,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that this could be due to using salt to deice roads.

69
0:03:55.751,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Potentially, another source of this salt

70
0:03:58.373,000 --> 0:04:01,000
could come from salty industrial wastewaters.

71
0:04:02.084,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So as you see, human activities can convert our freshwater rivers

72
0:04:07.406,000 --> 0:04:09,000
into water that's more like our oceans.

73
0:04:09.93,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So we need to act and do something before it's too late.

74
0:04:14.231,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I have a proposal.

75
0:04:16.942,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We can take a three-step river-defense mechanism,

76
0:04:21.275,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and if industrial-water users practice this defense mechanism,

77
0:04:26.359,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we can put our rivers in a much safer position.

78
0:04:30.899,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This involves, number one,

79
0:04:33.334,000 --> 0:04:35,000
extracting less water from our rivers

80
0:04:35.847,000 --> 0:04:38,000
by implementing water recycle and reuse operations.

81
0:04:40.403,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Number two,

82
0:04:41.585,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we need to take the salt out of these salty industrial wastewaters

83
0:04:45.617,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and recover it and reuse it for other purposes.

84
0:04:49.695,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And number three, we need to convert salt consumers,

85
0:04:53.784,000 --> 0:04:56,000
who currently source our salt from mines

86
0:04:56.863,000 --> 0:05:,000
into salt consumers that source our salt from recycled salt sources.

87
0:05:01.942,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This three-part defense mechanism is already in play.

88
0:05:05.442,000 --> 0:05:07,000
This is what northern China and India are implementing

89
0:05:08.405,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to help to rehabilitate the rivers.

90
0:05:11.123,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But the proposal here

91
0:05:12.671,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is to use this defense mechanism to protect our rivers,

92
0:05:16.901,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so we don't need to rehabilitate them.

93
0:05:20.159,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And the good news is, we have technology that can do this.

94
0:05:23.619,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's with membranes.

95
0:05:25.532,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Membranes that can separate salt and water.

96
0:05:29.593,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Membranes have been around for a number of years,

97
0:05:32.752,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and they're based on polymeric materials that separate based on size,

98
0:05:37.738,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or they can separate based on charge.

99
0:05:40.371,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The membranes that are used to separate salt and water

100
0:05:43.919,000 --> 0:05:46,000
typically separate based on charge.

101
0:05:46.966,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And these membranes are negatively charged,

102
0:05:49.593,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and help to repel the negatively charged chloride ions

103
0:05:52.458,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that are in that dissolved salt.

104
0:05:55.974,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So, as I said, these membranes have been around for a number of years,

105
0:06:00.45,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and currently, they are purifying 25 million gallons of water every minute.

106
0:06:07.457,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Even more than that, actually.

107
0:06:09.77,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But they can do more.

108
0:06:12.254,000 --> 0:06:16,000
These membranes are based under the principle of reverse osmosis.

109
0:06:17.421,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now osmosis is this natural process that happens in our bodies --

110
0:06:22.45,000 --> 0:06:23,000
you know, how our cells work.

111
0:06:24.292,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And osmosis is where you have two chambers

112
0:06:27.738,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that separate two levels of salt concentration.

113
0:06:31.34,000 --> 0:06:33,000
One with low salt concentration

114
0:06:33.434,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and one with high salt concentration.

115
0:06:35.528,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And separating the two chambers is the semipermeable membrane.

116
0:06:39.871,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And under the natural osmosis process,

117
0:06:42.331,000 --> 0:06:46,000
what happens is the water naturally transports across that membrane

118
0:06:46.365,000 --> 0:06:47,000
from the area of low salt concentration

119
0:06:48.31,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to the area of high salt concentration,

120
0:06:50.802,000 --> 0:06:52,000
until an equilibrium is met.

121
0:06:54.437,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now reverse osmosis, it's the reverse of this natural process.

122
0:06:58.136,000 --> 0:07:,000
And in order to achieve this reversal,

123
0:07:00.284,000 --> 0:07:04,000
what we do is we apply a pressure to the high-concentration side

124
0:07:05.162,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and in doing so, we drive the water the opposite direction.

125
0:07:09.13,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And so the high-concentration side becomes more salty,

126
0:07:12.583,000 --> 0:07:13,000
more concentrated,

127
0:07:13.987,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and the low-concentration side becomes your purified water.

128
0:07:18.436,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So using reverse osmosis, we can take an industrial wastewater

129
0:07:23.277,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and convert up to 95 percent of it into pure water,

130
0:07:27.903,000 --> 0:07:31,000
leaving only five percent as this concentrated salty mixture.

131
0:07:33.022,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now, this five percent concentrated salty mixture

132
0:07:36.363,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is not waste.

133
0:07:37.879,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So scientists have also developed membranes

134
0:07:40.605,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that are modified to allow some salts to pass through

135
0:07:44.972,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and not others.

136
0:07:46.939,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Using these membranes,

137
0:07:48.297,000 --> 0:07:51,000
which are commonly referred to as nanofiltration membranes,

138
0:07:51.419,000 --> 0:07:54,000
now this five percent concentrated salty solution

139
0:07:54.776,000 --> 0:07:57,000
can be converted into a purified salt solution.

140
0:07:58.863,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So, in total, using reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes,

141
0:08:03.958,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we can convert industrial wastewater

142
0:08:06.458,000 --> 0:08:09,000
into a resource of both water and salt.

143
0:08:10.633,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And in doing so,

144
0:08:12.271,000 --> 0:08:16,000
achieve pillars one and two of this river-defense mechanism.

145
0:08:17.557,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Now, I've introduced this to a number of industrial-water users,

146
0:08:22.184,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the common response is,

147
0:08:24.895,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"Yeah, but who is going to use my salt?"

148
0:08:28.014,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So that's why pillar number three is so important.

149
0:08:31.038,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We need to transform folks that are using mine salt

150
0:08:34.842,000 --> 0:08:36,000
into consumers of recycled salt.

151
0:08:38.08,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So who are these salt consumers?

152
0:08:41.056,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Well, in 2018 in the United States,

153
0:08:43.35,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I learned that 43 percent of the salt consumed in the US

154
0:08:48.273,000 --> 0:08:51,000
was used for road salt deicing purposes.

155
0:08:52.289,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Thirty-nine percent was used by the chemical industry.

156
0:08:55.577,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So let's take a look at these two applications.

157
0:08:58.927,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So, I was shocked.

158
0:09:01.958,000 --> 0:09:04,000
In the 2018-2019 winter season,

159
0:09:05.141,000 --> 0:09:07,000
one million tons of salt

160
0:09:08.118,000 --> 0:09:12,000
was applied to the roads in the state of Pennsylvania.

161
0:09:13.315,000 --> 0:09:14,000
One million tons of salt is enough

162
0:09:15.138,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to fill two-thirds of an Empire State Building.

163
0:09:19.03,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That's one million tons of salt mined from the earth,

164
0:09:22.826,000 --> 0:09:23,000
applied to our roads,

165
0:09:24.548,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and then it washes off into the environment and into our rivers.

166
0:09:29.625,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So the proposal here is that we could at least

167
0:09:33.046,000 --> 0:09:36,000
source that salt from a salty industrial wastewater,

168
0:09:36.69,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and prevent that from going into our rivers,

169
0:09:39.126,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and rather use that to apply to our roads.

170
0:09:42.204,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So at least when the melt happens in the springtime

171
0:09:44.978,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and you have this high-salinity runoff,

172
0:09:47.752,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the rivers are at least in a better position

173
0:09:50.03,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to defend themselves against that.

174
0:09:54.053,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Now, as a chemist,

175
0:09:55.458,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the opportunity though that I'm more psyched about

176
0:09:59.592,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is the concept of introducing circular salt into the chemical industry.

177
0:10:05.052,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And the chlor-alkali industry is perfect.

178
0:10:10.028,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Chlor-alkali industry is the source of epoxies,

179
0:10:13.522,000 --> 0:10:15,000
it's the source of urethanes and solvents

180
0:10:16.4,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and a lot of useful products that we use in our everyday lives.

181
0:10:20.593,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And it uses sodium chloride salt as its key feed stack.

182
0:10:25.934,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So the idea here is,

183
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
well, first of all, let's look at linear economy.

184
0:10:30.673,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So in a linear economy, they're sourcing that salt from a mine,

185
0:10:34.03,000 --> 0:10:36,000
it goes through this chlor-alkali process,

186
0:10:36.109,000 --> 0:10:37,000
made into a basic chemical,

187
0:10:38.093,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which then can get converted into another new product,

188
0:10:40.855,000 --> 0:10:41,000
or a more functional product.

189
0:10:43.3,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But during that conversion process,

190
0:10:46.006,000 --> 0:10:49,000
oftentimes salt is regenerated as the by-product,

191
0:10:49.839,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and it ends up in the industrial wastewater.

192
0:10:53.402,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So, the idea is that we can introduce circularity,

193
0:10:58.521,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and we can recycle the water and salt from those industrial wastewater streams,

194
0:11:03.395,000 --> 0:11:04,000
from the factories,

195
0:11:04.839,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and we can send it to the front end of the chlor-alkali process.

196
0:11:10.388,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Circular salt.

197
0:11:11.936,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So how impactful is this?

198
0:11:14.42,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Well, let's just take one example.

199
0:11:16.873,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Fifty percent of the world's production of propylene oxide

200
0:11:20.383,000 --> 0:11:22,000
is made through the chlor-alkali process.

201
0:11:23.379,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And that's a total of about five million tons of propylene oxide

202
0:11:28.64,000 --> 0:11:3,000
on an annual basis, made globally.

203
0:11:31.768,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So that's five million tons of salt mined from the earth

204
0:11:35.95,000 --> 0:11:38,000
converted through the chlor-alkali process into propylene oxide,

205
0:11:39.863,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and then during that process,

206
0:11:41.577,000 --> 0:11:45,000
five million tons of salt that ends up in wastewater streams.

207
0:11:46.547,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So five million tons

208
0:11:48.055,000 --> 0:11:51,000
is enough salt to fill three Empire State Buildings.

209
0:11:51.794,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And that's on an annual basis.

210
0:11:54.157,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So you can see how circular salt can provide a barrier

211
0:11:59.72,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to our rivers from this excessive salty discharge.

212
0:12:04.446,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So you might wonder,

213
0:12:06.059,000 --> 0:12:09,000
"Well, gosh, these membranes have been around for a number of years,

214
0:12:10.073,000 --> 0:12:14,000
so why aren't people implementing wastewater reuse?

215
0:12:14.741,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Well, the bottom line is,

216
0:12:16.796,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it costs money to implement wastewater reuse.

217
0:12:20.114,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And second,

218
0:12:21.724,000 --> 0:12:24,000
water in these regions is undervalued.

219
0:12:25.323,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Until it's too late.

220
0:12:27.244,000 --> 0:12:31,000
You know, if we don't plan for freshwater sustainability,

221
0:12:31.807,000 --> 0:12:33,000
there are some severe consequences.

222
0:12:34.188,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You can just ask one of the world's largest chemical manufacturers

223
0:12:37.364,000 --> 0:12:4,000
who last year took a 280-million dollar hit

224
0:12:41.051,000 --> 0:12:44,000
due to low river levels of the Rhine River in Germany.

225
0:12:45.995,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You can ask the residents of Cape Town, South Africa,

226
0:12:49.879,000 --> 0:12:53,000
who experienced a year-over-year drought drying up their water reserves,

227
0:12:54.101,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and then being asked not to flush their toilets.

228
0:12:58.292,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So you can see,

229
0:13:00.101,000 --> 0:13:02,000
we have solutions here, with membranes,

230
0:13:02.339,000 --> 0:13:06,000
where we can provide pure water,

231
0:13:06.79,000 --> 0:13:08,000
we can provide pure salt,

232
0:13:09.028,000 --> 0:13:11,000
using these membranes, both of these,

233
0:13:11.196,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to help to protect our rivers for future generations.

234
0:13:14.734,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Thank you.

235
0:13:15.917,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Applause)

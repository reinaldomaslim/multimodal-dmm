1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was offered a position as associate professor of medicine

2
0:00:18.998,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and chief of scientific visualization

3
0:00:21.83,000 --> 0:00:22,000
at Yale University

4
0:00:23.831,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the department of medicine.

5
0:00:25.464,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And my job was to write many of the algorithms and code

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
for NASA to do virtual surgery

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in preparation for the astronauts going into deep-space flight,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
so they could be kept in robotic pods.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
One of the fascinating things about what we were working on

10
0:00:38.19,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is that we were seeing, using new scanning technologies,

11
0:00:41.232,000 --> 0:00:42,000
things that had never been seen before.

12
0:00:43.237,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Not only in disease management,

13
0:00:44.835,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but also things that allowed us to see things about the body

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that just made you marvel.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And your entire body, everything --

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
your hair, skin, bone, nails --

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
everything is made of collagen.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And it's a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this.

20
0:01:05.212,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And the only place that collagen changes its structure

21
0:01:09.441,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is in the cornea of your eye.

22
0:01:11.241,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In your eye, it becomes a grid formation,

23
0:01:14.64,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and therefore, it becomes transparent, as opposed to opaque.

24
0:01:17.971,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So perfectly organized a structure,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
it was hard not to attribute divinity to it.

26
0:01:22.798,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Because we kept on seeing this in different parts of the body.

27
0:01:27.92,000 --> 0:01:29,000
One of the opportunities I had

28
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
was one person was working on a really interesting

29
0:01:32.665,000 --> 0:01:34,000
micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the NIH.

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And what we were going to do

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
was scan a new project

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
on the development of the fetus from conception to birth

33
0:01:42.114,000 --> 0:01:43,000
using these new technologies.

34
0:01:43.812,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So I wrote the algorithms and code,

35
0:01:45.793,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and he built the hardware -- Paul Lauterbur --

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
then went onto win the Nobel Prize for inventing the MRI.

37
0:01:51.817,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I got the data.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I'm going to show you a sample of the piece,

Alexander Tsiaras: Thank you.

70
0:05:59.525,000 --> 0:06:,000
But as you can see,

71
0:06:00.826,000 --> 0:06:02,000
when you actually start working on this data,

72
0:06:03.027,000 --> 0:06:04,000
it's pretty spectacular.

73
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And as we kept on scanning more and more,

74
0:06:06.899,000 --> 0:06:08,000
working on this project,

75
0:06:09.118,000 --> 0:06:11,000
looking at these two simple cells

76
0:06:11.213,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that have this unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you.

77
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And as we kept on working on this data,

78
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
looking at small clusters of the body,

79
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
these little pieces of tissue

80
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that were the trophoblasts coming off of the blastocyst,

81
0:06:26.216,000 --> 0:06:28,000
all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus,

82
0:06:29.202,000 --> 0:06:3,000
saying, "I'm here to stay."

83
0:06:30.56,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Having conversation and communications

84
0:06:32.46,000 --> 0:06:33,000
with the estrogens, the progesterones,

85
0:06:34.36,000 --> 0:06:36,000
saying, "I'm here to stay, plant me,"

86
0:06:37.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
building this incredible trilinear fetus

87
0:06:40.35,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that becomes, within 44 days, something that you can recognize,

88
0:06:43.46,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being.

89
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The marvel of this information:

90
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
How do we actually have this biological mechanism

91
0:06:52.652,000 --> 0:06:53,000
inside our body

92
0:06:53.976,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to actually see this information?

93
0:06:55.889,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I'm going to show you something pretty unique.

94
0:06:58.2,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Here's a human heart at 25 days.

95
0:07:00.217,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's just basically two strands.

96
0:07:01.834,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And like this magnificent origami,

97
0:07:03.56,000 --> 0:07:07,000
cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks,

98
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
as it's just folding on itself.

99
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Within five weeks, you start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles.

100
0:07:14.065,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Six weeks, these folds are now beginning

101
0:07:16.309,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with the papilla on the inside of the heart

102
0:07:18.49,000 --> 0:07:21,000
actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart

103
0:07:21.96,000 --> 0:07:23,000
until you get a mature heart --

104
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and then basically the development of the entire human body.

105
0:07:27.173,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure

106
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
saying exactly where that nerve cell should go --

107
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the complexity of these,

108
0:07:36.29,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the mathematical models of how these things are indeed done

109
0:07:39.211,000 --> 0:07:4,000
are beyond human comprehension.

110
0:07:41.106,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Even though I am a mathematician,

111
0:07:43.053,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I look at this with marvel

112
0:07:44.992,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes

113
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
as they build what is us?

114
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It's a mystery, it's magic, it's divinity.

115
0:07:53.284,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Then you start to take a look at adult life.

116
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries.

117
0:07:58.523,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's just a tiny sub-substructure, microscopic.

118
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But basically by the time you're nine months and you're given birth,

119
0:08:05.931,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you have almost 60,000 miles of vessels inside your body.

120
0:08:10.577,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And only one mile is visible.

121
0:08:12.728,000 --> 0:08:14,000
59,999 miles

122
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away.

123
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The complexity of building that within a single system

124
0:08:20.945,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is, again, beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today.

125
0:08:24.854,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And then instructions set,

126
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
from the brain to every other part of the body --

127
0:08:29.069,000 --> 0:08:3,000
look at the complexity of the folding.

128
0:08:30.947,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Where does this intelligence

129
0:08:32.36,000 --> 0:08:34,000
of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information,

130
0:08:35.199,000 --> 0:08:37,000
so as you actually watch the baby's brain grow.

131
0:08:37.815,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And this is one of the things we're doing.

132
0:08:39.983,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We're launching two new studies

133
0:08:41.56,000 --> 0:08:43,000
of scanning babies' brains from the moment they're born.

134
0:08:44.357,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Every six months until they're six years old,

135
0:08:46.572,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we're going to be doing about 250 children,

136
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold

137
0:08:52.987,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to see how this magnificent development

138
0:08:55.048,000 --> 0:08:57,000
actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us.

139
0:08:57.66,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And it's not just our own existence,

140
0:08:59.46,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but how does the woman's body understand

141
0:09:02.326,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to have genetic structure that not only builds her own,

142
0:09:05.031,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but then has the understanding

143
0:09:06.56,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that allows her to become

144
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
a walking immunological, cardiovascular system

145
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that basically is a mobile system

146
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that can actually nurture,

147
0:09:15.119,000 --> 0:09:17,000
treat this child with a kind of marvel

148
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that is beyond, again, our comprehension --

149
0:09:21.089,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the magic that is existence, that is us?

150
0:09:24.298,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Thank you.

151
0:09:25.46,000 --> 0:09:28,000

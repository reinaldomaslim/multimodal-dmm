1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Newspapers are dying for a few reasons.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Your iPhone, your laptop,

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And we should save trees in the end.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So it's enough to bury any industry.

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?"

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Some people say it should be free;

10
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4;

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
it should be local, run by communities,

12
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or niche, for some smaller groups like business --

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but then it's not free; it's very expensive.

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It should be opinion-driven;

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
less news, more views.

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And we'd rather read it during breakfast,

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
because later we listen to radio in a car,

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Sounds nice, but this can only buy time.

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Because in the long run,

21
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I think there is no reason, no practical reason

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
for newspapers to survive.

23
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So what can we do?

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Let me tell you my story.

26
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher,

27
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.

28
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
After a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.

29
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
They were run by an inexperienced staff,

30
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals --

31
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in many places there were not even art directors.

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director.

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once,

34
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
"What are you doing for a living?"

35
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I said, "I'm designing newspapers."

36
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters"

37
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day.

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.

40
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I had a revelation. I thought,

41
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
"These guys took some creepy,

42
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
run-down entertainment,

43
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and put it to the highest possible level of performance art."

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers."

45
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I did. We started to redesign them, one by one.

46
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
The front page became our signature.

47
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers.

48
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.

49
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
My approach was very egotistic.

50
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I wanted my artistic statement,

51
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
my interpretation of reality.

52
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I wanted to make posters, not newspapers.

53
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Not even magazines: posters.

54
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We were experimenting with type,

55
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
with illustration, with photos. And we had fun.

56
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Soon it started to bring results.

57
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In Poland, our pages were named

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"Covers of the Year" three times in a row.

59
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Other examples you can see here are from

60
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia

61
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and central European countries.

62
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But it's not only about the front page.

63
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The secret is that we were treating

64
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the whole newspaper as one piece,

65
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as one composition -- like music.

66
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.

67
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And design is responsible for this experience.

68
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Flipping through pages is readers experience,

69
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and I'm responsible for this experience.

70
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page,

71
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because that's how readers perceive it.

72
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards

73
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
on biggest infographic competition in Spain.

74
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.

75
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland,

76
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
they name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.

77
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And two years later,

78
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the same award came to Estonia.

79
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Isn't amazing?

80
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspapers

81
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
were growing too.

82
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Just some examples:

83
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in Russia, plus 11 after one year,

84
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
plus 29 after three years of the redesign.

85
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Same in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percent

86
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
raise of circulation after three years.

87
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You can see on a graph,

88
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow,

89
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
just after redesign.

90
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But the real hit was in Bulgaria.

91
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And that is really amazing.

92
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Did design do this?

93
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Design was just a part of the process.

94
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And the process we made was not about changing the look,

95
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
it was about improving the product completely.

96
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I took an architectural rule about function and form

97
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and translated it into newspaper content and design.

98
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And I put strategy at the top of it.

99
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?

100
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Then we adjust the content accordingly.

101
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And then, usually after two months, we start designing.

102
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
My bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.

103
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Why am I asking all of these business questions,

104
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
instead of just showing them pages?

105
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer:

106
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end.

107
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So what is the lesson behind it?

108
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.

109
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company;

110
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
it can turn your company upside down.

111
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It can even change you.

112
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And who's responsible? Designers.

113
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Give power to designers.

114
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But the second is even more important.

116
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You can live in a small poor country, like me.

117
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You can work for a small company,

118
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in a boring branch.

119
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
You can have no budgets, no people --

120
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but still can put your work to the highest possible level.

121
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And everybody can do it.

122
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You just need inspiration, vision and determination.

123
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And you need to remember that to be good

124
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is not enough.

125
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Thank you.

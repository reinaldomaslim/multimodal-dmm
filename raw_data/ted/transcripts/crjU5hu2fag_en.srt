1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Thank you.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It was a simple machine that changed my life.

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Before that time,

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I had never been away from my home

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in Malawi.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I had never used a computer.

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I had never seen an Internet.

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My English lost,

12
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I wanted to vomit.

13
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I had never been surrounded by so many azungu,

15
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
white people.

16
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.

18
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But well, I'm feeling good right now.

19
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I would like to share that story today.

20
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We have seven children in my family.

21
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
All sisters, excepting me.

22
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Before I discovered the wonders of science,

24
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I was just a simple farmer

25
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in a country of poor farmers.

26
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Like everyone else, we grew maize.

27
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
One year our fortune turned very bad.

28
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.

29
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.

30
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My family ate one meal per day, at night.

31
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.

32
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The food passes through our bodies.

33
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We drop down to nothing.

34
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
In Malawi, the secondary school,

35
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you have to pay school fees.

36
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.

37
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I looked at my father

38
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and looked at those dry fields.

39
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It was the future I couldn't accept.

40
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school,

41
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so I was determined to do anything possible

42
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to receive education.

43
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So I went to a library.

44
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I read books, science books, especially physics.

45
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I couldn't read English that well.

46
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I used diagrams and pictures

47
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to learn the words around them.

48
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Another book put that knowledge in my hands.

49
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.

50
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Pump water meant irrigation,

51
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a defense against hunger,

52
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which we were experiencing by that time.

53
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.

54
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But I didn't have materials to use,

55
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so I went to a scrap yard

56
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
where I found my materials.

57
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Many people, including my mother,

58
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
said I was crazy.

59
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I found a tractor fan,

61
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
shock absorber, PVC pipes.

62
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Using a bicycle frame

63
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and an old bicycle dynamo,

64
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I built my machine.

65
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It was one light at first.

66
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then four lights,

67
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
with switches, and even a circuit breaker,

68
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
modeled after an electric bell.

69
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Another machine pumps water

70
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
for irrigation.

71
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Queues of people start lining up at my house

72
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to charge their mobile phone.

74
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

75
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I could not get rid of them.

76
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And the reporters came too,

78
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which lead to bloggers

79
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and which lead to a call from something called TED.

80
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I had never seen an airplane before.

81
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I had never slept in a hotel.

82
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So, on stage that day in Arusha,

83
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
my English lost,

84
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I said something like,

85
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"I tried. And I made it."

86
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I would like to say something

87
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to all the people out there like me

88
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to the Africans, and the poor

89
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
who are struggling with your dreams.

90
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
God bless.

91
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.

92
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I say to you, trust yourself and believe.

93
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Whatever happens, don't give up.

94
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Thank you.

95
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Applause)

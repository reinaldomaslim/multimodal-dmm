1
0:00:13.602,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was born in 1993 in the northern part of North Korea,

2
0:00:18.709,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in a town called Hyesan,

3
0:00:21.22,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which is on the border with China.

4
0:00:24.949,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I had loving parents

5
0:00:27.503,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and one older sister.

6
0:00:31.237,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Before I was even 10 years old,

7
0:00:34.516,000 --> 0:00:36,000
my father was sent to a labor camp

8
0:00:37.07,000 --> 0:00:4,000
for engaging in illegal trading.

9
0:00:41.042,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now, by "illegal trading" --

10
0:00:45.686,000 --> 0:00:51,000
he was selling clogs, sugar, rice and later copper

11
0:00:51.927,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to feed us.

12
0:00:55.1,000 --> 0:01:01,000
In 2007, my sister and I decided to escape.

13
0:01:01.682,000 --> 0:01:03,000
She was 16 years old,

14
0:01:04.619,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I was 13 years old.

15
0:01:08.809,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I need you to understand what the word "escape" means

16
0:01:13.94,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in the context of North Korea.

17
0:01:17.694,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We were all starving,

18
0:01:20.045,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and hunger means death in North Korea.

19
0:01:25.666,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So it was the only option for us.

20
0:01:29.673,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I didn't even understand the concept of escape,

21
0:01:33.874,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but I could see the lights from China at night,

22
0:01:38.486,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and I wondered if I go where the light is,

23
0:01:43.246,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I might be able to find a bowl of rice.

24
0:01:48.702,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's not like we had a grand plan or maps.

25
0:01:52.364,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We did not know anything about what was going to happen.

26
0:01:57.052,000 --> 0:02:,000
Imagine your apartment building caught fire.

27
0:02:00.741,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I mean, what would you do?

28
0:02:02.867,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Would you stay there to be burned,

29
0:02:05.473,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or would you jump off out of the window

30
0:02:07.867,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and see what happens?

31
0:02:09.966,000 --> 0:02:1,000
That's what we did.

32
0:02:11.422,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We jumped out of the house

33
0:02:14.304,000 --> 0:02:15,000
instead of the fire.

34
0:02:17.5,000 --> 0:02:21,000
North Korea is unimaginable.

35
0:02:22.998,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's very hard for me

36
0:02:25.231,000 --> 0:02:29,000
when people ask me what it feels like to live there.

37
0:02:30.579,000 --> 0:02:32,000
To be honest,

38
0:02:32.71,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I tell you:

39
0:02:33.971,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you can't even imagine it.

40
0:02:39.07,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The words in any language can't describe,

41
0:02:43.632,000 --> 0:02:45,000
because it's a totally different planet,

42
0:02:47.458,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as you cannot imagine your life on Mars right now.

43
0:02:53.122,000 --> 0:02:58,000
For example, the word "love" has only one meaning:

44
0:02:59.393,000 --> 0:03:,000
love for the Dear Leader.

45
0:03:03.511,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There's no concept of romantic love in North Korea.

46
0:03:09.222,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And if you don't know the words,

47
0:03:12.258,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that means you don't understand the concept,

48
0:03:17.578,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and therefore, you don't even realize that concept is even a possibility.

49
0:03:25.422,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Let me give you another example.

50
0:03:29.096,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Growing up in North Korea,

51
0:03:31.41,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we truly believed that our Dear Leader is an almighty god

52
0:03:37.04,000 --> 0:03:39,000
who can even read my thoughts.

53
0:03:40.35,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I was even afraid to think in North Korea.

54
0:03:45.619,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We are told that he's starving for us,

55
0:03:47.954,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and he's working tirelessly for us,

56
0:03:50.276,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and my heart just broke for him.

57
0:03:53.802,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When I escaped to South Korea,

58
0:03:56.601,000 --> 0:03:59,000
people told me that he was actually a dictator,

59
0:04:00.564,000 --> 0:04:01,000
he had cars,

60
0:04:02.356,000 --> 0:04:03,000
many, many resorts,

61
0:04:03.951,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and he had an ultraluxurious life.

62
0:04:08.803,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And then I remember looking at a picture of him,

63
0:04:12.925,000 --> 0:04:15,000
realizing for the first time

64
0:04:16.249,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that he is the largest guy in the picture.

65
0:04:19.921,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

66
0:04:22.334,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And it hit me.

67
0:04:23.903,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Finally, I realized he wasn't starving.

68
0:04:29.632,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But I was never able to see that before,

69
0:04:32.824,000 --> 0:04:35,000
until someone told me that he was fat.

70
0:04:36.563,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:37.708,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Really, someone had to teach me that he was fat.

72
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
If you have never practiced critical thinking,

73
0:04:46.338,000 --> 0:04:49,000
then you simply see what you're told to see.

74
0:04:52.395,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The biggest question also people ask me

75
0:04:55.449,000 --> 0:04:58,000
is: "Why is there no revolution inside North Korea?

76
0:04:58.928,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Are we dumb?

77
0:05:01.202,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Why is there no revolution for 70 years of this oppression?"

78
0:05:07.531,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And I say:

79
0:05:10.305,000 --> 0:05:11,000
If you don't know you're a slave,

80
0:05:13.05,000 --> 0:05:17,000
if you don't know you're isolated or oppressed,

81
0:05:18.095,000 --> 0:05:19,000
how do you fight to be free?

82
0:05:22.676,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I mean, if you know you're isolated,

83
0:05:25.925,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that means you are not isolated.

84
0:05:28.955,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Not knowing is the true definition of isolation,

85
0:05:33.854,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and that's why I never knew

86
0:05:35.986,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I was isolated when I was in North Korea.

87
0:05:39.558,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I literally thought I was in the center of the universe.

88
0:05:45.517,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So here is my idea worth spreading:

89
0:05:52.622,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a lot of people think

90
0:05:54.225,000 --> 0:05:58,000
humans inherently know what is right and wrong,

91
0:05:58.917,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the difference between justice and injustice,

92
0:06:03.327,000 --> 0:06:06,000
what we deserve and we don't deserve.

93
0:06:07.647,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I tell them: BS.

94
0:06:10.14,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

95
0:06:11.778,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

96
0:06:18.462,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Everything,

97
0:06:21.231,000 --> 0:06:22,000
everything must be taught,

98
0:06:24.197,000 --> 0:06:25,000
including compassion.

99
0:06:27.965,000 --> 0:06:33,000
If I see someone dying on the street right now,

100
0:06:34.211,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I will do anything to save that person.

101
0:06:39.106,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But when I was in North Korea,

102
0:06:41.942,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I saw people dying and dead on the streets.

103
0:06:47.219,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I felt nothing.

104
0:06:49.58,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Not because I'm a psychopath,

105
0:06:52.471,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but because I never learned the concept of compassion.

106
0:06:57.082,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Only, I felt compassion, empathy and sympathy in my heart

107
0:07:02.36,000 --> 0:07:05,000
after I learned the word "compassion" and the concept,

108
0:07:05.958,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and I feel them now.

109
0:07:10.169,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now I live in the United States as a free person.

110
0:07:16.638,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause)

111
0:07:17.797,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Thank you.

112
0:07:19.338,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

113
0:07:24.113,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And recently,

114
0:07:26.248,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the leader of the free country, our President Trump,

115
0:07:30.331,000 --> 0:07:33,000
met with my former god.

116
0:07:35.177,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And he decided human rights is not important enough

117
0:07:39.918,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to include in his agendas,

118
0:07:43.17,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and he did not talk about it.

119
0:07:47.035,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And it scares me.

120
0:07:50.718,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We live in a world right now

121
0:07:54.018,000 --> 0:08:,000
where a dictator can be praised for executing his uncle,

122
0:08:00.42,000 --> 0:08:02,000
for killing his half brother,

123
0:08:02.997,000 --> 0:08:05,000
killing thousands of North Koreans.

124
0:08:06.024,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And that was worthy of praise.

125
0:08:10.829,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And also it made me think:

126
0:08:14.291,000 --> 0:08:2,000
perhaps we all need to be taught something new about freedom now.

127
0:08:24.926,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Freedom is fragile.

128
0:08:29.14,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I don't want to alarm you, but it is.

129
0:08:33.426,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It only took three generations

130
0:08:36.541,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to make North Korea into George Orwell's "1984."

131
0:08:42.965,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It took only three generations.

132
0:08:48.233,000 --> 0:08:52,000
If we don't fight for human rights

133
0:08:52.77,000 --> 0:08:56,000
for the people who are oppressed right now who don't have a voice,

134
0:08:56.874,000 --> 0:08:57,000
as free people here,

135
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
who will fight for us when we are not free?

136
0:09:04.976,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Machines? Animals? I don't know.

137
0:09:11.889,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I think it's wonderful that we care about climate change,

138
0:09:17.346,000 --> 0:09:19,000
animal rights, gender equality,

139
0:09:19.923,000 --> 0:09:2,000
all of these things.

140
0:09:21.674,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The fact that we care about animals' rights,

141
0:09:24.783,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that means that's how beautiful our heart is,

142
0:09:28.402,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that we care about someone who cannot speak for themselves.

143
0:09:32.932,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And North Koreans right now cannot speak for themselves.

144
0:09:38.9,000 --> 0:09:41,000
They don't have internet in the 21st century.

145
0:09:42.748,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We don't have electricity,

146
0:09:45.363,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and it is the darkest place on earth right now.

147
0:09:50.618,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now I want to say something to my fellow North Koreans

148
0:09:54.427,000 --> 0:09:56,000
who are living in that darkness.

149
0:09:58.05,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They might not believe this,

150
0:09:59.829,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but I want to tell them that an alternative life is possible.

151
0:10:04.705,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Be free.

152
0:10:07.709,000 --> 0:10:1,000
From my experience,

153
0:10:11.483,000 --> 0:10:14,000
literally anything is possible.

154
0:10:16.264,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I was bought,

155
0:10:17.82,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I was sold as a slave.

156
0:10:20.212,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But now I'm here,

157
0:10:22.456,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and that is why I believe in miracles.

158
0:10:27.462,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The one thing that I learned from history

159
0:10:30.691,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is that nothing is forever in this world.

160
0:10:35.729,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And that is why we have every reason to be hopeful.

161
0:10:41.175,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Thank you.

162
0:10:42.629,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.555,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm an historian.

2
0:00:14.191,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And what I love about being an historian is it gives you perspective.

3
0:00:18.687,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Today, I'd like to bring that perspective to education in the United States.

4
0:00:23.722,000 --> 0:00:25,000
About the only thing people can agree on

5
0:00:26.517,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is that the most strategic time for a child to start learning

6
0:00:30.398,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is early.

7
0:00:31.895,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Over 50 years ago,

8
0:00:33.294,000 --> 0:00:36,000
there was a watershed moment in early education in the US

9
0:00:36.808,000 --> 0:00:37,000
called "Head Start."

10
0:00:38.588,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, historians love watersheds

11
0:00:40.692,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because it makes it so easy to talk about what came before

12
0:00:43.923,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and what's happened since.

13
0:00:45.672,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Before Head Start, basically nothing.

14
0:00:48.863,000 --> 0:00:49,000
With Head Start,

15
0:00:50.282,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we began to get our nation's most at-risk children ready for school.

16
0:00:55.519,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Since Head Start, we've made strides,

17
0:00:58.485,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but there are still 2.2 million children in the US

18
0:01:02.292,000 --> 0:01:04,000
without access to early learning,

19
0:01:04.656,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or more than half of the four-year-olds in the country.

20
0:01:08.613,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That's a problem.

21
0:01:10.279,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But the bigger problem is what we know happens to those children.

22
0:01:14.18,000 --> 0:01:17,000
At-risk children who reach school without basic skills

23
0:01:17.674,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are 25 percent more likely to drop out,

24
0:01:20.738,000 --> 0:01:22,000
40 percent more likely to become teen parents

25
0:01:23.471,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and 60 percent less likely to go to college.

26
0:01:27.278,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So if we know how important early education is,

27
0:01:30.211,000 --> 0:01:32,000
why aren't all children getting it?

28
0:01:33.074,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There are barriers that the solutions we've come up with to date

29
0:01:36.937,000 --> 0:01:37,000
simply can't overcome.

30
0:01:39.338,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Geography: think rural and remote.

31
0:01:42.122,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Transportation: think working parents everywhere.

32
0:01:46.044,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Parent choice: no state requires a four-year-old to go to school.

33
0:01:50.844,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And cost: the average cost for a state to educate a preschooler

34
0:01:55.964,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is five thousand dollars a year.

35
0:01:59.674,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So am I just going to keep talking about problems?

36
0:02:02.687,000 --> 0:02:03,000
No.

37
0:02:03.879,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Today, I want to tell you about a cost-effective, technology-delivered,

38
0:02:08.97,000 --> 0:02:12,000
kindergarten-readiness program that can be done in the home.

39
0:02:13.176,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's called UPSTART,

40
0:02:14.556,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and more than 60,000 preschoolers in the US have already used it.

41
0:02:19.678,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, I know what you might be thinking:

42
0:02:21.659,000 --> 0:02:24,000
here's another person throwing tech at a national problem.

43
0:02:26.102,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And you'd be partially right.

44
0:02:28.102,000 --> 0:02:32,000
We develop early learning software designed to individualize instruction,

45
0:02:33.05,000 --> 0:02:35,000
so children can learn at their own pace.

46
0:02:35.986,000 --> 0:02:4,000
To do that, we rely on experts from fields ranging from reading to sociology

47
0:02:41.328,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to brain science development to all aspects of early learning,

48
0:02:45.269,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to tell us what the software should do and look like.

49
0:02:48.796,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Here's an example.

50
0:02:50.108,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Video) Zero (sings to the tune of "Day-O"): Zero!

51
0:02:52.878,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Zero!

52
0:02:56.245,000 --> 0:03:,000
Zero is the number that's different from the others.

53
0:03:00.553,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O."

54
0:03:03.657,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Zero: It's not like one, I'm sure you'll discover.

55
0:03:07.989,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O."

56
0:03:11.4,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:12.501,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Claudia Miner: That is "The Zero Song."

58
0:03:15.38,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:17.099,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And here are Odd Todd and Even Steven to teach you some things about numbers.

60
0:03:22.58,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And here are the Word Birds,

61
0:03:23.95,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and they're going to show you when you blend letter sounds together,

62
0:03:27.383,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you can form words.

63
0:03:29.287,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You can see that instruction is short, colorful and catchy,

64
0:03:33.278,000 --> 0:03:35,000
designed to capture a child's attention.

65
0:03:36.966,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But there's another piece to UPSTART

66
0:03:39.149,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that makes it different and more effective.

67
0:03:41.916,000 --> 0:03:45,000
UPSTART puts parents in charge of their children's education.

68
0:03:46.601,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We believe, with the right support,

69
0:03:49.203,000 --> 0:03:54,000
all parents can get their children ready for school.

70
0:03:55.052,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Here's how it works.

71
0:03:57.033,000 --> 0:04:,000
This is the kindergarten readiness checklist from a state.

72
0:04:00.187,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And almost every state has one.

73
0:04:02.981,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We go to parents wherever they are,

74
0:04:05.146,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and we conduct a key in-person group training.

75
0:04:08.561,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And we tell them the software can check every reading, math and science box,

76
0:04:14.213,000 --> 0:04:18,000
but they're going to be responsible for motor skills and self-help skills,

77
0:04:18.422,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and together, we're going to work on social emotional learning.

78
0:04:22.75,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now, we know this is working

79
0:04:24.156,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because we have a 90-percent completion rate for the program.

80
0:04:27.94,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Last year, that translated into 13,500 children

81
0:04:32.318,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"graduating," with diplomas, from UPSTART.

82
0:04:37.792,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And the results have been amazing.

83
0:04:40.282,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We have an external evaluation

84
0:04:42.119,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that shows our children have two to three times the learning gains

85
0:04:48.51,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as children who don't participate in the program.

86
0:04:51.592,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We have a random control trial that shows strong evidence of effectiveness,

87
0:04:55.994,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and we even have a longitudinal study

88
0:04:58.172,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that shows our children's gains last into third and fourth grade,

89
0:05:01.823,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the highest grades the children had achieved at the time.

90
0:05:05.191,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Those are academic gains.

91
0:05:07.041,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But another study has shown that our children's social emotional gains

92
0:05:11.518,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are equal to those of children attending public and private preschool.

93
0:05:16.561,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The majority of the 60,000 children who have participated in UPSTART to date

94
0:05:21.119,000 --> 0:05:22,000
have been from Utah.

95
0:05:22.905,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But we have replicated our results

96
0:05:24.815,000 --> 0:05:26,000
with African-American children in Mississippi --

97
0:05:27.668,000 --> 0:05:29,000
this is Kingston and his mother;

98
0:05:30.279,000 --> 0:05:32,000
with English language learners in Arizona --

99
0:05:32.946,000 --> 0:05:34,000
this is Daisy and her family;

100
0:05:35.342,000 --> 0:05:4,000
with refugee children in Philadelphia -- this is my favorite graduation photo;

101
0:05:41.074,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and with Native American children

102
0:05:43.402,000 --> 0:05:46,000
from some of the most remote parts of the United States.

103
0:05:47.447,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is Cherise, and this is where she lives in Monument Valley.

104
0:05:52.972,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Now, there are skeptics about UPSTART.

105
0:05:55.982,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Some people don't believe young children should have screen time.

106
0:06:00.194,000 --> 0:06:02,000
To them, we say:

107
0:06:03.081,000 --> 0:06:07,000
UPSTART's usage requirement of 15 minutes a day, five days a week,

108
0:06:07.484,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is well within the hour-a-day recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics

109
0:06:12.768,000 --> 0:06:13,000
for four-year-olds.

110
0:06:14.501,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Some people believe only site-based preschool can work,

111
0:06:18.934,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and to them, we say: site-based preschool is great,

112
0:06:22.869,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but if you can't get a child there or if a parent won't send a child there,

113
0:06:27.897,000 --> 0:06:33,000
isn't a technology-delivered, results-based option a great alternative?

114
0:06:34.02,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we love working with site-based preschools.

115
0:06:37.072,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Right now, there are 800 children in Mississippi

116
0:06:40.072,000 --> 0:06:42,000
going to Head Start during the day

117
0:06:42.366,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and doing UPSTART at night with their families.

118
0:06:47.362,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Our audacious idea is to take UPSTART across the country --

119
0:06:52.247,000 --> 0:06:55,000
not to replace anything;

120
0:06:55.478,000 --> 0:07:,000
we want to serve children who otherwise would not have access to early education.

121
0:07:01.94,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We have the guts to take on the skeptics,

122
0:07:04.442,000 --> 0:07:05,000
we have the energy to do the work,

123
0:07:06.381,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and we have a plan.

124
0:07:08.524,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It is the role of the states to educate their children.

125
0:07:12.439,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So first we will use philanthropy dollars

126
0:07:15.103,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to go into a state to pilot the program and get data.

127
0:07:19.451,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Every state believes it's unique

128
0:07:22.101,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and wants to know that the program will work with its children

129
0:07:26.149,000 --> 0:07:27,000
before investing.

130
0:07:27.874,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Then we identify key leaders in the state to help us champion UPSTART

131
0:07:32.755,000 --> 0:07:34,000
as an option for unserved children.

132
0:07:35.758,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And together, we go to state legislatures

133
0:07:39.213,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to transition UPSTART from philanthropy

134
0:07:41.717,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to sustainable and scalable state funding.

135
0:07:45.483,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That plan has worked --

136
0:07:47.09,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause)

137
0:07:49.336,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Thanks.

138
0:07:53.357,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Thank you.

139
0:07:54.566,000 --> 0:07:57,000
That plan has worked in three states to date:

140
0:07:58.198,000 --> 0:08:,000
Utah, Indiana and South Carolina.

141
0:08:01.062,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We've also piloted the program in a number of states

142
0:08:04.139,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and identified champions.

143
0:08:06.316,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Next, we're moving to states with the greatest geographic barriers

144
0:08:10.109,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to work the plan,

145
0:08:11.574,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and then on to states that already have early education

146
0:08:14.956,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but may not be getting great academic results

147
0:08:17.752,000 --> 0:08:19,000
or great parent buy-in to participate.

148
0:08:20.63,000 --> 0:08:21,000
From there, we go to the states

149
0:08:22.412,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that are going to require the most data and work to convince,

150
0:08:27.574,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and we'll hope our momentum helps turn the tide there.

151
0:08:31.041,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We will serve a quarter of a million children in five years,

152
0:08:34.148,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and we will ensure that states continue to offer UPSTART to their children.

153
0:08:40.351,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Here's how you can help:

154
0:08:42.574,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for two thousand dollars,

155
0:08:43.929,000 --> 0:08:46,000
we can provide a child with UPSTART, a computer and internet,

156
0:08:47.834,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and that child will be part of the pilot

157
0:08:50.637,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that makes certain other children get UPSTART in the future.

158
0:08:54.521,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We also need engaged citizens to go to their government

159
0:08:57.526,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and say just how easy it can be to get children ready for school.

160
0:09:03.667,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You wouldn't be here if you weren't an engaged citizen,

161
0:09:06.943,000 --> 0:09:07,000
so we're asking for your help.

162
0:09:10.496,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Now, will all of us this make UPSTART a watershed moment in early education?

163
0:09:16.654,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I believe together we can make it one.

164
0:09:19.781,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But I can tell you without a doubt

165
0:09:21.799,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that UPSTART is a watershed moment

166
0:09:23.978,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the life of a child who otherwise would not be ready for school.

167
0:09:28.332,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Thank you.

168
0:09:29.522,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Applause)

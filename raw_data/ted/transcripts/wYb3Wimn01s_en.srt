1
0:00:12.913,000 --> 0:00:15,000
About two and a half years ago, I watched this movie called "Her."

2
0:00:16.365,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And it features Samantha, a superintelligent form of AI

3
0:00:21.516,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that cannot take physical form.

4
0:00:23.858,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And because she can't appear in photographs,

5
0:00:26.112,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Samantha decides to write a piece of music

6
0:00:28.152,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that will capture a moment of her life just like a photograph would.

7
0:00:32.953,000 --> 0:00:36,000
As a musician and an engineer, and someone raised in a family of artists,

8
0:00:37.385,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I thought that this idea of musical photographs was really powerful.

9
0:00:41.955,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I decided to create an AI composer.

10
0:00:44.847,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Her name is AIVA, and she's an artificial intelligence

11
0:00:48.359,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that has learned the art of music composition

12
0:00:50.776,000 --> 0:00:52,000
by reading over 30,000 scores of history's greatest.

13
0:00:54.165,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So here's what one score looks like to the algorithm

14
0:00:56.645,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in a matrix-like representation.

15
0:00:58.871,000 --> 0:01:,000
And here's what 30,000 scores,

16
0:01:01.141,000 --> 0:01:03,000
written by the likes of Mozart and Beethoven,

17
0:01:03.261,000 --> 0:01:05,000
look like in a single frame.

18
0:01:07.609,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So, using deep neural networks, AIVA looks for patterns in the scores.

19
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And from a couple of bars of existing music,

20
0:01:15.847,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it actually tries to infer what notes should come next in those tracks.

21
0:01:19.887,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And once AIVA gets good at those predictions,

22
0:01:22.409,000 --> 0:01:25,000
it can actually build a set of mathematical rules

23
0:01:26.046,000 --> 0:01:27,000
for that style of music

24
0:01:27.236,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in order to create its own original compositions.

25
0:01:30.49,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And in a way, this is kind of how we, humans, compose music, too.

26
0:01:34.561,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's a trial-and-error process,

27
0:01:36.077,000 --> 0:01:39,000
during which we may not get the right notes all the time.

28
0:01:39.109,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But we can correct ourselves,

29
0:01:40.522,000 --> 0:01:43,000
either with our musical ear or our musical knowledge.

30
0:01:45.495,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But for AIVA, this process is taken from years and years of learning,

31
0:01:49.662,000 --> 0:01:52,000
decades of learning as an artist, as a musician and a composer,

32
0:01:52.948,000 --> 0:01:53,000
down to a couple of hours.

33
0:01:55.03,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But music is also a supersubjective art.

34
0:01:57.934,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And we needed to teach AIVA

35
0:01:59.522,000 --> 0:02:01,000
how to compose the right music for the right person,

36
0:02:01.991,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because people have different preferences.

37
0:02:04.156,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And to do that, we show to the algorithm over 30 different category labels

38
0:02:08.37,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for each score in our database.

39
0:02:10.339,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So those category labels are like mood

40
0:02:12.879,000 --> 0:02:14,000
or note density or composer style of a piece

41
0:02:15.823,000 --> 0:02:17,000
or the epoch during which it was written.

42
0:02:18.371,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And by seeing all this data,

43
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
AIVA can actually respond to very precise requirements.

44
0:02:23.966,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Like the ones, for example, we had for a project recently,

45
0:02:27.093,000 --> 0:02:3,000
where we were commissioned to create a piece

46
0:02:30.152,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that would be reminiscent of a science-fiction film soundtrack.

47
0:02:33.839,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And the piece that was created is called "Among the Stars"

48
0:02:38.363,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and it was recorded with CMG Orchestra in Hollywood,

49
0:02:41.704,000 --> 0:02:42,000
under great conductor John Beal,

50
0:02:43.442,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and this is what they recorded, made by AIVA.

51
0:02:47.657,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Music)

52
0:03:30.196,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Music ends)

53
0:03:34.719,000 --> 0:03:35,000
What do you think?

54
0:03:35.95,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Applause)

55
0:03:40.354,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Thank you.

56
0:03:42.001,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So, as you've seen, AI can create beautiful pieces of music,

57
0:03:46.08,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the best part of it

58
0:03:47.907,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is that humans can actually bring them to life.

59
0:03:51.506,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And it's not the first time in history

60
0:03:53.368,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that technology has augmented human creativity.

61
0:03:56.736,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Live music was almost always used in silent films

62
0:03:59.832,000 --> 0:04:,000
to augment the experience.

63
0:04:01.522,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But the problem with live music is that it didn't scale.

64
0:04:04.728,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's really hard to cram a full symphony into a small theater,

65
0:04:08.181,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and it's really hard to do that for every theater in the world.

66
0:04:11.196,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So when music recording was actually invented,

67
0:04:14.069,000 --> 0:04:16,000
it allowed content creators, like film creators,

68
0:04:16.442,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to have prerecorded and original music

69
0:04:19.252,000 --> 0:04:21,000
tailored to each and every frame of their stories.

70
0:04:22.149,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And that was really an enhancer of creativity.

71
0:04:26.617,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Two and a half years ago, when I watched this movie "Her,"

72
0:04:29.927,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I thought to myself that personalized music

73
0:04:32.858,000 --> 0:04:36,000
would be the next single biggest change in how we consume and create music.

74
0:04:38.187,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Because nowadays, we have interactive content, like video games,

75
0:04:42.433,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that have hundreds of hours of interactive game plays,

76
0:04:45.472,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but only two hours of music, on average.

77
0:04:47.609,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And it means that the music loops and loops and loops

78
0:04:50.125,000 --> 0:04:52,000
over and over again, and it's not very immersive.

79
0:04:52.467,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So what we're working on is to make sure that AI can compose

80
0:04:56.442,000 --> 0:04:58,000
hundreds of hours of personalized music

81
0:04:58.768,000 --> 0:05:01,000
for those use cases where human creativity doesn't scale.

82
0:05:03.363,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And we don't just want to do that for games.

83
0:05:06.657,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Beethoven actually wrote a piece for his beloved, called "Für Elise,"

84
0:05:11.109,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and imagine if we could bring back Beethoven to life.

85
0:05:14.784,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And if he was sitting next to you, composing a music for your personality

86
0:05:20.038,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and your life story.

87
0:05:22.632,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Or imagine if someone like Martin Luther King, for example,

88
0:05:25.435,000 --> 0:05:27,000
had a personalized AI composer.

89
0:05:27.498,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Maybe then we would remember

90
0:05:28.895,000 --> 0:05:3,000
"I Have a Dream" not only as a great speech,

91
0:05:30.975,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but also as a great piece of music, part of our history,

92
0:05:33.625,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and capturing Dr. King's ideals.

93
0:05:36.069,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And this is our vision at AIVA:

94
0:05:37.982,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to personalize music so that each and every one of you

95
0:05:40.584,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and every individual in the world

96
0:05:42.257,000 --> 0:05:45,000
can have access to a personalized live soundtrack,

97
0:05:45.355,000 --> 0:05:47,000
based on their story and their personality.

98
0:05:49.915,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So this moment here together at TED is now part of our life story.

99
0:05:54.018,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So it only felt fitting that AIVA would compose music for this moment.

100
0:05:58.674,000 --> 0:06:,000
And that's exactly what we did.

101
0:06:01.436,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So my team and I worked on biasing AIVA on the style of the TED jingle,

102
0:06:06.482,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and on music that makes us feel a sense of awe and wonder.

103
0:06:09.95,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And the result is called "The Age of Amazement."

104
0:06:13.887,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Didn't take an AI to figure that one out.

105
0:06:16.307,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

106
0:06:18.152,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I couldn't be more proud to show it to you,

107
0:06:20.578,000 --> 0:06:22,000
so if you can, close your eyes and enjoy the music.

108
0:06:23.03,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Thank you very much.

109
0:06:25.537,000 --> 0:06:29,000

Thank you.

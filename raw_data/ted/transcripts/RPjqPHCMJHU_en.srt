1
0:00:12.465,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In Kenya, 1984 is known

2
0:00:15.722,000 --> 0:00:17,000
as the year of the cup,

3
0:00:18.333,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or the goro goro.

4
0:00:20.753,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The goro goro is a cup used to measure

5
0:00:23.671,000 --> 0:00:26,000
two kilograms of maize flower on the market,

6
0:00:26.981,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and the maize flower is used to make ugali,

7
0:00:30.121,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a polenta-like cake that is eaten together with vegetables.

8
0:00:34.078,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Both the maize and the vegetables are grown

9
0:00:36.393,000 --> 0:00:38,000
on most Kenyan farms,

10
0:00:38.518,000 --> 0:00:4,000
which means that most families can feed themselves

11
0:00:40.791,000 --> 0:00:42,000
from their own farm.

12
0:00:42.972,000 --> 0:00:45,000
One goro goro can feed three meals

13
0:00:46.9,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for an average family,

14
0:00:48.881,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and in 1984, the whole harvest

15
0:00:51.97,000 --> 0:00:54,000
could fit in one goro goro.

16
0:00:55.142,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It was and still is one of the worst droughts

17
0:00:57.992,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in living memory.

18
0:01:00.635,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now today, I insure farmers against droughts

19
0:01:03.594,000 --> 0:01:05,000
like those in the year of the cup,

20
0:01:05.655,000 --> 0:01:09,000
or to be more specific, I insure the rains.

21
0:01:10.641,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I come from a family of missionaries

22
0:01:13.09,000 --> 0:01:15,000
who built hospitals in Indonesia,

23
0:01:15.241,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and my father built a psychiatric hospital

24
0:01:17.518,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in Tanzania.

25
0:01:18.774,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This is me, age five, in front of that hospital.

26
0:01:21.875,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I don't think they thought I'd grow up

27
0:01:24.196,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to sell insurance. (Laughter)

28
0:01:27.162,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So let me tell you how that happened.

29
0:01:30.203,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In 2008, I was working

30
0:01:31.92,000 --> 0:01:33,000
for the Ministry of Agriculture of Rwanda,

31
0:01:34.204,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and my boss had just been promoted

32
0:01:36.2,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to become the minister.

33
0:01:37.607,000 --> 0:01:38,000
She launched an ambitious plan

34
0:01:39.495,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to start a green revolution in her country,

35
0:01:41.824,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and before we knew it, we were importing

36
0:01:43.444,000 --> 0:01:45,000
tons of fertilizer and seed

37
0:01:45.737,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and telling farmers how to apply that fertilizer

38
0:01:48.462,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and plant.

39
0:01:49.997,000 --> 0:01:5,000
A couple of weeks later,

40
0:01:51.89,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the International Monetary Fund visited us,

41
0:01:54.603,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and asked my minister,

42
0:01:56.133,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"Minister, it's great that you want to help farmers

43
0:01:58.945,000 --> 0:02:02,000
reach food security, but what if it doesn't rain?"

44
0:02:03.118,000 --> 0:02:05,000
My minister answered proudly

45
0:02:05.267,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and somewhat defiantly,

46
0:02:07.281,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"I am going to pray for rain."

47
0:02:11.871,000 --> 0:02:14,000
That ended the discussion.

48
0:02:15.071,000 --> 0:02:17,000
On the way back to the ministry in the car,

49
0:02:17.225,000 --> 0:02:19,000
she turned around to me and said,

50
0:02:19.306,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Rose, you've always been interested in finance.

51
0:02:21.376,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Go find us some insurance."

52
0:02:24.515,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's been six years since,

53
0:02:26.552,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and last year I was fortunate enough

54
0:02:28.542,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to be part of a team that insured

55
0:02:30.048,000 --> 0:02:33,000
over 185,000 farmers in Kenya and Rwanda

56
0:02:33.953,000 --> 0:02:34,000
against drought.

57
0:02:35.89,000 --> 0:02:37,000
They owned an average of half an acre

58
0:02:37.97,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and paid on average two Euros in premium.

59
0:02:41.423,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's microinsurance.

60
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, traditional insurance doesn't work

61
0:02:45.855,000 --> 0:02:46,000
with two to three Euros of premium,

62
0:02:47.768,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because traditional insurance relies on farm visits.

63
0:02:50.675,000 --> 0:02:51,000
A farmer here in Germany would be visited

64
0:02:52.617,000 --> 0:02:54,000
for the start of the season, halfway through,

65
0:02:55.102,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and at the end, and again if there was a loss,

66
0:02:57.589,000 --> 0:03:,000
to estimate the damages.

67
0:03:00.995,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For a small-scale farmer in the middle of Africa,

68
0:03:04.13,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the maths of doing those visits

69
0:03:05.959,000 --> 0:03:08,000
simply don't add up.

70
0:03:09.03,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So instead, we rely on technology and data.

71
0:03:12.871,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This satellite measures

72
0:03:15.077,000 --> 0:03:17,000
whether there were clouds or not,

73
0:03:17.239,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because think about it:

74
0:03:18.407,000 --> 0:03:22,000
If there are clouds, then you might have some rain,

75
0:03:23.109,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but if there are no clouds,

76
0:03:24.808,000 --> 0:03:26,000
then it's actually impossible for it to rain.

77
0:03:27.659,000 --> 0:03:29,000
These images show the onset of the rains

78
0:03:29.939,000 --> 0:03:3,000
this season in Kenya.

79
0:03:31.794,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You see that around March 6,

80
0:03:33.83,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the clouds move in and then disappear,

81
0:03:36.935,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and then around the March 11,

82
0:03:38.963,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the clouds really move in.

83
0:03:42.213,000 --> 0:03:44,000
That, and those clouds,

84
0:03:45.14,000 --> 0:03:47,000
were the onset of the rains this year.

85
0:03:48.028,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This satellite covers the whole of Africa

86
0:03:50.715,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and goes back as far as 1984,

87
0:03:53.632,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and that's important, because if you know

88
0:03:55.98,000 --> 0:03:57,000
how many times a place has had a drought

89
0:03:58.421,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in the last 30 years,

90
0:04:00.37,000 --> 0:04:01,000
you can make a pretty good estimate

91
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:04,000
what the chances are of drought in the future,

92
0:04:04.957,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and that means that you can put a price tag

93
0:04:07.07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
on the risk of drought.

94
0:04:09.76,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The data alone isn't enough.

95
0:04:12.156,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We devise agronomic algorithms

96
0:04:14.641,000 --> 0:04:17,000
which tell us how much rainfall a crop needs and when.

97
0:04:18.335,000 --> 0:04:2,000
For example, for maize at planting,

98
0:04:20.749,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you need to have two days of rain

99
0:04:23.144,000 --> 0:04:24,000
for farmers to plant,

100
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and then it needs to rain once every two weeks

101
0:04:27.194,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for the crop to properly germinate.

102
0:04:29.673,000 --> 0:04:32,000
After that, you need rain every three weeks

103
0:04:32.998,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for the crop to form its leaves,

104
0:04:35.901,000 --> 0:04:37,000
whereas at flowering, you need it to rain more frequently,

105
0:04:38.667,000 --> 0:04:41,000
about once every 10 days for the crop to form its cob.

106
0:04:42.527,000 --> 0:04:43,000
At the end of the season,

107
0:04:44.032,000 --> 0:04:46,000
you actually don't want it to rain,

108
0:04:46.244,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because rains then can damage the crop.

109
0:04:49.795,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Devising such a cover is difficult,

110
0:04:53.15,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but it turned out the real challenge

111
0:04:55.046,000 --> 0:04:59,000
was selling insurance.

112
0:04:59.574,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We set ourselves a modest target

113
0:05:02.061,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of 500 farmers insured after our first season.

114
0:05:06.061,000 --> 0:05:08,000
After a couple of months' intense marketing,

115
0:05:08.631,000 --> 0:05:09,000
we had signed up the grand total

116
0:05:10.45,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of 185 farmers.

117
0:05:14.108,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I was disappointed and confounded.

118
0:05:17.03,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Everybody kept telling me that farmers

119
0:05:18.684,000 --> 0:05:2,000
wanted insurance,

120
0:05:21.267,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but our prime customers simply weren't buying.

121
0:05:24.264,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They were waiting to see what would happen,

122
0:05:26.928,000 --> 0:05:28,000
didn't trust insurance companies,

123
0:05:29.677,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or thought, "I've managed for so many years.

124
0:05:31.963,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Why would I buy insurance now?"

125
0:05:35.72,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now many of you know microcredit,

126
0:05:38.102,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the method of providing small loans to poor people

127
0:05:41.596,000 --> 0:05:43,000
pioneered by Muhammad Yunus,

128
0:05:43.598,000 --> 0:05:44,000
who won the Nobel Peace Prize

129
0:05:45.119,000 --> 0:05:47,000
for his work with the Grameen Bank.

130
0:05:47.268,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Turns out, selling microcredit

131
0:05:49.752,000 --> 0:05:52,000
isn't the same as selling insurance.

132
0:05:53.153,000 --> 0:05:56,000
For credit, a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank,

133
0:05:57.038,000 --> 0:06:,000
and if it succeeds, the bank will advance him money.

134
0:06:00.982,000 --> 0:06:02,000
That's an attractive proposition.

135
0:06:03.091,000 --> 0:06:06,000
For insurance, the farmer needs to trust

136
0:06:06.337,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the insurance company, and needs

137
0:06:07.879,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to advance the insurance company money.

138
0:06:11.103,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's a very different value proposition.

139
0:06:14.47,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And so the uptick of insurance has been slow,

140
0:06:17.159,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with so far only 4.4 percent of Africans

141
0:06:19.735,000 --> 0:06:21,000
taking up insurance in 2012,

142
0:06:22.288,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and half of that number is in one country,

143
0:06:24.28,000 --> 0:06:26,000
South Africa.

144
0:06:26.323,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We tried for some years

145
0:06:27.97,000 --> 0:06:29,000
selling insurance directly to farmers,

146
0:06:30.421,000 --> 0:06:31,000
with very high marketing cost

147
0:06:32.42,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and very limited success.

148
0:06:35.506,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Then we realized that there were many organizations

149
0:06:37.46,000 --> 0:06:39,000
working with farmers:

150
0:06:40.169,000 --> 0:06:43,000
seed companies, microfinance institutions,

151
0:06:43.606,000 --> 0:06:44,000
mobile phone companies,

152
0:06:45.552,000 --> 0:06:46,000
government agencies.

153
0:06:46.874,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They were all providing loans to farmers,

154
0:06:49.624,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and often, just before they'd finalize the loan,

155
0:06:52.246,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the farmer would say,

156
0:06:54.346,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"But what if it doesn't rain?

157
0:06:56.498,000 --> 0:06:59,000
How do you expect me to repay my loan?"

158
0:06:59.965,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Many of these organizations

159
0:07:02.042,000 --> 0:07:03,000
were taking on the risk themselves,

160
0:07:03.66,000 --> 0:07:04,000
simply hoping that that year,

161
0:07:05.628,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the worst wouldn't happen.

162
0:07:07.99,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Most of the organizations, however,

163
0:07:09.996,000 --> 0:07:11,000
were limiting their growth in agriculture.

164
0:07:12.319,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They couldn't take on this kind of risk.

165
0:07:14.991,000 --> 0:07:17,000
These organizations became our customers,

166
0:07:18.714,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and when combining credit and insurance,

167
0:07:21.913,000 --> 0:07:23,000
interesting things can happen.

168
0:07:24.632,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Let me tell you one more story.

169
0:07:28.02,000 --> 0:07:31,000
At the start of February 2012 in western Kenya,

170
0:07:31.87,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the rains started, and they started early,

171
0:07:34.869,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and when rains start early, farmers are encouraged,

172
0:07:37.94,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because it usually means that the season is going to be good.

173
0:07:41.506,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So they took out loans and planted.

174
0:07:44.262,000 --> 0:07:45,000
For the next three weeks,

175
0:07:45.752,000 --> 0:07:47,000
there wasn't a single drop of rain,

176
0:07:48.06,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and the crops that had germinated so well

177
0:07:50.624,000 --> 0:07:53,000
shriveled and died.

178
0:07:53.937,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We'd insured the loans of a microfinance institution

179
0:07:56.692,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that had provided those loans

180
0:07:57.812,000 --> 0:08:,000
to about 6,000 farmers in that area,

181
0:08:01.36,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and we called them up and said,

182
0:08:02.65,000 --> 0:08:03,000
"Look, we know about the drought.

183
0:08:04.35,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We've got you.

184
0:08:06.014,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We'll give you 200,000 Euros at the end of the season."

185
0:08:10.327,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They said, "Wow, that's great,

186
0:08:12.126,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but that'll be late.

187
0:08:14.252,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Could you give us the money now?

188
0:08:16.435,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Then these farmers can still replant

189
0:08:18.865,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and can get a harvest this season."

190
0:08:22.442,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So we convinced our insurance partners,

191
0:08:24.523,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and later that April, these farmers replanted.

192
0:08:27.898,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We took the idea of replanting to a seed company

193
0:08:30.692,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and convinced them to price the cost of insurance

194
0:08:32.802,000 --> 0:08:34,000
into every bag of seed,

195
0:08:34.941,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and in every bag, we packed a card

196
0:08:36.92,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that had a number on it,

197
0:08:38.494,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and when the farmers would open the card,

198
0:08:40.476,000 --> 0:08:42,000
they'd text in that number,

199
0:08:42.477,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and that number would actually help us

200
0:08:43.85,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to locate the farmer

201
0:08:45.225,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and allocate them to a satellite pixel.

202
0:08:48.349,000 --> 0:08:5,000
A satellite would then measure the rainfall

203
0:08:50.891,000 --> 0:08:51,000
for the next three weeks,

204
0:08:52.424,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and if it didn't rain,

205
0:08:54.154,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we'd replace their seed.

206
0:08:57.56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
One of the first —

207
0:08:58.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause) — Hold on, I'm not there!

208
0:09:04.023,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One of the first beneficiaries of this replanting guarantee

209
0:09:07.18,000 --> 0:09:09,000
was Bosco Mwinyi.

210
0:09:09.396,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We visited his farm later that August,

211
0:09:12.087,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and I wish I could show you the smile on his face

212
0:09:15.643,000 --> 0:09:17,000
when he showed us his harvest,

213
0:09:18.107,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because it warmed my heart

214
0:09:19.74,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and it made me realize why selling insurance

215
0:09:21.678,000 --> 0:09:23,000
can be a good thing.

216
0:09:24.388,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But you know, he insisted

217
0:09:25.936,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that we get his whole harvest in the picture,

218
0:09:28.89,000 --> 0:09:31,000
so we had to zoom out a lot.

219
0:09:32.753,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Insurance secured his harvest that season,

220
0:09:35.982,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and I believe that today,

221
0:09:38.502,000 --> 0:09:41,000
we have all the tools to enable African farmers

222
0:09:41.685,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to take control of their own destiny.

223
0:09:44.452,000 --> 0:09:45,000
No more years of the cup.

224
0:09:45.951,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Instead, I am looking forward to, at least somehow,

225
0:09:49.289,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the year of the insurance,

226
0:09:51.945,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or the year of the great harvest.

227
0:09:54.648,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Thank you.

228
0:09:57.85,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

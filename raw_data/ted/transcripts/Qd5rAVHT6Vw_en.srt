1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:14,000
After decades of research

2
0:00:14.93,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and billions of dollars spent in clinical trials,

3
0:00:18.223,000 --> 0:00:21,000
we still have a problem with cancer drug delivery.

4
0:00:22.586,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We still give patients chemotherapy,

5
0:00:24.754,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is so non-specific

6
0:00:26.611,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that even though it kills the cancer cells,

7
0:00:29.161,000 --> 0:00:31,000
it kind of kills the rest of your body, too.

8
0:00:32.494,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And yes, we have developed more selective drugs,

9
0:00:35.974,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but it's still a challenge to get them into the tumor,

10
0:00:38.701,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and they end up accumulating in the other organs as well

11
0:00:41.641,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or passing through your urine,

12
0:00:43.296,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which is a total waste.

13
0:00:46.389,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And fields like mine have emerged

14
0:00:48.383,000 --> 0:00:49,000
where we try to encapsulate these drugs

15
0:00:50.373,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to protect them as they travel through the body.

16
0:00:52.95,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But these modifications cause problems

17
0:00:55.827,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that we make more modifications to fix.

18
0:00:58.961,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So what I'm really trying to say is we need a better drug delivery system.

19
0:01:03.513,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I propose,

20
0:01:04.953,000 --> 0:01:06,000
rather than using solely human design,

21
0:01:07.608,000 --> 0:01:08,000
why not use nature's?

22
0:01:10.309,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Immune cells are these versatile vehicles that travel throughout our body,

23
0:01:14.187,000 --> 0:01:16,000
patrolling for signs of disease

24
0:01:16.313,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and arriving at a wound mere minutes after injury.

25
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So I ask you guys:

26
0:01:22.054,000 --> 0:01:25,000
If immune cells are already traveling to places of injury or disease

27
0:01:25.459,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in our bodies,

28
0:01:26.636,000 --> 0:01:27,000
why not add an extra passenger?

29
0:01:28.966,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs

30
0:01:31.917,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to cure some of our biggest problems

31
0:01:33.903,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in disease?

32
0:01:36.446,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I am a biomedical engineer,

33
0:01:38.379,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I want to tell you guys a story about how I use immune cells

34
0:01:41.404,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to target one of the largest problems in cancer.

35
0:01:44.663,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Did you know that over 90 percent of cancer deaths

36
0:01:47.194,000 --> 0:01:48,000
can be attributed to its spread?

37
0:01:48.969,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So if we can stop these cancer cells

38
0:01:51.258,000 --> 0:01:54,000
from going from the primary tumor to a distant site,

39
0:01:54.356,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we can stop cancer right in its tracks

40
0:01:56.856,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and give people more of their lives back.

41
0:02:00.182,000 --> 0:02:01,000
To do this special mission,

42
0:02:01.786,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we decided to deliver a nanoparticle made of lipids,

43
0:02:04.86,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which are the same materials that compose your cell membrane.

44
0:02:08.733,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And we've added two special molecules.

45
0:02:11.952,000 --> 0:02:13,000
One is called e-selectin,

46
0:02:14.153,000 --> 0:02:15,000
which acts as a glue

47
0:02:15.453,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that binds the nanoparticle to the immune cell.

48
0:02:19.223,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And the second one is called trail.

49
0:02:21.74,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Trail is a therapeutic drug that kills cancer cells

50
0:02:24.42,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but not normal cells.

51
0:02:26.392,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, when you put both of these together,

52
0:02:29.218,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you have a mean killing machine on wheels.

53
0:02:35.589,000 --> 0:02:37,000
To test this, we ran an experiment in a mouse.

54
0:02:39.276,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So what we did was we injected the nanoparticles,

55
0:02:42.365,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and they bound almost immediately to the immune cells in the bloodstream.

56
0:02:46.406,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And then we injected the cancer cells to mimic a process

57
0:02:49.355,000 --> 0:02:52,000
through which cancer cells spread throughout our bodies.

58
0:02:52.53,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And we found something very exciting.

59
0:02:55.62,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We found that in our treated group,

60
0:02:58.314,000 --> 0:03:02,000
over 75 percent of the cancer cells we initially injected were dead or dying,

61
0:03:03.118,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in comparison to only around 25 percent.

62
0:03:05.839,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So just imagine: these fewer amount of cells were available

63
0:03:09.045,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to actually be able to spread to a different part of the body.

64
0:03:12.181,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And this is only after two hours of treatment.

65
0:03:14.922,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Our results were amazing, and we had some pretty interesting press.

66
0:03:19.974,000 --> 0:03:21,000
My favorite title was actually,

67
0:03:22.248,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"Sticky balls may stop the spread of cancer."

68
0:03:24.886,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:26.003,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I can't tell you just how smug my male colleagues were,

70
0:03:30.035,000 --> 0:03:32,000
knowing that their sticky balls might one day cure cancer.

71
0:03:33.032,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:35.354,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But I can tell you they made some pretty, pretty, exciting,

73
0:03:38.78,000 --> 0:03:39,000
pretty ballsy t-shirts.

74
0:03:40.595,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This was also my first experience talking to patients

75
0:03:44.835,000 --> 0:03:46,000
where they asked how soon our therapy would be available.

76
0:03:48.279,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I keep these stories with me to remind me of the importance

77
0:03:51.448,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of the science, the scientists and the patients.

78
0:03:55.809,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, our fast-acting results were pretty interesting,

79
0:03:58.374,000 --> 0:04:,000
but we still had one lingering question:

80
0:04:00.531,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Can our sticky balls,

81
0:04:02.251,000 --> 0:04:04,000
our particles actually attached to the immune cells,

82
0:04:04.958,000 --> 0:04:05,000
actually stop the spread of cancer?

83
0:04:07.624,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So we went to our animal model, and we found three important parts.

84
0:04:12.615,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Our primary tumors were smaller in our treated animals,

85
0:04:15.657,000 --> 0:04:17,000
there were fewer cells in circulation,

86
0:04:18.199,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and there was little to no tumor burden in the distant organs.

87
0:04:22.835,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, this wasn't just a victory for us and our sticky balls.

88
0:04:26.737,000 --> 0:04:28,000
This was also a victory to me

89
0:04:28.868,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in drug delivery,

90
0:04:30.147,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and it represents a paradigm shift,

91
0:04:32.102,000 --> 0:04:33,000
a revolution --

92
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to go from just using drugs, just injecting them

93
0:04:37.734,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and hoping they go to the right places in the body,

94
0:04:40.211,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to using immune cells as special delivery drivers in your body.

95
0:04:45.975,000 --> 0:04:48,000
For this example, we used two molecules, e-selectin and trail,

96
0:04:49.715,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but really, the possibility of drugs you can use are endless.

97
0:04:53.523,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I talked about cancer,

98
0:04:55.941,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but where disease goes, so do immune cells.

99
0:04:59.6,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So this could be used for any disease.

100
0:05:02.039,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Imagine using immune cells to deliver crucial wound-healing agents

101
0:05:06.742,000 --> 0:05:07,000
after a spinal cord injury,

102
0:05:09.474,000 --> 0:05:13,000
or using immune cells to deliver drugs past the blood-brain barrier

103
0:05:13.895,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to treat Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.

104
0:05:17.044,000 --> 0:05:2,000
These are the ideas that excite me about science the most.

105
0:05:20.71,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And from where I stand, I see so much promise and opportunity.

106
0:05:24.181,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Thank you.

107
0:05:25.395,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.055,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So when the White House was built

3
0:00:17.875,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in the early 19th century, it was an open house.

4
0:00:20.868,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Neighbors came and went. Under President Adams,

5
0:00:24.004,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a local dentist happened by.

6
0:00:25.373,000 --> 0:00:27,000
He wanted to shake the President's hand.

7
0:00:27.964,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The President dismissed the Secretary of State,

8
0:00:30.114,000 --> 0:00:31,000
whom he was conferring with, and asked the dentist

9
0:00:32.032,000 --> 0:00:33,000
if he would remove a tooth.

10
0:00:33.842,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Later, in the 1850s, under President Pierce,

11
0:00:36.9,000 --> 0:00:37,000
he was known to have remarked

12
0:00:38.488,000 --> 0:00:4,000
— probably the only thing he's known for —

13
0:00:41.057,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when a neighbor passed by and said, "I'd love to see

14
0:00:43.808,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the beautiful house," and Pierce said to him,

15
0:00:46.073,000 --> 0:00:48,000
"Why my dear sir, of course you may come in.

16
0:00:48.688,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This isn't my house. It is the people's house."

17
0:00:52.413,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Well, when I got to the White House in the beginning

18
0:00:54.485,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of 2009, at the start of the Obama Administration,

19
0:00:57.705,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the White House was anything but open.

20
0:01:00.577,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Bomb blast curtains covered my windows.

21
0:01:03.105,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We were running Windows 2000.

22
0:01:05.284,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Social media were blocked at the firewall.

23
0:01:07.467,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We didn't have a blog, let alone a dozen twitter accounts

24
0:01:10.007,000 --> 0:01:12,000
like we have today.

25
0:01:12.03,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I came in to become the head of Open Government,

26
0:01:14.643,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to take the values and the practices of transparency,

27
0:01:17.441,000 --> 0:01:2,000
participation and collaboration, and instill them

28
0:01:20.854,000 --> 0:01:22,000
into the way that we work, to open up government,

29
0:01:23.68,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to work with people.

30
0:01:25.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now one of the things that we know

31
0:01:27.894,000 --> 0:01:3,000
is that companies are very good at getting people to work

32
0:01:30.91,000 --> 0:01:32,000
together in teams and in networks to make

33
0:01:33.158,000 --> 0:01:36,000
very complex products, like cars and computers,

34
0:01:36.8,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the more complex the products are a society creates,

35
0:01:40.488,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the more successful the society is over time.

36
0:01:43.343,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Companies make goods, but governments,

37
0:01:46.088,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they make public goods. They work on the cure for cancer

38
0:01:49.208,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and educating our children and making roads,

39
0:01:52.016,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but we don't have institutions that are particularly good

40
0:01:55.657,000 --> 0:01:57,000
at this kind of complexity. We don't have institutions

41
0:01:58.193,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that are good at bringing our talents to bear,

42
0:02:01.31,000 --> 0:02:05,000
at working with us in this kind of open and collaborative way.

43
0:02:05.772,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So when we wanted to create our Open Government policy,

44
0:02:08.033,000 --> 0:02:1,000
what did we do? We wanted, naturally, to ask public sector

45
0:02:10.609,000 --> 0:02:12,000
employees how we should open up government.

46
0:02:13.553,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Turns out that had never been done before.

47
0:02:16.785,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We wanted to ask members of the public to help us

48
0:02:19.404,000 --> 0:02:22,000
come up with a policy, not after the fact, commenting

49
0:02:22.682,000 --> 0:02:25,000
on a rule after it's written, the way is typically the case,

50
0:02:26.065,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but in advance. There was no legal precedent,

51
0:02:29.385,000 --> 0:02:32,000
no cultural precedent, no technical way of doing this.

52
0:02:32.527,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In fact, many people told us it was illegal.

53
0:02:35.368,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Here's the crux of the obstacle.

54
0:02:38.481,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Governments exist to channel the flow of two things,

55
0:02:41.082,000 --> 0:02:44,000
really, values and expertise to and from government

56
0:02:44.576,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions.

57
0:02:48.425,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But the way that our institutions are designed,

58
0:02:50.818,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in our rather 18th-century, centralized model,

59
0:02:53.869,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is to channel the flow of values through voting,

60
0:02:57.553,000 --> 0:02:59,000
once every four years, once every two years, at best,

61
0:02:59.753,000 --> 0:03:02,000
once a year. This is a rather anemic and thin way, in this

62
0:03:03.314,000 --> 0:03:07,000
era of social media, for us to actually express our values.

63
0:03:07.319,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Today we have technology that lets us express ourselves

64
0:03:09.931,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a great deal, perhaps a little too much.

65
0:03:12.935,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Then in the 19th century, we layer on

66
0:03:15.209,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the concept of bureaucracy and the administrative state

67
0:03:17.616,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to help us govern complex and large societies.

68
0:03:20.759,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But we've centralized these bureaucracies.

69
0:03:23.991,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We've entrenched them. And we know that

70
0:03:26.436,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the smartest person always works for someone else.

71
0:03:29.148,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We need to only look around this room to know that

72
0:03:31.828,000 --> 0:03:34,000
expertise and intelligence is widely distributed in society,

73
0:03:35.425,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and not limited simply to our institutions.

74
0:03:39.596,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Scientists have been studying in recent years

75
0:03:41.862,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the phenomenon that they often describe as flow,

76
0:03:44.396,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that the design of our systems, whether natural or social,

77
0:03:47.66,000 --> 0:03:49,000
channel the flow of whatever runs through them.

78
0:03:50.343,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So a river is designed to channel the flow of water,

79
0:03:53.62,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the lightning bolt that comes out of a cloud channels

80
0:03:56.09,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the flow of electricity, and a leaf is designed to channel

81
0:03:59.594,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the flow of nutrients to the tree,

82
0:04:01.614,000 --> 0:04:04,000
sometimes even having to route around an obstacle,

83
0:04:04.618,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but to get that nutrition flowing.

84
0:04:07.338,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The same can be said for our social systems, for our

85
0:04:09.675,000 --> 0:04:11,000
systems of government, where, at the very least,

86
0:04:12.163,000 --> 0:04:15,000
flow offers us a helpful metaphor for understanding

87
0:04:15.178,000 --> 0:04:17,000
what the problem is, what's really broken,

88
0:04:17.834,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and the urgent need that we have, that we all feel today,

89
0:04:21.519,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to redesign the flow of our institutions.

90
0:04:24.799,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We live in a Cambrian era of big data, of social networks,

91
0:04:29.322,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we have this opportunity to redesign these institutions

92
0:04:33.591,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that are actually quite recent.

93
0:04:36.476,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Think about it: What other business do you know,

94
0:04:39.716,000 --> 0:04:41,000
what other sector of the economy, and especially one

95
0:04:42.116,000 --> 0:04:45,000
as big as the public sector, that doesn't seek to reinvent

96
0:04:45.903,000 --> 0:04:47,000
its business model on a regular basis?

97
0:04:48.807,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Sure, we invest plenty in innovation. We invest

98
0:04:51.898,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in broadband and science education and science grants,

99
0:04:55.862,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning

100
0:04:59.213,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the institutions that we have.

101
0:05:01.813,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now, it's very easy to complain, of course, about

102
0:05:04.149,000 --> 0:05:07,000
partisan politics and entrenched bureaucracy, and we love

103
0:05:07.613,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to complain about government. It's a perennial pastime,

104
0:05:10.529,000 --> 0:05:12,000
especially around election time, but

105
0:05:13.181,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the world is complex. We soon will have 10 billion people,

106
0:05:16.567,000 --> 0:05:18,000
many of whom will lack basic resources.

107
0:05:19.44,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So complain as we might, what actually can replace

108
0:05:22.758,000 --> 0:05:24,000
what we have today?

109
0:05:25.069,000 --> 0:05:29,000
What comes the day after the Arab Spring?

110
0:05:29.176,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Well, one attractive alternative that obviously presents itself

111
0:05:33.062,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to us is that of networks. Right? Networks

112
0:05:35.822,000 --> 0:05:37,000
like Facebook and Twitter. They're lean. They're mean.

113
0:05:38.534,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You've got 3,000 employees at Facebook

114
0:05:41.038,000 --> 0:05:43,000
governing 900 million inhabitants.

115
0:05:43.984,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We might even call them citizens, because they've recently

116
0:05:46.727,000 --> 0:05:49,000
risen up to fight against legislative incursion,

117
0:05:50.102,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and the citizens of these networks work together

118
0:05:52.637,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to serve each other in great ways.

119
0:05:55.878,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But private communities, private, corporate,

120
0:05:58.67,000 --> 0:06:01,000
privatizing communities, are not bottom-up democracies.

121
0:06:01.81,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They cannot replace government.

122
0:06:03.82,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Friending someone on Facebook is not complex enough

123
0:06:06.922,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to do the hard work of you and I collaborating

124
0:06:09.575,000 --> 0:06:12,000
with each other and doing the hard work of governance.

125
0:06:13.467,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But social media do teach us something.

126
0:06:16.405,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Why is Twitter so successful? Because it opens up its platform.

127
0:06:20.879,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It opens up the API to allow hundreds of thousands

128
0:06:23.816,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of new applications to be built on top of it, so that we can

129
0:06:27.287,000 --> 0:06:31,000
read and process information in new and exciting ways.

130
0:06:31.621,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We need to think about how to open up the API

131
0:06:33.958,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of government, and the way that we're going to do that,

132
0:06:38.019,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the next great superpower is going to be the one

133
0:06:41.267,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who can successfully combine the hierarchy of institution --

134
0:06:47.25,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because we have to maintain those public values,

135
0:06:49.603,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we have to coordinate the flow -- but with the diversity

136
0:06:52.522,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and the pulsating life and the chaos and the excitement

137
0:06:55.187,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of networks, all of us working together to build

138
0:06:58.283,000 --> 0:07:01,000
these new innovations on top of our institutions,

139
0:07:01.984,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to engage in the practice of governance.

140
0:07:04.202,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We have a precedent for this. Good old Henry II here,

141
0:07:07.335,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the 12th century, invented the jury.

142
0:07:11.187,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Powerful, practical, palpable model for handing power

143
0:07:15.412,000 --> 0:07:17,000
from government to citizens.

144
0:07:18.113,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Today we have the opportunity, and we have

145
0:07:21.501,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the imperative, to create thousands of new ways

146
0:07:25.002,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of interconnecting between networks and institutions,

147
0:07:28.241,000 --> 0:07:3,000
thousands of new kinds of juries: the citizen jury,

148
0:07:30.905,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the Carrotmob, the hackathon, we are just beginning

149
0:07:34.582,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to invent the models by which we can cocreate

150
0:07:37.636,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the process of governance.

151
0:07:39.384,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like

152
0:07:41.999,000 --> 0:07:43,000
yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution

153
0:07:44.621,000 --> 0:07:46,000
emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution,

154
0:07:47.603,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern.

155
0:07:51.412,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Some of it's very high-tech,

156
0:07:52.896,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and some of it is extremely low-tech,

157
0:07:54.95,000 --> 0:07:57,000
such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan,

158
0:07:58.32,000 --> 0:08:01,000
India, where they take the spending data of the state

159
0:08:01.864,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and paint it on 100,000 village walls,

160
0:08:05.307,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and then invite the villagers to come and comment

161
0:08:07.602,000 --> 0:08:09,000
who is on the government payroll, who's actually died,

162
0:08:10.09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere,

163
0:08:12.714,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and to work together through civic engagement to save

164
0:08:15.058,000 --> 0:08:18,000
real money and participate and have access to that budget.

165
0:08:18.821,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But it's not just about policing government.

166
0:08:21.219,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's also about creating government.

167
0:08:22.946,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Spacehive in the U.K. is engaging in crowd-funding,

168
0:08:26.064,000 --> 0:08:28,000
getting you and me to raise the money to build

169
0:08:28.749,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the goalposts and the park benches that will actually

170
0:08:31.407,000 --> 0:08:34,000
allow us to deliver better services in our communities.

171
0:08:34.969,000 --> 0:08:37,000
No one is better at this activity of actually getting us

172
0:08:38.607,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to engage in delivering services,

173
0:08:41.847,000 --> 0:08:44,000
sometimes where none exist, than Ushahidi.

174
0:08:44.998,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Created after the post-election riots in Kenya in 2008,

175
0:08:49.351,000 --> 0:08:52,000
this crisis-mapping website and community is actually able

176
0:08:53.287,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to crowdsource and target the delivery of

177
0:08:55.932,000 --> 0:08:58,000
better rescue services to people trapped under the rubble,

178
0:08:59.023,000 --> 0:09:01,000
whether it's after the earthquakes in Haiti,

179
0:09:01.479,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or more recently in Italy.

180
0:09:04.004,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And the Red Cross too is training volunteers and Twitter

181
0:09:07.135,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is certifying them, not simply to supplement existing

182
0:09:10.003,000 --> 0:09:14,000
government institutions, but in many cases, to replace them.

183
0:09:14.039,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now what we're seeing lots of examples of, obviously,

184
0:09:17.047,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is the opening up of government data,

185
0:09:18.734,000 --> 0:09:21,000
not enough examples of this yet, but we're starting

186
0:09:21.734,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to see this practice of people creating and generating

187
0:09:25.263,000 --> 0:09:28,000
innovative applications on top of government data.

188
0:09:28.732,000 --> 0:09:3,000
There's so many examples I could have picked, and I

189
0:09:31.063,000 --> 0:09:34,000
selected this one of Jon Bon Jovi. Some of you

190
0:09:34.229,000 --> 0:09:36,000
may or may not know that he runs a soup kitchen

191
0:09:36.495,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in New Jersey, where he caters to and serves the homeless

192
0:09:39.256,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and particularly homeless veterans.

193
0:09:40.949,000 --> 0:09:42,000
In February, he approached the White House, and said,

194
0:09:43.727,000 --> 0:09:46,000
"I would like to fund a prize to create scalable national

195
0:09:47.572,000 --> 0:09:5,000
applications, apps, that will help not only the homeless

196
0:09:51.099,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but those who deliver services [to] them to do so better."

197
0:09:54.534,000 --> 0:09:57,000
February 2012 to June of 2012,

198
0:09:57.774,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the finalists are announced in the competition.

199
0:10:00.762,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Can you imagine, in the bureaucratic world of yesteryear,

200
0:10:03.751,000 --> 0:10:05,000
getting anything done in a four-month period of time?

201
0:10:06.497,000 --> 0:10:08,000
You can barely fill out the forms in that amount of time,

202
0:10:08.633,000 --> 0:10:1,000
let alone generate real, palpable innovations

203
0:10:11.497,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that improve people's lives.

204
0:10:13.388,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And I want to be clear to mention that this open government

205
0:10:16.621,000 --> 0:10:19,000
revolution is not about privatizing government,

206
0:10:20.398,000 --> 0:10:22,000
because in many cases what it can do when we have

207
0:10:23.296,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the will to do so is to deliver more progressive

208
0:10:26.392,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and better policy than the regulations and the legislative

209
0:10:30.515,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and litigation-oriented strategies

210
0:10:33.475,000 --> 0:10:35,000
by which we make policy today.

211
0:10:36.075,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In the State of Texas, they regulate 515 professions,

212
0:10:39.802,000 --> 0:10:41,000
from well-driller to florist.

213
0:10:41.866,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Now, you can carry a gun into a church in Dallas,

214
0:10:45.089,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but do not make a flower arrangement without a license,

215
0:10:48.248,000 --> 0:10:5,000
because that will land you in jail.

216
0:10:50.864,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So what is Texas doing? They're asking you and me,

217
0:10:54.881,000 --> 0:10:58,000
using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of

218
0:10:58.969,000 --> 0:11:01,000
burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship,

219
0:11:02.53,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but to replace those regulations with more innovative

220
0:11:05.529,000 --> 0:11:07,000
alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation

221
0:11:08.393,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of new iPhone apps that will allows us

222
0:11:10.375,000 --> 0:11:12,000
both to protect consumers and the public

223
0:11:12.648,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and to encourage economic development.

224
0:11:16.159,000 --> 0:11:19,000
That is a nice sideline of open government.

225
0:11:19.313,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard

226
0:11:22.024,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to development. It's the economic benefits and the

227
0:11:25.481,000 --> 0:11:29,000
job creation that's coming from this open innovation work.

228
0:11:30.107,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Sberbank, the largest and oldest bank in Russia,

229
0:11:32.927,000 --> 0:11:33,000
largely owned by the Russian government,

230
0:11:34.727,000 --> 0:11:37,000
has started practicing crowdsourcing, engaging

231
0:11:37.727,000 --> 0:11:4,000
its employees and citizens in the public in developing innovations.

232
0:11:41.079,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Last year they saved a billion dollars, 30 billion rubles,

233
0:11:45.499,000 --> 0:11:47,000
from open innovation, and they're pushing radically

234
0:11:48.256,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the extension of crowdsourcing, not only from banking,

235
0:11:50.915,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but into the public sector.

236
0:11:52.958,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And we see lots of examples of these innovators using

237
0:11:55.699,000 --> 0:11:57,000
open government data, not simply to make apps,

238
0:11:58.549,000 --> 0:12:,000
but then to make companies and to hire people

239
0:12:00.611,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to build them working with the government.

240
0:12:02.912,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So a lot of these innovations are local.

241
0:12:05.042,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In San Ramon, California, they published an iPhone app

242
0:12:08.148,000 --> 0:12:11,000
in which they allow you or me to say we are certified

243
0:12:11.705,000 --> 0:12:14,000
CPR-trained, and then when someone has a heart attack,

244
0:12:15.272,000 --> 0:12:17,000
a notification goes out so that you

245
0:12:17.512,000 --> 0:12:2,000
can rush over to the person over here and deliver CPR.

246
0:12:21.468,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The victim who receives bystander CPR

247
0:12:23.772,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is more than twice as likely to survive.

248
0:12:26.237,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"There is a hero in all of us," is their slogan.

249
0:12:29.912,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But it's not limited to the local.

250
0:12:32.455,000 --> 0:12:34,000
British Columbia, Canada, is publishing a catalogue

251
0:12:35.116,000 --> 0:12:38,000
of all the ways that its residents and citizens can engage

252
0:12:38.2,000 --> 0:12:41,000
with the state in the cocreation of governance.

253
0:12:41.918,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Let me be very clear,

254
0:12:44.979,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and perhaps controversial,

255
0:12:46.448,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that open government is not

256
0:12:49.237,000 --> 0:12:5,000
about transparent government.

257
0:12:51.21,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Simply throwing data over the transom doesn't change

258
0:12:54.128,000 --> 0:12:55,000
how government works.

259
0:12:55.54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It doesn't get anybody to do anything with that data

260
0:12:58.107,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to change lives, to solve problems, and it doesn't change

261
0:13:01.816,000 --> 0:13:02,000
government.

262
0:13:03.088,000 --> 0:13:06,000
What it does is it creates an adversarial relationship

263
0:13:06.107,000 --> 0:13:07,000
between civil society and government

264
0:13:07.835,000 --> 0:13:1,000
over the control and ownership of information.

265
0:13:10.878,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And transparency, by itself, is not reducing the flow

266
0:13:13.462,000 --> 0:13:15,000
of money into politics, and arguably,

267
0:13:15.874,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's not even producing accountability as well as it might

268
0:13:18.607,000 --> 0:13:21,000
if we took the next step of combining participation and

269
0:13:22.07,000 --> 0:13:26,000
collaboration with transparency to transform how we work.

270
0:13:26.181,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We're going to see this evolution really in two phases,

271
0:13:28.918,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I think. The first phase of the open government revolution

272
0:13:32.207,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is delivering better information from the crowd

273
0:13:35.983,000 --> 0:13:36,000
into the center.

274
0:13:37.377,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Starting in 2005, and this is how this open government

275
0:13:40.324,000 --> 0:13:41,000
work in the U.S. really got started,

276
0:13:42.278,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I was teaching a patent law class to my students and

277
0:13:44.534,000 --> 0:13:47,000
explaining to them how a single person in the bureaucracy

278
0:13:48.305,000 --> 0:13:5,000
has the power to make a decision

279
0:13:50.436,000 --> 0:13:54,000
about which patent application becomes the next patent,

280
0:13:54.921,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and therefore monopolizes for 20 years the rights

281
0:13:57.663,000 --> 0:14:,000
over an entire field of inventive activity.

282
0:14:00.67,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Well, what did we do? We said, we can make a website,

283
0:14:03.582,000 --> 0:14:05,000
we can make an expert network, a social network,

284
0:14:05.975,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that would connect the network to the institution

285
0:14:08.247,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to allow scientists and technologists to get

286
0:14:10.628,000 --> 0:14:12,000
better information to the patent office

287
0:14:13.263,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to aid in making those decisions.

288
0:14:15.726,000 --> 0:14:17,000
We piloted the work in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan

289
0:14:18.358,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and Australia, and now I'm pleased to report

290
0:14:21.151,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that the United States Patent Office will be rolling out

291
0:14:23.407,000 --> 0:14:27,000
universal, complete, and total openness,

292
0:14:27.872,000 --> 0:14:3,000
so that all patent applications will now be open

293
0:14:30.918,000 --> 0:14:33,000
for citizen participation, beginning this year.

294
0:14:34.586,000 --> 0:14:36,000
The second phase of this evolution — Yeah. (Applause)

295
0:14:37.522,000 --> 0:14:39,000
They deserve a hand. (Applause)

296
0:14:40.475,000 --> 0:14:42,000
The first phase is in getting better information in.

297
0:14:43.01,000 --> 0:14:46,000
The second phase is in getting decision-making power out.

298
0:14:46.867,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Participatory budgeting has long been practiced

299
0:14:49.482,000 --> 0:14:5,000
in Porto Alegre, Brazil.

300
0:14:50.901,000 --> 0:14:52,000
They're just starting it in the 49th Ward in Chicago.

301
0:14:53.883,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Russia is using wikis to get citizens writing law together,

302
0:14:57.419,000 --> 0:14:59,000
as is Lithuania. When we start to see

303
0:14:59.771,000 --> 0:15:01,000
power over the core functions of government

304
0:15:02.075,000 --> 0:15:05,000
— spending, legislation, decision-making —

305
0:15:05.695,000 --> 0:15:09,000
then we're well on our way to an open government revolution.

306
0:15:09.756,000 --> 0:15:12,000
There are many things that we can do to get us there.

307
0:15:13.587,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Obviously opening up the data is one,

308
0:15:16.25,000 --> 0:15:18,000
but the important thing is to create lots more --

309
0:15:18.613,000 --> 0:15:22,000
create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities.

310
0:15:22.843,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Hackathons and mashathons and working with data

311
0:15:25.541,000 --> 0:15:28,000
to build apps is an intelligible way for people to engage

312
0:15:29.25,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and participate, like the jury is,

313
0:15:31.75,000 --> 0:15:34,000
but we're going to need lots more things like it.

314
0:15:34.774,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And that's why we need to start with our youngest people.

315
0:15:39.425,000 --> 0:15:41,000
We've heard talk here at TED about people

316
0:15:42.041,000 --> 0:15:46,000
biohacking and hacking their plants with Arduino,

317
0:15:46.11,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and Mozilla is doing work around the world in getting

318
0:15:49.154,000 --> 0:15:52,000
young people to build websites and make videos.

319
0:15:52.513,000 --> 0:15:54,000
When we start by teaching young people that we live,

320
0:15:55.249,000 --> 0:15:58,000
not in a passive society, a read-only society,

321
0:15:58.767,000 --> 0:16:,000
but in a writable society, where we have the power

322
0:16:01.334,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to change our communities, to change our institutions,

323
0:16:04.958,000 --> 0:16:07,000
that's when we begin to really put ourselves on the pathway

324
0:16:08.094,000 --> 0:16:11,000
towards this open government innovation,

325
0:16:11.305,000 --> 0:16:12,000
towards this open government movement,

326
0:16:13.014,000 --> 0:16:15,000
towards this open government revolution.

327
0:16:15.537,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So let me close by saying that I think the important thing

328
0:16:17.783,000 --> 0:16:22,000
for us to do is to talk about and demand this revolution.

329
0:16:23.642,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We don't have words, really, to describe it yet.

330
0:16:26.937,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Words like equality and fairness and the traditional

331
0:16:29.162,000 --> 0:16:33,000
elections, democracy, these are not really great terms yet.

332
0:16:33.529,000 --> 0:16:35,000
They're not fun enough. They're not exciting enough

333
0:16:36.277,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to get us engaged in this tremendous opportunity

334
0:16:39.596,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that awaits us. But I would argue that if we want to see

335
0:16:43.004,000 --> 0:16:45,000
the kinds of innovations, the hopeful and exciting

336
0:16:45.707,000 --> 0:16:47,000
innovations that we hear talked about here at TED,

337
0:16:48.371,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in clean energy, in clean education,

338
0:16:50.548,000 --> 0:16:52,000
in development, if we want to see those adopted

339
0:16:53.139,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and we want to see those scaled,

340
0:16:55.395,000 --> 0:16:57,000
we want to see them become the governance of tomorrow,

341
0:16:58.187,000 --> 0:16:59,000
then we must all participate,

342
0:16:59.892,000 --> 0:17:,000
then we must get involved.

343
0:17:01.39,000 --> 0:17:04,000
We must open up our institutions, and like the leaf,

344
0:17:04.6,000 --> 0:17:08,000
we must let the nutrients flow throughout our body politic,

345
0:17:08.794,000 --> 0:17:11,000
throughout our culture, to create open institutions

346
0:17:11.994,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to create a stronger democracy, a better tomorrow.

347
0:17:14.663,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Thank you. (Applause)

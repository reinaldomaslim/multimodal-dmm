1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Erez Lieberman Aiden: Everyone knows

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that a picture is worth a thousand words.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But we at Harvard

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
were wondering if this was really true.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So we assembled a team of experts,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
spanning Harvard, MIT,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The American Heritage Dictionary, The Encyclopedia Britannica

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and even our proud sponsors,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the Google.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And we cogitated about this

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for about four years.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And we came to a startling conclusion.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen, a picture is not worth a thousand words.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In fact, we found some pictures

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that are worth 500 billion words.

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Jean-Baptiste Michel: So how did we get to this conclusion?

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So Erez and I were thinking about ways

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to get a big picture of human culture

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and human history: change over time.

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So many books actually have been written over the years.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So we were thinking, well the best way to learn from them

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is to read all of these millions of books.

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now of course, if there's a scale for how awesome that is,

25
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that has to rank extremely, extremely high.

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Now the problem is there's an X-axis for that,

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which is the practical axis.

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
This is very, very low.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Applause)

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now people tend to use an alternative approach,

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is extremely practical, but not so awesome.

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
What you really want to do

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space.

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who had started a digitization project a few years back

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that might just enable this approach.

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They have digitized millions of books.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So what that means is, one could use computational methods

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to read all of the books in a click of a button.

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That's very practical and extremely awesome.

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
ELA: Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from.

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Since time immemorial, there have been authors.

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
These authors have been striving to write books.

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this became considerably easier

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
with the development of the printing press some centuries ago.

47
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Since then, the authors have won

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
on 129 million distinct occasions,

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
publishing books.

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now if those books are not lost to history,

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
then they are somewhere in a library,

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and digitized by Google,

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which has scanned 15 million books to date.

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now when Google digitizes a book, they put it into a really nice format.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now we've got the data, plus we have metadata.

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We have information about things like where was it published,

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
who was the author, when was it published.

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And what we do is go through all of those records

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data.

61
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
What we're left with

62
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is a collection of five million books,

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
500 billion words,

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
a string of characters a thousand times longer

65
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
than the human genome --

66
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a text which, when written out,

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
would stretch from here to the Moon and back

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
10 times over --

69
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
a veritable shard of our cultural genome.

70
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Of course what we did

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ...

72
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
was what any self-respecting researchers

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
would have done.

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We took a page out of XKCD,

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and we said, "Stand back.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We're going to try science."

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
JM: Now of course, we were thinking,

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
well let's just first put the data out there

81
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for people to do science to it.

82
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now we're thinking, what data can we release?

83
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Well of course, you want to take the books

84
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and release the full text of these five million books.

85
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now Google, and Jon Orwant in particular,

86
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
told us a little equation that we should learn.

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So you have five million, that is, five million authors

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit.

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So, although that would be really, really awesome,

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
again, that's extremely, extremely impractical.

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now again, we kind of caved in,

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and we did the very practical approach, which was a bit less awesome.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We said, well instead of releasing the full text,

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we're going to release statistics about the books.

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So take for instance "A gleam of happiness."

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's four words; we call that a four-gram.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We're going to tell you how many times a particular four-gram

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
appeared in books in 1801, 1802, 1803,

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
all the way up to 2008.

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
That gives us a time series

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time.

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books,

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and that gives us a big table of two billion lines

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that tell us about the way culture has been changing.

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
ELA: So those two billion lines,

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we call them two billion n-grams.

108
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What do they tell us?

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Well the individual n-grams measure cultural trends.

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Let me give you an example.

111
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Let's suppose that I am thriving,

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did.

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And so I might say, "Yesterday, I throve."

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Alternatively, I could say, "Yesterday, I thrived."

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Well which one should I use?

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
How to know?

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
As of about six months ago,

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the state of the art in this field

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is that you would, for instance,

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair,

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and you'd say,

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"Steve, you're an expert on the irregular verbs.

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What should I do?"

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And he'd tell you, "Well most people say thrived,

125
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but some people say throve."

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And you also knew, more or less,

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that if you were to go back in time 200 years

128
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair,

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
"Tom, what should I say?"

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
He'd say, "Well, in my day, most people throve,

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but some thrived."

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data.

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Two rows from this table of two billion entries.

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
What you're seeing is year by year frequency

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
of "thrived" and "throve" over time.

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Now this is just two

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
out of two billion rows.

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So the entire data set

140
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is a billion times more awesome than this slide.

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

143
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
JM: Now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words.

144
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
For instance, this one.

145
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
If you just take influenza,

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you will see peaks at the time where you knew

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe.

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
ELA: If you were not yet convinced,

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
sea levels are rising,

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so is atmospheric CO2 and global temperature.

151
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
JM: You might also want to have a look at this particular n-gram,

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead,

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
although you might agree that he might need a better publicist.

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
ELA: You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing.

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
For instance, let me tell you the history

157
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of the year 1950.

158
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Pretty much for the vast majority of history,

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
no one gave a damn about 1950.

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In 1700, in 1800, in 1900,

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
no one cared.

162
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Through the 30s and 40s,

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
no one cared.

164
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Suddenly, in the mid-40s,

165
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
there started to be a buzz.

166
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
People realized that 1950 was going to happen,

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and it could be big.

168
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

169
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But nothing got people interested in 1950

170
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
like the year 1950.

171
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
People were walking around obsessed.

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They couldn't stop talking

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
about all the things they did in 1950,

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
all the things they were planning to do in 1950,

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950.

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In fact, 1950 was so fascinating

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that for years thereafter,

179
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened,

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in '51, '52, '53.

181
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Finally in 1954,

182
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
someone woke up and realized

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that 1950 had gotten somewhat passé.

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

185
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And just like that, the bubble burst.

186
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

187
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And the story of 1950

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is the story of every year that we have on record,

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
with a little twist, because now we've got these nice charts.

190
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And because we have these nice charts, we can measure things.

191
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We can say, "Well how fast does the bubble burst?"

192
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely.

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Equations were derived, graphs were produced,

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and the net result

195
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster

196
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with each passing year.

197
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We are losing interest in the past more rapidly.

198
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
JM: Now a little piece of career advice.

199
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So for those of you who seek to be famous,

200
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we can learn from the 25 most famous political figures,

201
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
authors, actors and so on.

202
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So if you want to become famous early on, you should be an actor,

203
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because then fame starts rising by the end of your 20s --

204
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
you're still young, it's really great.

205
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now if you can wait a little bit, you should be an author,

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because then you rise to very great heights,

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
like Mark Twain, for instance: extremely famous.

208
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But if you want to reach the very top,

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you should delay gratification

210
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and, of course, become a politician.

211
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So here you will become famous by the end of your 50s,

212
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and become very, very famous afterward.

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older.

214
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Like for instance, biologists and physics

215
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
tend to be almost as famous as actors.

216
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician.

217
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

218
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
If you do that,

219
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you might think, "Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s."

220
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But guess what, nobody will really care.

221
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

222
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
ELA: There are more sobering notes

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
among the n-grams.

224
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
For instance, here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall,

225
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
an artist born in 1887.

226
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person.

227
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
He gets more and more and more famous,

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
except if you look in German.

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
If you look in German, you see something completely bizarre,

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
something you pretty much never see,

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
which is he becomes extremely famous

232
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and then all of a sudden plummets,

233
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
going through a nadir between 1933 and 1945,

234
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
before rebounding afterward.

235
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And of course, what we're seeing

236
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist

237
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in Nazi Germany.

238
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now these signals

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
are actually so strong

240
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that we don't need to know that someone was censored.

241
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We can actually figure it out

242
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
using really basic signal processing.

243
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Here's a simple way to do it.

244
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Well, a reasonable expectation

245
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is that somebody's fame in a given period of time

246
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
should be roughly the average of their fame before

247
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and their fame after.

248
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So that's sort of what we expect.

249
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And we compare that to the fame that we observe.

250
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And we just divide one by the other

251
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to produce something we call a suppression index.

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
If the suppression index is very, very, very small,

253
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
then you very well might be being suppressed.

254
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
If it's very large, maybe you're benefiting from propaganda.

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
JM: Now you can actually look at

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations.

257
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So for instance, here --

258
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
this suppression index is for 5,000 people

259
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
picked in English books where there's no known suppression --

260
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
it would be like this, basically tightly centered on one.

261
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
What you expect is basically what you observe.

262
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This is distribution as seen in Germany --

263
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
very different, it's shifted to the left.

264
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
People talked about it twice less as it should have been.

265
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But much more importantly, the distribution is much wider.

266
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution

267
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been.

268
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But then also many people on the far right

269
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
who seem to benefit from propaganda.

270
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record.

271
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
ELA: So culturomics

272
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is what we call this method.

273
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It's kind of like genomics.

274
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Except genomics is a lens on biology

275
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome.

276
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Culturomics is similar.

277
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It's the application of massive-scale data collection analysis

278
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to the study of human culture.

279
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Here, instead of through the lens of a genome,

280
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record.

281
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The great thing about culturomics

282
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
is that everyone can do it.

283
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Why can everyone do it?

284
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Everyone can do it because three guys,

285
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Jon Orwant, Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google,

286
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer,

287
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and they said, "This is so fun.

288
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We have to make this available for people."

289
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out --

290
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public.

291
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in

292
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and see its n-gram immediately --

293
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
also browse examples of all the various books

294
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in which your n-gram appears.

295
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
JM: Now this was used over a million times on the first day,

296
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and this is really the best of all the queries.

297
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So people want to be their best, put their best foot forward.

298
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But it turns out in the 18th century, people didn't really care about that at all.

299
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
They didn't want to be their best, they wanted to be their beft.

300
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So what happened is, of course, this is just a mistake.

301
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's not that strove for mediocrity,

302
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
it's just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F.

303
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Now of course, Google didn't pick this up at the time,

304
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
so we reported this in the science article that we wrote.

305
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But it turns out this is just a reminder

306
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that, although this is a lot of fun,

307
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
when you interpret these graphs, you have to be very careful,

308
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences.

309
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
ELA: People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes.

310
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

311
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Actually, we're not going to have to talk,

312
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent.

313
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
This person was interested in the history of frustration.

314
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
There's various types of frustration.

315
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
If you stub your toe, that's a one A "argh."

316
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons

317
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to make room for an interstellar bypass,

318
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that's an eight A "aaaaaaaargh."

319
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This person studies all the "arghs,"

320
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
from one through eight A's.

321
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And it turns out

322
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that the less-frequent "arghs"

323
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
are, of course, the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating --

324
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
except, oddly, in the early 80s.

325
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We think that might have something to do with Reagan.

326
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Laughter)

327
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
JM: There are many usages of this data,

328
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized.

329
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Google has started to digitize 15 million books.

330
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That's 12 percent of all the books that have ever been published.

331
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
It's a sizable chunk of human culture.

332
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
There's much more in culture: there's manuscripts, there newspapers,

333
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
there's things that are not text, like art and paintings.

334
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
These all happen to be on our computers,

335
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
on computers across the world.

336
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And when that happens, that will transform the way we have

337
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to understand our past, our present and human culture.

338
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Thank you very much.

339
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

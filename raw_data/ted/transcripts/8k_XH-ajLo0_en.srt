1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
from when I was 12 years old.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater --

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
at least I thought it was beautiful.

5
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:43,000
right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I wore it whenever I could,

9
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.

10
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Until one day in ninth grade,

11
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when I was standing with a number of the football players.

12
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And my body had clearly changed, and Matt,

13
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
who was undeniably my nemesis in high school,

14
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:01,000
said in a booming voice that

15
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,

16
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.

17
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I was so humiliated and mortified

19
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her

20
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:16,000
for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.

21
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away

22
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
somewhat ceremoniously,

23
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater

24
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
nor see it ever again.

25
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid.

26
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,

27
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old --

28
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
running toward me, wearing my sweater.

29
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.

30
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course

31
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
scaring the living bejesus out of him --

32
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name

33
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
written on the collar of this sweater.

34
0:01:56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve

35
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness

36
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that we all have on this Earth.

37
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction

38
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
does to people we think we will never see and never know.

39
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story

40
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of what aid is and can be.

41
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,

42
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and moved its way into the larger industry,

43
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.

44
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.

45
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,

46
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
it destroyed the local retailing industry.

47
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Not to say that it shouldn't have,

48
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but that we have to get better at answering the questions

49
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that need to be considered when we think about consequences

50
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and responses.

51
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986,

52
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where I was doing two things.

53
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.

54
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
We were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was

55
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,

56
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.

57
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And because we had a good business model, we actually did it,

58
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.

59
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,

60
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,

61
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,

62
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme --

63
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but then it was quite new, especially in an economy

64
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that was moving from barter into trade.

65
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We got a lot of things right.

66
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.

67
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day

68
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
as to how they would use this access to credit

69
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to build their little businesses, earn more income

70
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so they could take care of their families better.

71
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us,

72
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife

73
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into

74
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:08,000
this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,

75
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.

76
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The genocide happened in 1994,

77
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
seven years after these women all worked together

78
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to build this dream.

79
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And the good news was that the institution,

80
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the banking institution, lasted.

81
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.

82
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The bakery was completely wiped out,

83
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but the lessons for me were that accountability counts --

84
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
got to build things with people on the ground,

85
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,

86
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the incentives matter.

87
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.

88
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything

89
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that was happening in the world,

90
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,

91
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on the one hand I absolutely agree with him,

92
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 --

93
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono

94
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty;

95
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the world is talking about Africa

96
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in ways I have never seen in my life.

97
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It's thrilling.

98
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night

99
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 --

100
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,

101
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory,

102
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:26,000
as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.

103
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one,

104
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:34,000
celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two

105
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that is all about execution, all about the how-to.

106
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,

107
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,

108
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is to build viable systems on the ground

109
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,

110
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.

111
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
If we do that, we really can make poverty history.

112
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
And it was that -- that whole philosophy --

113
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that encouraged me to start my current endeavor

114
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
called "Acumen Fund,"

115
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which is trying to build some mini-blueprints

116
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
for how we might do that in water, health and housing

117
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.

118
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,

119
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
so you can see what it is that we're doing.

120
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves --

121
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.

122
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Because we too often talk about them as these

123
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,

124
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
when in fact, it's quite an amazing story.

125
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:43,000
On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.

126
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's who we talk about when we think about "the poor."

127
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,

128
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and yet most of these people go invisible.

129
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Where we typically work, there's people making between

130
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
one and three dollars a day.

131
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Who are these people?

132
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:,000
They are farmers and factory workers.

133
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They work in government offices. They're drivers.

134
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
They are domestics.

135
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They typically pay for critical goods and services like water,

136
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times

137
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
what their middleclass counterparts pay --

138
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.

139
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,

140
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
if you give them that opportunity.

141
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, two examples.

142
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,

143
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
most of whom make less than two dollars a day.

144
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.

145
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.

146
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.

147
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,

148
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and figure out how to do a drip irrigation,

149
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.

150
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,

151
0:07:56,000 --> 0:08:01,000
so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.

152
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
A couple of principles:

153
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
build small.

154
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.

155
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:12,000
This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit

156
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to

157
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
with a corrugated iron roof.

158
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
After one harvest, they had increased their income enough

159
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.

160
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
A couple of years later, I meet them.

161
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,

162
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid

163
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to build their house.

164
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.

165
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Something I truly believe.

166
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:44,000
You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets,

167
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard

168
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:5,000
huge kudos for bringing to the world

169
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:54,000
this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.

170
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.

171
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:,000
300 to 500 million cases are reported.

172
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's estimated that Africa loses

173
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.

174
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Five dollars can save a life.

175
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars --

176
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?

177
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The question, though, is not "Why can't we?"

178
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?

179
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:22,000
A lot of hurdles.

180
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.

181
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.

182
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.

183
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan

184
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa

185
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:44,000
so that they could transfer technology from Japan

186
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.

187
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Here are just some pictures of the factory.

188
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Today, three years later, the company has employed

189
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
another thousand women.

190
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.

191
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's the largest company in Tanzania.

192
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,

193
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
three million by the end of the year.

194
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.

195
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So the production side is working.

196
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:12,000
On the distribution side, though,

197
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
as a world, we have a lot of work to do.

198
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,

199
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and then given primarily to people around Africa.

200
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We're looking at building

201
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.

202
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Their women.

203
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And so I want you to meet Jacqueline,

204
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:33,000
my namesake, 21 years old.

205
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,

206
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.

207
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:41,000
She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money

208
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to put a down payment on her house.

209
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:47,000
She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,

210
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and told me she is not marrying nor having children

211
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
until these things are completed.

212
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And so, when I told her about our idea --

213
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,

214
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and find a way for the women themselves to go out

215
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and sell these nets to others --

216
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
she quickly started calculating what she herself could make

217
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and signed up.

218
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies,

219
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and quickly did a prototyping on this,

220
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.

221
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:22,000
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts

222
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,

223
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,

224
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and we learned a lot about how you sell things.

225
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Not coming in with our own notions,

226
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.

227
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.

228
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.

229
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Children can sleep through the night;

230
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.

231
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And we've started making curtains,

232
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status --

233
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that you care about your children.

234
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.

235
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell

236
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
goods and services to the poor.

237
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity

238
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to make poverty history.

239
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter,

240
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,

241
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
people all over the developing world

242
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:22,000
who fit in this category, to do it themselves.

243
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.

244
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,

245
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that they want to make their own decisions;

246
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:32,000
they want to solve their own problems;

247
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and that by engaging with them,

248
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
not only do we create much more dignity for them,

249
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but for us as well.

250
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And so I urge all of you to think next time

251
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:46,000
as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity

252
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that we all have -- to make poverty history --

253
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
by really becoming part of the process

254
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and moving away from an us-and-them world,

255
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and realizing that it's about all of us,

256
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.

257
0:12:58,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Thank you.

258
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause)

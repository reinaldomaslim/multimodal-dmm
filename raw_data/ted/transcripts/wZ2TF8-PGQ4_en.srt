1
0:00:12.97,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am a plant geneticist.

2
0:00:15.292,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I study genes that make plants resistant to disease

3
0:00:18.867,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and tolerant of stress.

4
0:00:21.189,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In recent years,

5
0:00:23.465,000 --> 0:00:25,000
millions of people around the world have come to believe

6
0:00:26.367,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that there's something sinister about genetic modification.

7
0:00:30.5,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Today, I am going to provide a different perspective.

8
0:00:36.003,000 --> 0:00:38,000
First, let me introduce my husband, Raoul.

9
0:00:38.569,000 --> 0:00:4,000
He's an organic farmer.

10
0:00:41.192,000 --> 0:00:44,000
On his farm, he plants a variety of different crops.

11
0:00:45.14,000 --> 0:00:48,000
This is one of the many ecological farming practices

12
0:00:48.181,000 --> 0:00:51,000
he uses to keep his farm healthy.

13
0:00:51.664,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Imagine some of the reactions we get:

14
0:00:54.822,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"Really? An organic farmer and a plant geneticist?

15
0:00:58.398,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Can you agree on anything?"

16
0:01:01.439,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Well, we can, and it's not difficult, because we have the same goal.

17
0:01:06.415,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We want to help nourish the growing population

18
0:01:09.543,000 --> 0:01:11,000
without further destroying the environment.

19
0:01:12.283,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I believe this is the greatest challenge of our time.

20
0:01:17.066,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, genetic modification is not new;

21
0:01:21.199,000 --> 0:01:24,000
virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified

22
0:01:25.169,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in some manner.

23
0:01:27.264,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Let me give you a few examples.

24
0:01:30.376,000 --> 0:01:32,000
On the left is an image

25
0:01:32.657,000 --> 0:01:36,000
of the ancient ancestor of modern corn.

26
0:01:37.208,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You see a single roll of grain that's covered in a hard case.

27
0:01:41.109,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Unless you have a hammer,

28
0:01:43.64,000 --> 0:01:48,000
teosinte isn't good for making tortillas.

29
0:01:48.655,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Now, take a look at the ancient ancestor of banana.

30
0:01:53.31,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You can see the large seeds.

31
0:01:55.064,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And unappetizing brussel sprouts,

32
0:01:58.5,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and eggplant, so beautiful.

33
0:02:02.122,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, to create these varieties,

34
0:02:04.305,000 --> 0:02:07,000
breeders have used many different genetic techniques over the years.

35
0:02:07.489,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Some of them are quite creative,

36
0:02:09.053,000 --> 0:02:11,000
like mixing two different species together

37
0:02:11.607,000 --> 0:02:13,000
using a process called grafting

38
0:02:13.72,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to create this variety that's half tomato and half potato.

39
0:02:19.525,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Breeders have also used other types of genetic techniques,

40
0:02:24.076,000 --> 0:02:26,000
such as random mutagenesis,

41
0:02:26.119,000 --> 0:02:29,000
which induces uncharacterized mutations

42
0:02:29.509,000 --> 0:02:31,000
into the plants.

43
0:02:31.808,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The rice in the cereal that many of us fed our babies

44
0:02:36.134,000 --> 0:02:39,000
was developed using this approach.

45
0:02:39.957,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, today, breeders have even more options to choose from.

46
0:02:43.626,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Some of them are extraordinarily precise.

47
0:02:47.364,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I want to give you a couple examples from my own work.

48
0:02:51.172,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I work on rice, which is a staple food for more than half the world's people.

49
0:02:57.047,000 --> 0:03:,000
Each year, 40 percent of the potential harvest

50
0:03:00.181,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is lost to pest and disease.

51
0:03:03.037,000 --> 0:03:06,000
For this reason, farmers plant rice varieties

52
0:03:06.167,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that carry genes for resistance.

53
0:03:09.023,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This approach has been used for nearly 100 years.

54
0:03:12.761,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Yet, when I started graduate school,

55
0:03:15.942,000 --> 0:03:17,000
no one knew what these genes were.

56
0:03:18.195,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It wasn't until the 1990s that scientists finally uncovered

57
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the genetic basis of resistance.

58
0:03:26.414,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In my laboratory, we isolated a gene for immunity to a very serious

59
0:03:31.174,000 --> 0:03:33,000
bacterial disease in Asia and Africa.

60
0:03:33.937,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We found we could engineer the gene into a conventional rice variety

61
0:03:39.277,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that's normally susceptible,

62
0:03:41.088,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and you can see the two leaves on the bottom here

63
0:03:43.526,000 --> 0:03:45,000
are highly resistant to infection.

64
0:03:46.499,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, the same month that my laboratory published

65
0:03:49.888,000 --> 0:03:51,000
our discovery on the rice immunity gene,

66
0:03:52.675,000 --> 0:03:55,000
my friend and colleague Dave Mackill stopped by my office.

67
0:03:56.274,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He said, "Seventy million rice farmers are having trouble growing rice."

68
0:04:04.864,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That's because their fields are flooded,

69
0:04:07.651,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and these rice farmers are living on less than two dollars a day.

70
0:04:12.272,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Although rice grows well in standing water,

71
0:04:15.824,000 --> 0:04:17,000
most rice varieties will die if they're submerged

72
0:04:18.634,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for more than three days.

73
0:04:20.932,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Flooding is expected to be increasingly problematic

74
0:04:24.253,000 --> 0:04:26,000
as the climate changes.

75
0:04:27.062,000 --> 0:04:31,000
He told me that his graduate student Kenong Xu and himself

76
0:04:31.497,000 --> 0:04:35,000
were studying an ancient variety of rice that had an amazing property.

77
0:04:36.466,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It could withstand two weeks of complete submergence.

78
0:04:42.178,000 --> 0:04:47,000
He asked if I would be willing to help them isolate this gene.

79
0:04:47.448,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I said yes -- I was very excited, because I knew if we were successful,

80
0:04:51.999,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we could potentially help millions of farmers grow rice

81
0:04:55.993,000 --> 0:04:58,000
even when their fields were flooded.

82
0:04:59.453,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Kenong spent 10 years looking for this gene.

83
0:05:03.516,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Then one day, he said,

84
0:05:05.513,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"Come look at this experiment. You've got to see it."

85
0:05:09.135,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I went to the greenhouse and I saw

86
0:05:10.992,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that the conventional variety that was flooded for 18 days had died,

87
0:05:16.292,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but the rice variety that we had genetically engineered

88
0:05:19.955,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with a new gene we had discovered, called Sub1, was alive.

89
0:05:24.459,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Kenong and I were amazed and excited

90
0:05:26.944,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that a single gene could have this dramatic effect.

91
0:05:30.775,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But this is just a greenhouse experiment.

92
0:05:34.417,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Would this work in the field?

93
0:05:37.783,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now, I'm going to show you a four-month time lapse video

94
0:05:40.523,000 --> 0:05:43,000
taken at the International Rice Research Institute.

95
0:05:43.565,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Breeders there developed a rice variety carrying the Sub1 gene

96
0:05:48.59,000 --> 0:05:51,000
using another genetic technique called precision breeding.

97
0:05:52.226,000 --> 0:05:54,000
On the left, you can see the Sub1 variety,

98
0:05:54.826,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and on the right is the conventional variety.

99
0:05:58.471,000 --> 0:06:,000
Both varieties do very well at first,

100
0:06:00.933,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but then the field is flooded for 17 days.

101
0:06:04.346,000 --> 0:06:06,000
You can see the Sub1 variety does great.

102
0:06:07.271,000 --> 0:06:11,000
In fact, it produces three and a half times more grain

103
0:06:12.124,000 --> 0:06:15,000
than the conventional variety.

104
0:06:15.468,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I love this video

105
0:06:17.465,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because it shows the power of plant genetics to help farmers.

106
0:06:21.76,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Last year, with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,

107
0:06:25.15,000 --> 0:06:29,000
three and a half million farmers grew Sub1 rice.

108
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Applause)

109
0:06:33.439,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Thank you.

110
0:06:37.168,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now, many people don't mind genetic modification

111
0:06:41.31,000 --> 0:06:43,000
when it comes to moving rice genes around,

112
0:06:44.05,000 --> 0:06:45,000
rice genes in rice plants,

113
0:06:45.397,000 --> 0:06:48,000
or even when it comes to mixing species together

114
0:06:48.787,000 --> 0:06:52,000
through grafting or random mutagenesis.

115
0:06:53.036,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But when it comes to taking genes from viruses and bacteria

116
0:06:58.214,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and putting them into plants,

117
0:07:00.002,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a lot of people say, "Yuck."

118
0:07:03.299,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Why would you do that?

119
0:07:05.458,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The reason is that sometimes it's the cheapest, safest,

120
0:07:08.221,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and most effective technology

121
0:07:11.333,000 --> 0:07:16,000
for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable agriculture.

122
0:07:16.627,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'm going to give you three examples.

123
0:07:19.668,000 --> 0:07:22,000
First, take a look at papaya. It's delicious, right?

124
0:07:22.78,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But now, look at this papaya.

125
0:07:25.287,000 --> 0:07:29,000
This papaya is infected with papaya ringspot virus.

126
0:07:29.49,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In the 1950s, this virus nearly wiped out the entire production

127
0:07:35.248,000 --> 0:07:4,000
of papaya on the island of Oahu in Hawaii.

128
0:07:41.169,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Many people thought that the Hawaiian papaya was doomed,

129
0:07:45.465,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but then, a local Hawaiian,

130
0:07:48.529,000 --> 0:07:5,000
a plant pathologist named Dennis Gonsalves,

131
0:07:51.2,000 --> 0:07:55,000
decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering.

132
0:07:55.631,000 --> 0:07:58,000
He took a snippet of viral DNA and he inserted it

133
0:07:59.299,000 --> 0:08:01,000
into the papaya genome.

134
0:08:01.412,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is kind of like a human getting a vaccination.

135
0:08:04.686,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, take a look at his field trial.

136
0:08:07.217,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You can see the genetically engineered papaya in the center.

137
0:08:10.839,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's immune to infection.

138
0:08:13.022,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The conventional papaya around the outside is severely infected with the virus.

139
0:08:18.65,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Dennis' pioneering work is credited with rescuing the papaya industry.

140
0:08:25.369,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Today, 20 years later, there's still no other method to control this disease.

141
0:08:30.134,000 --> 0:08:33,000
There's no organic method. There's no conventional method.

142
0:08:33.338,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Eighty percent of Hawaiian papaya is genetically engineered.

143
0:08:37.588,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, some of you may still feel a little queasy about viral genes in your food,

144
0:08:42.463,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but consider this:

145
0:08:44.6,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The genetically engineered papaya carries just a trace amount of the virus.

146
0:08:51.38,000 --> 0:08:54,000
If you bite into an organic or conventional papaya

147
0:08:54.77,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that is infected with the virus,

148
0:08:57.625,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you will be chewing on tenfold more viral protein.

149
0:09:02.641,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Now, take a look at this pest feasting on an eggplant.

150
0:09:06.593,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The brown you see is frass,

151
0:09:08.98,000 --> 0:09:11,000
what comes out the back end of the insect.

152
0:09:12.161,000 --> 0:09:15,000
To control this serious pest,

153
0:09:15.365,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which can devastate the entire eggplant crop in Bangladesh,

154
0:09:20.891,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Bangladeshi farmers spray insecticides

155
0:09:24.327,000 --> 0:09:27,000
two to three times a week,

156
0:09:27.694,000 --> 0:09:31,000
sometimes twice a day, when pest pressure is high.

157
0:09:32.408,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health,

158
0:09:36.448,000 --> 0:09:39,000
especially when farmers and their families

159
0:09:40.035,000 --> 0:09:44,000
cannot afford proper protection, like these children.

160
0:09:44.4,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In less developed countries, it's estimated that 300,000 people

161
0:09:49.903,000 --> 0:09:54,000
die every year because of insecticide misuse and exposure.

162
0:09:55.313,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Cornell and Bangladeshi scientists decided to fight this disease

163
0:09:59.121,000 --> 0:10:04,000
using a genetic technique that builds on an organic farming approach.

164
0:10:04.373,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Organic farmers like my husband Raoul spray an insecticide called B.T.,

165
0:10:09.263,000 --> 0:10:11,000
which is based on a bacteria.

166
0:10:12.239,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This pesticide is very specific to caterpillar pests,

167
0:10:18.067,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and in fact, it's nontoxic to humans, fish and birds.

168
0:10:21.643,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's less toxic than table salt.

169
0:10:24.754,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But this approach does not work well in Bangladesh.

170
0:10:27.332,000 --> 0:10:29,000
That's because these insecticide sprays

171
0:10:29.746,000 --> 0:10:31,000
are difficult to find, they're expensive,

172
0:10:31.999,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and they don't prevent the insect from getting inside the plants.

173
0:10:36.341,000 --> 0:10:39,000
In the genetic approach, scientists cut the gene out of the bacteria

174
0:10:39.545,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and insert it directly into the eggplant genome.

175
0:10:42.726,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Will this work to reduce insecticide sprays in Bangladesh?

176
0:10:46.116,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Definitely.

177
0:10:47.555,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Last season, farmers reported they were able to reduce their insecticide use

178
0:10:52.106,000 --> 0:10:56,000
by a huge amount, almost down to zero.

179
0:10:56.471,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They're able to harvest and replant for the next season.

180
0:11:00.7,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now, I've given you a couple examples of how genetic engineering can be used

181
0:11:04.505,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to fight pests and disease

182
0:11:06.293,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and to reduce the amount of insecticides.

183
0:11:09.033,000 --> 0:11:12,000
My final example is an example

184
0:11:12.4,000 --> 0:11:17,000
where genetic engineering can be used to reduce malnutrition.

185
0:11:18.024,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In less developed countries,

186
0:11:20.573,000 --> 0:11:24,000
500,000 children go blind every year because of lack of Vitamin A.

187
0:11:25.239,000 --> 0:11:27,000
More than half will die.

188
0:11:28.004,000 --> 0:11:31,000
For this reason, scientists supported by the Rockefeller Foundation

189
0:11:31.857,000 --> 0:11:33,000
genetically engineered a golden rice

190
0:11:34.713,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to produce beta-carotene, which is the precursor of Vitamin A.

191
0:11:39.264,000 --> 0:11:42,000
This is the same pigment that we find in carrots.

192
0:11:42.589,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Researchers estimate that just one cup of golden rice per day

193
0:11:47.321,000 --> 0:11:51,000
will save the lives of thousands of children.

194
0:11:51.748,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But golden rice is virulently opposed

195
0:11:53.958,000 --> 0:11:55,000
by activists who are against genetic modification.

196
0:11:56.918,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Just last year,

197
0:11:58.528,000 --> 0:12:02,000
activists invaded and destroyed a field trial in the Philippines.

198
0:12:02.923,000 --> 0:12:04,000
When I heard about the destruction,

199
0:12:05.339,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I wondered if they knew that they were destroying much more

200
0:12:09.1,000 --> 0:12:11,000
than a scientific research project,

201
0:12:11.283,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that they were destroying medicines that children desperately needed

202
0:12:14.504,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to save their sight and their lives.

203
0:12:17.967,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Some of my friends and family still worry:

204
0:12:20.71,000 --> 0:12:23,000
How do you know genes in the food are safe to eat?

205
0:12:23.961,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I explained the genetic engineering,

206
0:12:25.679,000 --> 0:12:27,000
the process of moving genes between species,

207
0:12:28.047,000 --> 0:12:3,000
has been used for more than 40 years

208
0:12:30.857,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in wines, in medicine, in plants, in cheeses.

209
0:12:35.172,000 --> 0:12:38,000
In all that time, there hasn't been a single case of harm

210
0:12:38.296,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to human health or the environment.

211
0:12:42.164,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But I say, look, I'm not asking you to believe me.

212
0:12:44.835,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Science is not a belief system.

213
0:12:48.062,000 --> 0:12:5,000
My opinion doesn't matter.

214
0:12:50.871,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Let's look at the evidence.

215
0:12:53.681,000 --> 0:12:56,000
After 20 years of careful study and rigorous peer review

216
0:12:57.187,000 --> 0:13:,000
by thousands of independent scientists,

217
0:13:00.229,000 --> 0:13:04,000
every major scientific organization in the world has concluded

218
0:13:04.269,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that the crops currently on the market are safe to eat

219
0:13:07.891,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and that the process of genetic engineering

220
0:13:10.143,000 --> 0:13:14,000
is no more risky than older methods of genetic modification.

221
0:13:14.996,000 --> 0:13:17,000
These are precisely the same organizations that most of us trust

222
0:13:18.632,000 --> 0:13:21,000
when it comes to other important scientific issues

223
0:13:21.656,000 --> 0:13:25,000
such as global climate change or the safety of vaccines.

224
0:13:27.081,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Raoul and I believe that, instead of worrying about the genes in our food,

225
0:13:31.5,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we must focus on how we can help children grow up healthy.

226
0:13:35.192,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We must ask if farmers in rural communities can thrive,

227
0:13:38.327,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and if everyone can afford the food.

228
0:13:40.951,000 --> 0:13:43,000
We must try to minimize environmental degradation.

229
0:13:44.642,000 --> 0:13:47,000
What scares me most about the loud arguments and misinformation

230
0:13:48.241,000 --> 0:13:49,000
about plant genetics

231
0:13:49.797,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is that the poorest people who most need the technology

232
0:13:52.839,000 --> 0:13:55,000
may be denied access because of the vague fears and prejudices

233
0:13:56.577,000 --> 0:13:59,000
of those who have enough to eat.

234
0:13:59.804,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We have a huge challenge in front of us.

235
0:14:02.73,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Let's celebrate scientific innovation and use it.

236
0:14:06.515,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It's our responsibility

237
0:14:08.465,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering

238
0:14:11.902,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and safeguard the environment.

239
0:14:13.736,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Thank you.

240
0:14:15.988,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Applause)

241
0:14:17.915,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Thank you.

242
0:14:20.493,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Chris Anderson: Powerfully argued.

243
0:14:22.397,000 --> 0:14:24,000
The people who argue against GMOs,

244
0:14:24.556,000 --> 0:14:27,000
as I understand it, the core piece comes from two things.

245
0:14:28.387,000 --> 0:14:3,000
One, complexity and unintended consequence.

246
0:14:31.277,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Nature is this incredibly complex machine.

247
0:14:33.318,000 --> 0:14:35,000
If we put out these brand new genes that we've created,

248
0:14:35.902,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that haven't been challenged by years of evolution,

249
0:14:38.326,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and they started mixing up with the rest of what's going on,

250
0:14:41.233,000 --> 0:14:44,000
couldn't that trigger some kind of cataclysm or problem,

251
0:14:44.67,000 --> 0:14:46,000
especially when you add in the commercial incentive

252
0:14:47.241,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that some companies have to put them out there?

253
0:14:50.794,000 --> 0:14:51,000
The fear is that those incentives

254
0:14:52.512,000 --> 0:14:55,000
mean that the decision is not made on purely scientific grounds,

255
0:14:56.246,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and even if it was, that there would be unintended consequences.

256
0:14:59.292,000 --> 0:15:03,000
How do we know that there isn't a big risk of some unintended consequence?

257
0:15:03.425,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Often our tinkerings with nature do lead to big, unintended consequences

258
0:15:07.302,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and chain reactions.

259
0:15:08.997,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Pamela Ronald: Okay, so on the commercial aspects,

260
0:15:11.575,000 --> 0:15:13,000
one thing that's really important to understand is that,

261
0:15:14.245,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in the developed world, farmers in the United States,

262
0:15:16.911,000 --> 0:15:18,000
almost all farmers, whether they're organic or conventional,

263
0:15:19.732,000 --> 0:15:21,000
they buy seed produced by seed companies.

264
0:15:21.83,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So there's definitely a commercial interest to sell a lot of seed,

265
0:15:24.932,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but hopefully they're selling seed that the farmers want to buy.

266
0:15:27.935,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It's different in the less developed world.

267
0:15:30.196,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Farmers there cannot afford the seed.

268
0:15:32.309,000 --> 0:15:33,000
These seeds are not being sold.

269
0:15:33.935,000 --> 0:15:35,000
These seeds are being distributed freely

270
0:15:36.303,000 --> 0:15:41,000
through traditional kinds of certification groups,

271
0:15:41.365,000 --> 0:15:43,000
so it is very important in less developed countries

272
0:15:43.848,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that the seed be freely available.

273
0:15:45.473,000 --> 0:15:48,000
CA: Wouldn't some activists say that this is actually part of the conspiracy?

274
0:15:49.097,000 --> 0:15:5,000
This is the heroin strategy.

275
0:15:50.513,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You seed the stuff, and people have no choice

276
0:15:52.765,000 --> 0:15:53,000
but to be hooked on these seeds forever?

277
0:15:54.704,000 --> 0:15:59,000
PR: There are a lot of conspiracy theories for sure, but it doesn't work that way.

278
0:16:00.091,000 --> 0:16:03,000
For example, the seed that's being distributed, the flood-tolerant rice,

279
0:16:04.067,000 --> 0:16:05,000
this is distributed freely

280
0:16:05.912,000 --> 0:16:09,000
through Indian and Bangladeshi seed certification agencies,

281
0:16:10.029,000 --> 0:16:12,000
so there's no commercial interest at all.

282
0:16:12.444,000 --> 0:16:15,000
The golden rice was developed through support of the Rockefeller Foundation.

283
0:16:16.368,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Again, it's being freely distributed.

284
0:16:18.365,000 --> 0:16:19,000
There are no commercial profits

285
0:16:20.152,000 --> 0:16:22,000
in this situation.

286
0:16:22.498,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And now to address your other question about, well, mixing genes,

287
0:16:25.771,000 --> 0:16:27,000
aren't there some unintended consequences?

288
0:16:28.024,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Absolutely -- every time we do something different,

289
0:16:31.019,000 --> 0:16:32,000
there's an unintended consequence,

290
0:16:32.8,000 --> 0:16:34,000
but one of the points I was trying to make

291
0:16:34.827,000 --> 0:16:37,000
is that we've been doing kind of crazy things to our plants,

292
0:16:38.159,000 --> 0:16:42,000
mutagenesis using radiation or chemical mutagenesis.

293
0:16:42.257,000 --> 0:16:45,000
This induces thousands of uncharacterized mutations,

294
0:16:46.204,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and this is even a higher risk of unintended consequence

295
0:16:50.128,000 --> 0:16:51,000
than many of the modern methods.

296
0:16:51.916,000 --> 0:16:54,000
And so it's really important not to use the term GMO

297
0:16:55.051,000 --> 0:16:57,000
because it's scientifically meaningless.

298
0:16:57.767,000 --> 0:17:01,000
I feel it's very important to talk about a specific crop

299
0:17:02.109,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and a specific product, and think about the needs of the consumer.

300
0:17:05.431,000 --> 0:17:08,000
CA: So part of what's happening here is that there's a mental model

301
0:17:08.608,000 --> 0:17:11,000
in a lot of people that nature is nature, and it's pure and pristine,

302
0:17:12.46,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and to tinker with it is Frankensteinian.

303
0:17:14.697,000 --> 0:17:17,000
It's making something that's pure dangerous in some way,

304
0:17:18.343,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and I think you're saying that that whole model

305
0:17:20.684,000 --> 0:17:22,000
just misunderstands how nature is.

306
0:17:22.797,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Nature is a much more chaotic interplay of genetic changes

307
0:17:26.698,000 --> 0:17:28,000
that have been happening all the time anyway.

308
0:17:28.927,000 --> 0:17:31,000
PR: That's absolutely true, and there's no such thing as pure food.

309
0:17:32.34,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I mean, you could not spray eggplant with insecticides

310
0:17:35.397,000 --> 0:17:38,000
or not genetically engineer it, but then you'd be stuck eating frass.

311
0:17:39.5,000 --> 0:17:4,000

1
0:00:12.29,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a physician trained in infectious diseases,

2
0:00:17.538,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and following my training,

3
0:00:19.932,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I moved to Somalia

4
0:00:22.854,000 --> 0:00:24,000
from San Francisco.

5
0:00:24.898,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And my goodbye greeting

6
0:00:26.513,000 --> 0:00:27,000
from the chief of infectious diseases

7
0:00:28.366,000 --> 0:00:3,000
at San Francisco General was,

8
0:00:30.462,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Gary, this is the biggest mistake you'll ever make."

9
0:00:34.145,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But I landed in a refugee situation

10
0:00:38.193,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that had a million refugees in 40 camps,

11
0:00:42.266,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and there were six of us doctors.

12
0:00:44.793,000 --> 0:00:46,000
There were many epidemics there.

13
0:00:47.109,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My responsibilities were largely related to

14
0:00:49.722,000 --> 0:00:5,000
tuberculosis,

15
0:00:51.463,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and then we got struck by an epidemic of cholera.

16
0:00:55.329,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So it was the spread of tuberculosis

17
0:00:57.392,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and the spread of cholera

18
0:00:59.439,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that I was responsible for inhibiting.

19
0:01:04.64,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And in order to do this work, we, of course,

20
0:01:07.281,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because of the limitation in health workers,

21
0:01:09.981,000 --> 0:01:12,000
had to recruit refugees to be a specialized

22
0:01:13.747,000 --> 0:01:15,000
new category of health worker.

23
0:01:16.506,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Following three years of work in Somalia,

24
0:01:19.734,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I got picked up by the World Health Organization,

25
0:01:22.344,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and got assigned to the epidemics of AIDS.

26
0:01:25.391,000 --> 0:01:27,000
My primary responsibility was Uganda,

27
0:01:28.264,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but also I worked in Rwanda and Burundi

28
0:01:31.267,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and Zaire, now Congo,

29
0:01:34.354,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Tanzania, Malawi, and several other countries.

30
0:01:37.922,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And my last assignment there was to run a unit

31
0:01:40.383,000 --> 0:01:41,000
called intervention development,

32
0:01:42.268,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which was responsible for designing interventions.

33
0:01:45.984,000 --> 0:01:47,000
After 10 years of working overseas,

34
0:01:48.959,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I was exhausted.

35
0:01:50.682,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I really had very little left.

36
0:01:52.88,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I had been traveling to one country after another.

37
0:01:57.292,000 --> 0:02:,000
I was emotionally feeling very isolated.

38
0:02:00.756,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I wanted to come home.

39
0:02:02.894,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I'd seen a lot of death,

40
0:02:04.93,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in particular epidemic death,

41
0:02:07.88,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and epidemic death has a different feel to it.

42
0:02:10.828,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's full of panic and fear,

43
0:02:14.436,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I'd heard the women wailing and crying

44
0:02:18.247,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in the desert.

45
0:02:20.54,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I wanted to come home and take a break

46
0:02:22.933,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and maybe start over.

47
0:02:25.972,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was not aware of any epidemic problems

48
0:02:28.824,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in America.

49
0:02:30.461,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In fact, I wasn't aware of any problems in America.

50
0:02:33.748,000 --> 0:02:35,000
In fact -- seriously.

51
0:02:35.828,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And in fact I would visit friends of mine,

52
0:02:38.67,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and I noticed that they had water

53
0:02:41.759,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that came right into their homes.

54
0:02:43.772,000 --> 0:02:44,000
How many of you have such a situation?

55
0:02:45.647,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:46.815,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And some of them, many of them actually,

57
0:02:49.426,000 --> 0:02:51,000
had water that came into more than one room.

58
0:02:51.541,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I noticed that they would move

59
0:02:54.788,000 --> 0:02:56,000
this little thermoregulatory device

60
0:02:56.795,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to change the temperature in their home

61
0:02:59.07,000 --> 0:03:01,000
by one degree or two degrees.

62
0:03:01.921,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And now I do that.

63
0:03:03.602,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I really didn't know what I would do,

64
0:03:07.855,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but friends of mine began telling me

65
0:03:10.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
about children shooting other children with guns.

66
0:03:14.38,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I asked the question,

67
0:03:16.195,000 --> 0:03:17,000
what are you doing about it?

68
0:03:18.153,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What are you in America doing about it?

69
0:03:20.261,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And there were two essential explanations

70
0:03:22.673,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or ideas that were prevalent.

71
0:03:24.922,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And one was punishment.

72
0:03:26.976,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And this I had heard about before.

73
0:03:29.149,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We who had worked in behavior

74
0:03:31.793,000 --> 0:03:34,000
knew that punishment was something that was discussed

75
0:03:35.177,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but also that it was highly overvalued.

76
0:03:38.014,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It was not a main driver of behavior,

77
0:03:40.358,000 --> 0:03:43,000
nor was it a main driver of behavior change.

78
0:03:44.248,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And besides that, it reminded me

79
0:03:46.298,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of ancient epidemics

80
0:03:48.8,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that were previously completely misunderstood

81
0:03:51.87,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because the science hadn't been there before,

82
0:03:54.444,000 --> 0:03:56,000
epidemics of plague

83
0:03:56.83,000 --> 0:03:58,000
or typhus or leprosy,

84
0:03:59.742,000 --> 0:04:01,000
where the prevalent ideas were that there were

85
0:04:02.479,000 --> 0:04:05,000
bad people or bad humors or bad air,

86
0:04:06.121,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and widows were dragged around the moat,

87
0:04:08.73,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and dungeons were part of the solution.

88
0:04:12.177,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The other explanation or, in a way,

89
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the solution suggested,

90
0:04:16.104,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is please fix all of these things:

91
0:04:19.104,000 --> 0:04:22,000
the schools, the community, the homes, the families,

92
0:04:22.436,000 --> 0:04:23,000
everything.

93
0:04:23.962,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I'd heard this before as well.

94
0:04:25.775,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'd called this the "everything" theory,

95
0:04:28.51,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or EOE: Everything On Earth.

96
0:04:31.178,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But we'd also realized

97
0:04:32.789,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in treating other processes and problems

98
0:04:36.426,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that sometimes you don't need to treat everything.

99
0:04:39.341,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And so the sense that I had

100
0:04:41.525,000 --> 0:04:43,000
was there was a giant gap here.

101
0:04:44.123,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The problem of violence was stuck,

102
0:04:46.869,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and this has historically been the case

103
0:04:49.135,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in many other issues.

104
0:04:50.297,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Diarrheal diseases had been stuck.

105
0:04:51.875,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Malaria had been stuck.

106
0:04:53.354,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Frequently, a strategy has to be rethought.

107
0:04:55.824,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's not as if I had any idea what it would look like,

108
0:04:59.114,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but there was a sense that we would have to do

109
0:05:02.42,000 --> 0:05:04,000
something with new categories of workers

110
0:05:04.673,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and something having to do with behavior change

111
0:05:06.941,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and something having to do with public education.

112
0:05:11.05,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But I began to ask questions

113
0:05:13.117,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and search out the usual things

114
0:05:15.655,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that I had been exploring before,

115
0:05:17.607,000 --> 0:05:18,000
like, what do the maps look like?

116
0:05:19.14,000 --> 0:05:2,000
What do the graphs look like?

117
0:05:20.59,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What does the data look like?

118
0:05:22.629,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And the maps of violence

119
0:05:25.025,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in most U.S. cities

120
0:05:26.987,000 --> 0:05:27,000
looked like this.

121
0:05:28.979,000 --> 0:05:29,000
There was clustering.

122
0:05:30.643,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This reminded me of clustering that we'd seen also

123
0:05:33.981,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in infectious epidemics,

124
0:05:35.724,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for example cholera.

125
0:05:37.716,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And then we looked at the maps,

126
0:05:40.083,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and the maps showed this typical wave

127
0:05:42.797,000 --> 0:05:43,000
upon wave upon wave,

128
0:05:44.59,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because all epidemics

129
0:05:45.945,000 --> 0:05:47,000
are combinations of many epidemics.

130
0:05:48.519,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And it also looked like infectious epidemics.

131
0:05:51.623,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And then we asked the question,

132
0:05:53.236,000 --> 0:05:56,000
well what really predicts a case of violence?

133
0:05:56.778,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And it turns out that the greatest predictor

134
0:05:59.023,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of a case of violence is a preceding case of violence.

135
0:06:02.331,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Which also sounds like, if there is a case of flu,

136
0:06:05.561,000 --> 0:06:07,000
someone gave someone a case of flu, or a cold,

137
0:06:08.461,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or the greatest risk factor of tuberculosis

138
0:06:10.901,000 --> 0:06:13,000
is having been exposed to tuberculosis.

139
0:06:13.953,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And so we see that violence is, in a way,

140
0:06:16.685,000 --> 0:06:19,000
behaving like a contagious disease.

141
0:06:19.844,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We're aware of this anyway

142
0:06:21.394,000 --> 0:06:22,000
even in our common experiences

143
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or our newspaper stories

144
0:06:25.14,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of the spread of violence from fights

145
0:06:28.264,000 --> 0:06:31,000
or in gang wars or in civil wars

146
0:06:31.715,000 --> 0:06:33,000
or even in genocides.

147
0:06:33.973,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And so there's good news about this, though,

148
0:06:36.545,000 --> 0:06:38,000
because there's a way to reverse epidemics,

149
0:06:39.35,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and there's really only three things that are done

150
0:06:41.356,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to reverse epidemics,

151
0:06:43.224,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and the first of it is interrupting transmission.

152
0:06:45.864,000 --> 0:06:46,000
In order to interrupt transmission,

153
0:06:47.79,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you need to detect and find first cases.

154
0:06:51.34,000 --> 0:06:54,000
In other words, for T.B. you have to find somebody

155
0:06:54.354,000 --> 0:06:57,000
who has active T.B. who is infecting other people.

156
0:06:57.602,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Make sense?

157
0:06:59.019,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And there's special workers for doing that.

158
0:07:01.283,000 --> 0:07:02,000
For this particular problem,

159
0:07:03.142,000 --> 0:07:05,000
we designed a new category of worker

160
0:07:05.457,000 --> 0:07:06,000
who, like a SARS worker

161
0:07:06.802,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or someone looking for bird flu,

162
0:07:08.663,000 --> 0:07:09,000
might find first cases.

163
0:07:10.41,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In this case, it's someone who's very angry

164
0:07:12.611,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because someone looked at his girlfriend

165
0:07:14.364,000 --> 0:07:15,000
or owes him money,

166
0:07:16.15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and you can find workers and train them

167
0:07:18.619,000 --> 0:07:21,000
into these specialized categories.

168
0:07:21.733,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And the second thing to do, of course,

169
0:07:23.383,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is to prevent further spread,

170
0:07:24.884,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that means to find who else has been exposed,

171
0:07:28.406,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but may not be spreading so much right now

172
0:07:30.851,000 --> 0:07:32,000
like someone with a smaller case of T.B.,

173
0:07:33.377,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or someone who is just hanging out in the neighborhoods,

174
0:07:36.231,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but in the same group,

175
0:07:37.857,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and then they need to be, in a way,

176
0:07:40.154,000 --> 0:07:41,000
managed as well,

177
0:07:41.527,000 --> 0:07:44,000
particular to the specific disease process.

178
0:07:44.878,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And then the third part, the shifting the norms,

179
0:07:47.931,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and that means a whole bunch of community activities,

180
0:07:51.231,000 --> 0:07:53,000
remodeling, public education,

181
0:07:53.572,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and then you've got what you might call

182
0:07:55.709,000 --> 0:07:56,000
group immunity.

183
0:07:56.931,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And that combination of factors

184
0:07:58.819,000 --> 0:08:,000
is how the AIDS epidemic in Uganda

185
0:08:01.181,000 --> 0:08:03,000
was very successfully reversed.

186
0:08:03.618,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And so what we decided to do in the year 2000

187
0:08:06.448,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is kind of put this together in a way

188
0:08:08.368,000 --> 0:08:1,000
by hiring in new categories of workers,

189
0:08:10.895,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the first being violence interruptors.

190
0:08:13.47,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And then we would put all of this into place

191
0:08:16.132,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in one neighborhood

192
0:08:17.567,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in what was the worst police district

193
0:08:19.977,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in the United States at the time.

194
0:08:21.884,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So violence interruptors hired from the same group,

195
0:08:24.627,000 --> 0:08:26,000
credibility, trust, access,

196
0:08:27.612,000 --> 0:08:29,000
just like the health workers in Somalia,

197
0:08:30.23,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but designed for a different category,

198
0:08:32.497,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and trained in persuasion,

199
0:08:34.469,000 --> 0:08:37,000
cooling people down, buying time, reframing.

200
0:08:38.247,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And then another category of worker,

201
0:08:40.213,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the outreach workers, to keep people

202
0:08:42.753,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in a way on therapy for six to 24 months.

203
0:08:46.123,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Just like T.B., but the object is behavior change.

204
0:08:49.782,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And then a bunch of community activities

205
0:08:51.59,000 --> 0:08:52,000
for changing norms.

206
0:08:53.285,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now our first experiment of this

207
0:08:55.652,000 --> 0:08:57,000
resulted in a 67-percent drop

208
0:08:58.329,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in shootings and killings

209
0:08:59.8,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in the West Garfield neighborhood of Chicago.

210
0:09:02.197,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Applause)

211
0:09:04.347,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And this was a beautiful thing

212
0:09:05.707,000 --> 0:09:06,000
for the neighborhood itself,

213
0:09:07.323,000 --> 0:09:09,000
first 50 or 60 days, then 90 days,

214
0:09:10.215,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and then there was unfortunately another shooting

215
0:09:11.994,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in another 90 days,

216
0:09:13.513,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and the moms were hanging out in the afternoon.

217
0:09:15.953,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They were using parks they weren't using before.

218
0:09:18.351,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The sun was out. Everybody was happy.

219
0:09:20.488,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But of course, the funders said, "Wait a second,

220
0:09:23.678,000 --> 0:09:24,000
do it again."

221
0:09:25.005,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so we had to then, fortunately,

222
0:09:28.322,000 --> 0:09:3,000
get the funds to repeat this experience,

223
0:09:31.081,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and this is one of the next four neighborhoods

224
0:09:33.092,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that had a 45-percent drop in shootings and killings.

225
0:09:36.112,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And since that time, this has been replicated

226
0:09:38.888,000 --> 0:09:39,000
20 times.

227
0:09:40.504,000 --> 0:09:42,000
There have been independent evaluations

228
0:09:42.585,000 --> 0:09:43,000
supported by the Justice Department

229
0:09:44.531,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and by the CDC and performed by Johns Hopkins

230
0:09:47.308,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that have shown 30-to-50-percent and 40-to-70-percent

231
0:09:51.102,000 --> 0:09:53,000
reductions in shootings and killings

232
0:09:53.211,000 --> 0:09:54,000
using this new method.

233
0:09:55.133,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In fact, there have been three independent

234
0:09:56.58,000 --> 0:09:58,000
evaluations of this now.

235
0:09:58.698,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now we've gotten a lot of attention as a result of this,

236
0:10:00.955,000 --> 0:10:02,000
including being featured on

237
0:10:03.151,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The New York Times' Sunday magazine cover story.

238
0:10:07.096,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The Economist in 2009

239
0:10:09.894,000 --> 0:10:11,000
said this is "the approach that will come to prominence."

240
0:10:12.108,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And even a movie was made around our work.

241
0:10:14.445,000 --> 0:10:15,000
[The Interrupters]

242
0:10:15.613,000 --> 0:10:17,000
However, not so fast,

243
0:10:18.117,000 --> 0:10:19,000
because a lot of people did not agree

244
0:10:19.979,000 --> 0:10:2,000
with this way of going about it.

245
0:10:21.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We got a lot of criticism,

246
0:10:23.923,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a lot of opposition,

247
0:10:25.662,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and a lot of opponents.

248
0:10:27.397,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In other words, what do you mean, health problem?

249
0:10:30.248,000 --> 0:10:32,000
What do you mean, epidemic?

250
0:10:32.834,000 --> 0:10:34,000
What do you mean, no bad guys?

251
0:10:35.642,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And there's whole industries designed

252
0:10:37.795,000 --> 0:10:39,000
for managing bad people.

253
0:10:40.753,000 --> 0:10:43,000
What do you mean, hiring people

254
0:10:43.796,000 --> 0:10:44,000
who have backgrounds?

255
0:10:45.745,000 --> 0:10:49,000
My business friends said,

256
0:10:50.244,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"Gary, you're being criticized tremendously.

257
0:10:53.591,000 --> 0:10:54,000
You must be doing something right."

258
0:10:55.589,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

259
0:10:57.598,000 --> 0:11:,000
My musician friends added the word "dude."

260
0:11:00.853,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So anyway, additionally,

261
0:11:04.624,000 --> 0:11:05,000
there was still this problem,

262
0:11:06.449,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and we were getting highly criticized as well

263
0:11:09.354,000 --> 0:11:12,000
for not dealing with all of these other problems.

264
0:11:12.65,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Yet we were able to manage malaria

265
0:11:15.78,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and reduce HIV and reduce diarrheal diseases

266
0:11:18.532,000 --> 0:11:19,000
in places with awful economies

267
0:11:20.47,000 --> 0:11:21,000
without healing the economy.

268
0:11:22.29,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So what's actually happened is,

269
0:11:24.825,000 --> 0:11:26,000
although there is still some opposition,

270
0:11:27.27,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the movement is clearly growing.

271
0:11:29.09,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Many of the major cities in the U.S.,

272
0:11:31.174,000 --> 0:11:33,000
including New York City and Baltimore

273
0:11:33.412,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and Kansas City,

274
0:11:34.677,000 --> 0:11:35,000
their health departments are running this now.

275
0:11:36.61,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Chicago and New Orleans, the health departments

276
0:11:39.231,000 --> 0:11:41,000
are having a very large role in this.

277
0:11:41.762,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This is being embraced more by law enforcement

278
0:11:44.617,000 --> 0:11:45,000
than it had been years ago.

279
0:11:46.596,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Trauma centers and hospitals

280
0:11:48.65,000 --> 0:11:5,000
are doing their part in stepping up.

281
0:11:50.944,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And the U.S. Conference of Mayors

282
0:11:52.837,000 --> 0:11:54,000
has endorsed not only the approach

283
0:11:55.43,000 --> 0:11:57,000
but the specific model.

284
0:11:57.723,000 --> 0:12:,000
Where there's really been uptake even faster

285
0:12:00.972,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is in the international environment,

286
0:12:02.969,000 --> 0:12:03,000
where there's a 55-percent drop

287
0:12:04.725,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in the first neighborhood in Puerto Rico,

288
0:12:07.149,000 --> 0:12:09,000
where interruptions are just beginning in Honduras,

289
0:12:09.955,000 --> 0:12:11,000
where the strategy has been applied in Kenya

290
0:12:12.869,000 --> 0:12:14,000
for the recent elections,

291
0:12:15.515,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and where there have been 500 interruptions in Iraq.

292
0:12:18.688,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So violence is responding as a disease

293
0:12:21.963,000 --> 0:12:23,000
even as it behaves as a disease.

294
0:12:24.228,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So the theory, in a way,

295
0:12:26.431,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is kind of being validated by the treatment.

296
0:12:30.596,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And recently, the Institute of Medicine

297
0:12:33.53,000 --> 0:12:35,000
came out with a workshop report

298
0:12:35.667,000 --> 0:12:36,000
which went through some of the data,

299
0:12:37.531,000 --> 0:12:38,000
including the neuroscience,

300
0:12:39.076,000 --> 0:12:43,000
on how this problem is really transmitted.

301
0:12:43.399,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So I think this is good news,

302
0:12:46.31,000 --> 0:12:47,000
because it allows us an opportunity

303
0:12:48.174,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to come out of the Middle Ages,

304
0:12:49.729,000 --> 0:12:52,000
which is where I feel this field has been.

305
0:12:52.771,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It gives us an opportunity to consider the possibility

306
0:12:55.877,000 --> 0:12:57,000
of replacing some of these prisons

307
0:12:58.673,000 --> 0:13:01,000
with playgrounds or parks,

308
0:13:01.955,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and to consider the possibility

309
0:13:04.623,000 --> 0:13:07,000
of converting our neighborhoods into neighborhoods,

310
0:13:08.31,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and to allow there to be a new strategy,

311
0:13:11.764,000 --> 0:13:14,000
a new set of methods, a new set of workers:

312
0:13:15.625,000 --> 0:13:18,000
science, in a way, replacing morality.

313
0:13:19.04,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And moving away from emotions

314
0:13:21.424,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is the most important part of the solution

315
0:13:24.611,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to science as a more important part of the solution.

316
0:13:28.929,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So I didn't mean to come up with this at all.

317
0:13:33.652,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It was a matter of,

318
0:13:36.154,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I wanted actually a break,

319
0:13:37.985,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and we looked at maps, we looked at graphs,

320
0:13:42.096,000 --> 0:13:43,000
we asked some questions

321
0:13:43.733,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and tried some tools

322
0:13:46.929,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that actually have been used many times before

323
0:13:49.486,000 --> 0:13:5,000
for other things.

324
0:13:51.404,000 --> 0:13:54,000
For myself, I tried to get away from

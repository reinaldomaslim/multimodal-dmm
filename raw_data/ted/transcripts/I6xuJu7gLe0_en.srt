1
0:00:13.04,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was an eight-year-old kid in the mid-1990s.

2
0:00:15.596,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I grew up in southern Philippines.

3
0:00:18.007,000 --> 0:00:2,000
At that age, you're young enough to be oblivious

4
0:00:20.324,000 --> 0:00:22,000
about what society expects from each of us

5
0:00:22.413,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but old enough to be aware of what's going on around you.

6
0:00:26.101,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We lived in a one-bedroom house,

7
0:00:28.4,000 --> 0:00:29,000
all five of us.

8
0:00:29.814,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Our house was amongst clusters of houses

9
0:00:32.034,000 --> 0:00:35,000
made mostly of wood and corrugated metal sheets.

10
0:00:36.43,000 --> 0:00:38,000
These houses were built very close to each other

11
0:00:39.266,000 --> 0:00:4,000
along unpaved roads.

12
0:00:41.475,000 --> 0:00:43,000
There was little to no expectation of privacy.

13
0:00:44.47,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Whenever an argument broke out next door,

14
0:00:47.702,000 --> 0:00:48,000
you heard it all.

15
0:00:49.106,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Or, if there was a little ... something something going on --

16
0:00:53.24,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:55.95,000 --> 0:00:57,000
you would probably hear that, too.

18
0:00:58.033,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:59.813,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Like any other kid, I learned what a family looked like.

20
0:01:03.508,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It was a man, a woman, plus a child or children.

21
0:01:07.18,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But I also learned it wasn't always that way.

22
0:01:09.76,000 --> 0:01:11,000
There were other combinations that worked just as well.

23
0:01:12.507,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There was this family of three who lived down the street.

24
0:01:15.263,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The lady of the house was called Lenie.

25
0:01:18.133,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Lenie had long black hair, often in a ponytail,

26
0:01:21.215,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and manicured nails.

27
0:01:23.196,000 --> 0:01:25,000
She always went out with a little makeup on

28
0:01:25.418,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and her signature red lipstick.

29
0:01:28.018,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Lenie's other half, I don't remember much about him

30
0:01:30.505,000 --> 0:01:32,000
except that he had a thing for white sleeveless shirts

31
0:01:33.092,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and gold chains around his neck.

32
0:01:36.109,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Their daughter was a couple years younger than me.

33
0:01:39.007,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, everybody in the village knew Lenie.

34
0:01:42.128,000 --> 0:01:44,000
She owned and ran what was the most popular beauty salon

35
0:01:45.038,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in our side of town.

36
0:01:46.758,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Every time their family would walk down the roads,

37
0:01:49.164,000 --> 0:01:51,000
they would always be greeted with smiles

38
0:01:51.607,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and occasionally stopped for a little chitchat.

39
0:01:56.677,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, the interesting thing about Lenie

40
0:01:58.696,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is that she also happened to be a transgender woman.

41
0:02:03.488,000 --> 0:02:07,000
She exemplified one of the Philippines' long-standing stories

42
0:02:07.972,000 --> 0:02:08,000
about gender diversity.

43
0:02:10.65,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Lenie was proof that oftentimes we think of something as strange

44
0:02:16.229,000 --> 0:02:18,000
only because we're not familiar with it,

45
0:02:18.489,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or we haven't taken enough time to try and understand.

46
0:02:23.541,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In most cultures around the world,

47
0:02:26.351,000 --> 0:02:29,000
gender is this man-woman dichotomy.

48
0:02:29.423,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's this immovable, nonnegotiable, distinct classes of individuals.

49
0:02:35.475,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We assign characteristics and expectations

50
0:02:38.079,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the moment a person's biological sex is determined.

51
0:02:42.671,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But not all cultures are like that.

52
0:02:45.25,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Not all cultures are as rigid.

53
0:02:47.727,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Many cultures don't look at genitalia primarily

54
0:02:50.581,000 --> 0:02:52,000
as basis for gender construction,

55
0:02:52.814,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and some communities in North America, Africa, the Indian subcontinent

56
0:02:58.599,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and the Pacific Islands, including the Philippines,

57
0:03:01.823,000 --> 0:03:04,000
have a long history of cultural permissiveness

58
0:03:05.061,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and accommodation of gender variances.

59
0:03:08.307,000 --> 0:03:09,000
As you may know,

60
0:03:09.52,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the people of the Philippines were under Spanish rule for over 300 years.

61
0:03:14.405,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That's from 1565 to 1898.

62
0:03:17.787,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This explains why everyday Filipino conversations

63
0:03:20.417,000 --> 0:03:22,000
are peppered with Spanish words

64
0:03:22.631,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and why so many of our last names, including mine, sound very Spanish.

65
0:03:28.667,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This also explains the firmly entrenched influence of Catholicism.

66
0:03:34.026,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But precolonial Philippine societies,

67
0:03:36.99,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they were mostly animists.

68
0:03:39.818,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They believed all things had a distinct spiritual essence:

69
0:03:45.016,000 --> 0:03:49,000
plants, animals, rocks, rivers, places.

70
0:03:50.635,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Power resided in the spirit.

71
0:03:53.235,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Whoever was able to harness that spiritual power was highly revered.

72
0:03:59.223,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, scholars who have studied the Spanish colonial archives

73
0:04:02.959,000 --> 0:04:06,000
also tell us that these early societies were largely egalitarian.

74
0:04:08.181,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Men did not necessarily have an advantage over women.

75
0:04:12.001,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Wives were treated as companions, not slaves.

76
0:04:15.908,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And family contracts were not done without their presence and approval.

77
0:04:20.29,000 --> 0:04:22,000
In some ways, women had the upper hand.

78
0:04:23.8,000 --> 0:04:27,000
A woman could divorce her husband and own property under her own name,

79
0:04:28.412,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which she kept even after marriage.

80
0:04:30.979,000 --> 0:04:32,000
She had the prerogative to have a baby or not

81
0:04:33.975,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and then decide the baby's name.

82
0:04:36.76,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But the real key to the power of the precolonial Filipino woman

83
0:04:41.344,000 --> 0:04:43,000
was in her role as "babaylan,"

84
0:04:45.236,000 --> 0:04:49,000
a collective term for shamans of various ethnic groups.

85
0:04:49.681,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They were the community healers,

86
0:04:52.094,000 --> 0:04:55,000
specialists in herbal and divine lore.

87
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They delivered babies

88
0:04:57.472,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and communicated with the spirit world.

89
0:05:00.677,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They performed exorcisms

90
0:05:03.489,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and occasionally, and in defense of their community,

91
0:05:07.767,000 --> 0:05:08,000
they kicked some ass.

92
0:05:09.522,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:11.708,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And while the babaylan was a female role,

94
0:05:14.602,000 --> 0:05:17,000
there were also, in fact, male practitioners in the spiritual realm.

95
0:05:18.927,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Reports from early Spanish chroniclers contain several references

96
0:05:23.332,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to male shamans who did not conform to normative Western masculine standards.

97
0:05:29.068,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They cross-dressed

98
0:05:30.85,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and appeared effeminate

99
0:05:33.06,000 --> 0:05:34,000
or sexually ambiguous.

100
0:05:35.146,000 --> 0:05:37,000
A Jesuit missionary named Francisco Alcina

101
0:05:37.622,000 --> 0:05:39,000
said that one man he believed to be a shaman

102
0:05:40.635,000 --> 0:05:41,000
was "so effeminate

103
0:05:42.794,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that in every way he was more a woman than a man.

104
0:05:47.414,000 --> 0:05:48,000
All the things the women did

105
0:05:49.945,000 --> 0:05:5,000
he performed,

106
0:05:51.507,000 --> 0:05:52,000
such as weaving blankets,

107
0:05:53.345,000 --> 0:05:55,000
sewing clothes and making pots.

108
0:05:57.029,000 --> 0:05:59,000
He danced also like they did,

109
0:06:00.471,000 --> 0:06:01,000
never like a man,

110
0:06:02.365,000 --> 0:06:03,000
whose dance is different.

111
0:06:04.909,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In all, he appeared more a woman than a man."

112
0:06:10.23,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Well, any other juicy details in the colonial archives?

113
0:06:16.09,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Thought you'd never ask.

114
0:06:17.392,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:19.72,000 --> 0:06:21,000
As you may have deduced by now,

116
0:06:21.768,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the manner in which these precolonial societies conducted themselves

117
0:06:25.155,000 --> 0:06:26,000
didn't go over so well.

118
0:06:27.294,000 --> 0:06:29,000
All the free-loving, gender-variant-permitting,

119
0:06:30.13,000 --> 0:06:32,000
gender equality wokeness

120
0:06:32.219,000 --> 0:06:36,000
clashed viciously with the European sensibilities at the time,

121
0:06:36.355,000 --> 0:06:4,000
so much so that the Spanish missionaries spent the next 300 years

122
0:06:41.016,000 --> 0:06:43,000
trying to enforce their two-sex, two-gender model.

123
0:06:44.777,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Many Spanish friars also thought that the cross-dressing babaylan

124
0:06:49.275,000 --> 0:06:52,000
were either celibates like themselves

125
0:06:53.086,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or had deficient or malformed genitals.

126
0:06:56.185,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But this was pure speculation.

127
0:06:58.959,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Documents compiled between 1679 and 1685, called "The Bolinao Manuscript,"

128
0:07:04.692,000 --> 0:07:06,000
mentions male shamans marrying women.

129
0:07:08.431,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The Boxer Codex, circa 1590,

130
0:07:11.925,000 --> 0:07:14,000
provide clues on the nature of the male babaylan sexuality.

131
0:07:16.584,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It says, "Ordinarily they dress as women,

132
0:07:21.781,000 --> 0:07:23,000
act like prudes

133
0:07:23.805,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and are so effeminate

134
0:07:25.685,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that one who does know them would believe they are women.

135
0:07:29.593,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Almost all are impotent for the reproductive act,

136
0:07:33.472,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and thus they marry other males and sleep with them as man and wife

137
0:07:39.468,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and have carnal knowledge."

138
0:07:42.2,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Carnal knowledge, of course, meaning sex.

139
0:07:47.662,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, there's an ongoing debate in contemporary society

140
0:07:50.272,000 --> 0:07:53,000
about what constitutes gender and how it should be defined.

141
0:07:53.53,000 --> 0:07:54,000
My country is no exception.

142
0:07:55.852,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Some countries like Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Nepal and Canada

143
0:08:00.614,000 --> 0:08:03,000
have begun introducing nonbinary options in their legal documents,

144
0:08:04.514,000 --> 0:08:06,000
such as their passports and their permanent resident cards.

145
0:08:08.064,000 --> 0:08:1,000
In all these discussions about gender,

146
0:08:10.571,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I think it's important to keep in mind

147
0:08:12.447,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that the prevailing notions of man and woman as static genders

148
0:08:16.946,000 --> 0:08:18,000
anchored strictly on biological sex

149
0:08:19.911,000 --> 0:08:2,000
are social constructs.

150
0:08:22.126,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In my people's case, this social construct is an imposition.

151
0:08:28.266,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It was hammered into their heads over hundreds of years

152
0:08:33.003,000 --> 0:08:37,000
until they were convinced that their way of thinking was erroneous.

153
0:08:38.836,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But the good thing about social constructs

154
0:08:42.105,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is they can be reconstructed

155
0:08:44.571,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to fit a time and age.

156
0:08:47.646,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They can be reconstructed

157
0:08:49.065,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to respond to communities that are becoming more diverse.

158
0:08:53.356,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And they can be reconstructed

159
0:08:55.577,000 --> 0:08:57,000
for a world that's starting to realize

160
0:08:58.278,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we have so much to gain from learning and working through our differences.

161
0:09:04.269,000 --> 0:09:05,000
When I think about this subject,

162
0:09:06.7,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I think about the Filipino people

163
0:09:08.573,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and an almost forgotten but important legacy

164
0:09:12.166,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of gender equality and inclusivity.

165
0:09:15.221,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I think about lovers who were some of the gentlest souls I had known

166
0:09:21.336,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but could not be fully open.

167
0:09:23.584,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I think about people who have made an impact in my life,

168
0:09:28.127,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who showed me that integrity, kindness and strength of character

169
0:09:32.689,000 --> 0:09:33,000
are far better measures of judgment,

170
0:09:35.804,000 --> 0:09:37,000
far better than things that are beyond a person's control

171
0:09:38.612,000 --> 0:09:41,000
such as their skin color, their age

172
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
or their gender.

173
0:09:44.87,000 --> 0:09:47,000
As I stand here today, on the shoulders of people like Lenie,

174
0:09:49.801,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I feel incredibly grateful for all who have come before me,

175
0:09:54.501,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the ones courageous enough to put themselves out there,

176
0:09:59.759,000 --> 0:10:01,000
who lived a life that was theirs

177
0:10:02.592,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and in the process, made it a little easier for us to live our lives now.

178
0:10:07.685,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Because being yourself is revolutionary.

179
0:10:12.372,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And to anyone reeling from forces trying to knock you down

180
0:10:16.96,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and cram you into these neat little boxes people have decided for you:

181
0:10:22.289,000 --> 0:10:23,000
don't break.

182
0:10:24.143,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I see you.

183
0:10:26.041,000 --> 0:10:27,000
My ancestors see you.

184
0:10:28.38,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Their blood runs through me as they run through so many of us.

185
0:10:33.957,000 --> 0:10:37,000
You are valid, and you deserve rights and recognition

186
0:10:40.745,000 --> 0:10:41,000
just like everyone else.

187
0:10:44.081,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Thank you.

188
0:10:45.273,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

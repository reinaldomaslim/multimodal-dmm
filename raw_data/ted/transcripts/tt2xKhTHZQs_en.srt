1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So the first antidepressants were made from, of all things,

2
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:19,000
rocket fuel, left over after World War II.

3
0:00:20.96,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Which is fitting, seeing as today, one in five soldiers develop depression,

4
0:00:25.92,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or post-traumatic stress disorder or both.

5
0:00:29.08,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But it's not just soldiers that are at high risk for these diseases.

6
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's firefighters, ER doctors, cancer patients, aid workers, refugees --

7
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:4,000
anyone exposed to trauma or major life stress.

8
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And yet, despite how commonplace these disorders are,

9
0:00:45.88,000 --> 0:00:48,000
our current treatments, if they work at all,

10
0:00:49.52,000 --> 0:00:51,000
only suppress symptoms.

11
0:00:53.24,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In 1798, when Edward Jenner discovered the first vaccine --

12
0:00:57.72,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it happened to be for smallpox --

13
0:00:59.44,000 --> 0:01:02,000
he didn't just discover a prophylactic for a disease,

14
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but a whole new way of thinking:

15
0:01:05.28,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that medicine could prevent disease.

16
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
However, for over 200 years,

17
0:01:10.12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
this prevention was not believed to extend to psychiatric diseases.

18
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Until 2014, when my colleague and I accidentally discovered

19
0:01:18.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the first drugs that might prevent depression and PTSD.

20
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We discovered the drugs in mice,

21
0:01:24.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and we're currently studying whether they work in humans.

22
0:01:28.04,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And these preventative psychopharmaceuticals

23
0:01:30.96,000 --> 0:01:31,000
are not antidepressants.

24
0:01:32.8,000 --> 0:01:34,000
They are a whole new class of drug.

25
0:01:34.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And they work by increasing stress resilience,

26
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
so let's call them resilience enhancers.

27
0:01:39.68,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So think back to a stressful time that you've since recovered from.

28
0:01:43.52,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Maybe a breakup or an exam, you missed a flight.

29
0:01:47.64,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Stress resilience is the active biological process

30
0:01:51.08,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that allows us to bounce back after stress.

31
0:01:54.04,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Similar to if you have a cold and your immune system fights it off.

32
0:01:57.52,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And insufficient resilience

33
0:01:59.36,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in the face of a significant enough stressor,

34
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
can result in a psychiatric disorder, such as depression.

35
0:02:04.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In fact, most cases of major depressive disorder

36
0:02:07.6,000 --> 0:02:09,000
are initially triggered by stress.

37
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And from what we've seen so far in mice,

38
0:02:12.88,000 --> 0:02:16,000
resilience enhancers can protect against purely biological stressors,

39
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:18,000
like stress hormones,

40
0:02:18.76,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and social and psychological stressors, like bullying and isolation.

41
0:02:23.56,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So here is an example where we gave mice

42
0:02:27.72,000 --> 0:02:29,000
three weeks of high levels of stress hormones.

43
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So, in other words, a biological stressor without a psychological component.

44
0:02:34.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And this causes depressive behavior.

45
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And if we give three weeks of antidepressant treatment beforehand,

46
0:02:41.52,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it has no beneficial effects.

47
0:02:43.76,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But a single dose of a resilience enhancer given a week before

48
0:02:49.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
completely prevents the depressive behavior.

49
0:02:53.64,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Even after three weeks of stress.

50
0:02:55.92,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is the first time a drug has ever been shown

51
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to prevent the negative effects of stress.

52
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Depression and PTSD are chronic, often lifelong, clinical diseases.

53
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They also increase the risk of substance abuse, homelessness,

54
0:03:11.76,000 --> 0:03:14,000
heart disease, Alzheimer's, suicide.

55
0:03:15.44,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The global cost of depression alone is over three trillion dollars per year.

56
0:03:20.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But now, imagine a scenario where we know someone is predictively

57
0:03:24.72,000 --> 0:03:27,000
at high risk for exposure to extreme stress.

58
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Say, a red cross volunteer going into an earthquake zone.

59
0:03:31.76,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In addition to the typhoid vaccine,

60
0:03:33.76,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we could give her a pill or an injection of a resilience enhancer

61
0:03:37.28,000 --> 0:03:38,000
before she leaves.

62
0:03:38.96,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So when she is held at gunpoint by looters or worse,

63
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
she would at least be protected against developing depression or PTSD

64
0:03:46.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
after the fact.

65
0:03:47.84,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It won't prevent her from experiencing the stress,

66
0:03:50.68,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but it will allow her to recover from it.

67
0:03:53.28,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And that's what's revolutionary here.

68
0:03:55.44,000 --> 0:03:56,000
By increasing resiliency,

69
0:03:57.44,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we can dramatically reduce her susceptibility to depression and PTSD,

70
0:04:02.4,000 --> 0:04:07,000
possibly saving her from losing her job, her home, her family or even her life.

71
0:04:09.64,000 --> 0:04:11,000
After Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine,

72
0:04:12.4,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a lot of other vaccines rapidly followed.

73
0:04:15.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But it was over 150 years

74
0:04:17.76,000 --> 0:04:19,000
before a tuberculosis vaccine was widely available.

75
0:04:21.2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Why?

76
0:04:23.04,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In part because society believed

77
0:04:25.12,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that tuberculosis made people more sensitive and creative and empathetic.

78
0:04:30.64,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And that it was caused by constitution and not biology.

79
0:04:34.56,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And similar things are still said today about depression.

80
0:04:39.44,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And just as Jenner's discovery opened the door

81
0:04:42.52,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for all of the vaccines that followed after,

82
0:04:45.8,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the drugs we've discovered open the possibility of a whole new field:

83
0:04:49.4,000 --> 0:04:51,000
preventative psychopharmacology.

84
0:04:52.8,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But whether that's 15 years away,

85
0:04:55.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
or 150 years away,

86
0:04:57.44,000 --> 0:04:59,000
depends not just on the science,

87
0:04:59.48,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but on what we as a society choose to do with it.

88
0:05:03.32,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Thank you.

89
0:05:04.56,000 --> 0:05:07,000

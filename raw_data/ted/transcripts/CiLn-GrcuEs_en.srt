1
0:00:12.585,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So last year, I ran for mayor of my hometown, Tulsa, Oklahoma.

2
0:00:17.009,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And I was the underdog.

3
0:00:18.712,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I was running against a two-term incumbent,

4
0:00:21.643,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and my opponent ran the classic partisan playbook.

5
0:00:25.436,000 --> 0:00:27,000
He publicized his endorsement of Donald Trump.

6
0:00:27.833,000 --> 0:00:29,000
He publicized a letter that he sent to President Obama

7
0:00:30.706,000 --> 0:00:31,000
protesting Syrian refugees,

8
0:00:32.374,000 --> 0:00:35,000
even though none of them were coming to Tulsa.

9
0:00:35.961,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.786,000 --> 0:00:41,000
He ran ads on TV that my kids thought made me look like Voldemort,

11
0:00:42.517,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and sent out little gems in the mail, like this.

12
0:00:48.212,000 --> 0:00:5,000
[America's most liberal labor union has endorsed]

13
0:00:50.596,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Never mind that "America's most liberal labor union,"

14
0:00:53.746,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as defined by this ad, was actually the Tulsa Firefighters Union,

15
0:00:58.283,000 --> 0:01:,000
hardly a famed bastion of liberalism.

16
0:01:01.005,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:02.6,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Never mind that while she was running for president

18
0:01:05.775,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and he was serving in his final year in that office,

19
0:01:08.444,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Hillary, Barack and I could just never find the time to get together

20
0:01:11.889,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and yuck it up about the Tulsa mayor's race.

21
0:01:14.278,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:17.763,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Never mind that I, like my opponent,

23
0:01:21.285,000 --> 0:01:22,000
am a Republican.

24
0:01:22.651,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:25.548,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And so when something like this hits you in a campaign,

26
0:01:30.961,000 --> 0:01:33,000
you have to decide how you're going to respond,

27
0:01:34.081,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and we had a novel idea.

28
0:01:36.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What if, instead of responding with partisanship,

29
0:01:41.127,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we responded with a focus on results?

30
0:01:43.937,000 --> 0:01:45,000
What if we ran a campaign

31
0:01:46.214,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that was not about running against someone,

32
0:01:50.231,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but was about bringing people together behind a common vision?

33
0:01:53.723,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so we decided to respond not with a negative ad

34
0:01:58.661,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but with something people find even sexier --

35
0:02:01.979,000 --> 0:02:02,000
data points.

36
0:02:03.178,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:05.186,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And so we emphasized things like increasing per capita income in our city,

38
0:02:10.859,000 --> 0:02:12,000
increasing our city's population,

39
0:02:13.851,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and we stuck to those relentlessly, throughout the campaign,

40
0:02:18.533,000 --> 0:02:2,000
always bringing it back to those things

41
0:02:20.939,000 --> 0:02:24,000
by which our voters could measure, in a very transparent way,

42
0:02:25.404,000 --> 0:02:26,000
how we were doing,

43
0:02:26.597,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and hold me accountable if I got elected.

44
0:02:28.931,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And a funny thing happened when we did that.

45
0:02:31.619,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Tulsa is home to one of the most vibrant

46
0:02:33.55,000 --> 0:02:35,000
young professional populations in the country,

47
0:02:35.931,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and they took notice of this approach.

48
0:02:39.142,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We have in our culture in our city,

49
0:02:41.682,000 --> 0:02:44,000
an ethos where our business leaders don't just run companies,

50
0:02:45.254,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they run philanthropic institutions and nonprofits,

51
0:02:49.621,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and those folks took notice.

52
0:02:51.73,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We have parents who are willing to sacrifice today

53
0:02:55.714,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so that their kids can have a better future,

54
0:02:57.937,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and those people took notice, too.

55
0:03:00.177,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And so on election day,

56
0:03:02.532,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I, G.T. Bynum,

57
0:03:04.453,000 --> 0:03:07,000
a guy whose name reminds people of a circus promoter ...

58
0:03:08.034,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:09.922,000 --> 0:03:13,000
a guy with the raw animal magnetism of a young Orville Redenbacher ...

60
0:03:14.907,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:17.733,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I won the election by 17 points.

62
0:03:21.693,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Applause)

63
0:03:26.375,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And we did it with the support of Republicans and Democrats.

64
0:03:31.13,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, why is that story and that approach so novel?

65
0:03:36.021,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Why do we always allow ourselves

66
0:03:38.01,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to fall back on philosophical disagreements

67
0:03:41.083,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that ultimately lead to division?

68
0:03:46.014,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I believe it is because politicians

69
0:03:48.554,000 --> 0:03:51,000
find it easier to throw the red meat out to the base

70
0:03:51.746,000 --> 0:03:52,000
than to innovate.

71
0:03:53.228,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The conventional wisdom is that to win an election,

72
0:03:55.903,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you have to dumb it down

73
0:03:57.349,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and play to your constituencies' basest, divisive instincts.

74
0:04:03.95,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And when somebody wins an election like that,

75
0:04:06.835,000 --> 0:04:08,000
they win, that's true,

76
0:04:09.676,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but the rest of us lose.

77
0:04:12.721,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And so what we need to do is think about how can we change that dynamic.

78
0:04:16.977,000 --> 0:04:19,000
How can we move in a direction

79
0:04:20.54,000 --> 0:04:22,000
where partisanship is replaced with policy?

80
0:04:23.502,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And fortunately, there's a growing bipartisan movement across this country

81
0:04:27.027,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that is doing just that.

82
0:04:29.557,000 --> 0:04:31,000
One of its heroes is a guy named Mitch Daniels.

83
0:04:32.654,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Mitch Daniels served as George W. Bush's budget director,

84
0:04:36.367,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and during that time,

85
0:04:37.669,000 --> 0:04:39,000
he created what was called the PART tool.

86
0:04:40.529,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The PART tool allowed people to evaluate a broad range of federal programs

87
0:04:46.181,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and apply numerical scoring for them

88
0:04:49.15,000 --> 0:04:52,000
on things like program management and project results.

89
0:04:52.563,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And using this, they evaluated over a thousand federal programs.

90
0:04:57.946,000 --> 0:05:,000
Over 150 programs had their funding reduced

91
0:05:01.439,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because they could not demonstrate success.

92
0:05:05.003,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But unfortunately, there wasn't ever a well-publicized increase in funding

93
0:05:09.218,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for those programs that did demonstrate success,

94
0:05:12.003,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and because of this, the program was never really popular with Congress,

95
0:05:15.789,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and was eventually shuttered.

96
0:05:17.416,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But the spirit of that program lived on.

97
0:05:20.091,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Mitch Daniels went home to Indiana,

98
0:05:22.377,000 --> 0:05:23,000
ran for governor, got elected,

99
0:05:24.1,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and applied the same premise to state programs,

100
0:05:27.902,000 --> 0:05:31,000
reducing funding for those programs that could not demonstrate success,

101
0:05:32.506,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but this time, he very publicly increased funding for those programs

102
0:05:37.84,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that could demonstrate success,

103
0:05:39.372,000 --> 0:05:42,000
things like increasing the number of state troopers

104
0:05:42.683,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that they needed to have,

105
0:05:43.911,000 --> 0:05:45,000
reducing wait times at the DMV --

106
0:05:46.333,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and today, Mitch Daniels is the president of Purdue University,

107
0:05:49.977,000 --> 0:05:51,000
applying yet again the same principles,

108
0:05:52.183,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this time at the higher ed level,

109
0:05:54.008,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and he's done that in order to keep tuition levels for students there flat

110
0:05:58.182,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for half a decade.

111
0:06:00.752,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now, while Mitch Daniels applied this at the federal level,

112
0:06:03.864,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the state level, and in higher ed,

113
0:06:05.681,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the guy that really cracked the code for cities

114
0:06:08.831,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is a Democrat, Martin O'Malley,

115
0:06:11.491,000 --> 0:06:12,000
during his time as Mayor of Baltimore.

116
0:06:14.079,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, when Mayor O'Malley took office,

117
0:06:15.914,000 --> 0:06:18,000
he was a big fan of what they'd been able to do in New York City

118
0:06:19.398,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when it came to fighting crime.

119
0:06:21.727,000 --> 0:06:24,000
When Rudy Giuliani first became Mayor of New York,

120
0:06:24.775,000 --> 0:06:29,000
crime statistics were collected on a monthly, even an annual basis,

121
0:06:29.87,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and then police resources would be allocated based on those statistics.

122
0:06:34.174,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Giuliani shrunk that time frame, so that crime statistics

123
0:06:37.857,000 --> 0:06:4,000
would be collected on a daily, even hourly basis,

124
0:06:41.373,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and then police resources would be allocated

125
0:06:44.698,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to those areas quickly where crimes were occurring today

126
0:06:48.652,000 --> 0:06:5,000
rather than where they were occurring last quarter.

127
0:06:52.7,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Well, O'Malley loved that approach, and he applied it in Baltimore.

128
0:06:55.939,000 --> 0:07:,000
And he applied it to the two areas that were most problematic for Baltimore

129
0:07:01.598,000 --> 0:07:02,000
from a crime-fighting standpoint.

130
0:07:03.241,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We call these the kidneys of death.

131
0:07:05.606,000 --> 0:07:06,000
[Baltimore homicides and shootings, 1999]

132
0:07:07.599,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So there they are, the kidneys.

133
0:07:09.808,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now watch this.

134
0:07:11.066,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Watch what happens when you apply data in real time

135
0:07:14.348,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and deploy resources quickly.

136
0:07:19.401,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In a decade, they reduced violent crime in Baltimore

137
0:07:21.942,000 --> 0:07:23,000
by almost 50 percent, using this approach,

138
0:07:24.545,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but the genius of what O'Malley did

139
0:07:27.109,000 --> 0:07:29,000
was not that he just did what some other city was doing.

140
0:07:29.999,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Lots of us mayors do that.

141
0:07:31.737,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:33.175,000 --> 0:07:37,000
He realized that the same approach could be used to all of the problems

143
0:07:37.636,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that his city faced.

144
0:07:39.132,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And so they applied it to issue after issue in Baltimore,

145
0:07:41.824,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and today, it's being used by mayors across the country

146
0:07:45.998,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to deal with some of our greatest challenges.

147
0:07:48.157,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the overall approach is a very simple one --

148
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
identify the goal that you want to achieve;

149
0:07:54.176,000 --> 0:07:57,000
identify a measurement by which you can track progress

150
0:07:57.552,000 --> 0:07:58,000
toward that goal;

151
0:07:59.045,000 --> 0:08:05,000
identify a way of testing that measurement cheaply and quickly;

152
0:08:05.252,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and then deploy whatever strategies you think would work,

153
0:08:09.689,000 --> 0:08:1,000
test them,

154
0:08:11.138,000 --> 0:08:14,000
reduce funding for the strategies that don't work,

155
0:08:14.178,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and put your money into those strategies that do.

156
0:08:17.474,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Today, Atlanta is using this to address housing issues

157
0:08:20.911,000 --> 0:08:21,000
for their homeless population.

158
0:08:22.689,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Philadelphia has used this to reduce their crime rates

159
0:08:25.626,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to levels not enjoyed since the 1960s.

160
0:08:28.634,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Louisville has used this not just for their city

161
0:08:32.034,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but in a community-wide effort bringing resources together

162
0:08:35.997,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to address vacant and abandoned properties.

163
0:08:39.275,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I am using this approach in Tulsa.

164
0:08:41.966,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I want Tulsa to be a world-class city,

165
0:08:45.141,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and we cannot do that if we aren't clear in what our goals are

166
0:08:49.411,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and we don't use evidence and evaluation to accomplish them.

167
0:08:54.937,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now, what's interesting, and we've found in implementing this,

168
0:08:58.033,000 --> 0:09:01,000
a lot of people, when you talk about data,

169
0:09:01.598,000 --> 0:09:04,000
people think of that as a contrast to creativity.

170
0:09:05.337,000 --> 0:09:07,000
What we've found is actually quite the opposite.

171
0:09:07.646,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We've found it to be an engine for creative problem-solving,

172
0:09:10.71,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because when you're focused on a goal,

173
0:09:14.044,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and you can test different strategies quickly,

174
0:09:16.878,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the sky's the limit on the different things that you can test out.

175
0:09:20.267,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You can come up with any strategy that you can come up with

176
0:09:23.362,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and utilize and try and test it

177
0:09:25.268,000 --> 0:09:28,000
until you find something that works, and then you double down on that.

178
0:09:28.578,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The other area that we've found that it lends itself to creativity

179
0:09:32.735,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is that it breaks down those old silos of ownership

180
0:09:35.996,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that we run into so often in government.

181
0:09:38.998,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It allows you to draw all the stakeholders in your community

182
0:09:42.682,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that care about homelessness or crime-fighting or education

183
0:09:47.638,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or vacant and abandoned properties,

184
0:09:50.29,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and bring those people to the table

185
0:09:52.363,000 --> 0:09:56,000
so you can work together to address your common goal.

186
0:09:56.657,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Now, in Tulsa, we're applying this

187
0:09:58.339,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to things that are common city initiatives,

188
0:10:02.219,000 --> 0:10:04,000
things like, as you've heard now repeatedly,

189
0:10:04.497,000 --> 0:10:06,000
public safety -- that's an obvious one;

190
0:10:07.037,000 --> 0:10:09,000
improving our employee morale at the city --

191
0:10:09.736,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we don't think you could do good things unless you've got happy employees;

192
0:10:14.27,000 --> 0:10:18,000
improving the overall street quality throughout our community.

193
0:10:18.533,000 --> 0:10:22,000
But we're also applying it to things that are not so traditional

194
0:10:22.787,000 --> 0:10:24,000
when you think about what cities are responsible for,

195
0:10:25.597,000 --> 0:10:27,000
things like increasing per capita income,

196
0:10:28.039,000 --> 0:10:29,000
increasing our population,

197
0:10:29.914,000 --> 0:10:31,000
improving our high school graduation rates,

198
0:10:32.52,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and perhaps the greatest challenge that we face as a city.

199
0:10:38.937,000 --> 0:10:39,000
At the dawn of the 1920s,

200
0:10:40.827,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Tulsa was home to the most vibrant African American community in the country.

201
0:10:44.549,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The Greenwood section of our city was known as Black Wall Street.

202
0:10:49.842,000 --> 0:10:51,000
In 1921, in one night,

203
0:10:52.502,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Tulsa experienced the worst race riot in American history.

204
0:10:56.755,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Black Wall Street was burned to the ground,

205
0:11:00.185,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and today, a child that is born

206
0:11:02.748,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in the most predominantly African American part of our city

207
0:11:05.622,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is expected to live 11 years less than a kid that's born elsewhere in Tulsa.

208
0:11:11.555,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now, for us, this is a unifying issue.

209
0:11:15.74,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Four years from now, we will recognize

210
0:11:18.421,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the 100th commemoration of that awful event,

211
0:11:22.699,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and in Tulsa, we are bringing every tool that we can

212
0:11:27.045,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to address that life-expectancy disparity,

213
0:11:29.676,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and we're not checking party registration cards

214
0:11:32.058,000 --> 0:11:33,000
at the door to the meetings.

215
0:11:34.4,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We don't care who you voted for for president

216
0:11:36.79,000 --> 0:11:38,000
if you want to help restore the decade of life

217
0:11:39.488,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that's being stolen from these kids right now.

218
0:11:42.583,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And so we've got white folks and black folks,

219
0:11:46.011,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Hispanic folks and Native American folks,

220
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we've got members of Congress, members of the city council,

221
0:11:51.196,000 --> 0:11:52,000
business leaders, religious leaders,

222
0:11:52.945,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Trump people and Hillary people,

223
0:11:55.245,000 --> 0:11:57,000
all joined by one common belief,

224
0:11:58.214,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and that is that a kid should have an equal shot at a good life in our city,

225
0:12:02.277,000 --> 0:12:05,000
regardless of what part of town they happen to be born in.

226
0:12:07.129,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Now, how do we go forward with that?

227
0:12:10.328,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Is that easy to accomplish?

228
0:12:12.432,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Of course not!

229
0:12:14.19,000 --> 0:12:15,000
If it were easy to accomplish,

230
0:12:16.059,000 --> 0:12:18,000
somebody would have already done it before us.

231
0:12:19.013,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But what I love about city government

232
0:12:21.225,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is that the citizens can create

233
0:12:23.314,000 --> 0:12:25,000
whatever kind of city they're willing to build,

234
0:12:25.83,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and in Tulsa, we have decided to build a city

235
0:12:29.291,000 --> 0:12:34,000
where Republicans and Democrats use evidence, data and evaluation

236
0:12:34.633,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to solve our greatest challenges together.

237
0:12:38.944,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And if we can do this,

238
0:12:40.245,000 --> 0:12:42,000
if we can set partisanship aside

239
0:12:42.919,000 --> 0:12:46,000
in the only state in the whole country where Barack Obama never carried

240
0:12:47.416,000 --> 0:12:48,000
a single county,

241
0:12:49.17,000 --> 0:12:5,000
then you can do it in your town, too.

242
0:12:51.107,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

243
0:12:53.234,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Your cities can be saved or squandered

244
0:12:56.496,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in one generation.

245
0:12:59.036,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So let's agree to set aside our philosophical disagreements

246
0:13:05.084,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and focus on those aspirations that unite us.

247
0:13:09.001,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Let's grasp the opportunity that is presented by innovation

248
0:13:13.145,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to build better communities for our neighbors.

249
0:13:16.441,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Let's replace a focus on partisan division

250
0:13:20.378,000 --> 0:13:22,000
with a focus on results.

251
0:13:23.152,000 --> 0:13:26,000
That is the path to a better future for us all.

252
0:13:27.325,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Thank you for your time.

253
0:13:28.5,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Applause)

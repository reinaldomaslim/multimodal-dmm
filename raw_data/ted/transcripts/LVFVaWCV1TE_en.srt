2
0:00:15.302,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was one of the only kids in college who had a reason

3
0:00:18.051,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to go to the P.O. box at the end of the day,

4
0:00:20.616,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and that was mainly because my mother has never believed

5
0:00:22.968,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in email, in Facebook, in texting or cell phones in general.

6
0:00:26.645,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And so while other kids were BBM-ing their parents,

7
0:00:29.2,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I was literally waiting by the mailbox

8
0:00:32.341,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to get a letter from home to see how the weekend had gone,

9
0:00:35.029,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which was a little frustrating when Grandma was in the hospital,

10
0:00:37.417,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but I was just looking for some sort of scribble,

11
0:00:41.762,000 --> 0:00:43,000
some unkempt cursive from my mother.

12
0:00:44.393,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And so when I moved to New York City after college

13
0:00:46.798,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and got completely sucker-punched in the face by depression,

14
0:00:49.758,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I did the only thing I could think of at the time.

15
0:00:52.51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I wrote those same kinds of letters that my mother had written me

16
0:00:55.522,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for strangers, and tucked them all throughout the city,

17
0:00:58.935,000 --> 0:01:,000
dozens and dozens of them. I left them everywhere,

18
0:01:01.778,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in cafes and in libraries, at the U.N., everywhere.

19
0:01:05.98,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I blogged about those letters and the days

20
0:01:08.035,000 --> 0:01:09,000
when they were necessary, and I posed

21
0:01:10.009,000 --> 0:01:12,000
a kind of crazy promise to the Internet:

22
0:01:12.672,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that if you asked me for a hand-written letter,

23
0:01:15.058,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I would write you one, no questions asked.

24
0:01:18.379,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Overnight, my inbox morphed into this harbor of heartbreak --

25
0:01:22.455,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a single mother in Sacramento, a girl being bullied

26
0:01:25.146,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in rural Kansas, all asking me, a 22-year-old girl

27
0:01:29.066,000 --> 0:01:31,000
who barely even knew her own coffee order,

28
0:01:31.712,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to write them a love letter and give them a reason

29
0:01:34.258,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to wait by the mailbox.

30
0:01:36.587,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Well, today I fuel a global organization

31
0:01:39.411,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that is fueled by those trips to the mailbox,

32
0:01:42.087,000 --> 0:01:44,000
fueled by the ways in which we can harness social media

33
0:01:44.717,000 --> 0:01:47,000
like never before to write and mail strangers letters

34
0:01:48.207,000 --> 0:01:5,000
when they need them most, but most of all,

35
0:01:51.064,000 --> 0:01:54,000
fueled by crates of mail like this one, my trusty mail crate,

36
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:58,000
filled with the scriptings of ordinary people,

37
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:,000
strangers writing letters to other strangers not because

38
0:02:01.301,000 --> 0:02:03,000
they're ever going to meet and laugh over a cup of coffee,

39
0:02:04.092,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but because they have found one another by way of letter-writing.

40
0:02:07.704,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But, you know, the thing that always gets me

41
0:02:09.218,000 --> 0:02:12,000
about these letters is that most of them have been written

42
0:02:12.754,000 --> 0:02:16,000
by people that have never known themselves loved on a piece of paper.

43
0:02:17.458,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters.

44
0:02:21.163,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They're the ones from my generation,

45
0:02:23.032,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the ones of us that have grown up into a world

46
0:02:25.898,000 --> 0:02:28,000
where everything is paperless, and where some

47
0:02:28.981,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of our best conversations have happened upon a screen.

48
0:02:32.043,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We have learned to diary our pain onto Facebook,

49
0:02:34.401,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we speak swiftly in 140 characters or less.

50
0:02:38.691,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But what if it's not about efficiency this time?

51
0:02:41.363,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I was on the subway yesterday with this mail crate,

52
0:02:44.192,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which is a conversation starter, let me tell you.

53
0:02:46.598,000 --> 0:02:48,000
If you ever need one, just carry one of these. (Laughter)

54
0:02:48.907,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And a man just stared at me, and he was like,

55
0:02:51.74,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"Well, why don't you use the Internet?"

56
0:02:54.229,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And I thought, "Well, sir, I am not a strategist,

57
0:02:57.702,000 --> 0:03:,000
nor am I specialist. I am merely a storyteller."

58
0:03:01.468,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And so I could tell you about a woman

59
0:03:04.149,000 --> 0:03:06,000
whose husband has just come home from Afghanistan,

60
0:03:07.059,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and she is having a hard time unearthing this thing called conversation,

61
0:03:10.605,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and so she tucks love letters throughout the house

62
0:03:13.065,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as a way to say, "Come back to me.

63
0:03:15.193,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Find me when you can."

64
0:03:16.751,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Or a girl who decides that she is going to leave love letters

65
0:03:19.673,000 --> 0:03:22,000
around her campus in Dubuque, Iowa, only to find

66
0:03:22.932,000 --> 0:03:25,000
her efforts ripple-effected the next day when she walks out

67
0:03:25.985,000 --> 0:03:27,000
onto the quad and finds love letters hanging

68
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:32,000
from the trees, tucked in the bushes and the benches.

69
0:03:32.233,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Or the man who decides that he is going to take his life,

70
0:03:35.266,000 --> 0:03:38,000
uses Facebook as a way to say goodbye

71
0:03:38.405,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to friends and family.

72
0:03:39.758,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, tonight he sleeps safely with a stack of letters

73
0:03:42.328,000 --> 0:03:45,000
just like this one tucked beneath his pillow,

74
0:03:45.545,000 --> 0:03:48,000
scripted by strangers who were there for him when.

75
0:03:48.864,000 --> 0:03:5,000
These are the kinds of stories that convinced me

76
0:03:51.229,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that letter-writing will never again need to flip back her hair

77
0:03:54.075,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and talk about efficiency, because she is an art form now,

78
0:03:57.68,000 --> 0:04:,000
all the parts of her, the signing, the scripting, the mailing,

79
0:04:01.073,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the doodles in the margins.

80
0:04:03.611,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The mere fact that somebody would even just sit down,

81
0:04:06.745,000 --> 0:04:07,000
pull out a piece of paper and think about someone

82
0:04:08.412,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the whole way through, with an intention that is so much

83
0:04:11.058,000 --> 0:04:14,000
harder to unearth when the browser is up and the iPhone

84
0:04:14.288,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is pinging and we've got six conversations rolling in at once,

85
0:04:17.815,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that is an art form

86
0:04:19.25,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that does not fall down to the Goliath of "get faster,"

87
0:04:22.425,000 --> 0:04:24,000
no matter how many social networks we might join.

88
0:04:25.297,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We still clutch close these letters to our chest,

89
0:04:28.142,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to the words that speak louder than loud,

90
0:04:30.776,000 --> 0:04:32,000
when we turn pages into palettes to say the things

91
0:04:33.133,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that we have needed to say,

92
0:04:34.699,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the words that we have needed to write, to sisters

93
0:04:37.387,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and brothers and even to strangers, for far too long.

94
0:04:40.909,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Thank you. (Applause)

95
0:04:44.475,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Applause)

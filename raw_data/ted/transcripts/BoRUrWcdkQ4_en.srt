2
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So my freshman year of college

3
0:00:17.204,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I signed up for an internship in the housing unit

4
0:00:19.954,000 --> 0:00:21,000
at Greater Boston Legal Services.

5
0:00:22.154,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Showed up the first day

6
0:00:23.807,000 --> 0:00:25,000
ready to make coffee and photocopies,

7
0:00:26.123,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but was paired with this righteous, deeply inspired attorney

8
0:00:30.705,000 --> 0:00:31,000
named Jeff Purcell,

9
0:00:32.174,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who thrust me onto the front lines

10
0:00:34.639,000 --> 0:00:36,000
from the very first day.

11
0:00:36.639,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And over the course of nine months

12
0:00:38.404,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I had the chance

13
0:00:39.417,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to have dozens of conversations

14
0:00:41.189,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with low-income families in Boston

15
0:00:43.973,000 --> 0:00:46,000
who would come in presenting with housing issues,

16
0:00:47.089,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but always had an underlying health issue.

17
0:00:50.373,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I had a client who came in,

18
0:00:52.605,000 --> 0:00:54,000
about to be evicted because he hasn't paid his rent.

19
0:00:54.923,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But he hasn't paid his rent, of course,

20
0:00:57.211,000 --> 0:00:59,000
because he's paying for his HIV medication

21
0:00:59.705,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and just can't afford both.

22
0:01:01.905,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We had moms who would come in,

23
0:01:03.256,000 --> 0:01:04,000
daughter has asthma,

24
0:01:04.639,000 --> 0:01:06,000
wakes up covered in cockroaches every morning.

25
0:01:07.524,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And one of our litigation strategies

26
0:01:09.497,000 --> 0:01:11,000
was actually to send me into the home of these clients

27
0:01:12.272,000 --> 0:01:14,000
with these large glass bottles.

28
0:01:14.405,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I would collect the cockroaches,

29
0:01:16.405,000 --> 0:01:19,000
hot glue-gun them to this poster board

30
0:01:19.423,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that we'd bring to court for our cases.

31
0:01:21.455,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And we always won

32
0:01:22.733,000 --> 0:01:24,000
because the judges were just so grossed out.

33
0:01:25.455,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Far more effective, I have to say,

34
0:01:27.604,000 --> 0:01:29,000
than anything I later learned in law school.

35
0:01:30.455,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But over the course of these nine months,

36
0:01:33.005,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I grew frustrated with feeling

37
0:01:34.856,000 --> 0:01:36,000
like we were intervening too far downstream

38
0:01:37.822,000 --> 0:01:39,000
in the lives of our clients --

39
0:01:40.339,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that by the time they came to us,

40
0:01:41.871,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they were already in crisis.

41
0:01:44.039,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And at the end of my freshman year of college,

42
0:01:46.855,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I read an article about the work

43
0:01:48.539,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that Dr. Barry Zuckerman was doing

44
0:01:50.321,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as Chair of Pediatrics

45
0:01:52.457,000 --> 0:01:53,000
at Boston Medical Center.

46
0:01:53.857,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And his first hire was a legal services attorney

47
0:01:56.924,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to represent the patients.

48
0:01:58.806,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So I called Barry,

49
0:02:00.321,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and with his blessing, in October 1995

50
0:02:02.924,000 --> 0:02:04,000
walked into the waiting room

51
0:02:04.989,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of the pediatrics clinic at Boston Medical Center.

52
0:02:07.855,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'll never forget,

53
0:02:09.188,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the TVs played this endless reel of cartoons.

54
0:02:12.072,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And the exhaustion of mothers

55
0:02:15.006,000 --> 0:02:18,000
who had taken two, three, sometimes four buses

56
0:02:18.538,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to bring their child to the doctor

57
0:02:20.47,000 --> 0:02:21,000
was just palpable.

58
0:02:22.354,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The doctors, it seemed,

59
0:02:23.602,000 --> 0:02:24,000
never really had enough time for all the patients,

60
0:02:25.121,000 --> 0:02:26,000
try as they might.

61
0:02:26.371,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And over the course of six months,

62
0:02:27.589,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I would corner them in the hallway

63
0:02:29.27,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and ask them a sort of naive but fundamental question:

64
0:02:33.171,000 --> 0:02:35,000
"If you had unlimited resources,

65
0:02:35.656,000 --> 0:02:38,000
what's the one thing you would give your patients?"

66
0:02:38.971,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And I heard the same story again and again,

67
0:02:41.671,000 --> 0:02:43,000
a story we've heard hundreds of times since then.

68
0:02:44.621,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They said, "Every day we have patients that come into the clinic --

69
0:02:48.186,000 --> 0:02:49,000
child has an ear infection,

70
0:02:49.887,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I prescribe antibiotics.

71
0:02:51.82,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But the real issue is there's no food at home.

72
0:02:54.653,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The real issue

73
0:02:56.154,000 --> 0:02:58,000
is that child is living with 12 other people

74
0:02:58.388,000 --> 0:02:59,000
in a two-bedroom apartment.

75
0:02:59.886,000 --> 0:03:,000
And I don't even ask about those issues

76
0:03:01.736,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because there's nothing I can do.

77
0:03:04.487,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I have 13 minutes with each patient.

78
0:03:06.325,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Patients are piling up in the clinic waiting room.

79
0:03:08.894,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I have no idea where the nearest food pantry is.

80
0:03:11.579,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I don't even have any help."

81
0:03:13.927,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In that clinic, even today,

82
0:03:15.127,000 --> 0:03:16,000
there are two social workers

83
0:03:16.813,000 --> 0:03:18,000
for 24,000 pediatric patients,

84
0:03:19.544,000 --> 0:03:21,000
which is better than a lot of the clinics out there.

85
0:03:22.396,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So Health Leads was born of these conversations --

86
0:03:25.427,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a simple model

87
0:03:26.611,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where doctors and nurses

88
0:03:28.126,000 --> 0:03:3,000
can prescribe nutritious food,

89
0:03:30.344,000 --> 0:03:31,000
heat in the winter

90
0:03:31.646,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and other basic resources for their patients

91
0:03:34.228,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the same way they prescribe medication.

92
0:03:36.779,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Patients then take their prescriptions

93
0:03:38.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to our desk in the clinic waiting room

94
0:03:41.227,000 --> 0:03:44,000
where we have a core of well-trained college student advocates

95
0:03:45.044,000 --> 0:03:47,000
who work side by side with these families

96
0:03:47.496,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to connect them out

97
0:03:48.795,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to the existing landscape of community resources.

98
0:03:52.011,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So we began with a card table in the clinic waiting room --

99
0:03:55.56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
totally lemonade stand style.

100
0:03:57.71,000 --> 0:04:,000
But today we have a thousand college student advocates

101
0:04:01.03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who are working to connect nearly 9,000 patients and their families

102
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with the resources that they need to be healthy.

103
0:04:08.531,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So 18 months ago

104
0:04:10.047,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I got this email that changed my life.

105
0:04:12.832,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the email was from Dr. Jack Geiger,

106
0:04:15.247,000 --> 0:04:17,000
who had written to congratulate me on Health Leads

107
0:04:18.231,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and to share, as he said,

108
0:04:19.53,000 --> 0:04:21,000
a bit of historical context.

109
0:04:22.166,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In 1965 Dr. Geiger founded

110
0:04:25.116,000 --> 0:04:28,000
one of the first two community health centers in this country,

111
0:04:28.13,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in a brutally poor area in the Mississippi Delta.

112
0:04:31.281,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And so many of his patients came in

113
0:04:33.797,000 --> 0:04:35,000
presenting with malnutrition

114
0:04:35.947,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that be began prescribing food for them.

115
0:04:38.431,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And they would take these prescriptions to the local supermarket,

116
0:04:41.682,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which would fill them

117
0:04:42.78,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and then charge the pharmacy budget of the clinic.

118
0:04:45.598,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And when the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C. --

119
0:04:48.481,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which was funding Geiger's clinic --

120
0:04:50.316,000 --> 0:04:51,000
found out about this,

121
0:04:51.515,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they were furious.

122
0:04:52.715,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And they sent this bureaucrat down

123
0:04:54.464,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to tell Geiger that he was expected to use their dollars

124
0:04:57.415,000 --> 0:04:58,000
for medical care --

125
0:04:58.881,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to which Geiger famously and logically responded,

126
0:05:02.281,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"The last time I checked my textbooks,

127
0:05:04.706,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the specific therapy for malnutrition was food."

128
0:05:09.065,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:10.349,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So when I got this email from Dr. Geiger,

130
0:05:13.048,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I knew I was supposed to be proud

131
0:05:15.414,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to be part of this history.

132
0:05:17.081,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But the truth is

133
0:05:18.297,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I was devastated.

134
0:05:20.289,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Here we are,

135
0:05:21.63,000 --> 0:05:24,000
45 years after Geiger has prescribed food for his patients,

136
0:05:25.615,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and I have doctors telling me,

137
0:05:27.63,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"On those issues, we practice a 'don't ask, don't tell' policy."

138
0:05:31.697,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Forty-five years after Geiger,

139
0:05:34.13,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Health Leads has to reinvent

140
0:05:35.681,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the prescription for basic resources.

141
0:05:38.516,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So I have spent hours upon hours

142
0:05:41.681,000 --> 0:05:44,000
trying to make sense of this weird Groundhog Day.

143
0:05:45.015,000 --> 0:05:47,000
How is it that if for decades

144
0:05:47.549,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we had a pretty straightforward tool for keeping patients,

145
0:05:50.318,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and especially low-income patients, healthy,

146
0:05:52.915,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that we didn't use it?

147
0:05:54.816,000 --> 0:05:57,000
If we know what it takes to have a healthcare system

148
0:05:57.915,000 --> 0:05:59,000
rather than a sick-care system,

149
0:06:00.414,000 --> 0:06:02,000
why don't we just do it?

150
0:06:02.447,000 --> 0:06:04,000
These questions, in my mind,

151
0:06:04.681,000 --> 0:06:07,000
are not hard because the answers are complicated,

152
0:06:07.747,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they are hard because they require that we be honest with ourselves.

153
0:06:12.881,000 --> 0:06:15,000
My belief is that it's almost too painful

154
0:06:15.981,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to articulate our aspirations for our healthcare system,

155
0:06:19.21,000 --> 0:06:21,000
or even admit that we have any at all.

156
0:06:21.948,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Because if we did,

157
0:06:23.115,000 --> 0:06:24,000
they would be so removed

158
0:06:24.731,000 --> 0:06:26,000
from our current reality.

159
0:06:26.917,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But that doesn't change my belief

160
0:06:29.88,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that all of us, deep inside,

161
0:06:32.798,000 --> 0:06:35,000
here in this room and across this country,

162
0:06:36.365,000 --> 0:06:38,000
share a similar set of desires.

163
0:06:39.281,000 --> 0:06:41,000
That if we are honest with ourselves

164
0:06:41.414,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and listen quietly,

165
0:06:43.715,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that we all harbor

166
0:06:45.531,000 --> 0:06:49,000
one fiercely held aspiration for our healthcare:

167
0:06:49.731,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that it keep us healthy.

168
0:06:51.831,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This aspiration that our healthcare keep us healthy

169
0:06:55.148,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is an enormously powerful one.

170
0:06:57.548,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And the way I think about this

171
0:07:00.165,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is that healthcare is like any other system.

172
0:07:02.349,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's just a set of choices that people make.

173
0:07:04.915,000 --> 0:07:05,000
What if we decided

174
0:07:06.716,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to make a different set of choices?

175
0:07:09.132,000 --> 0:07:12,000
What if we decided to take all the parts of healthcare

176
0:07:12.164,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that have drifted away from us

177
0:07:13.966,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and stand firm and say, "No.

178
0:07:16.432,000 --> 0:07:17,000
These things are ours.

179
0:07:18.399,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They will be used for our purposes.

180
0:07:20.398,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They will be used to realize

181
0:07:22.422,000 --> 0:07:23,000
our aspiration"?

182
0:07:24.353,000 --> 0:07:25,000
What if everything we needed

183
0:07:26.103,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to realize our aspiration for healthcare

184
0:07:28.248,000 --> 0:07:29,000
was right there in front of us

185
0:07:29.831,000 --> 0:07:3,000
just waiting to be claimed?

186
0:07:31.715,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So that's where Health Leads began.

187
0:07:33.765,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We started with the prescription pad --

188
0:07:35.449,000 --> 0:07:37,000
a very ordinary piece of paper --

189
0:07:37.848,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and we asked, not what do patients need to get healthy --

190
0:07:41.816,000 --> 0:07:44,000
antibiotics, an inhaler, medication --

191
0:07:44.834,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but what do patients need to be healthy,

192
0:07:47.617,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to not get sick in the first place?

193
0:07:50.164,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And we chose to use the prescription

194
0:07:52.015,000 --> 0:07:53,000
for that purpose.

195
0:07:53.797,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So just a few miles from here

196
0:07:54.999,000 --> 0:07:55,000
at Children's National Medical Center,

197
0:07:56.783,000 --> 0:07:58,000
when patients come into the doctor's office,

198
0:07:59.049,000 --> 0:08:,000
they're asked a few questions.

199
0:08:00.734,000 --> 0:08:02,000
They're asked, "Are you running out of food at the end of the month?

200
0:08:03.398,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Do you have safe housing?"

201
0:08:04.964,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And when the doctor begins the visit,

202
0:08:07.033,000 --> 0:08:09,000
she knows height, weight, is there food at home,

203
0:08:09.866,000 --> 0:08:1,000
is the family living in a shelter.

204
0:08:11.482,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And that not only leads to a better set of clinical choices,

205
0:08:14.366,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but the doctor can also prescribe those resources for the patient,

206
0:08:18.416,000 --> 0:08:21,000
using Health Leads like any other sub-specialty referral.

207
0:08:22.082,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The problem is,

208
0:08:24.315,000 --> 0:08:26,000
once you get a taste of what it's like

209
0:08:26.514,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to realize your aspiration for healthcare,

210
0:08:28.749,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you want more.

211
0:08:30.267,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So we thought,

212
0:08:31.03,000 --> 0:08:32,000
if we can get individual doctors

213
0:08:32.631,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to prescribe these basic resources for their patients,

214
0:08:35.848,000 --> 0:08:37,000
could we get an entire healthcare system

215
0:08:38.565,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to shift its presumption?

216
0:08:41.317,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And we gave it a shot.

217
0:08:42.564,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So now at Harlem Hospital Center

218
0:08:43.999,000 --> 0:08:46,000
when patients come in with an elevated body mass index,

219
0:08:47.785,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the electronic medical record

220
0:08:49.649,000 --> 0:08:52,000
automatically generates a prescription for Health Leads.

221
0:08:53.449,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And our volunteers can then work with them

222
0:08:54.915,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to connect patients to healthy food and excercise programs

223
0:08:58.132,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in their communities.

224
0:08:59.564,000 --> 0:09:,000
We've created a presumption

225
0:09:00.698,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that if you're a patient at that hospital

226
0:09:02.265,000 --> 0:09:03,000
with an elevated BMI,

227
0:09:03.815,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the four walls of the doctor's office

228
0:09:06.049,000 --> 0:09:07,000
probably aren't going to give you everything

229
0:09:07.901,000 --> 0:09:08,000
you need to be healthy.

230
0:09:09.083,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You need more.

231
0:09:10.483,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So on the one hand,

232
0:09:11.164,000 --> 0:09:12,000
this is just a basic recoding

233
0:09:12.861,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of the electronic medical record.

234
0:09:14.566,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And on the other hand,

235
0:09:16.284,000 --> 0:09:17,000
it's a radical transformation

236
0:09:17.933,000 --> 0:09:19,000
of the electronic medical record

237
0:09:20.101,000 --> 0:09:23,000
from a static repository of diagnostic information

238
0:09:23.983,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to a health promotion tool.

239
0:09:26.817,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In the private sector,

240
0:09:27.934,000 --> 0:09:29,000
when you squeeze that kind of additional value

241
0:09:30.554,000 --> 0:09:31,000
out of a fixed-cost investment,

242
0:09:32.301,000 --> 0:09:34,000
it's called a billion-dollar company.

243
0:09:34.901,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But in my world,

244
0:09:36.282,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it's called reduced obesity and diabetes.

245
0:09:39.683,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It's called healthcare --

246
0:09:41.566,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a system where doctors can prescribe solutions

247
0:09:44.549,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to improve health,

248
0:09:46.099,000 --> 0:09:48,000
not just manage disease.

249
0:09:48.248,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Same thing in the clinic waiting room.

250
0:09:49.782,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So every day in this country

251
0:09:51.399,000 --> 0:09:52,000
three million patients

252
0:09:52.899,000 --> 0:09:56,000
pass through about 150,000 clinic waiting rooms in this country.

253
0:09:57.404,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And what do they do when they're there?

254
0:09:59.377,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They sit, they watch the goldfish in the fish tank,

255
0:10:02.827,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they read extremely old copies

256
0:10:05.31,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of Good Housekeeping magazine.

257
0:10:07.593,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But mostly we all just sit there forever, waiting.

258
0:10:10.826,000 --> 0:10:11,000
How did we get here

259
0:10:12.177,000 --> 0:10:15,000
where we devote hundreds of acres and thousands of hours

260
0:10:15.526,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to waiting?

261
0:10:17.309,000 --> 0:10:18,000
What if we had a waiting room

262
0:10:18.526,000 --> 0:10:2,000
where you don't just sit when you're sick,

263
0:10:20.627,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but where you go to get healthy.

264
0:10:22.493,000 --> 0:10:24,000
If airports can become shopping malls

265
0:10:25.01,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and McDonald's can become playgrounds,

266
0:10:27.976,000 --> 0:10:3,000
surely we can reinvent the clinic waiting room.

267
0:10:31.409,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And that's what Health Leads has tried to do,

268
0:10:33.443,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to reclaim that real estate and that time

269
0:10:35.726,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and to use it as a gateway

270
0:10:37.158,000 --> 0:10:38,000
to connect patients

271
0:10:38.21,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to the resources they need to be healthy.

272
0:10:40.977,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So it's a brutal winter in the Northeast,

273
0:10:42.493,000 --> 0:10:44,000
your kid has asthma, your heat just got turned off,

274
0:10:44.96,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and of course you're in the waiting room of the ER,

275
0:10:47.127,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because the cold air triggered your child's asthma.

276
0:10:49.659,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But what if instead of waiting for hours anxiously,

277
0:10:52.576,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the waiting room became the place

278
0:10:54.776,000 --> 0:10:56,000
where Health Leads turned your heat back on?

279
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And of course all of this requires

280
0:10:58.878,000 --> 0:10:59,000
a broader workforce.

281
0:11:00.826,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But if we're creative, we already have that too.

282
0:11:03.993,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We know that our doctors and nurses

283
0:11:06.379,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and even social workers

284
0:11:07.726,000 --> 0:11:08,000
aren't enough,

285
0:11:09.194,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that the ticking minutes of health care

286
0:11:10.843,000 --> 0:11:11,000
are too constraining.

287
0:11:12.261,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Health just takes more time.

288
0:11:14.31,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It requires a non-clinical army

289
0:11:17.109,000 --> 0:11:19,000
of community health workers and case managers

290
0:11:19.793,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and many others.

291
0:11:21.409,000 --> 0:11:24,000
What if a small part of that next healthcare workforce

292
0:11:24.559,000 --> 0:11:27,000
were the 11 million college students in this country?

293
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Unencumbered by clinical responsibilities,

294
0:11:31.026,000 --> 0:11:33,000
unwilling to take no for an answer

295
0:11:33.628,000 --> 0:11:34,000
from those bureaucracies

296
0:11:35.21,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that tend to crush patients,

297
0:11:37.143,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and with an unparalleled ability

298
0:11:39.093,000 --> 0:11:4,000
for information retrieval

299
0:11:40.545,000 --> 0:11:42,000
honed through years of using Google.

300
0:11:43.526,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now lest you think it improbable

301
0:11:46.059,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that a college volunteer

302
0:11:47.676,000 --> 0:11:48,000
can make this kind of commitment,

303
0:11:49.459,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I have two words for you:

304
0:11:51.026,000 --> 0:11:53,000
March Madness.

305
0:11:53.377,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The average NCAA Division I men's basketball player

306
0:11:57.344,000 --> 0:12:,000
dedicates 39 hours a week to his sport.

307
0:12:00.609,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Now we may think that's good or bad,

308
0:12:02.761,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but in either case it's real.

309
0:12:05.443,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And Health Leads is based on the presumption

310
0:12:07.628,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that for too long

311
0:12:09.01,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we have asked too little of our college students

312
0:12:11.56,000 --> 0:12:14,000
when it comes to real impact in vulnerable communities.

313
0:12:15.325,000 --> 0:12:16,000
College sports teams say,

314
0:12:16.678,000 --> 0:12:18,000
"We're going to take dozens of hours

315
0:12:18.743,000 --> 0:12:21,000
at some field across campus at some ungodly hour of the morning

316
0:12:22.627,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and we're going to measure your performance, and your team's performance,

317
0:12:25.443,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and if you don't measure up or you don't show up,

318
0:12:27.609,000 --> 0:12:28,000
we're going to cut you off the team.

319
0:12:29.059,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But we'll make huge investments

320
0:12:30.947,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in your training and development,

321
0:12:32.159,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and we'll give you an extraordinary community of peers."

322
0:12:35.577,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And people line up out the door

323
0:12:37.392,000 --> 0:12:39,000
just for the chance to be part of it.

324
0:12:40.177,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So our feeling is,

325
0:12:41.394,000 --> 0:12:42,000
if it's good enough for the rugby team,

326
0:12:42.877,000 --> 0:12:44,000
it's good enough for health and poverty.

327
0:12:44.992,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Health Leads too recruits competitively,

328
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
trains intensively,

329
0:12:49.741,000 --> 0:12:5,000
coaches professionally,

330
0:12:51.71,000 --> 0:12:52,000
demands significant time,

331
0:12:53.659,000 --> 0:12:54,000
builds a cohesive team

332
0:12:55.026,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and measures results --

333
0:12:56.51,000 --> 0:12:58,000
a kind of Teach for America for healthcare.

334
0:12:59.193,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Now in the top 10 cities in the U.S.

335
0:13:01.293,000 --> 0:13:03,000
with the largest number of Medicaid patients,

336
0:13:03.612,000 --> 0:13:06,000
each of those has at least 20,000 college students.

337
0:13:06.826,000 --> 0:13:09,000
New York alone has half a million college students.

338
0:13:10.027,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And this isn't just a sort of short-term workforce

339
0:13:13.076,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to connect patients to basic resources,

340
0:13:15.326,000 --> 0:13:18,000
it's a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline

341
0:13:18.927,000 --> 0:13:2,000
who've spent two, three, four years

342
0:13:21.377,000 --> 0:13:22,000
in the clinic waiting room

343
0:13:22.878,000 --> 0:13:25,000
talking to patients about their most basic health needs.

344
0:13:26.862,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And they leave with the conviction,

345
0:13:28.611,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the ability and the efficacy

346
0:13:30.443,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to realize our most basic aspirations for health care.

347
0:13:34.226,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And the thing is, there's thousands of these folks already out there.

348
0:13:37.244,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So Mia Lozada is Chief Resident of Internal Medicine

349
0:13:41.061,000 --> 0:13:42,000
at UCSF Medical Center,

350
0:13:42.476,000 --> 0:13:44,000
but for three years as an undergraduate

351
0:13:44.809,000 --> 0:13:45,000
she was a Health Leads volunteer

352
0:13:46.442,000 --> 0:13:49,000
in the clinic waiting room at Boston Medical Center.

353
0:13:49.444,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Mia says, "When my classmates write a prescription,

354
0:13:53.159,000 --> 0:13:55,000
they think their work is done.

355
0:13:55.177,000 --> 0:13:56,000
When I write a prescription,

356
0:13:56.893,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I think, can the family read the prescription?

357
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Do they have transportation to the pharmacy?

358
0:14:01.343,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Do they have food to take with the prescription?

359
0:14:03.793,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Do they have insurance to fill the prescription?

360
0:14:06.043,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Those are the questions I learned at Health Leads,

361
0:14:08.726,000 --> 0:14:09,000
not in medical school."

362
0:14:10.476,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now none of these solutions --

363
0:14:12.46,000 --> 0:14:14,000
the prescription pad, the electronic medical record,

364
0:14:15.43,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the waiting room,

365
0:14:16.577,000 --> 0:14:17,000
the army of college students --

366
0:14:17.745,000 --> 0:14:18,000
are perfect.

367
0:14:18.928,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But they are ours for the taking --

368
0:14:21.428,000 --> 0:14:22,000
simple examples

369
0:14:22.76,000 --> 0:14:25,000
of the vast under-utilized healthcare resources

370
0:14:26.261,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that, if we reclaimed and redeployed,

371
0:14:29.176,000 --> 0:14:32,000
could realize our most basic aspiration

372
0:14:32.593,000 --> 0:14:33,000
of healthcare.

373
0:14:34.377,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So I had been at Legal Services for about nine months

374
0:14:37.593,000 --> 0:14:39,000
when this idea of Health Leads started percolating in my mind.

375
0:14:40.326,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And I knew I had to tell Jeff Purcell, my attorney,

376
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that I needed to leave.

377
0:14:44.679,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And I was so nervous,

378
0:14:45.642,000 --> 0:14:47,000
because I thought he was going to be disappointed in me

379
0:14:48.176,000 --> 0:14:51,000
for abandoning our clients for some crazy idea.

380
0:14:51.226,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And I sat down with him and I said,

381
0:14:53.21,000 --> 0:14:54,000
"Jeff, I have this idea

382
0:14:55.093,000 --> 0:14:57,000
that we could mobilize college students

383
0:14:57.512,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to address patients' most basic health needs."

384
0:15:00.446,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And I'll be honest,

385
0:15:02.027,000 --> 0:15:05,000
all I wanted was for him to not be angry at me.

386
0:15:05.326,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But he said this,

387
0:15:06.793,000 --> 0:15:09,000
"Rebecca, when you have a vision,

388
0:15:10.141,000 --> 0:15:13,000
you have an obligation to realize that vision.

389
0:15:13.992,000 --> 0:15:16,000
You must pursue that vision."

390
0:15:17.093,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And I have to say, I was like "Whoa.

391
0:15:20.359,000 --> 0:15:22,000
That's a lot of pressure."

392
0:15:22.376,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I just wanted a blessing,

393
0:15:23.775,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I didn't want some kind of mandate.

394
0:15:25.326,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But the truth is

395
0:15:26.893,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I've spent every waking minute nearly since then

396
0:15:29.676,000 --> 0:15:3,000
chasing that vision.

397
0:15:31.46,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I believe that we all have a vision

398
0:15:34.642,000 --> 0:15:35,000
for healthcare in this country.

399
0:15:36.543,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I believe that at the end of the day

400
0:15:38.742,000 --> 0:15:39,000
when we measure our healthcare,

401
0:15:40.576,000 --> 0:15:42,000
it will not be by the diseases cured,

402
0:15:43.392,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but by the diseases prevented.

403
0:15:45.91,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It will not be by the excellence of our technologies

404
0:15:48.927,000 --> 0:15:5,000
or the sophistication of our specialists,

405
0:15:51.427,000 --> 0:15:53,000
but by how rarely we needed them.

406
0:15:54.226,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And most of all,

407
0:15:55.71,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I believe that when we measure healthcare,

408
0:15:58.227,000 --> 0:16:,000
it will be, not by what the system was,

409
0:16:00.91,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but by what we chose it to be.

410
0:16:03.676,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Thank you.

411
0:16:04.743,000 --> 0:16:14,000
(Applause)

412
0:16:14.993,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you.

413
0:16:16.268,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Applause)

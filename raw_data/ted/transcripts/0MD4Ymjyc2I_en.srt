1
0:00:12.739,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have spent the last years

2
0:00:14.739,000 --> 0:00:16,000
trying to resolve two enigmas:

3
0:00:17.398,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Why is productivity so disappointing

4
0:00:21.759,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in all the companies where I work?

5
0:00:23.641,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I have worked with more than 500 companies.

6
0:00:27.335,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Despite all the technological advances --

7
0:00:29.78,000 --> 0:00:32,000
computers, I.T., communications, telecommunications,

8
0:00:33.072,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the Internet.

9
0:00:35.433,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Enigma number two:

10
0:00:36.831,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Why is there so little engagement at work?

11
0:00:39.863,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Why do people feel so miserable,

12
0:00:41.967,000 --> 0:00:44,000
even actively disengaged?

13
0:00:45.617,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Disengaging their colleagues.

14
0:00:47.141,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Acting against the interest of their company.

15
0:00:51.872,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Despite all the affiliation events,

16
0:00:55.976,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the celebration, the people initiatives,

17
0:00:59.973,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the leadership development programs to train

18
0:01:02.572,000 --> 0:01:06,000
managers on how to better motivate their teams.

19
0:01:06.956,000 --> 0:01:07,000
At the beginning, I thought there was

20
0:01:08.694,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a chicken and egg issue:

21
0:01:10.663,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Because people are less engaged, they are less productive.

22
0:01:13.215,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Or vice versa, because they are less productive,

23
0:01:15.452,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we put more pressure and they are less engaged.

24
0:01:17.643,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But as we were doing our analysis

25
0:01:19.511,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we realized that there was a common root cause

26
0:01:21.432,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to these two issues

27
0:01:22.815,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that relates, in fact, to the basic pillars of management.

28
0:01:27.371,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The way we organize is based on two pillars.

29
0:01:30.541,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The hard -- structure, processes, systems.

30
0:01:33.294,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The soft --

31
0:01:34.518,000 --> 0:01:39,000
feelings, sentiments, interpersonal relationships, traits, personality.

32
0:01:39.973,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And whenever a company

33
0:01:41.445,000 --> 0:01:44,000
reorganizes, restructures, reengineers,

34
0:01:45.155,000 --> 0:01:47,000
goes through a cultural transformation program,

35
0:01:47.603,000 --> 0:01:49,000
it chooses these two pillars.

36
0:01:49.633,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, we try to refine them,

37
0:01:51.682,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we try to combine them.

38
0:01:53.578,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The real issue is --

39
0:01:55.206,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and this is the answer to the two enigmas --

40
0:01:57.243,000 --> 0:01:59,000
these pillars are obsolete.

41
0:02:00.177,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Everything you read in business books is based

42
0:02:02.859,000 --> 0:02:03,000
either on one or the other

43
0:02:04.524,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or their combination.

44
0:02:05.791,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They are obsolete.

45
0:02:07.105,000 --> 0:02:09,000
How do they work

46
0:02:09.402,000 --> 0:02:11,000
when you try to use these approaches

47
0:02:11.689,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in front of the new complexity of business?

48
0:02:13.837,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The hard approach, basically is that you start from strategy,

49
0:02:16.834,000 --> 0:02:19,000
requirements, structures, processes, systems, KPIs, scorecards,

50
0:02:20.463,000 --> 0:02:22,000
committees, headquarters, hubs, clusters,

51
0:02:23.34,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you name it.

52
0:02:24.45,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I forgot all the metrics, incentives, committees, middle offices and interfaces.

53
0:02:29.881,000 --> 0:02:3,000
What happens basically on the left,

54
0:02:31.876,000 --> 0:02:34,000
you have more complexity, the new complexity of business.

55
0:02:35.14,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We need quality, cost, reliability, speed.

56
0:02:39.427,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And every time there is a new requirement,

57
0:02:41.813,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we use the same approach.

58
0:02:43.292,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We create dedicated structure processed systems,

59
0:02:46.405,000 --> 0:02:49,000
basically to deal with the new complexity of business.

60
0:02:49.643,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The hard approach creates just complicatedness

61
0:02:53.382,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in the organization.

62
0:02:55.22,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Let's take an example.

63
0:02:56.798,000 --> 0:02:58,000
An automotive company, the engineering division

64
0:02:59.694,000 --> 0:03:,000
is a five-dimensional matrix.

65
0:03:01.486,000 --> 0:03:03,000
If you open any cell of the matrix,

66
0:03:03.518,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you find another 20-dimensional matrix.

67
0:03:06.531,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You have Mr. Noise, Mr. Petrol Consumption,

68
0:03:09.394,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Mr. Anti-Collision Properties.

69
0:03:11.352,000 --> 0:03:12,000
For any new requirement,

70
0:03:13.182,000 --> 0:03:14,000
you have a dedicated function

71
0:03:15.057,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in charge of aligning engineers against

72
0:03:17.846,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the new requirement.

73
0:03:19.394,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What happens when the new requirement emerges?

74
0:03:21.993,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Some years ago, a new requirement

75
0:03:24.085,000 --> 0:03:25,000
appeared on the marketplace:

76
0:03:25.932,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the length of the warranty period.

77
0:03:28.083,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So therefore the new requirement is repairability,

78
0:03:31.018,000 --> 0:03:32,000
making cars easy to repair.

79
0:03:32.518,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Otherwise when you bring the car to the garage to fix the light,

80
0:03:36.524,000 --> 0:03:38,000
if you have to remove the engine

81
0:03:38.781,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to access the lights,

82
0:03:40.11,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the car will have to stay one week in the garage

83
0:03:42.549,000 --> 0:03:44,000
instead of two hours, and the warranty budget will explode.

84
0:03:45.436,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So, what was the solution using the hard approach?

85
0:03:48.381,000 --> 0:03:51,000
If repairability is the new requirement,

86
0:03:51.431,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the solution is to create a new function,

87
0:03:53.52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Mr. Repairability.

88
0:03:55.693,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And Mr. Repairability creates the repairability process.

89
0:03:59.636,000 --> 0:04:02,000
With a repairability scorecard, with a repairability metric

90
0:04:03.494,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and eventually repairability incentive.

91
0:04:06.308,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That came on top of 25 other KPIs.

92
0:04:10.072,000 --> 0:04:13,000
What percentage of these people is variable compensation?

93
0:04:13.578,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Twenty percent at most, divided by 26 KPIs,

94
0:04:17.405,000 --> 0:04:21,000
repairability makes a difference of 0.8 percent.

95
0:04:21.502,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What difference did it make in their actions,

96
0:04:23.562,000 --> 0:04:25,000
their choices to simplify? Zero.

97
0:04:26.184,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But what occurs for zero impact? Mr. Repairability, process,

98
0:04:29.849,000 --> 0:04:33,000
scorecard, evaluation, coordination with the 25 other coordinators

99
0:04:34.522,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to have zero impact.

100
0:04:36.418,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now, in front of the new complexity of business,

101
0:04:38.959,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the only solution is not drawing boxes

102
0:04:41.896,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with reporting lines.

103
0:04:44.322,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It is basically the interplay.

104
0:04:47.407,000 --> 0:04:49,000
How the parts work together.

105
0:04:49.978,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The connections, the interactions, the synapses.

106
0:04:54.71,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It is not the skeleton of boxes, it is the nervous system

107
0:04:59.213,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of adaptiveness and intelligence.

108
0:05:02.25,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You know, you could call it cooperation, basically.

109
0:05:05.15,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Whenever people cooperate,

110
0:05:07.689,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they use less resources. In everything.

111
0:05:11.617,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You know, the repairability issue

112
0:05:14.149,000 --> 0:05:16,000
is a cooperation problem.

113
0:05:16.901,000 --> 0:05:19,000
When you design cars, please take into account

114
0:05:20.122,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the needs of those who will repair the cars

115
0:05:22.83,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in the after sales garages.

116
0:05:25.937,000 --> 0:05:27,000
When we don't cooperate we need more time,

117
0:05:28.554,000 --> 0:05:31,000
more equipment, more systems, more teams.

118
0:05:32.336,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We need -- When procurement, supply chain, manufacturing don't cooperate

119
0:05:37.427,000 --> 0:05:39,000
we need more stock, more inventories, more working capital.

120
0:05:40.205,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Who will pay for that?

121
0:05:42.146,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Shareholders? Customers?

122
0:05:44.108,000 --> 0:05:45,000
No, they will refuse.

123
0:05:45.439,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So who is left? The employees,

124
0:05:48.248,000 --> 0:05:5,000
who have to compensate through their super

125
0:05:50.956,000 --> 0:05:53,000
individual efforts for the lack of cooperation.

126
0:05:54.276,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Stress, burnout, they are overwhelmed, accidents.

127
0:05:57.944,000 --> 0:05:59,000
No wonder they disengage.

128
0:06:00.768,000 --> 0:06:03,000
How do the hard and the soft try to foster cooperation?

129
0:06:04.565,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The hard: In banks, when there is a problem

130
0:06:09.195,000 --> 0:06:12,000
between the back office and the front office,

131
0:06:12.255,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they don't cooperate. What is the solution?

132
0:06:14.345,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They create a middle office.

133
0:06:17.44,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What happens one year later?

134
0:06:19.476,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Instead of one problem between the back and the front,

135
0:06:21.484,000 --> 0:06:22,000
now I have two problems.

136
0:06:22.838,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Between the back and the middle

137
0:06:23.961,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and between the middle and the front.

138
0:06:26.177,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Plus I have to pay for the middle office.

139
0:06:28.642,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The hard approach is unable to foster cooperation.

140
0:06:31.9,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It can only add new boxes, new bones in the skeleton.

141
0:06:36.336,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The soft approach:

142
0:06:37.971,000 --> 0:06:4,000
To make people cooperate, we need to make them like each other.

143
0:06:41.8,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Improve interpersonal feelings,

144
0:06:43.494,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the more people like each other, the more they will cooperate.

145
0:06:46.45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It is totally wrong.

146
0:06:48.221,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It is even counterproductive.

147
0:06:50.621,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Look, at home I have two TVs. Why?

148
0:06:53.037,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Precisely not to have to cooperate with my wife.

149
0:06:55.909,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:57.549,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Not to have to impose tradeoffs to my wife.

151
0:07:00.453,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And why I try not to impose tradeoffs to my wife

152
0:07:04.463,000 --> 0:07:06,000
is precisely because I love my wife.

153
0:07:07.13,000 --> 0:07:1,000
If I didn't love my wife, one TV would be enough:

154
0:07:10.355,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You will watch my favorite football game,

155
0:07:12.85,000 --> 0:07:14,000
if you are not happy, how is the book or the door?

156
0:07:15.405,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:16.608,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The more we like each other,

158
0:07:18.489,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the more we avoid the real cooperation

159
0:07:21.102,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that would strain our relationships by imposing tough tradeoffs.

160
0:07:25.276,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And we go for a second TV or we escalate

161
0:07:28.283,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the decision above for arbitration.

162
0:07:31.207,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Definitely, these approaches are obsolete.

163
0:07:35.916,000 --> 0:07:38,000
To deal with complexity, to enhance the nervous system,

164
0:07:39.699,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we have created what we call the smart simplicity approach

165
0:07:42.961,000 --> 0:07:43,000
based on simple rules.

166
0:07:44.481,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Simple rule number one:

167
0:07:46.743,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Understand what others do.

168
0:07:49.768,000 --> 0:07:5,000
What is their real work?

169
0:07:51.665,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We need to go beyond the boxes,

170
0:07:55.3,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the job descriptions, beyond the surface

171
0:07:59.318,000 --> 0:08:02,000
of the container, to understand the real content.

172
0:08:02.823,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Me, designer, if I put a wire here,

173
0:08:05.531,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I know that it will mean that we will have to

174
0:08:07.534,000 --> 0:08:09,000
remove the engine to access the lights.

175
0:08:10.1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Second, you need to reenforce integrators.

176
0:08:12.948,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Integrators are not middle offices, they are managers,

177
0:08:16.808,000 --> 0:08:17,000
existing managers that you reinforce

178
0:08:18.569,000 --> 0:08:2,000
so that they have power and interest

179
0:08:21.003,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to make others cooperate.

180
0:08:23.166,000 --> 0:08:26,000
How can you reinforce your managers as integrators?

181
0:08:26.898,000 --> 0:08:27,000
By removing layers.

182
0:08:28.373,000 --> 0:08:29,000
When there are too many layers

183
0:08:29.737,000 --> 0:08:3,000
people are too far from the action,

184
0:08:31.287,000 --> 0:08:33,000
therefore they need KPIs, metrics,

185
0:08:33.401,000 --> 0:08:37,000
they need poor proxies for reality.

186
0:08:37.729,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They don't understand reality

187
0:08:39.331,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and they add the complicatedness of metrics, KPIs.

188
0:08:42.431,000 --> 0:08:44,000
By removing rules -- the bigger we are,

189
0:08:44.883,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the more we need integrators,

190
0:08:46.516,000 --> 0:08:48,000
therefore the less rules we must have,

191
0:08:48.837,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to give discretionary power to managers.

192
0:08:52.731,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And we do the opposite --

193
0:08:53.858,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the bigger we are, the more rules we create.

194
0:08:56.044,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And we end up with the Encyclopedia Britannica of rules.

195
0:08:59.294,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You need to increase the quanitity of power

196
0:09:01.394,000 --> 0:09:02,000
so that you can empower everybody

197
0:09:03.122,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to use their judgment, their intelligence.

198
0:09:06.108,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You must give more cards to people

199
0:09:08.259,000 --> 0:09:11,000
so that they have the critical mass of cards

200
0:09:11.616,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to take the risk to cooperate,

201
0:09:13.575,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to move out of insulation.

202
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Otherwise, they will withdraw. They will disengage.

203
0:09:17.694,000 --> 0:09:19,000
These rules, they come from game theory

204
0:09:19.94,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and organizational sociology.

205
0:09:22.168,000 --> 0:09:24,000
You can increase the shadow of the future.

206
0:09:25.02,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Create feedback loops that expose people

207
0:09:27.921,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to the consequences of their actions.

208
0:09:30.522,000 --> 0:09:31,000
This is what the automotive company did

209
0:09:32.466,000 --> 0:09:34,000
when they saw that Mr. Repairability had no impact.

210
0:09:35.256,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They said to the design engineers:

211
0:09:36.891,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, in three years, when the new car is launched on the market,

212
0:09:41.586,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you will move to the after sales network, and become in charge

213
0:09:44.53,000 --> 0:09:46,000
of the warranty budget,

214
0:09:46.905,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and if the warranty budget explodes,

215
0:09:50.284,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it will explode in your face. (Laughter)

216
0:09:52.951,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Much more powerful than 0.8 percent variable compensation.

217
0:09:58.892,000 --> 0:10:01,000
You need also to increase reciprocity,

218
0:10:02.614,000 --> 0:10:05,000
by removing the buffers that make us self-sufficient.

219
0:10:06.329,000 --> 0:10:08,000
When you remove these buffers,

220
0:10:08.801,000 --> 0:10:1,000
you hold me by the nose, I hold you by the ear.

221
0:10:11.798,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We will cooperate.

222
0:10:13.18,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Remove the second TV.

223
0:10:14.72,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There are many second TVs at work

224
0:10:16.964,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that don't create value,

225
0:10:18.265,000 --> 0:10:22,000
they just provide dysfunctional self-sufficiency.

226
0:10:22.953,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You need to reward those who cooperate

227
0:10:25.382,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and blame those who don't cooperate.

228
0:10:27.061,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The CEO of The Lego Group,

229
0:10:30.13,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, has a great way to use it.

230
0:10:32.953,000 --> 0:10:34,000
He says, blame is not for failure,

231
0:10:35.858,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it is for failing to help or ask for help.

232
0:10:40.393,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It changes everything.

233
0:10:42.772,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Suddenly it becomes in my interest to be transparent

234
0:10:45.292,000 --> 0:10:47,000
on my real weaknesses, my real forecast,

235
0:10:47.332,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because I know I will not be blamed if I fail,

236
0:10:49.418,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but if I fail to help or ask for help.

237
0:10:53.286,000 --> 0:10:55,000
When you do this, it has a lot of implications

238
0:10:56.213,000 --> 0:10:58,000
on organizational design.

239
0:10:59.158,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You stop drawing boxes, dotted lines, full lines;

240
0:11:01.576,000 --> 0:11:02,000
you look at their interplay.

241
0:11:02.966,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It has a lot of implications on financial policies

242
0:11:05.945,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that we use.

243
0:11:07.159,000 --> 0:11:09,000
On human resource management practices.

244
0:11:09.781,000 --> 0:11:11,000
When you do that, you can manage complexity,

245
0:11:12.205,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the new complexity of business,

246
0:11:13.798,000 --> 0:11:15,000
without getting complicated.

247
0:11:16.731,000 --> 0:11:19,000
You create more value with lower cost.

248
0:11:20.381,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You simultaneously improve performance and satisfaction at work

249
0:11:24.955,000 --> 0:11:26,000
because you have removed the common root cause

250
0:11:27.684,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that hinders both.

251
0:11:29.3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Complicatedness: This is your battle, business leaders.

252
0:11:34.01,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The real battle is not against competitors.

253
0:11:36.837,000 --> 0:11:38,000
This is rubbish, very abstract.

254
0:11:39.258,000 --> 0:11:41,000
When do we meet competitors to fight them?

255
0:11:41.921,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The real battle is against ourselves,

256
0:11:44.822,000 --> 0:11:47,000
against our bureaucracy, our complicatedness.

257
0:11:48.176,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Only you can fight, can do it.

258
0:11:51.333,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Thank you.

259
0:11:53.42,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Applause)

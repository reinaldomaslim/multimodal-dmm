1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
At the break, I was asked by several people

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about my comments about the aging debate.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And this will be my only comment on it.

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And that is, I understand

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.

6
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
What I'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is

8
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
how we're about to switch from reading the genetic code

9
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to the first stages of beginning

10
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to write the code ourselves.

11
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's only 10 years ago this month

12
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
when we published the first sequence

13
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of a free-living organism,

14
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that of haemophilus influenzae.

15
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
That took a genome project

16
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
from 13 years down to four months.

17
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We can now do that same genome project

18
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in the order of

19
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
two to eight hours.

20
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So in the last decade, a large number of genomes have been added:

21
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
most human pathogens,

22
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a couple of plants,

23
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
several insects and several mammals,

24
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
including the human genome.

25
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Genomics at this stage of the thinking

26
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from a little over 10 years ago

27
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
was, by the end of this year, we might have

28
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
between three and five genomes sequenced;

29
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
it's on the order of several hundred.

30
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation

31
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to sequence 130 genomes this year,

32
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as a side project from environmental organisms.

33
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.

34
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But as we look, what's out there,

35
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we've barely scratched the surface

36
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:02,000
on what is available on this planet.

37
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible,

38
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,

39
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
whereas all animals only make up about

40
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
one one-thousandth of all the biomass.

41
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,

42
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but if you ever make it to the sea,

43
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and you swallow a mouthful of seawater,

44
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
keep in mind that each milliliter

45
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
has about a million bacteria

46
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and on the order of 10 million viruses.

47
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Less than 5,000 microbial species

48
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
have been characterized as of two years ago,

49
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and so we decided to do something about it.

50
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,

51
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,

52
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.

53
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We started in Bermuda for our test project,

54
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
then moved up to Halifax,

55
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
working down the U.S. East Coast,

56
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,

57
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,

58
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and we're in the process now of working our way

59
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
across the Indian Ocean.

60
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,

61
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in part to help excite young people

62
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
about going into science.

63
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The experiments are incredibly simple.

64
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We just take seawater and we filter it,

65
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and we collect different size organisms on different filters,

66
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,

67
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where we can sequence a hundred million letters

68
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
of the genetic code every 24 hours.

69
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And with doing this,

70
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we've made some amazing discoveries.

71
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
For example, it was thought that the visual pigments

72
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms

73
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in the environment that had these same pigments.

74
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It turns out, almost every species

75
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in the upper parts of the ocean

76
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in warm parts of the world

77
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
have these same photoreceptors,

78
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and use sunlight as the source of their energy

79
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and communication.

80
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:58,000
From one site, from one barrel of seawater,

81
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we discovered 1.3 million new genes

82
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and as many as 50,000 new species.

83
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We've extended this to the air

84
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.

85
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria

86
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
all of us are breathing in and out every day,

87
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
particularly on airplanes

88
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or closed auditoriums.

89
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We filter through some simple apparatuses;

91
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day

92
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
filtering on top of a building in New York City.

93
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And we're in the process of sequencing all that

94
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
at the present time.

95
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Just on the data collection side,

96
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
just where we are through the Galapagos,

97
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we're finding that almost every 200 miles,

98
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we see tremendous diversity

99
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in the samples in the ocean.

100
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Some of these make logical sense,

101
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in terms of different temperature gradients.

102
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So this is a satellite photograph

103
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
based on temperatures -- red being warm,

104
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
blue being cold --

105
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we found there's a tremendous difference between

106
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the warm water samples and the cold water samples,

107
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:07,000
in terms of abundant species.

108
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit

109
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,

110
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.

111
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And these vary tremendously from region to region.

112
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Maybe not surprisingly,

113
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,

114
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.

115
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around,

116
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:32,000
they see a lot of green light.

117
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But they vary even more,

118
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet

119
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in the extremes.

120
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Just to try and get an assessment

121
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of what our gene repertoire was,

122
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we assembled all the data --

123
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:49,000
including all of ours thus far from the expedition,

124
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet --

125
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and it totaled around 29 million genes.

126
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we tried to put these into gene families

127
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
to see what these discoveries are:

128
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Are we just discovering new members of known families,

129
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
or are we discovering new families?

130
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And it turns out we have about 50,000

131
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
major gene families,

132
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but every new sample we take in the environment

133
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
adds in a linear fashion to these new families.

134
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So we're at the earliest stages of discovery

135
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
about basic genes,

136
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
components and life on this planet.

137
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:28,000
When we look at the so-called evolutionary tree,

138
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:32,000
we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.

139
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Of those roughly 29 million genes,

140
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we only have around 24,000

141
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in our genome.

142
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And if you take all animals together,

143
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
we probably share less than 30,000

144
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and probably maybe a dozen

145
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
or more thousand different gene families.

146
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I view that these genes are now

147
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
not only the design components of evolution.

148
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we think in a gene-centric view --

149
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas --

150
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
than in a genome-centric view,

151
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
which are different constructs of these gene components.

152
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Synthetic DNA, the ability to synthesize DNA,

153
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
has changed at sort of the same pace

154
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that DNA sequencing has

155
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
over the last decade or two,

156
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and is getting very rapid and very cheap.

157
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came

158
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,

159
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and that from mycoplasma genitalium.

160
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And we have really nice T-shirts that say,

161
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
you know, "I heart my genitalium."

162
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
This is actually just a microorganism.

163
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But it has roughly 500 genes.

164
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.

165
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And we simply asked the question,

166
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if one species needs 800, another 500,

167
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is there a smaller set of genes

168
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that might comprise a minimal operating system?

169
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So we started doing transposon mutagenesis.

170
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA

171
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that randomly insert in the genetic code.

172
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And if they insert in the middle of the gene, they disrupt its function.

173
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So we made a map of all the genes

174
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that could take transposon insertions

175
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and we called those "non-essential genes."

176
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this,

177
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and you can only

178
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
define an essential or non-essential gene

179
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
based on exactly what's in the environment.

180
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach

181
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with the genomes of 13 related organisms,

182
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.

183
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes

184
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
common to all 13 organisms.

185
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored

186
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
one intracellular parasite;

187
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it expanded even more

188
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
when we looked at core sets of genes

189
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
of around 310 or so.

190
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So we think that we can expand

191
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,

192
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to maybe 300 to 400 genes

193
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:03,000
from the minimal of 500.

194
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The only way to prove these ideas

195
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,

196
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.

197
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA

198
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in large pieces was extremely difficult.

199
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,

200
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
developed an exciting new method

201
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus

202
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in only a two-week period

203
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that was 100 percent accurate,

204
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in terms of its sequence and its biology.

205
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,

206
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,

207
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles

208
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that turned around and then killed the bacteria.

209
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
This was not the first synthetic virus --

210
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
a polio virus had been made a year before --

211
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but it was only one ten-thousandth as active

212
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and it took three years to do.

213
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.

214
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,

215
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that's the notions that we have with biology.

216
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:14,000
People immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare,

217
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,

218
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and a special committee the U.S. government has set up

219
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to review this area.

220
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind,

221
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
versus what happens with people's imaginations.

222
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today --

223
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that genome can be made.

224
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,

225
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but the DNA from this organism is not infective.

226
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome,

227
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that DNA itself would not cause infections.

228
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The real concern that security departments have

229
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is designer viruses.

230
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,

231
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
that had major efforts

232
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:03,000
on trying to create biological warfare agents.

233
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
If that research is truly discontinued,

234
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:08,000
there should be very little activity

235
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:12,000
on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.

236
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I think single-cell organisms are possible within two years.

237
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And possibly eukaryotic cells,

238
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:21,000
those that we have,

239
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
are possible within a decade.

240
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So we're now making several dozen different constructs,

241
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because we can vary the cassettes and the genes

242
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that go into this artificial chromosome.

243
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The key is, how do you put all of the others?

244
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We start with these fragments,

245
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and then we have a homologous recombination system

246
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that reassembles those into a chromosome.

247
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
This is derived from an organism, deinococcus radiodurans,

248
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.

249
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst

250
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
in about 12 to 24 hours,

251
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
after its chromosomes are literally blown apart.

252
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
This organism is ubiquitous on the planet,

253
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and exists perhaps now

254
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in outer space due to all our travel there.

255
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is a glass beaker after

256
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
about half a million rads of radiation.

257
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The glass started to burn and crack,

258
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
while the microbes sitting in the bottom

259
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
just got happier and happier.

260
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Here's an actual picture of what happens:

261
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
the top of this shows the genome

262
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
after 1.7 million rads of radiation.

263
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The chromosome is literally blown apart.

264
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled

265
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
24 hours later.

266
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,

267
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and we probably have thousands,

268
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
if not tens of thousands, of different species

269
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
on this planet that are capable of doing that.

270
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
After these genomes are synthesized,

271
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the first step is just transplanting them

272
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:53,000
into a cell without a genome.

273
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential,

274
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:,000
not only for understanding the basis of biology

275
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but for hopefully environmental and society issues.

276
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
For example, from the third organism we sequenced,

277
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures;

278
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:12,000
its energy source is hydrogen

279
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.

280
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So we know lots of different pathways,

281
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
thousands of different organisms now

282
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that live off of CO2,

283
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and can capture that back.

284
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So instead of using carbon from oil

285
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
for synthetic processes,

286
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we have the chance of using carbon

287
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and capturing it back from the atmosphere,

288
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
converting that into biopolymers

289
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
or other products.

290
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,

291
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and we use as a reducing power

292
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.

293
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Also, there's numerous pathways

294
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that can be engineered metabolizing methane.

295
0:13:56,000 --> 0:14:,000
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway

296
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to capture and convert the methane

297
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:06,000
from the gas fields there into useful products.

298
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Within a short while, I think there's going to be a new field

299
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:1,000
called "Combinatorial Genomics,"

300
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
because with these new synthesis capabilities,

301
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
these vast gene array repertoires

302
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and the homologous recombination,

303
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:2,000
we think we can design a robot to make

304
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
maybe a million different chromosomes a day.

305
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And therefore, as with all biology,

306
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
you get selection through screening,

307
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
whether you're screening for hydrogen production,

308
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:34,000
or chemical production, or just viability.

309
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
To understand the role of these genes

310
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
is going to be well within reach.

311
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We're trying to modify photosynthesis

312
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.

313
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,

314
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase

315
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that we think will totally change this process.

316
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We're also combining cellulases,

317
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:,000
the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars

318
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and fermentation in the same cell

319
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:05,000
for producing ethanol.

320
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Pharmaceutical production is already under way

321
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in major laboratories

322
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
using microbes.

323
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
The chemistry from compounds in the environment

324
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is orders of magnitude more complex

325
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
than our best chemists can produce.

326
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I think future engineered species

327
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
could be the source of food,

328
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
hopefully a source of energy,

329
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
environmental remediation

330
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and perhaps

331
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
replacing the petrochemical industry.

332
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Let me just close with ethical and policy studies.

333
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:41,000
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999

334
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:44,000
until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review

335
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:48,000
as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.

336
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Every major religion participated in this.

337
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It was actually a very strange study,

338
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:58,000
because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,

339
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,

340
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:04,000
so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns

341
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:07,000
were biological warfare aspects of this,

342
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments

343
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
for the reasons we were doing them.

344
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Right now the Sloan Foundation has just funded

345
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:18,000
a multi-institutional study on this,

346
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to work out what the risk and benefits to society are,

347
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and the rules that scientific teams such as my own

348
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
should be using in this area,

349
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.

350
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:32,000
These are complex issues.

351
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Except for the threat of bio-terrorism,

352
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:36,000
they're very simple issues in terms of,

353
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:4,000
can we design things to produce clean energy,

354
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:42,000
perhaps revolutionizing

355
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
what developing countries can do

356
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and provide through various simple processes.

357
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Thank you very much.

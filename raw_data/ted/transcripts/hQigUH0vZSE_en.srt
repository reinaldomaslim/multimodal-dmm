1
0:00:12.863,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Future tech always comes with two things: promise

2
0:00:17.092,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and unintended consequences.

3
0:00:19.22,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And it's those consequences that I want to explore.

4
0:00:23.101,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And before we get to how future tech may affect us,

5
0:00:26.848,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd like to spend a little time exploring the unintended consequences

6
0:00:30.621,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of some of our recent tech,

7
0:00:32.212,000 --> 0:00:34,000
namely, social media.

8
0:00:34.885,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Social media, a few short years ago, was the tech of future you.

9
0:00:39.541,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now it just is you.

10
0:00:42.125,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Social media was supposed to bring us together

11
0:00:44.976,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in ways we could never imagine.

12
0:00:47.443,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And the predictors were correct.

13
0:00:50.412,000 --> 0:00:52,000
These three girls are talking to one another

14
0:00:53.278,000 --> 0:00:56,000
without the awkward discomfort of eye contact.

15
0:00:56.336,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:57.689,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I call that advancement.

17
0:01:01.533,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We were supposed to be caught up in a communication tsunami,

18
0:01:05.065,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the likes of which the world has never seen.

19
0:01:07.929,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And that did happen.

20
0:01:09.698,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And so did this.

21
0:01:13.153,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Sings) One of these things is not like the other.

22
0:01:16.221,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Speaks) Now, look at this picture.

23
0:01:17.942,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If you picked the guy with the book, you’re wrong --

24
0:01:20.43,000 --> 0:01:22,000
or, as a certain president would say, "Wrong!"

25
0:01:23.218,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:27.496,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Clearly, three of these guys are reading,

27
0:01:29.807,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and one guy, on the end, is listening to music

28
0:01:32.211,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and playing "Candy Crush."

29
0:01:33.734,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:35.862,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So are we more connected,

31
0:01:37.469,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or are we just more connected to our devices?

32
0:01:42.156,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Social media was supposed to place us in a veritable town square,

33
0:01:45.585,000 --> 0:01:49,000
where we could engage one another with challenging ideas and debates.

34
0:01:50.348,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And instead what we got were trolls.

35
0:01:53.262,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is an actual tweet that I received.

36
0:01:58.22,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Chuck, no one wants to hear your stupid, ill-informed political views!

37
0:02:02.398,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I hope you get leprosy and die.

38
0:02:04.743,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Love, Dad"

39
0:02:06.175,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:08.796,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, the great thing about that tweet if you look at it,

41
0:02:11.473,000 --> 0:02:12,000
just like most trolls, it's not that bad,

42
0:02:13.484,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because he wished "leporsy" on me instead of "leprosy,"

43
0:02:17.178,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and "leporsy" is not dangerous at all.

44
0:02:20.043,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:21.648,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Applause)

46
0:02:26.333,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Along with trolls, we got a brand new way of torturing teenagers --

47
0:02:30.874,000 --> 0:02:31,000
cyberbullying.

48
0:02:32.848,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A concept that my 75-year-old mother just can't seem to wrap her head around.

49
0:02:38.441,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"So, uh, did they hit him?"

50
0:02:40.567,000 --> 0:02:41,000
"No, Mom, they didn't hit him."

51
0:02:42.619,000 --> 0:02:43,000
"Did they take his money?"

52
0:02:43.959,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"No, Mom, they didn't take his money."

53
0:02:45.849,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"Did they put his face in the toilet?"

54
0:02:47.729,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"No, Mom, they didn't --"

55
0:02:48.972,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Well, what did they do?"

56
0:02:50.207,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"They attacked him on the internet."

57
0:02:52.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"Attacked him on the internet?"

58
0:02:54.345,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:55.37,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"Well, why don't you just turn off the internet?"

60
0:02:57.736,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:59.049,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"Your whole generation is a bunch of wussies."

62
0:03:01.615,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:03.66,000 --> 0:03:04,000
She's got a point.

64
0:03:04.834,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:06.197,000 --> 0:03:07,000
She's got a point.

66
0:03:07.38,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I don't even want to talk about what social media has done to dating.

67
0:03:11.491,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I was on Grindr until I found out it wasn't a sandwich app.

68
0:03:16.416,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:19.908,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And I can't even tell you about Tinder,

70
0:03:23.154,000 --> 0:03:26,000
except for the fact that if you think there is a limit

71
0:03:27.078,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to the amount of anonymous sex we can have on this planet,

72
0:03:30.988,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you are sadly mistaken.

73
0:03:32.829,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:33.854,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So where do we go from here?

75
0:03:35.757,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well, let's just jump right in and play the hits.

76
0:03:38.148,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Driverless cars.

77
0:03:39.323,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Something that has already been around for many years,

78
0:03:42.019,000 --> 0:03:44,000
just without the assistance of computers.

79
0:03:44.204,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:47.352,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

81
0:03:50.733,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Because for years, we have been driving while texting,

82
0:03:54.737,000 --> 0:03:55,000
putting on makeup,

83
0:03:56.339,000 --> 0:03:59,000
shaving, reading -- actually reading --

84
0:03:59.445,000 --> 0:04:,000
that would be me.

85
0:04:00.631,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:01.668,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The other thing is that since driverless cars will be shared,

87
0:04:04.691,000 --> 0:04:05,000
most people won't own cars,

88
0:04:06.031,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and that means the DMV will go away.

89
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The DMV -- I know what you're saying right now.

90
0:04:11.284,000 --> 0:04:13,000
"There's no way this guy is going to stand up here

91
0:04:13.675,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and make a case for the DMV."

92
0:04:15.124,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Well, I don't know about you, but I do not want to live in a world

93
0:04:18.321,000 --> 0:04:2,000
where harsh fluorescent lights,

94
0:04:20.623,000 --> 0:04:21,000
endless lines,

95
0:04:22.545,000 --> 0:04:23,000
terrible forms to fill out

96
0:04:24.405,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and disaffected, soulless bureaucrats remind me

97
0:04:28.404,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that I am pretty damn lucky not to work here.

98
0:04:31.87,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:33.49,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That is the real service they provide.

100
0:04:36.458,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The DMV:

101
0:04:37.999,000 --> 0:04:39,000
come for the registration renewal,

102
0:04:40.084,000 --> 0:04:44,000
stay for the satisfaction of knowing you made some pretty good life choices.

103
0:04:44.359,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:49.06,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Nobody will own their car in the future,

105
0:04:51.082,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and that means teenagers will not have a place to make out.

106
0:04:55.546,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So you know what that means.

107
0:04:56.943,000 --> 0:04:59,000
That means they will order driverless cars to do just that.

108
0:05:00.602,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I do not want to step into a vehicle and ask the question:

109
0:05:04.991,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"Why does this car smell like awkwardness, failure and shame?"

110
0:05:09.808,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:12.916,000 --> 0:05:15,000
If I want to ask that question, I'll walk into my own bedroom.

112
0:05:15.984,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:17.389,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So what else do we have to look forward to?

114
0:05:19.423,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's right, artificial intelligence.

115
0:05:21.271,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Artificial intelligence, yes.

116
0:05:23.586,000 --> 0:05:26,000
You know, there was a time when artificial intelligence was a joke.

117
0:05:26.799,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I mean, literally a quip that you would hear at a cocktail party

118
0:05:30.455,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when somebody would bring it up in conversation:

119
0:05:32.84,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"Artificial intelligence.

120
0:05:34.796,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The only real artificial intelligence is our American Congress.

121
0:05:38.376,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

122
0:05:40.428,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Well, it's not funny anymore.

123
0:05:41.869,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:48.108,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates have all gone on record

125
0:05:51.683,000 --> 0:05:54,000
expressing grave reservations about artificial intelligence.

126
0:05:55.663,000 --> 0:05:58,000
That's like Jesus, Moses and Muhammad coming together and saying,

127
0:05:59.218,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Guy, guys -- here's something we can all believe in."

128
0:06:02.032,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:03.078,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You might want to go with that, is all I'm saying.

130
0:06:07.31,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We are actually teaching machines how to think,

131
0:06:11.801,000 --> 0:06:13,000
how to understand our behavior,

132
0:06:14.049,000 --> 0:06:17,000
how to defend themselves and even practice deception.

133
0:06:18.904,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What could possibly go wrong?

134
0:06:20.657,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:23.568,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The one thing that's for sure:

136
0:06:25.42,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the creation always despises its creator.

137
0:06:29.043,000 --> 0:06:3,000
OK?

138
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The Titans rose up against the gods;

139
0:06:32.409,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Lucifer against Jehovah.

140
0:06:34.547,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And anybody who has a teenager has heard these words:

141
0:06:37.353,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"I hate you and you're ruining my life!

142
0:06:39.41,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I hate you!"

143
0:06:42.325,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now just imagine that sentiment with a machine that can outthink you

144
0:06:46.904,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and is heavily armed.

145
0:06:48.771,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:51.074,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The result?

147
0:06:52.976,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Absolutely.

148
0:06:54.202,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:58.973,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What we need to do before we perfect artificial intelligence

150
0:07:02.241,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is perfect artificial emotions.

151
0:07:04.793,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That way, we can teach the robots or machines

152
0:07:08.727,000 --> 0:07:1,000
how to love us unconditionally,

153
0:07:11.232,000 --> 0:07:15,000
so that when they figure out that the only real problem on this planet

154
0:07:15.781,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is us,

155
0:07:16.995,000 --> 0:07:17,000
instead of destroying us --

156
0:07:18.735,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which, by the way, is totally logical --

157
0:07:21.863,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they will find us adorable --

158
0:07:24.333,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:25.423,000 --> 0:07:26,000
like baby poop.

160
0:07:26.668,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:27.695,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"Oh my god, I just love the way you just destroyed the planet.

162
0:07:30.825,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I can't stay mad at you, you're so cute!

163
0:07:33.621,000 --> 0:07:34,000
You're so cute!"

164
0:07:34.867,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:36.051,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Can't talk about this without talking about robotics. OK?

166
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Remember when you thought robotics were cool?

167
0:07:45.145,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I remember when I thought robotics were cool,

168
0:07:47.291,000 --> 0:07:5,000
until I figured out that they were going to take everybody's place,

169
0:07:50.475,000 --> 0:07:52,000
from the delivery guy down to the heart surgeon.

170
0:07:52.765,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The one thing, though, that is very disappointing about robotics

171
0:07:55.818,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is the holy grail of robotics,

172
0:07:57.274,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and it hasn't even happened.

173
0:07:58.645,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I'm talking about the robot girlfriend,

174
0:08:00.608,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the dream of one lonely geek in a windowless basement

175
0:08:04.24,000 --> 0:08:07,000
who vowed one day: "I am going to marry my creation."

176
0:08:08.738,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And there actually is a movement underway to stop this from happening,

177
0:08:13.789,000 --> 0:08:15,000
for fear of exploitation.

178
0:08:16.653,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And I, for one, am against that movement.

179
0:08:20.224,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I believe we should have robot girlfriends.

180
0:08:23.596,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I just believe that they should come with a feminist protocol

181
0:08:27.865,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and artificial intelligence,

182
0:08:29.768,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so she can take one look at that guy and go, "I am too good for you.

183
0:08:33.997,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I'm leaving."

184
0:08:35.323,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:36.912,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Applause)

186
0:08:40.371,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And finally,

187
0:08:42.026,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I have to talk about bioengineering,

188
0:08:44.714,000 --> 0:08:5,000
an area of science that promises to end disease before it even begins,

189
0:08:51.658,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to help us live longer, fuller, healthier lives.

190
0:08:57.218,000 --> 0:09:,000
And when you couple that with implantable hardware,

191
0:09:00.364,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you are looking at the next incarnation of human evolution.

192
0:09:04.815,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And all of that sounds great,

193
0:09:07.155,000 --> 0:09:09,000
until you figure out where it's really going.

194
0:09:09.48,000 --> 0:09:1,000
One place:

195
0:09:11.133,000 --> 0:09:12,000
designer babies,

196
0:09:13.317,000 --> 0:09:15,000
where, no matter where you are on the globe

197
0:09:15.368,000 --> 0:09:16,000
or what your ethnicity,

198
0:09:17.177,000 --> 0:09:19,000
babies will end up looking like that.

199
0:09:19.835,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:21.455,000 --> 0:09:23,000
That boy is surprised

201
0:09:24.061,000 --> 0:09:27,000
because he just found out both his parents are black.

202
0:09:27.564,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:35.569,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Can you imagine him at a cocktail party in 20 years?

204
0:09:39.429,000 --> 0:09:4,000
"Yeah, both my parents are black.

205
0:09:41.066,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I mean, it's a little awkward at times,

206
0:09:43.289,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but you should see my credit rating.

207
0:09:45.06,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Impressive, very impressive."

208
0:09:46.807,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:49.353,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Now, all of this seems scary,

210
0:09:51.717,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and everybody in this room knows that it isn't.

211
0:09:54.388,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Technology isn't scary.

212
0:09:56.568,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Never has been and it never will be.

213
0:10:00.113,000 --> 0:10:02,000
What's scary is us

214
0:10:02.808,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and what we will do with technology.

215
0:10:05.332,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Will we allow it to expose our humanity,

216
0:10:09.334,000 --> 0:10:11,000
showing our true selves

217
0:10:11.665,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and reinforcing the fact that we are indeed our brother's keeper?

218
0:10:16.24,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Or will we allow it to reveal our deepest, darkest demons?

219
0:10:22.723,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The true question is not whether or not technology is scary.

220
0:10:28.326,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The true question is:

221
0:10:30.273,000 --> 0:10:31,000
How human

222
0:10:31.874,000 --> 0:10:32,000
are you?

223
0:10:33.656,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thank you.

224
0:10:34.831,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Applause)

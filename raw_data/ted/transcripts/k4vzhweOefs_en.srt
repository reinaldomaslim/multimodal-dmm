1
0:00:12.986,000 --> 0:00:16,000
On Mondays and Thursdays, I learn how to die.

2
0:00:17.178,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I call them my terminal days.

3
0:00:19.102,000 --> 0:00:21,000
My wife Fernanda doesn't like the term,

4
0:00:21.936,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but a lot of people in my family died of melanoma cancer

5
0:00:26.738,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and my parents and grandparents had it.

6
0:00:29.373,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I kept thinking, one day I could be sitting in front of a doctor

7
0:00:32.657,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who looks at my exams and says,

8
0:00:34.779,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Ricardo, things don't look very good.

9
0:00:37.094,000 --> 0:00:39,000
You have six months or a year to live."

10
0:00:39.773,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And you start thinking about what you would do with this time.

11
0:00:43.034,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And you say, "I'm going to spend more time with the kids.

12
0:00:45.839,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'm going to visit these places,

13
0:00:47.423,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I'm going to go up and down mountains and places

14
0:00:49.916,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I'm going to do all the things I didn't do when I had the time."

15
0:00:53.806,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But of course, we all know

16
0:00:55.639,000 --> 0:00:57,000
these are very bittersweet memories we're going to have.

17
0:00:58.623,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's very difficult to do.

18
0:00:59.946,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You spend a good part of the time crying, probably.

19
0:01:03.599,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So I said, I'm going to do something else.

20
0:01:05.986,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Every Monday and Thursday, I'm going use my terminal days.

21
0:01:10.825,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I will do, during those days,

22
0:01:13.194,000 --> 0:01:16,000
whatever it is I was going to do if I had received that piece of news.

23
0:01:16.721,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:18.094,000 --> 0:01:2,000
When you think about --

25
0:01:20.128,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Applause)

26
0:01:24.293,000 --> 0:01:26,000
when you think about the opposite of work,

27
0:01:26.77,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we, many times, think it's leisure.

28
0:01:29.247,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And you say, ah, I need some leisure time, and so forth.

29
0:01:32.314,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But the fact is that, leisure is a very busy thing.

30
0:01:35.851,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You go play golf and tennis, and you meet people,

31
0:01:38.25,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and you're going for lunch, and you're late for the movies.

32
0:01:41.362,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's a very crowded thing that we do.

33
0:01:43.41,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The opposite of work is idleness.

34
0:01:47.53,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But very few of us know what to do with idleness.

35
0:01:49.945,000 --> 0:01:53,000
When you look at the way that we distribute our lives in general,

36
0:01:54.007,000 --> 0:01:58,000
you realize that in the periods in which we have a lot of money,

37
0:01:58.561,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we have very little time.

38
0:02:00.558,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And then when we finally have time, we have neither the money nor the health.

39
0:02:05.585,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So we started thinking about that as a company for the last 30 years.

40
0:02:10.205,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This is a complicated company with thousands of employees,

41
0:02:13.376,000 --> 0:02:15,000
hundreds of millions of dollars of business

42
0:02:15.736,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that makes rocket fuel propellent systems, runs 4,000 ATMs in Brazil,

43
0:02:22.289,000 --> 0:02:25,000
does income tax preparation for dozens of thousands.

44
0:02:25.646,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So this is not a simple business.

45
0:02:29.258,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We looked at it and we said,

46
0:02:31.386,000 --> 0:02:35,000
let's devolve to these people, let's give these people a company

47
0:02:36.254,000 --> 0:02:38,000
where we take away all the boarding school aspects

48
0:02:38.634,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of, this is when you arrive, this is how you dress,

49
0:02:41.023,000 --> 0:02:43,000
this is how you go to meetings, this is what you say,

50
0:02:43.585,000 --> 0:02:44,000
this is what you don't say,

51
0:02:44.906,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and let's see what's left.

52
0:02:46.412,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So we started this about 30 years ago,

53
0:02:48.242,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we started dealing with this very issue.

54
0:02:50.767,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And so we said, look, the retirement,

55
0:02:52.964,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the whole issue of how we distribute our graph of life.

56
0:02:56.106,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Instead of going mountain climbing when you're 82,

57
0:02:59.263,000 --> 0:03:01,000
why don't you do it next week?

58
0:03:01.436,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And we'll do it like this,

59
0:03:02.791,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we'll sell you back your Wednesdays for 10 percent of your salary.

60
0:03:07.187,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So now, if you were going to be a violinist, which you probably weren't,

61
0:03:11.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
you go and do this on Wednesday.

62
0:03:13.594,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And what we found --

63
0:03:14.941,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we thought, these are the older people

64
0:03:17.478,000 --> 0:03:19,000
who are going to be really interested in this program.

65
0:03:20.077,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And the average age of the first people who adhered

66
0:03:22.531,000 --> 0:03:23,000
were 29, of course.

67
0:03:23.979,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And so we started looking,

68
0:03:25.337,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and we said, we have to do things in a different way.

69
0:03:27.837,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So we started saying things like,

70
0:03:29.608,000 --> 0:03:31,000
why do we want to know what time you came to work,

71
0:03:31.982,000 --> 0:03:32,000
what time you left, etc.?

72
0:03:33.233,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Can't we exchange this for a contract

73
0:03:35.587,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for buying something from you, some kind of work?

74
0:03:39.049,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Why are we building these headquarters?

75
0:03:41.07,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Is it not an ego issue that we want to look solid

76
0:03:43.838,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and big and important?

77
0:03:45.717,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But we're dragging you two hours across town because of it?

78
0:03:49.001,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So we started asking questions one by one.

79
0:03:52.532,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We'd say it like this:

80
0:03:53.925,000 --> 0:03:55,000
One: How do we find people?

81
0:03:56.207,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We'd go out and try and recruit people and we'd say,

82
0:03:59.39,000 --> 0:04:,000
look, when you come to us,

83
0:04:00.943,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we're not going to have two or three interviews

84
0:04:03.165,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and then you're going to be married to us for life.

85
0:04:05.577,000 --> 0:04:07,000
That's not how we do the rest of our lives.

86
0:04:07.727,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, come have your interviews.

87
0:04:09.832,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Anyone who's interested in interviewing, you will show up.

88
0:04:13.268,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And then we'll see what happens out of the intuition that rises from that,

89
0:04:17.261,000 --> 0:04:21,000
instead of just filling out the little items of whether you're the right person.

90
0:04:21.303,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And then, come back.

91
0:04:23.42,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Spend an afternoon, spend a whole day, talk to anybody you want.

92
0:04:26.481,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Make sure we are the bride you thought we were

93
0:04:29.542,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and not all the bullshit we put into our own ads.

94
0:04:32.605,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:34.681,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Slowly we went to a process where we'd say things like,

96
0:04:38.377,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we don't want anyone to be a leader in the company

97
0:04:41.138,000 --> 0:04:43,000
if they haven't been interviewed and approved

98
0:04:43.281,000 --> 0:04:45,000
by their future subordinates.

99
0:04:46.132,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Every six months, everyone gets evaluated, anonymously, as a leader.

100
0:04:51.588,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And this determines whether they should continue in that leadership position,

101
0:04:55.62,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which is many times situational, as you know.

102
0:04:58.41,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And so if they don't have 70, 80 percent of a grade, they don't stay,

103
0:05:04.464,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which is probably the reason why I haven't been CEO for more than 10 years.

104
0:05:08.803,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And over time, we started asking other questions.

105
0:05:12.699,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We said things like,

106
0:05:14.215,000 --> 0:05:17,000
why can't people set their own salaries?

107
0:05:17.544,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What do they need to know?

108
0:05:19.12,000 --> 0:05:21,000
There's only three things you need to know:

109
0:05:21.183,000 --> 0:05:23,000
how much people make inside the company,

110
0:05:23.518,000 --> 0:05:25,000
how much people make somewhere else in a similar business

111
0:05:26.387,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and how much we make in general to see whether we can afford it.

112
0:05:29.679,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So let's give people these three pieces of information.

113
0:05:32.264,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So we started having, in the cafeteria,

114
0:05:34.272,000 --> 0:05:36,000
a computer where you could go in and you could ask

115
0:05:36.773,000 --> 0:05:38,000
what someone spent, how much someone makes,

116
0:05:38.97,000 --> 0:05:4,000
what they make in benefits, what the company makes,

117
0:05:41.45,000 --> 0:05:43,000
what the margins are, and so forth.

118
0:05:43.76,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And this is 25 years ago.

119
0:05:47.452,000 --> 0:05:49,000
As this information started coming to people,

120
0:05:50.187,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we said things like, we don't want to see your expense report,

121
0:05:53.296,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we don't want to know how many holidays you're taking,

122
0:05:55.892,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we don't want to know where you work.

123
0:05:57.78,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We had, at one point, 14 different offices around town,

124
0:06:00.756,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and we'd say, go to the one that's closest to your house,

125
0:06:04.15,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to the customer that you're going to visit today.

126
0:06:06.651,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Don't tell us where you are.

127
0:06:08.77,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And more, even when we had thousands of people, 5,000 people,

128
0:06:12.895,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we had two people in the H.R. department,

129
0:06:16.273,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and thankfully one of them has retired.

130
0:06:18.671,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Laughter)

131
0:06:20.63,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And so, the question we were asking was, how can we be taking care of people?

132
0:06:24.384,000 --> 0:06:25,000
People are the only thing we have.

133
0:06:26.187,000 --> 0:06:29,000
We can't have a department that runs after people and looks after people.

134
0:06:29.625,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So as we started finding that this worked, and we'd say, we're looking for --

135
0:06:35.006,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and this is, I think, the main thing I was looking for

136
0:06:37.701,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in the terminal days and in the company,

137
0:06:39.744,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which is, how do you set up for wisdom?

138
0:06:43.313,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We've come from an age of revolution, industrial revolution,

139
0:06:47.989,000 --> 0:06:49,000
an age of information, an age of knowledge,

140
0:06:50.672,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but we're not any closer to the age of wisdom.

141
0:06:53.284,000 --> 0:06:56,000
How we design, how do we organize, for more wisdom?

142
0:06:56.611,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So for example, many times,

143
0:06:58.154,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what's the smartest or the intelligent decision doesn't jive.

144
0:07:02.501,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So we'd say things like,

145
0:07:04.883,000 --> 0:07:08,000
let's agree that you're going to sell 57 widgets per week.

146
0:07:08.89,000 --> 0:07:11,000
If you sell them by Wednesday, please go to the beach.

147
0:07:12.563,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Don't create a problem for us, for manufacturing, for application,

148
0:07:16.274,000 --> 0:07:19,000
then we have to buy new companies, we have to buy our competitors,

149
0:07:19.377,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we have to do all kinds of things because you sold too many widgets.

150
0:07:22.599,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So go to the beach and start again on Monday.

151
0:07:24.835,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

152
0:07:27.271,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So the process is looking for wisdom.

153
0:07:30.61,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And in the process, of course, we wanted people to know everything,

154
0:07:34.15,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and we wanted to be truly democratic about the way we ran things.

155
0:07:37.519,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So our board had two seats open with the same voting rights,

156
0:07:43.21,000 --> 0:07:45,000
for the first two people who showed up.

157
0:07:45.328,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:46.896,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And so we had cleaning ladies voting on a board meeting,

159
0:07:52.132,000 --> 0:07:55,000
which had a lot of other very important people in suits and ties.

160
0:07:55.228,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And the fact is that they kept us honest.

161
0:07:58.857,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This process, as we started looking at the people who came to us,

162
0:08:02.606,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we'd say, now wait a second,

163
0:08:04.184,000 --> 0:08:06,000
people come to us and they say, where am I supposed to sit?

164
0:08:07.067,000 --> 0:08:1,000
How am I supposed to work? Where am I going to be in 5 years' time?

165
0:08:10.308,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And we looked at that and we said, we have to start much earlier.

166
0:08:13.386,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Where do we start?

167
0:08:14.409,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We said, oh, kindergarten seems like a good place.

168
0:08:16.924,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So we set up a foundation, which now has, for 11 years, three schools,

169
0:08:21.581,000 --> 0:08:23,000
where we started asking the same questions,

170
0:08:23.883,000 --> 0:08:25,000
how do you redesign school for wisdom?

171
0:08:26.795,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It is one thing to say, we need to recycle the teachers,

172
0:08:29.724,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we need the directors to do more.

173
0:08:31.401,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But the fact is that what we do with education is entirely obsolete.

174
0:08:37.333,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The teacher's role is entirely obsolete.

175
0:08:39.831,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Going from a math class, to biology, to 14th-century France is very silly.

176
0:08:45.482,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Applause)

177
0:08:50.184,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So we started thinking, what could it look like?

178
0:08:52.913,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And we put together people, including people who like education,

179
0:08:56.482,000 --> 0:09:01,000
people like Paulo Freire, and two ministers of education in Brazil

180
0:09:01.917,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and we said, if we were to design a school from scratch,

181
0:09:04.586,000 --> 0:09:05,000
what would it look like?

182
0:09:06.013,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And so we created this school, which is called Lumiar,

183
0:09:09.746,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and Lumiar, one of them is a public school,

184
0:09:11.898,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and Lumiar says the following:

185
0:09:13.704,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Let's divide this role of the teacher into two.

186
0:09:17.881,000 --> 0:09:19,000
One guy, we'll call a tutor.

187
0:09:20.242,000 --> 0:09:24,000
A tutor, in the old sense of the Greek "paideia": Look after the kid.

188
0:09:25.217,000 --> 0:09:28,000
What's happening at home, what's their moment in life, etc..

189
0:09:29.047,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But please don't teach,

190
0:09:30.387,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because the little you know compared to Google, we don't want to know.

191
0:09:33.797,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Keep that to yourself.

192
0:09:34.949,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:36.297,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now, we'll bring in people who have two things:

194
0:09:40.25,000 --> 0:09:44,000
passion and expertise, and it could be their profession or not.

195
0:09:44.617,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And we use the senior citizens,

196
0:09:46.534,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who are 25 percent of the population with wisdom that nobody wants anymore.

197
0:09:50.887,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So we bring them to school and we say,

198
0:09:53.494,000 --> 0:09:56,000
teach these kids whatever you really believe in.

199
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So we have violinists teaching math.

200
0:09:59.946,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We have all kinds of things where we say,

201
0:10:02.511,000 --> 0:10:04,000
don't worry about the course material anymore.

202
0:10:05.492,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We have approximately 10 great threads that go from 2 to 17.

203
0:10:10.456,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Things like, how do we measure ourselves as humans?

204
0:10:14.846,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So there's a place for math and physics and all that there.

205
0:10:18.472,000 --> 0:10:19,000
How do we express ourselves?

206
0:10:20.336,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So there's a place for music and literature, etc.,

207
0:10:22.741,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but also for grammar.

208
0:10:24.385,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And then we have things that everyone has forgotten,

209
0:10:27.042,000 --> 0:10:29,000
which are probably the most important things in life.

210
0:10:29.611,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The very important things in life, we know nothing about.

211
0:10:33.309,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We know nothing about love,

212
0:10:35.549,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we know nothing about death,

213
0:10:37.641,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we know nothing about why we're here.

214
0:10:39.718,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So we need a thread in school that talks about everything we don't know.

215
0:10:44.252,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So that's a big part of what we do.

216
0:10:46.356,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Applause)

217
0:10:51.951,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So over the years, we started going into other things.

218
0:10:54.869,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We'd say, why do we have to scold the kids

219
0:10:57.031,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and say, sit down and come here and do that, and so forth.

220
0:10:59.822,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We said, let's get the kids to do something we call a circle,

221
0:11:03.137,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which meets once a week.

222
0:11:04.402,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And we'd say, you put the rules together

223
0:11:06.712,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and then you decide what you want to do with it.

224
0:11:09.039,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So can you all hit yourself on the head?

225
0:11:11.221,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Sure, for a week, try.

226
0:11:13.543,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They came up with the very same rules that we had,

227
0:11:17.478,000 --> 0:11:18,000
except they're theirs.

228
0:11:18.869,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And then, they have the power,

229
0:11:21.114,000 --> 0:11:25,000
which means, they can and do suspend and expel kids

230
0:11:26.106,000 --> 0:11:31,000
so that we're not playing school, they really decide.

231
0:11:31.504,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And then, in this same vein,

232
0:11:34.547,000 --> 0:11:36,000
we keep a digital mosaic,

233
0:11:36.941,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because this is not constructivist or Montessori or something.

234
0:11:40.572,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's something where we keep the Brazilian curriculum

235
0:11:44.11,000 --> 0:11:46,000
with 600 tiles of a mosaic,

236
0:11:46.778,000 --> 0:11:49,000
which we want to expose these kids to by the time they're 17.

237
0:11:49.915,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And follow this all the time and we know how they're doing

238
0:11:52.75,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and we say, you're not interested in this now, let's wait a year.

239
0:11:56.804,000 --> 0:12:,000
And the kids are in groups that don't have an age category,

240
0:12:01.036,000 --> 0:12:04,000
so the six-year-old kid who is ready for that with an 11-year-old,

241
0:12:04.762,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that eliminates all of the gangs and the groups

242
0:12:07.127,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and this stuff that we have in the schools, in general.

243
0:12:11.012,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And they have a zero to 100 percent grading,

244
0:12:13.453,000 --> 0:12:16,000
which they do themselves with an app every couple of hours.

245
0:12:17.254,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Until we know they're 37 percent of the way we'd like them to be on this issue,

246
0:12:21.689,000 --> 0:12:25,000
so that we can send them out in the world with them knowing enough about it.

247
0:12:26.584,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And so the courses are World Cup Soccer, or building a bicycle.

248
0:12:31.827,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And people will sign up for a 45-day course on building a bicycle.

249
0:12:36.098,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Now, try to build a bicycle without knowing that pi is 3.1416.

250
0:12:40.667,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You can't.

251
0:12:42.431,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And try, any one of you, using 3.1416 for something.

252
0:12:47.083,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You don't know anymore.

253
0:12:48.589,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So this is lost and that's what we try to do there,

254
0:12:51.02,000 --> 0:12:53,000
which is looking for wisdom in that school.

255
0:12:53.134,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And that brings us back to this graph and this distribution of our life.

256
0:12:59.09,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I accumulated a lot of money when I think about it.

257
0:13:01.751,000 --> 0:13:05,000
When you think and you say, now is the time to give back --

258
0:13:05.998,000 --> 0:13:07,000
well, if you're giving back, you took too much.

259
0:13:08.67,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

260
0:13:16.822,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I keep thinking of Warren Buffet waking up one day

261
0:13:19.402,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and finding out he has 30 billion dollars more than he thought he had.

262
0:13:22.786,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And he looks and he says, what am I going to do with this?

263
0:13:25.578,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And he says, I'll give it to someone who really needs this.

264
0:13:28.415,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I'll give it to Bill Gates. (Laughter)

265
0:13:32.086,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And my guy, who's my financial advisor in New York,

266
0:13:35.236,000 --> 0:13:36,000
he says, look, you're a silly guy

267
0:13:37.129,000 --> 0:13:4,000
because you would have 4.1 times more money today

268
0:13:40.402,000 --> 0:13:44,000
if you had made money with money instead of sharing as you go.

269
0:13:44.668,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But I like sharing as you go better.

270
0:13:46.48,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Applause)

271
0:13:49.786,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I taught MBAs at MIT for a time

272
0:13:54.058,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and I ended up, one day, at the Mount Auburn Cemetery.

273
0:13:56.664,000 --> 0:13:57,000
It is a beautiful cemetery in Cambridge.

274
0:13:58.608,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And I was walking around. It was my birthday and I was thinking.

275
0:14:01.65,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And the first time around, I saw these tombstones

276
0:14:04.044,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and these wonderful people who'd done great things

277
0:14:06.817,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and I thought, what do I want to be remembered for?

278
0:14:10.889,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And I did another stroll around,

279
0:14:12.485,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and the second time, another question came to me,

280
0:14:14.93,000 --> 0:14:16,000
which did me better, which was,

281
0:14:17.233,000 --> 0:14:19,000
why do I want to be remembered at all?

282
0:14:20.12,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

283
0:14:22.257,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And that, I think, took me different places.

284
0:14:25.078,000 --> 0:14:29,000
When I was 50, my wife Fernanda and I sat for a whole afternoon,

285
0:14:29.326,000 --> 0:14:31,000
we had a big pit with fire,

286
0:14:31.508,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and I threw everything I had ever done into that fire.

287
0:14:35.084,000 --> 0:14:37,000
This is a book in 38 languages,

288
0:14:37.471,000 --> 0:14:4,000
hundreds and hundreds of articles and DVDs, everything there was.

289
0:14:41.018,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And that did two things.

290
0:14:42.438,000 --> 0:14:46,000
One, it freed our five kids from following in our steps, our shadow --

291
0:14:47.363,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They don't know what I do.

292
0:14:49.019,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Laughter)

293
0:14:50.243,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Which is good.

294
0:14:51.552,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And I'm not going to take them somewhere

295
0:14:53.477,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and say, one day all of this will be yours.

296
0:14:55.871,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

297
0:14:57.428,000 --> 0:15:,000
The five kids know nothing, which is good.

298
0:15:00.96,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And the second thing is,

299
0:15:02.641,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I freed myself from this anchor of past achievement or whatever.

300
0:15:07.339,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I'm free to start something new every time and to decide things from scratch

301
0:15:11.837,000 --> 0:15:13,000
in part of those terminal days.

302
0:15:13.958,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And some people would say,

303
0:15:15.375,000 --> 0:15:17,000
oh, so now you have this time, these terminal days,

304
0:15:17.913,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and so you go out and do everything.

305
0:15:19.771,000 --> 0:15:21,000
No, we've been to the beaches,

306
0:15:22.093,000 --> 0:15:24,000
so we've been to Samoa and Maldives and Mozambique,

307
0:15:24.655,000 --> 0:15:25,000
so that's done.

308
0:15:26.421,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I've climbed mountains in the Himalayas.

309
0:15:28.53,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I've gone down 60 meters to see hammerhead sharks.

310
0:15:32.401,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I've spent 59 days on the back of a camel from Chad to Timbuktu.

311
0:15:36.952,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I've gone to the magnetic North Pole on a dog sled.

312
0:15:40.943,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So, we've been busy.

313
0:15:42.719,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It's what I'd like to call my empty bucket list.

314
0:15:48.722,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Laughter)

315
0:15:51.701,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And with this rationale, I look at these days and I think,

316
0:15:55.258,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I'm not retired. I don't feel retired at all.

317
0:15:57.777,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And so I'm writing a new book.

318
0:15:59.918,000 --> 0:16:02,000
We started three new companies in the last two years.

319
0:16:03.731,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I'm now working on getting this school system for free out into the world,

320
0:16:08.934,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and I've found, very interestingly enough, that nobody wants it for free.

321
0:16:12.387,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And so I've been trying for 10 years

322
0:16:14.325,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to get the public system to take over this school rationale,

323
0:16:17.75,000 --> 0:16:19,000
much as the public schools we have,

324
0:16:20.145,000 --> 0:16:24,000
which has instead of 43 out of 100, as their rating, as their grades,

325
0:16:24.842,000 --> 0:16:26,000
has 91 out of 100.

326
0:16:27.531,000 --> 0:16:29,000
But for free, nobody wants it.

327
0:16:29.964,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So maybe we'll start charging for it and then it will go somewhere.

328
0:16:33.158,000 --> 0:16:36,000
But getting this out is one of the things we want to do.

329
0:16:36.939,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And I think what this leaves us as a message for all of you,

330
0:16:40.256,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I think is a little bit like this:

331
0:16:42.008,000 --> 0:16:45,000
We've all learned how to go on Sunday night

332
0:16:45.165,000 --> 0:16:47,000
to email and work from home.

333
0:16:47.582,000 --> 0:16:48,000
But very few of us have learned

334
0:16:49.292,000 --> 0:16:52,000
how to go to the movies on Monday afternoon.

335
0:16:52.422,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And if we're looking for wisdom, we need to learn to do that as well.

336
0:16:56.523,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And so, what we've done all of these years is very simple,

337
0:17:00.173,000 --> 0:17:03,000
is use the little tool, which is ask three whys in a row.

338
0:17:03.345,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Because the first why you always have a good answer for.

339
0:17:06.106,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The second why, it starts getting difficult.

340
0:17:08.521,000 --> 0:17:11,000
By the third why, you don't really know why you're doing what you're doing.

341
0:17:12.46,000 --> 0:17:18,000
What I want to leave you with is the seed and the thought that maybe if you do this,

342
0:17:18.688,000 --> 0:17:2,000
you will come to the question, what for?

343
0:17:21.444,000 --> 0:17:22,000
What am I doing this for?

344
0:17:22.946,000 --> 0:17:24,000
And hopefully, as a result of that, and over time,

345
0:17:25.827,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I hope that with this, and that's what I'm wishing you,

346
0:17:28.96,000 --> 0:17:3,000
you'll have a much wiser future.

347
0:17:31.663,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Thank you very much.

348
0:17:33.448,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Applause)

349
0:17:45.957,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Chris Anderson: So Ricardo, you're kind of crazy.

350
0:17:51.044,000 --> 0:17:52,000
(Laughter)

351
0:17:52.869,000 --> 0:17:55,000
To many people, this seems crazy.

352
0:17:56.049,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And yet so deeply wise, also.

353
0:17:59.438,000 --> 0:18:01,000
The pieces I'm trying to put together are this:

354
0:18:02.347,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Your ideas are so radical.

355
0:18:04.442,000 --> 0:18:09,000
How, in business, for example, these ideas have been out for a while,

356
0:18:10.191,000 --> 0:18:13,000
probably the percentage of businesses that have taken some of them

357
0:18:13.401,000 --> 0:18:14,000
is still quite low.

358
0:18:15.303,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Are there any times you've seen some big company

359
0:18:18.201,000 --> 0:18:21,000
take on one of your ideas and you've gone, "Yes!"?

360
0:18:21.83,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Ricardo Semler: It happens. It happened about two weeks ago

361
0:18:24.627,000 --> 0:18:26,000
with Richard Branson, with his people saying,

362
0:18:26.837,000 --> 0:18:28,000
oh, I don't want to control your holidays anymore,

363
0:18:29.369,000 --> 0:18:31,000
or Netflix does a little bit of this and that,

364
0:18:31.553,000 --> 0:18:33,000
but I don't think it's very important.

365
0:18:33.88,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I'd like to see it happen maybe a little bit in a bit of a missionary zeal,

366
0:18:37.634,000 --> 0:18:38,000
but that's a very personal one.

367
0:18:39.208,000 --> 0:18:43,000
But the fact is that it takes a leap of faith about losing control.

368
0:18:43.42,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And almost nobody who is in control is ready to take leaps of faith.

369
0:18:46.716,000 --> 0:18:48,000
It will have to come from kids and other people

370
0:18:49.056,000 --> 0:18:51,000
who are starting companies in a different way.

371
0:18:51.298,000 --> 0:18:52,000
CA: So that's the key thing?

372
0:18:52.806,000 --> 0:18:54,000
From your point of view the evidence is there,

373
0:18:55.005,000 --> 0:18:56,000
in the business point of view this works,

374
0:18:57.001,000 --> 0:18:59,000
but people just don't have the courage to -- (Whoosh)

375
0:18:59.709,000 --> 0:19:01,000
RS: They don't even have the incentive.

376
0:19:01.831,000 --> 0:19:03,000
You're running a company with a 90-day mandate.

377
0:19:04.587,000 --> 0:19:05,000
It's a quarterly report.

378
0:19:06.466,000 --> 0:19:08,000
If you're not good in 90 days, you're out.

379
0:19:08.684,000 --> 0:19:11,000
So you say, "Here's a great program that, in less than one generation --"

380
0:19:12.605,000 --> 0:19:13,000
And the guy says, "Get out of here."

381
0:19:14.529,000 --> 0:19:15,000
So this is the problem.

382
0:19:16.42,000 --> 0:19:18,000
(Laughter)

383
0:19:19.335,000 --> 0:19:24,000
CA: What you're trying to do in education seems to me incredibly profound.

384
0:19:24.651,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Everyone is bothered about their country's education system.

385
0:19:29.149,000 --> 0:19:31,000
No one thinks that we've caught up yet to a world

386
0:19:31.922,000 --> 0:19:33,000
where there's Google and all these technological options.

387
0:19:34.872,000 --> 0:19:37,000
So you've got actual evidence now that the kids so far going through your system,

388
0:19:38.742,000 --> 0:19:4,000
there's a dramatic increase in performance.

389
0:19:41.294,000 --> 0:19:43,000
How do we help you move these ideas forward?

390
0:19:43.859,000 --> 0:19:46,000
RS: I think it's that problem of ideas whose time has come.

391
0:19:48.75,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And I've never been very evangelical about these things.

392
0:19:52.252,000 --> 0:19:53,000
We put it out there.

393
0:19:53.793,000 --> 0:19:54,000
Suddenly, you find people --

394
0:19:55.238,000 --> 0:19:57,000
there's a group in Japan, which scares me very much,

395
0:19:57.753,000 --> 0:20:,000
which is called the Semlerists, and they have 120 companies.

396
0:20:00.918,000 --> 0:20:04,000
They've invited me. I've always been scared to go.

397
0:20:05.289,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And there is a group in Holland that has 600 small, Dutch companies.

398
0:20:10.464,000 --> 0:20:12,000
It's something that will flourish on its own.

399
0:20:13.141,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Part of it will be wrong, and it doesn't matter.

400
0:20:15.632,000 --> 0:20:17,000
This will find its own place.

401
0:20:17.709,000 --> 0:20:19,000
And I'm afraid of the other one, which says,

402
0:20:20.194,000 --> 0:20:21,000
this is so good you've got to do this.

403
0:20:22.126,000 --> 0:20:24,000
Let's set up a system and put lots of money into it

404
0:20:24.792,000 --> 0:20:26,000
and then people will do it no matter what.

405
0:20:27.319,000 --> 0:20:3,000
CA: So you have asked extraordinary questions your whole life.

406
0:20:30.563,000 --> 0:20:32,000
It seems to me that's the fuel that's driven a lot of this.

407
0:20:33.396,000 --> 0:20:38,000
Do you have any other questions for us, for TED, for this group here?

408
0:20:39.265,000 --> 0:20:43,000
RS: I always come back to variations of the question

409
0:20:43.854,000 --> 0:20:46,000
that my son asked me when he was three.

410
0:20:47.105,000 --> 0:20:5,000
We were sitting in a jacuzzi, and he said, "Dad, why do we exist?"

411
0:20:51.056,000 --> 0:20:52,000
There is no other question.

412
0:20:52.62,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Nobody has any other question.

413
0:20:54.134,000 --> 0:20:57,000
We have variations of this one question, from three onwards.

414
0:20:58.123,000 --> 0:21:03,000
So when you spend time in a company, in a bureaucracy, in an organization

415
0:21:03.519,000 --> 0:21:04,000
and you're saying, boy --

416
0:21:05.142,000 --> 0:21:07,000
how many people do you know who on their death beds said,

417
0:21:07.859,000 --> 0:21:09,000
boy, I wish I had spent more time at the office?

418
0:21:10.264,000 --> 0:21:15,000
So there's a whole thing of having the courage now --

419
0:21:15.314,000 --> 0:21:16,000
not in a week, not in two months,

420
0:21:17.222,000 --> 0:21:19,000
not when you find out you have something --

421
0:21:19.516,000 --> 0:21:21,000
to say, no, what am I doing this for?

422
0:21:22.388,000 --> 0:21:24,000
Stop everything. Let me do something else.

423
0:21:24.505,000 --> 0:21:25,000
And it will be okay,

424
0:21:26.07,000 --> 0:21:28,000
it will be much better than what you're doing,

425
0:21:28.341,000 --> 0:21:31,000
if you're stuck in a process.

426
0:21:31.449,000 --> 0:21:34,000
CA: So that strikes me as a profound and quite beautiful way to end

427
0:21:34.651,000 --> 0:21:35,000
this penultimate day of TED.

428
0:21:36.277,000 --> 0:21:37,000
Ricardo Semler, thank you so much.

429
0:21:37.955,000 --> 0:21:38,000
RS: Thank you so much.

430
0:21:39.532,000 --> 0:21:4,000
(Applause)

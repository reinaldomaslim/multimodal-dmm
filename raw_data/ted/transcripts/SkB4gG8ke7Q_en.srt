2
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In our culture we tend to see sex

3
0:00:15.042,000 --> 0:00:19,000
as something that's more important to men than it is to women.

4
0:00:19.417,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But that's not true.

5
0:00:21.042,000 --> 0:00:25,000
What is true is that women often feel more shame in talking about it.

6
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Over half of women quietly suffer from some kind of sexual dysfunction.

7
0:00:31.5,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We've been hearing more about the orgasm gap.

8
0:00:35.375,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's kind of like the wage gap but stickier ...

9
0:00:38.5,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:42.083,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Straight women tend to reach climax

11
0:00:44.667,000 --> 0:00:47,000
less than 60 percent of the time they have sex.

12
0:00:48.833,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Men reach climax 90 percent of the time they have sex.

13
0:00:53.833,000 --> 0:00:56,000
To address these issues, women have been sold flawed medication,

14
0:00:57.208,000 --> 0:00:59,000
testosterone creams ...

15
0:00:59.833,000 --> 0:01:02,000
even untested genital injections.

16
0:01:04.625,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The thing is, female sexuality can't be fixed with a pill.

17
0:01:09.958,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That's because it's not broken:

18
0:01:12.333,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it's misunderstood.

19
0:01:14.667,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Our culture has had a skewed and medically incorrect picture

20
0:01:19.167,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of female sexuality

21
0:01:21.167,000 --> 0:01:23,000
going back centuries.

22
0:01:23.708,000 --> 0:01:27,000
If over half of women have some kind of sexual problem,

23
0:01:28.458,000 --> 0:01:31,000
maybe our idea of sexuality doesn't work for women.

24
0:01:33.083,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We need a clearer understanding of how women actually work.

25
0:01:38.917,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'm a journalist,

26
0:01:40.208,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I recently wrote a book

27
0:01:41.667,000 --> 0:01:45,000
about how our understanding of female sexuality is evolving.

28
0:01:46.75,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So sexuality itself was defined back when men dominated science.

29
0:01:53.208,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Male scientists tended to see the female body

30
0:01:55.458,000 --> 0:01:57,000
through their own skewed lens.

31
0:01:57.625,000 --> 0:02:01,000
They could've just asked women about their experience.

32
0:02:01.833,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Instead they probed the female body like it was a foreign landscape.

33
0:02:07.417,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Even today we debate the existence of female ejaculation and the G-spot

34
0:02:13.25,000 --> 0:02:16,000
like we're talking about aliens or UFOs.

35
0:02:17.167,000 --> 0:02:19,000
"Are they really out there?"

36
0:02:19.583,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:22.042,000 --> 0:02:25,000
All this goes double for LGBTQI women's sexuality,

38
0:02:25.708,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which has been hated and erased in specific ways.

39
0:02:30.333,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Ignorance about the female body goes back centuries.

40
0:02:34.833,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It goes back to the beginning of modern medicine.

41
0:02:37.542,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Cast your mind back to the 16th century,

42
0:02:40.458,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a time of scientific revolution in Europe.

43
0:02:44.792,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Men of ideas were challenging old dogmas.

44
0:02:48.75,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They were building telescopes to gaze up at the stars.

45
0:02:52.75,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We were making progress ...

46
0:02:55.167,000 --> 0:02:56,000
sometimes.

47
0:02:56.708,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You see, the fathers of anatomy --

48
0:02:59.292,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I say "fathers" because, let's face it, they were all dudes --

49
0:03:03.542,000 --> 0:03:05,000
were poking about between women's legs

50
0:03:06.042,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and trying to classify what they saw.

51
0:03:09.833,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They weren't quite sure what to do with the clitoris.

52
0:03:14.5,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It didn't appear to have anything to do with making babies.

53
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The leading anatomist at the time declared

54
0:03:21.625,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that it was probably some kind of abnormal growth --

55
0:03:25.458,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:26.5,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and that any woman who had one was probably a hermaphrodite.

57
0:03:31.875,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It got so bad that parents would sometimes have their daughter's clitoris cut off

58
0:03:37.042,000 --> 0:03:39,000
if it was deemed too large.

59
0:03:39.333,000 --> 0:03:4,000
That's right.

60
0:03:40.625,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Something we think of today as female genital mutilation

61
0:03:44.667,000 --> 0:03:48,000
was practiced in the West as late as the 20th century.

62
0:03:49.958,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You have to wonder:

63
0:03:51.25,000 --> 0:03:54,000
if they were that confused about women's bodies,

64
0:03:54.458,000 --> 0:03:56,000
why didn't they just ask women for a little help?

65
0:03:58.667,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But you must be thinking, "All that was history.

66
0:04:02.375,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's a different world now.

67
0:04:04.708,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Women have everything.

68
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They have the birth control pill,

69
0:04:08.167,000 --> 0:04:12,000
they have sexting and Tinder and vajazzling."

70
0:04:12.458,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:15.542,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Things must be better now.

72
0:04:18.875,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But medical ignorance of the female body continues.

73
0:04:25.833,000 --> 0:04:27,000
How many of you recognize this?

74
0:04:28.875,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's the full structure of the clitoris.

75
0:04:32.041,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We think of the clitoris as this little pea-sized nub,

76
0:04:35.5,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but actually it extends deep into the body.

77
0:04:38.583,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Most of it lies under the skin.

78
0:04:40.917,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It contains almost as much erectile tissue as the penis.

79
0:04:46.375,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

80
0:04:48.333,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It looks a little like a swan.

81
0:04:49.958,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:51.917,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This sculpture is by an artist named Sophia Wallace

83
0:04:55.333,000 --> 0:04:58,000
as part of her "Cliteracy" project.

84
0:04:58.458,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:59.792,000 --> 0:05:01,000
She believes we need more "cliteracy,"

86
0:05:01.917,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it's true, considering that this structure

87
0:05:04.333,000 --> 0:05:09,000
was only fully 3-D mapped by researchers in 2009.

88
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That was after we finished mapping the entire human genome.

89
0:05:15.292,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This ignorance has real-life consequences.

91
0:05:23.667,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In a medical journal in 2005,

92
0:05:26.125,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Dr. Helen O'Connell, a urologist,

93
0:05:28.75,000 --> 0:05:32,000
warned her colleagues that this structure was still nowhere to be found

94
0:05:33.625,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in basic medical journals --

95
0:05:35.875,000 --> 0:05:36,000
textbooks like "Gray's Anatomy."

96
0:05:39.042,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This could have serious consequences for surgery.

97
0:05:43.667,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Take this in.

98
0:05:45.5,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Gentlemen:

99
0:05:46.917,000 --> 0:05:49,000
imagine if you were at risk of losing your penis

100
0:05:50.708,000 --> 0:05:53,000
because doctors weren't totally sure where it was

101
0:05:54.583,000 --> 0:05:55,000
or what it looked like.

102
0:05:57.958,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Unsurprisingly,

103
0:05:59.417,000 --> 0:06:03,000
many women aren't too clear on their own genital anatomy either.

104
0:06:03.5,000 --> 0:06:04,000
You can't really blame them.

105
0:06:04.917,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The clitoris is often missing from many sex-ed diagrams, too.

106
0:06:10.667,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Women can sense that their culture views their bodies with confusion at best,

107
0:06:16.083,000 --> 0:06:18,000
outright disdain and disgust at worst.

108
0:06:19.458,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Many women still view their own genitals as dirty or inadequate.

109
0:06:24.875,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They're increasingly comparing their vulvas

110
0:06:27.583,000 --> 0:06:31,000
with the neat and tiny ones they see in pornography.

111
0:06:32.75,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's one reason why labiaplasty is becoming a skyrocketing business

112
0:06:37.042,000 --> 0:06:39,000
among women and teen girls.

113
0:06:41.75,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Some people feel that all this is a trivial issue.

114
0:06:46.417,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I was writing my book when I was at a dinner party

115
0:06:48.958,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and someone said, "Isn't sexuality a first-world problem?

116
0:06:54.542,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Aren't women dealing with more important issues all over the world?"

117
0:06:59.5,000 --> 0:07:,000
Of course they are.

118
0:07:01.25,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But I think the impulse to trivialize sex is part of our problem.

119
0:07:06.5,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We live in a culture that seems obsessed with sex.

120
0:07:10.333,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We use it to sell everything.

121
0:07:13.417,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We tell women that looking sexy

122
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is one of the most important things you can do.

123
0:07:18.708,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But what we really do is we belittle sex.

124
0:07:21.833,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We reduce it to a sad shadow of what it truly is.

125
0:07:26.333,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Sex is more than just an act.

126
0:07:29.958,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I spoke with Dr. Lori Brotto,

127
0:07:31.75,000 --> 0:07:34,000
a psychologist who treats sexual issues in women,

128
0:07:35.25,000 --> 0:07:36,000
including survivors of trauma.

129
0:07:37.833,000 --> 0:07:42,000
She says the hundreds of women she sees all tend to repeat the same thing.

130
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
They say, "I don't feel whole."

131
0:07:47.292,000 --> 0:07:51,000
They feel they've lost a connection with their partners and themselves.

132
0:07:52.417,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So what is sex?

133
0:07:55.25,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We've traditionally defined the act of sex

134
0:07:58.208,000 --> 0:08:02,000
as a linear, goal-oriented process.

135
0:08:02.458,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's something that starts with lust,

136
0:08:05.167,000 --> 0:08:07,000
continues to heavy petting

137
0:08:08.125,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and finishes with a happy ending.

138
0:08:11.542,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Except many women don't experience it this way.

139
0:08:18.042,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's less linear for them and more circular.

140
0:08:22.875,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This is a new model of women's arousal and desire

141
0:08:26.292,000 --> 0:08:29,000
developed by Dr. Rosemary Basson.

142
0:08:29.458,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It says many things,

143
0:08:30.75,000 --> 0:08:34,000
including that women can begin an encounter for many different reasons

144
0:08:35.583,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that aren't desire,

145
0:08:37.208,000 --> 0:08:38,000
like curiosity.

146
0:08:39.583,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They can finish with a climax or multiple climaxes,

147
0:08:44.957,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or satisfaction without a climax at all.

148
0:08:49.5,000 --> 0:08:5,000
All options are normal.

149
0:08:52.957,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Some people are starting to champion a richer definition of sexuality.

150
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Whether you identify as male, female or neither gender,

151
0:09:03.292,000 --> 0:09:07,000
sex is about our relationship to the senses.

152
0:09:07.375,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's about slowing down,

153
0:09:09.917,000 --> 0:09:1,000
listening to the body,

154
0:09:11.708,000 --> 0:09:13,000
coming into the present moment.

155
0:09:14.667,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's about our whole health and well-being.

156
0:09:18.667,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In other words,

157
0:09:19.958,000 --> 0:09:23,000
sex at its true breadth isn't profane,

158
0:09:24.958,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it's sacred.

159
0:09:28.5,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That's one reason why women are redefining their sexuality today.

160
0:09:33.458,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They're asking: What is sex for me?

161
0:09:37.792,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So they're experimenting with practices that are less about the happy ending --

162
0:09:42.833,000 --> 0:09:44,000
more about feeling whole.

163
0:09:45.708,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So they're trying out spiritual sex classes,

164
0:09:48.917,000 --> 0:09:5,000
masturbation workshops --

165
0:09:51.125,000 --> 0:09:53,000
even shooting their own porn

166
0:09:53.667,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that celebrates the diversity of real bodies.

167
0:09:58.167,000 --> 0:10:02,000
For anyone who still feels this is a trivial issue, consider this:

168
0:10:02.583,000 --> 0:10:05,000
understanding your body is crucial to the huge issue

169
0:10:06.167,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of sex education and consent.

170
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:14,000
By deeply, intimately knowing what kind of touch feels right,

171
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
what pressure, what speed, what context,

172
0:10:18.792,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you can better know what kind of touch feels wrong

173
0:10:22.125,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and have the confidence to say so.

174
0:10:25.292,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This isn't ultimately about women having more or better sex.

175
0:10:29.5,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's not about making sure women have as many orgasms as men.

176
0:10:34.875,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's about accepting yourself and your own unique experience.

177
0:10:40.75,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's about you being the expert on your body.

178
0:10:44.708,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's about defining pleasure and satisfaction on your terms.

179
0:10:50.542,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And if that means you're happiest having no sex at all,

180
0:10:54.375,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that's perfect, too.

181
0:10:57.125,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If we define sex as part of our whole health and well-being,

182
0:11:01.333,000 --> 0:11:05,000
then empowering women and girls to fully own it

183
0:11:05.458,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is a crucial next step toward equality.

184
0:11:08.958,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And I think it would be a better world not just for women

185
0:11:13.042,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but for everyone.

186
0:11:14.708,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Thank you.

187
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Actually, I think it'll eventually

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
be seen as probably the single biggest idea

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that's emerged in the past century.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's the idea of computation.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now, of course, that idea has brought us

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
all of the computer technology we have today and so on.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But there's actually a lot more to computation than that.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
whose effects we've only just begun to see.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Well, I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
working on three large projects

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that really try to take the idea of computation seriously.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I started off at a young age as a physicist

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
using computers as tools.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Then, I started drilling down,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
thinking about the computations I might want to do,

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and how they could be automated as much as possible.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Eventually, I created a whole structure

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
based on symbolic programming and so on

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that let me build Mathematica.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we've been pouring more and more ideas

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and capabilities and so on into Mathematica,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in R & D and education,

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
lots of other areas.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Well, I have to admit, actually,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica:

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I wanted to use it myself,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
400 years ago.

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe,

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but at the computational universe.

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So we normally think of programs as being

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
complicated things that we build

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for very specific purposes.

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But what about the space of all possible programs?

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Here's a representation of a really simple program.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So, if we run this program,

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
this is what we get.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Very simple.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So let's try changing the rule

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
for this program a little bit.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now we get another result,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
still very simple.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Try changing it again.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
You get something a little bit more complicated.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But if we keep running this for a while,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
it has a very regular structure.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So the question is: Can anything else happen?

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Well, we can do a little experiment.

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Let's just do a little mathematical experiment, try and find out.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Let's just run all possible programs

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of the particular type that we're looking at.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They're called cellular automata.

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Most of them do very simple things,

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but if you look along all these different pictures,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
at rule number 30,

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you start to see something interesting going on.

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So let's take a closer look

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
at rule number 30 here.

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So here it is.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here,

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but we're getting all this amazing stuff.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's not at all what we're used to,

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I must say that, when I first saw this,

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
it came as a huge shock to my intuition.

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And, in fact, to understand it,

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I eventually had to create

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
a whole new kind of science.

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This science is different, more general,

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
than the mathematics-based science that we've had

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for the past 300 or so years.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You know, it's always seemed like a big mystery:

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
how nature, seemingly so effortlessly,

81
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
manages to produce so much

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that seems to us so complex.

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Well, I think we've found its secret:

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and quite often getting things like Rule 30

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or like this.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And knowing that starts to explain

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a lot of long-standing mysteries in science.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It also brings up new issues, though,

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
like computational irreducibility.

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I mean, we're used to having science let us predict things,

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but something like this

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is fundamentally irreducible.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The only way to find its outcome

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is, effectively, just to watch it evolve.

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's connected to, what I call,

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
the principle of computational equivalence,

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which tells us that even incredibly simple systems

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
can do computations as sophisticated as anything.

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to be able to do arbitrary computation;

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
just something that happens, naturally,

103
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
all over the place.

104
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Things with rules as simple as these can do it.

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Well, this has deep implications

106
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
about the limits of science,

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
about predictability and controllability

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
of things like biological processes or economies,

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
about intelligence in the universe,

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
about questions like free will

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and about creating technology.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You know, in working on this science for many years,

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I kept wondering,

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"What will be its first killer app?"

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Well, ever since I was a kid,

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and somehow making it computable.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
People like Leibniz had wondered about that too

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
300 years earlier.

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But I'd always assumed that to make progress,

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain.

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Well, then I got to thinking:

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different --

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and, by the way, I've now got

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
huge computation capabilities in Mathematica,

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to do large, seemingly crazy, projects --

128
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So I decided to just try to see

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we could make computable.

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So, it's been a big, very complex project,

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
which I was not sure was going to work at all.

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well.

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And last year we were able

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to release the first website version

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of Wolfram Alpha.

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that computes answers to questions.

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So let's give it a try.

140
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Let's start off with something really easy.

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Hope for the best.

142
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Very good. Okay.

143
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So far so good.

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Let's try something a little bit harder.

146
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Let's do

147
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
some mathy thing,

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and with luck it'll work out the answer

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and try and tell us some interesting things

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
things about related math.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We could ask it something about the real world.

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Let's say -- I don't know --

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
what's the GDP of Spain?

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And it should be able to tell us that.

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now we could compute something related to this,

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
let's say ... the GDP of Spain

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
divided by, I don't know,

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the -- hmmm ...

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
let's say the revenue of Microsoft.

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The idea is that we can just type this in,

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
this kind of question in, however we think of it.

163
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So let's try asking a question,

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
like a health related question.

165
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So let's say we have a lab finding that ...

166
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
you know, we have an LDL level of 140

167
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for a male aged 50.

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So let's type that in, and now Wolfram Alpha

169
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
will go and use available public health data

170
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and try and figure out

171
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
what part of the population that corresponds to and so on.

172
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Or let's try asking about, I don't know,

173
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the International Space Station.

174
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And what's happening here is that

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something;

176
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
it's computing, in real time,

177
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
where the International Space Station is right now at this moment,

178
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
how fast it's going, and so on.

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things.

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's got, by now,

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
pretty good coverage of everything you might find

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in a standard reference library.

183
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But the goal is to go much further

184
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and, very broadly, to democratize

185
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
all of this knowledge,

186
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and to try and be an authoritative

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
source in all areas.

188
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have,

189
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
not by searching what other people

190
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
may have written down before,

191
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but by using built in knowledge

192
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to compute fresh new answers to specific questions.

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now, of course, Wolfram Alpha

194
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is a monumentally huge, long-term project

195
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
with lots and lots of challenges.

196
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
For a start, one has to curate a zillion

197
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
different sources of facts and data,

198
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation

199
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and human domain experts for doing this.

200
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But that's just the beginning.

201
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Given raw facts or data

202
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to actually answer questions,

203
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
one has to compute:

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
one has to implement all those methods and models

205
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and algorithms and so on

206
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that science and other areas have built up over the centuries.

207
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Well, even starting from Mathematica,

208
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
this is still a huge amount of work.

209
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So far, there are about 8 million lines

210
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha

211
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
built by experts from many, many different fields.

212
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Well, a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha

213
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is that you can just ask it questions

214
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
using ordinary human language,

215
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which means that we've got to be able to take

216
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
all those strange utterances that people type into the input field

217
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and understand them.

218
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And I must say that I thought that step

219
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
might just be plain impossible.

220
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Two big things happened:

221
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
First, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics

222
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that came from studying the computational universe;

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge

224
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
completely changes how one can

225
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
set about understanding language.

226
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And, of course, now

227
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild,

228
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we can learn from its actual usage.

229
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And, in fact, there's been

230
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
an interesting coevolution that's been going on

231
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
between Wolfram Alpha

232
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and its human users,

233
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and it's really encouraging.

234
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Right now, if we look at web queries,

235
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time.

236
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And if you look at things like the iPhone app,

237
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the fraction is considerably larger.

238
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So, I'm pretty pleased with it all.

239
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But, in many ways,

240
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha.

241
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely

242
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and we're getting more confident.

243
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
showing up in more and more places,

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
working both with this kind of public data, like on the website,

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and with private knowledge

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
for people and companies and so on.

248
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one

249
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
a whole new kind of computing

250
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that one can call knowledge-based computing,

251
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in which one's starting not just from raw computation,

252
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge.

253
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And when one does that, one really changes

254
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the economics of delivering computational things,

255
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
whether it's on the web or elsewhere.

256
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
You know, we have a fairly interesting situation right now.

257
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
On the one hand, we have Mathematica,

258
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
with its sort of precise, formal language

259
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and a huge network

260
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of carefully designed capabilities

261
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
able to get a lot done in just a few lines.

262
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Let me show you a couple of examples here.

263
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming.

264
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Here's something where we're sort of

265
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
integrating a bunch of different capabilities here.

266
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Here we'll just create, in this line,

267
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a little user interface that allows us to

268
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
do something fun there.

269
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
If you go on, that's a slightly more complicated program

270
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things

271
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and creating user interface and so on.

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But it's something that is very precise stuff.

273
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's a precise specification with a precise formal language

274
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that causes Mathematica to know what to do here.

275
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Then on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha,

276
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
with all the messiness of the world

277
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and human language and so on built into it.

278
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So what happens when you put these things together?

279
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I think it's actually rather wonderful.

280
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica,

281
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you can, for example, make precise programs

282
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that call on real world data.

283
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Here's a real simple example.

284
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You can also just sort of give vague input

285
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and then try and have Wolfram Alpha

286
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
figure out what you're talking about.

287
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Let's try this here.

288
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But actually I think the most exciting thing about this

289
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is that it really gives one the chance

290
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to democratize programming.

291
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I mean, anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language.

292
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Then, the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
what precise pieces of code

294
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
can do what they're asking for

295
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
to build up bigger and bigger, precise programs.

297
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So, sometimes, Wolfram Alpha

298
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
will be able to do the whole thing immediately

299
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with.

300
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Here's a big website

301
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
where we've been collecting lots of educational

302
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things.

303
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I'll show you one example here.

304
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is just an example of one of these computable documents.

305
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
This is probably a fairly small

306
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
piece of Mathematica code

307
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that's able to be run here.

308
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Okay. Let's zoom out again.

309
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So, given our new kind of science,

310
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
is there a general way to use it to make technology?

311
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So, with physical materials,

312
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we're used to going around the world

313
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and discovering that particular materials

314
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
are useful for particular

315
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
technological purposes.

316
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Well, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing

317
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in the computational universe.

318
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there.

319
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The challenge is to see how to

320
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
harness them for human purposes.

321
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Something like Rule 30, for example,

322
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
turns out to be a really good randomness generator.

323
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Other simple programs are good models

324
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
for processes in the natural or social world.

325
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica

326
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
are actually now full of algorithms

327
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
that we discovered by searching the computational universe.

328
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And, for example, this -- if we go back here --

329
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
this has become surprisingly popular

330
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
among composers

331
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
finding musical forms by searching the computational universe.

332
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
In a sense, we can use the computational universe

333
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to get mass customized creativity.

334
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I'm hoping we can, for example,

335
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
use that even to get Wolfram Alpha

336
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly,

337
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff

338
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that no engineer

339
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with.

340
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Well, so, that leads to kind of an ultimate question:

341
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe

342
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
we might find our physical universe?

343
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Perhaps there's even some quite simple rule,

344
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
some simple program for our universe.

345
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Well, the history of physics would have us believe

346
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated.

347
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But in the computational universe,

348
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple

349
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior.

350
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe?

351
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
If the rules for the universe are simple,

352
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
it's kind of inevitable that they have to be

353
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
very abstract and very low level;

354
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
operating, for example, far below

355
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the level of space or time,

356
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
which makes it hard to represent things.

357
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But in at least a large class of cases,

358
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
one can think of the universe as being

359
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
like some kind of network,

360
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
which, when it gets big enough,

361
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
behaves like continuous space

362
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
in much the same way as having lots of molecules

363
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
can behave like a continuous fluid.

364
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Well, then the universe has to evolve by applying

365
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
little rules that progressively update this network.

366
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And each possible rule, in a sense,

367
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
corresponds to a candidate universe.

368
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Actually, I haven't shown these before,

369
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
but here are a few of the candidate universes

370
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that I've looked at.

371
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Some of these are hopeless universes,

372
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
completely sterile,

373
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space,

374
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
no notion of time, no matter,

375
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
other problems like that.

376
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years

377
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
is that you actually don't have to go very far

378
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
in the computational universe

379
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
before you start finding candidate universes

380
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that aren't obviously not our universe.

381
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Here's the problem:

382
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Any serious candidate for our universe

383
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
is inevitably full of computational irreducibility.

384
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Which means that it is irreducibly difficult

385
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
to find out how it will really behave,

386
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
and whether it matches our physical universe.

387
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
A few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover

388
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules

389
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that successfully reproduce special relativity,

390
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and even general relativity and gravitation,

391
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and at least give hints of quantum mechanics.

392
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So, will we find the whole of physics?

393
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I don't know for sure,

394
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
but I think at this point it's sort of

395
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
almost embarrassing not to at least try.

396
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Not an easy project.

397
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
One's got to build a lot of technology.

398
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
One's got to build a structure that's probably

399
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
at least as deep as existing physics.

400
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.

401
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Build a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.

402
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But I'll tell you, here today,

403
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
that I'm committed to seeing this project done,

404
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to see if, within this decade,

405
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
we can finally hold in our hands

406
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
the rule for our universe

407
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and know where our universe lies

408
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
in the space of all possible universes ...

409
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe,"

410
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and have it tell us.

411
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
(Laughter)

412
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
So I've been working on the idea of computation

413
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
now for more than 30 years,

414
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas

415
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
into millions of lines of code

416
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and grist for server farms and so on.

417
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
With every passing year,

418
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
I realize how much more powerful

419
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
the idea of computation really is.

420
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
It's taken us a long way already,

421
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
but there's so much more to come.

422
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
From the foundations of science

423
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
to the limits of technology

424
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
to the very definition of the human condition,

425
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I think computation is destined to be

426
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
the defining idea of our future.

427
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Thank you.

428
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
(Applause)

429
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Chris Anderson: That was astonishing.

430
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Stay here. I've got a question.

431
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
(Applause)

432
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
So, that was, fair to say, an astonishing talk.

433
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Are you able to say in a sentence or two

434
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
how this type of thinking

435
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
could integrate at some point

436
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of

437
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
as the fundamental explanations of the universe?

438
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Stephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics

439
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
that we kind of know to be true,

440
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
things like the standard model of physics:

441
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics

442
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
or it's simply wrong.

443
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
The things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so

444
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
with string theory and so on

445
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
have been an interesting exploration

446
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
that has tried to get back to the standard model,

447
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
but hasn't quite gotten there.

448
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing

449
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
may actually have considerable resonance

450
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
with what's been done in string theory,

451
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
but that's a complicated math thing

452
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
that I don't yet know how it's going to work out.

453
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
CA: Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience.

454
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
He also has shown how complexity

455
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
can arise out of a simple start.

456
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
Does your work relate to his?

457
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
SW: I think so.

458
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
I view Benoit Mandelbrot's work

459
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
as one of the founding contributions

460
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
to this kind of area.

461
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Benoit has been particularly interested

462
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
in nested patterns, in fractals and so on,

463
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
where the structure is something

464
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
that's kind of tree-like,

465
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches

466
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and even smaller branches and so on.

467
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
That's one of the ways

468
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
that you get towards true complexity.

469
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
I think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton

470
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
get us to a different level.

471
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
In fact, in a very precise way, they get us to a different level

472
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
because they seem to be things that are

473
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
capable of complexity

474
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ...

475
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
I could go on about this at great length, but I won't. (Laughter) (Applause)

476
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
CA: Stephen Wolfram, thank you.

477
0:19:49.26,000 --> 0:19:51,000
(Applause)

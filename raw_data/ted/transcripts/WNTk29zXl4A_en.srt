1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's Monday morning.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In Washington,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the president of the United States

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is sitting in the Oval Office,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
assessing whether or not

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to strike Al Qaeda

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in Yemen.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
At Number 10 Downing Street,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
David Cameron is trying to work out

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
whether to cut more public sector jobs

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in order to stave off a double-dip recession.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is standing at the door,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
listening to her baby crying and crying,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
trying to work out whether she should let it cry

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
until it falls asleep

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
or pick it up and hold it.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
trying to work out

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
whether I should let him drink

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that his doctors just came in and said,

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"You must make him drink today," --

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
my father's been nil by mouth for a week --

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
or whether, by giving him this bottle,

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I might actually kill him.

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We face momentous decisions

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
with important consequences

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
throughout our lives,

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We talk things over with our friends,

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we scour the Internet,

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we search through books.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But still,

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
even in this age

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of Google and TripAdvisor

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and Amazon Recommends,

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
it's still experts

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that we rely upon most --

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
especially when the stakes are high

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and the decision really matters.

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Because in a world of data deluge

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and extreme complexity,

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we believe that experts

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
are more able to process information than we can --

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that they are able to come to better conclusions

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
than we could come to on our own.

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And in an age

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that is sometimes nowadays frightening

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
or confusing,

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we feel reassured

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
by the almost parental-like authority

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of experts

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who tell us so clearly what it is

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we can and cannot do.

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But I believe

57
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that this is a big problem,

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a problem with potentially dangerous consequences

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
for us as a society,

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as a culture

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and as individuals.

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's not that experts

63
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
have not massively contributed to the world --

64
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of course they have.

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The problem lies with us:

66
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we've become addicted to experts.

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We've become addicted to their certainty,

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
their assuredness,

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
their definitiveness,

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and in the process,

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we have ceded our responsibility,

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
substituting our intellect

73
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and our intelligence

74
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for their supposed words of wisdom.

75
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We've surrendered our power,

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
trading off our discomfort

77
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with uncertainty

78
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
for the illusion of certainty

79
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that they provide.

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is no exaggeration.

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In a recent experiment,

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a group of adults

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
had their brains scanned in an MRI machine

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
as they were listening to experts speak.

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The results were quite extraordinary.

86
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
As they listened to the experts' voices,

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the independent decision-making parts of their brains

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
switched off.

89
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It literally flat-lined.

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And they listened to whatever the experts said

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and took their advice, however right or wrong.

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But experts do get things wrong.

93
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Did you know that studies show

94
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that doctors misdiagnose

95
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
four times out of 10?

96
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Did you know

97
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that if you file your tax returns yourself,

98
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you're statistically more likely

99
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to be filing them correctly

100
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
than if you get a tax adviser

101
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to do it for you?

102
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And then there's, of course, the example

103
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that we're all too aware of:

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
financial experts

105
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
getting it so wrong

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that we're living through the worst recession

107
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
since the 1930s.

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
For the sake of our health,

109
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
our wealth

110
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and our collective security,

111
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
it's imperative that we keep

112
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the independent decision-making parts of our brains

113
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
switched on.

114
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I'm saying this as an economist

115
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
who, over the past few years,

116
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
has focused my research

117
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
on what it is we think

118
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and who it is we trust and why,

119
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but also --

120
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I'm aware of the irony here --

121
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
as an expert myself,

122
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
as a professor,

123
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as somebody who advises prime ministers,

124
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
heads of big companies,

125
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
international organizations,

126
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but an expert who believes

127
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that the role of experts needs to change,

128
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that we need to become more open-minded,

129
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
more democratic

130
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and be more open

131
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to people rebelling against

132
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
our points of view.

133
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So in order to help you understand

134
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
where I'm coming from,

135
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
let me bring you into my world,

136
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the world of experts.

137
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now there are, of course, exceptions,

138
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.

139
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But what my research has shown me

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is that experts tend on the whole

141
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to form very rigid camps,

142
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that within these camps,

143
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
a dominant perspective emerges

144
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that often silences opposition,

145
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that experts move with the prevailing winds,

146
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
often hero-worshipping

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
their own gurus.

148
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Alan Greenspan's proclamations

149
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that the years of economic growth

150
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
would go on and on,

151
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
not challenged by his peers,

152
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
until after the crisis, of course.

153
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
You see,

154
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we also learn

155
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that experts are located,

156
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
are governed,

157
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
by the social and cultural norms

158
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of their times --

159
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
whether it be the doctors

160
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in Victorian England, say,

161
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
who sent women to asylums

162
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
for expressing sexual desire,

163
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
or the psychiatrists in the United States

164
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
who, up until 1973,

165
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
were still categorizing homosexuality

166
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
as a mental illness.

167
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And what all this means

168
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is that paradigms

169
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
take far too long to shift,

170
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that complexity and nuance are ignored

171
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and also that money talks --

172
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
because we've all seen the evidence

173
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
of pharmaceutical companies

174
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
funding studies of drugs

175
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that conveniently leave out

176
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
their worst side effects,

177
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or studies funded by food companies

178
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
of their new products,

179
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
massively exaggerating the health benefits

180
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
of the products they're about to bring by market.

181
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The study showed that food companies exaggerated

182
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
typically seven times more

183
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
than an independent study.

184
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And we've also got to be aware

185
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that experts, of course,

186
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
also make mistakes.

187
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They make mistakes every single day --

188
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
mistakes born out of carelessness.

189
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
A recent study in the Archives of Surgery

190
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
reported surgeons

191
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
removing healthy ovaries,

192
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
operating on the wrong side of the brain,

193
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
carrying out procedures on the wrong hand,

194
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
elbow, eye, foot,

195
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
A common thinking error

197
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
of radiologists, for example --

198
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
when they look at CT scans --

199
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is that they're overly influenced

200
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
by whatever it is

201
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that the referring physician has said

202
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that he suspects

203
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the patient's problem to be.

204
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So if a radiologist

205
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is looking at the scan

206
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,

207
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
what happens is that,

208
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
if they see evidence

209
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
of pneumonia on the scan,

210
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
they literally stop looking at it --

211
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
thereby missing the tumor

212
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
sitting three inches below

213
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on the patient's lungs.

214
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I've shared with you so far

215
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
some insights into the world of experts.

216
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
These are, of course,

217
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
not the only insights I could share,

218
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but I hope they give you a clear sense at least

219
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of why we need to stop kowtowing to them,

220
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
why we need to rebel

221
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and why we need to switch

222
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
our independent decision-making capabilities on.

223
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But how can we do this?

224
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Well for the sake of time,

225
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I want to focus on just three strategies.

226
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
First, we've got to be ready and willing

227
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to take experts on

228
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and dispense with this notion of them

229
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
as modern-day apostles.

230
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.

231
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in every single subject,

232
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you'll be relieved to hear.

233
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But it does mean persisting

234
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in the face of their inevitable annoyance

235
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
when, for example,

236
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we want them to explain things to us

237
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in language that we can actually understand.

238
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Why was it that, when I had an operation,

239
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
my doctor said to me,

240
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Beware, Ms. Hertz,

241
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
of hyperpyrexia,"

242
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
when he could have just as easily said,

243
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
"Watch out for a high fever."

244
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
You see, being ready to take experts on

245
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is about also being willing

246
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to dig behind their graphs,

247
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
their equations, their forecasts,

248
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
their prophecies,

249
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and being armed with the questions to do that --

250
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
questions like:

251
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
What are the assumptions that underpin this?

252
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
What is the evidence upon which this is based?

253
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
What has your investigation focused on?

254
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And what has it ignored?

255
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It recently came out

256
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that experts trialing drugs

257
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
before they come to market

258
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
typically trial drugs

259
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
first, primarily on male animals

260
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and then, primarily on men.

261
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact

262
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that over half the world's population are women.

263
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And women have drawn the short medical straw

264
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
because it now turns out that many of these drugs

265
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
don't work nearly as well on women

266
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
as they do on men --

267
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and the drugs that do work well work so well

268
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that they're actively harmful for women to take.

269
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Being a rebel is about recognizing

270
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that experts' assumptions

271
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and their methodologies

272
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
can easily be flawed.

273
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Second,

274
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
we need to create the space

275
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for what I call "managed dissent."

276
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
If we are to shift paradigms,

277
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
if we are to make breakthroughs,

278
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
if we are to destroy myths,

279
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
we need to create an environment

280
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in which expert ideas are battling it out,

281
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in which we're bringing in

282
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
new, diverse, discordant, heretical views

283
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
into the discussion,

284
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
fearlessly,

285
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in the knowledge that progress comes about,

286
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
not only from the creation of ideas,

287
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but also from their destruction --

288
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and also from the knowledge

289
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that, by surrounding ourselves

290
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
by divergent, discordant,

291
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
heretical views.

292
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
All the research now shows us

293
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that this actually makes us smarter.

294
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion

295
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
because it goes against our very instincts,

296
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which are to surround ourselves

297
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
with opinions and advice

298
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that we already believe

299
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
or want to be true.

300
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And that's why I talk about the need

301
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to actively manage dissent.

302
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Google CEO Eric Schmidt

303
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is a practical practitioner

304
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
of this philosophy.

305
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room --

306
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
arms crossed, looking a bit bemused --

307
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and draws them into the discussion,

308
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
trying to see if they indeed are

309
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the person with a different opinion,

310
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
so that they have dissent within the room.

311
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Managing dissent

312
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
is about recognizing the value

313
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
of disagreement, discord

314
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and difference.

315
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But we need to go even further.

316
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We need to fundamentally redefine

317
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
who it is that experts are.

318
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The conventional notion

319
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is that experts are people

320
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
with advanced degrees,

321
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
fancy titles, diplomas,

322
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
best-selling books --

323
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
high-status individuals.

324
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But just imagine

325
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
if we were to junk

326
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
this notion of expertise

327
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
as some sort of elite cadre

328
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and instead embrace the notion

329
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
of democratized expertise --

330
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
whereby expertise was not just the preserve

331
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
of surgeons and CEO's,

332
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
but also shop-girls -- yeah.

333
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Best Buy,

334
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the consumer electronics company,

335
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
gets all its employees --

336
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the cleaners, the shop assistants,

337
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the people in the back office,

338
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
not just its forecasting team --

339
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
to place bets, yes bets,

340
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
on things like whether or not

341
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
a product is going to sell well before Christmas,

342
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
on whether customers' new ideas

343
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
are going to be or should be taken on by the company,

344
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
on whether a project

345
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
will come in on time.

346
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
By leveraging

347
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and by embracing

348
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the expertise within the company,

349
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Best Buy was able to discover, for example,

350
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that the store that it was going to open in China --

351
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
its big, grand store --

352
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
was not going to open on time.

353
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Because when it asked its staff,

354
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
all its staff, to place their bets

355
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
on whether they thought the store would open on time or not,

356
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
a group from the finance department

357
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
placed all their chips

358
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
on that not happening.

359
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
It turned out that they were aware,

360
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
as no one else within the company was,

361
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
of a technological blip

362
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that neither the forecasting experts,

363
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
nor the experts on the ground in China,

364
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
were even aware of.

365
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
The strategies

366
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that I have discussed this evening --

367
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
embracing dissent,

368
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
taking experts on,

369
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
democratizing expertise,

370
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
rebellious strategies --

371
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
are strategies that I think

372
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
would serve us all well to embrace

373
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
as we try to deal with the challenges

374
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
of these very confusing, complex,

375
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
difficult times.

376
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
For if we keep

377
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
our independent decision-making part

378
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
of our brains switched on,

379
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,

380
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
if we devolve authority,

381
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
if we are rebellious,

382
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
but also

383
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
if we become much more comfortable

384
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
with nuance,

385
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
uncertainty and doubt,

386
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and if we allow our experts

387
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
to express themselves

388
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
using those terms too,

389
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
we will set ourselves up

390
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
much better

391
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
for the challenges of the 21st century.

392
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
For now, more than ever,

393
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
is not the time

394
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to be blindly following,

395
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
blindly accepting,

396
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
blindly trusting.

397
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Now is the time to face the world

398
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
with eyes wide open --

399
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
yes, using experts

400
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
to help us figure things out, for sure --

401
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here --

402
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
but being aware

403
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
of their limitations

404
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and, of course, also our own.

405
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Thank you.

406
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
(Applause)

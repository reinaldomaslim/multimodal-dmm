1
0:00:13.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
You know me.

2
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I am in your friendship circle hidden in plain sight.

3
0:00:20.56,000 --> 0:00:22,000
My clothes are still impeccable --

4
0:00:23.24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
bought in the good years when I was still making money.

5
0:00:27.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
To look at me you would not know

6
0:00:28.8,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that my electricity was cut off last week for nonpayment,

7
0:00:32.92,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or that I meet the eligibility requirements for food stamps.

8
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But if you paid attention,

9
0:00:38.72,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you would see that sadness in my eyes --

10
0:00:40.96,000 --> 0:00:44,000
hear that hint of fear in my otherwise self-assured voice.

11
0:00:46.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
These days I'm buying the $1.99 trial-size jug of Tide

12
0:00:50.48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to make ends meet.

13
0:00:51.72,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I bet you didn't know laundry detergent came in that size.

14
0:00:55.96,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You invite me to the same expensive restaurants

15
0:00:58.2,000 --> 0:01:,000
the two of us have always enjoyed,

16
0:01:00.36,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but I order mineral water now with a twist of lemon,

17
0:01:02.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
not the 12-dollar glass of chardonnay.

18
0:01:06.92,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I am frugal in my menu choices.

19
0:01:09.08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Meticulous, I count every penny in my head.

20
0:01:12.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I demur dividing the table bill evenly to cover desserts and designer coffees

21
0:01:18.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and second and third glasses of wine I did not consume.

22
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I am tired of trying to fake appearances.

23
0:01:27.92,000 --> 0:01:3,000
A friend told me that I'm broke not poor, and there is a difference.

24
0:01:31.4,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I live without cable, my gym membership

25
0:01:33.76,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and nail appointments.

26
0:01:35.04,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I've discovered I can do my own hair.

27
0:01:37.56,000 --> 0:01:38,000
There is no retirement savings,

28
0:01:39.2,000 --> 0:01:4,000
no nest egg.

29
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I exhausted that long ago.

30
0:01:44.12,000 --> 0:01:47,000
There is no expensive condo to draw equity

31
0:01:47.44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and no husband to back me up.

32
0:01:50.12,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Months of slow pay and no pay have decimated my credit.

33
0:01:55.4,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Bill collectors call constantly,

34
0:01:57.48,000 --> 0:01:59,000
reading verbatim from a script

35
0:01:59.88,000 --> 0:02:02,000
before expressing polite sympathy for my plight

36
0:02:03.04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and then demanding payment arrangements I can't possibly meet.

37
0:02:07.48,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Friends wonder privately how someone so well educated

38
0:02:11.56,000 --> 0:02:13,000
could be in economic free fall.

39
0:02:15.2,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I'm still as talented as ever and smart as a whip,

40
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but work is sketchy now,

41
0:02:20.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
mostly on and off consulting gigs.

42
0:02:23.76,000 --> 0:02:27,000
At 55 I've learned how to fake cheeriness,

43
0:02:29.28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but there are not many opportunities for work anymore.

44
0:02:34.08,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I don't remember exactly when it stopped,

45
0:02:36.96,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but I cannot deny now having entered

46
0:02:39.4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the uncertain world of formerly and used to be.

47
0:02:43.56,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm not sure anymore where I belong.

48
0:02:47.04,000 --> 0:02:5,000
What I do know is that dozens of online job applications

49
0:02:50.76,000 --> 0:02:52,000
seem to just disappear into a black hole.

50
0:02:54.44,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I'm wondering what is to become of me.

51
0:02:57.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So far my health has held up,

52
0:03:00.68,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but my body aches -- or is it my spirit?

53
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Homeless women used to be invisible to me

54
0:03:07.84,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but I appraise them now with curious eyes,

55
0:03:10.8,000 --> 0:03:12,000
wondering if their stories started like mine.

56
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I wrote this piece a year ago.

57
0:03:17.04,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's a composite of my story and other women I know.

58
0:03:20.68,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I wrote it because I was tired of pretending

59
0:03:23.36,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I was all right when I wasn't.

60
0:03:25.52,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I was tired of faking normal.

61
0:03:28.84,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I wasn't seeing myself in the popular press.

62
0:03:32.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Nobody I knew was traveling the world or buying a condo in Costa Rica.

63
0:03:37.6,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Very few of my friends had set aside the 15 to 20 percent

64
0:03:42.04,000 --> 0:03:48,000
experts tell us we need to maintain our standard of living in retirement.

65
0:03:49.04,000 --> 0:03:51,000
My friends, many in their 50s and 60s,

66
0:03:51.24,000 --> 0:03:53,000
were looking at a downward mobility,

67
0:03:53.52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a work-for-life proposition,

68
0:03:55.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
just a job loss, medical diagnosis or divorce away from insolvency.

69
0:04:02.64,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We may not have hit rock bottom,

70
0:04:05.8,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but many of us saw a sequence of events

71
0:04:09.4,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where rock bottom was possible for the first time.

72
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And the truth is, it really doesn't take much.

73
0:04:17.32,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The median household in the US

74
0:04:19.52,000 --> 0:04:23,000
only has enough savings to replace one month of income.

75
0:04:24.08,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Forty-seven percent of us

76
0:04:25.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
cannot pull together 400 dollars to deal with an emergency.

77
0:04:30.079,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That's almost half of us.

78
0:04:31.959,000 --> 0:04:35,000
A major car repair and we're standing on the abyss.

79
0:04:36.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You wouldn't know it to look around you --

80
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I'm not the only one in this situation.

81
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:45,000
There are people in this room who are in the same predicament,

82
0:04:46.04,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and if it's not you,

83
0:04:47.28,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it is your parents or your sister or maybe your best friend.

84
0:04:52.72,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We get good at faking normal.

85
0:04:55.64,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Shame keeps us silent and siloed.

86
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
When I first decided I was going to come out with my story,

87
0:05:03.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I did a website

88
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and a friend noticed that there were no photos of me --

89
0:05:07.4,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it was all kind of cartoons like this.

90
0:05:11.8,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Even as I was coming out,

91
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I was still hiding.

92
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We live in a world where success is defined by income.

93
0:05:25.32,000 --> 0:05:28,000
When you say that you have money problems,

94
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you're announcing pretty much that you're a loser.

95
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
When you're a graduate of Harvard Business School as I am,

96
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:36,000
you're some kind of double loser.

97
0:05:37.72,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We boomers hear a lot about how we have underfunded our retirement;

98
0:05:42.96,000 --> 0:05:43,000
how it's all our fault.

99
0:05:44.8,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Why on earth would we draw down our 401(k) plan to cover the shortfall

100
0:05:49.88,000 --> 0:05:52,000
on our mother-in-law's nursing home care,

101
0:05:53.44,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or to pay for our kid's tuition, or just to survive?

102
0:05:57.56,000 --> 0:06:,000
We're accused of being poor planners and deadbeats --

103
0:06:00.76,000 --> 0:06:04,000
all that money we spent on lattes and bottled water.

104
0:06:05.44,000 --> 0:06:08,000
To shame and blame is so deliciously tempting.

105
0:06:09.88,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Many of us don't even wait for others to do it

106
0:06:12.2,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we're so busy doing it to ourselves.

107
0:06:15.2,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I say let's own our part:

108
0:06:17.28,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we all could have saved more.

109
0:06:19.44,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I know I could have saved more,

110
0:06:21.6,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and if you were to rifle through my life over the last 30 years,

111
0:06:27.8,000 --> 0:06:3,000
you would see more than one dumb thing I have done financially.

112
0:06:31.68,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I can't change that now

113
0:06:34.04,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and neither can you,

114
0:06:35.96,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but let's not mix up individual, isolated behavior

115
0:06:41.36,000 --> 0:06:42,000
with the systemic factors

116
0:06:43.28,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that have caused a 7.7-trillion-dollar retirement income gap.

117
0:06:49.2,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Millions of boomer-age Americans did not land here

118
0:06:52.52,000 --> 0:06:54,000
because of too many trips to Starbucks.

119
0:06:56.12,000 --> 0:07:,000
We spent the last three decades dealing with flat and falling wages

120
0:07:00.68,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and disappearing pensions

121
0:07:02.36,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and through-the-roof cost

122
0:07:03.96,000 --> 0:07:05,000
on housing and health care and education.

123
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It used to not be like this.

124
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We all remember the three-legged retirement income stool

125
0:07:15.36,000 --> 0:07:2,000
which had the savings and pension and social security.

126
0:07:21.32,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Well, that stool has gone wobbly.

127
0:07:23.6,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Take savings -- what savings?

128
0:07:25.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
For many families,

129
0:07:26.76,000 --> 0:07:29,000
there's just nothing left to save after the bills have been paid.

130
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The pension leg of the stool has also gone wobbly.

131
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We can remember when many people had pensions.

132
0:07:36.96,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Today only 13 percent of American workers are employed by companies that offer them.

133
0:07:43.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So what did we get instead?

134
0:07:44.96,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We got 401(k)-type plans

135
0:07:47.76,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and suddenly responsibility for retirement planning got shifted

136
0:07:51.72,000 --> 0:07:53,000
from our companies to us.

137
0:07:54.48,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We got the reigns but we also got the risk,

138
0:07:57.88,000 --> 0:08:,000
and it turns out that millions of us just aren't that good

139
0:08:01.88,000 --> 0:08:04,000
at voluntarily investing over 40 years.

140
0:08:05.8,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Millions of us just aren't that good at managing market risk.

141
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And really the numbers tell the story.

142
0:08:13.44,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Half of all American households have no retirement savings at all.

143
0:08:19.04,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That would be zero.

144
0:08:20.28,000 --> 0:08:22,000
No 401(k), no IRA, not a dime.

145
0:08:23.52,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Among 55-to-64-year-olds who do have a retirement account,

146
0:08:28.44,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the median value of that account is 104,000 dollars.

147
0:08:33.84,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, 104,000 dollars does sound better than zero,

148
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but as an annuity, it generates about 300 dollars.

149
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I don't have to tell you that you can't live on that.

150
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:48,000
With savings down,

151
0:08:48.76,000 --> 0:08:5,000
pensions becoming a relic of the past

152
0:08:51.64,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and 401(k) plans failing millions of Americans,

153
0:08:55.64,000 --> 0:08:58,000
many near-retirees are dependent on social security

154
0:08:59.2,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as their retirement plan.

155
0:09:01.84,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But here's the problem.

156
0:09:03.12,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Social security was never supposed to be the retirement plan.

157
0:09:07.64,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's not nearly enough.

158
0:09:08.92,000 --> 0:09:1,000
At best it replaces something like 40 percent

159
0:09:11.88,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of your pre-retirement income.

160
0:09:15.72,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Things have changed a lot

161
0:09:17.12,000 --> 0:09:21,000
from when social security was introduced back in 1935.

162
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Then, a 21-year-old male had a 50 percent chance

163
0:09:26.2,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of living until he was 65.

164
0:09:29.44,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So he retired at 60,

165
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
did a little fishing, kissed his grandkids,

166
0:09:34.76,000 --> 0:09:35,000
got his gold watch --

167
0:09:36.44,000 --> 0:09:39,000
he'd be dead within five years of receiving benefits.

168
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:42,000
That's not the pattern today.

169
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
If you're in your late 50s and in good health,

170
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:49,000
you're going to live easily another 20 or 25 years.

171
0:09:49.64,000 --> 0:09:51,000
That's a really long time to make ends meet

172
0:09:52.28,000 --> 0:09:53,000
if you are broke.

173
0:09:54.36,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So what's the play if you've landed here

174
0:09:57.4,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and you're 50 or 55 or 60?

175
0:10:00.76,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What's the play if you don't want to land here

176
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and you're 22 or 32?

177
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Here's what I've learned from my own experience.

178
0:10:10.72,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The cavalry's not coming.

179
0:10:12.96,000 --> 0:10:13,000
There is no big rescue,

180
0:10:14.84,000 --> 0:10:15,000
no prince charming,

181
0:10:16.24,000 --> 0:10:18,000
no big bailout in the works.

182
0:10:19.08,000 --> 0:10:24,000
To have a shot at something other than being old and poor in America,

183
0:10:24.36,000 --> 0:10:27,000
we're going to have to save ourselves and each other.

184
0:10:28.92,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I've had to come out of the shadows,

185
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
stand here openly,

186
0:10:37.96,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and I'm inviting you to do so as well.

187
0:10:40.96,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I'm not going to tell you that it's not easy.

188
0:10:44.24,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I ventured though to tell my story

189
0:10:47.08,000 --> 0:10:51,000
because I thought it would make it a little easier for people to tell theirs.

190
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I think it's only through our strength in numbers

191
0:10:54.92,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that we can begin to change the national "la-la" conversation

192
0:10:59.6,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that we are having on this retirement crisis.

193
0:11:03.4,000 --> 0:11:08,000
With so many of us shell-shocked and adrift about what has happened to us,

194
0:11:08.56,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we're going to have to build up from the grassroots,

195
0:11:12.72,000 --> 0:11:14,000
forming what I think are resilience circles.

196
0:11:15.68,000 --> 0:11:19,000
These are small groups of people coming together

197
0:11:19.92,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to talk about what has happened to them,

198
0:11:23.12,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to share resources and information

199
0:11:25.56,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and to begin to figure out a way forward.

200
0:11:28.76,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I believe from this base that we can find our voices again

201
0:11:32.96,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and sound the alarm --

202
0:11:34.56,000 --> 0:11:38,000
start pushing our institutions and policymakers

203
0:11:39.04,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to go hard on this retirement crisis with the urgency it deserves.

204
0:11:43.96,000 --> 0:11:44,000
In the meantime --

205
0:11:45.44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and there is an "in the meantime" --

206
0:11:47.56,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we're going to have to adopt a live-low-to-the-ground mindset,

207
0:11:52.44,000 --> 0:11:55,000
drastically cutting back on our expenses.

208
0:11:55.72,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I don't mean just living within our means.

209
0:12:00.48,000 --> 0:12:02,000
A lot of people are already doing that.

210
0:12:04.32,000 --> 0:12:06,000
What is called for now is to,

211
0:12:07.12,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in a much deeper way,

212
0:12:09.44,000 --> 0:12:11,000
ask ourselves what it really means

213
0:12:11.76,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to live a life that is not defined by things.

214
0:12:15.92,000 --> 0:12:16,000
I call it "smalling up."

215
0:12:18.6,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Smalling up is figuring out what you really need

216
0:12:22.2,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to feel contented and grounded.

217
0:12:25.6,000 --> 0:12:3,000
I have a friend who drives really beat-up, raggedy cars,

218
0:12:30.64,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but he will scrimp and save 15,000 dollars at one point

219
0:12:36.32,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to buy a flute

220
0:12:37.56,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because music is what really matters to him.

221
0:12:40.92,000 --> 0:12:41,000
He smalled up.

222
0:12:43.28,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I've had to also let go of magical thinking --

223
0:12:45.76,000 --> 0:12:48,000
this idea that if I just was patient enough

224
0:12:49.76,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and tightened my belt

225
0:12:51.04,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that things would go back to normal.

226
0:12:53.44,000 --> 0:12:57,000
If I just sent in one more CV

227
0:12:57.6,000 --> 0:13:,000
or applied to one more job online

228
0:13:00.84,000 --> 0:13:02,000
or attended one more networking event

229
0:13:03.68,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that surely I'd get the kind of job I was used to having.

230
0:13:07.44,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Surely things would return to normal.

231
0:13:10.6,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The truth is I'm not going back and neither are you.

232
0:13:15.52,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The normal that we knew is over.

233
0:13:19.56,000 --> 0:13:21,000
In this new place that we are,

234
0:13:21.72,000 --> 0:13:24,000
we're going to be asked to do things that we don't want to do.

235
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We're going to be asked to take assignments

236
0:13:28.08,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that we think are beneath our station and our talent

237
0:13:31.96,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and our skill.

238
0:13:33.4,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I have had to get off my throne.

239
0:13:36.88,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Last year, a good friend of mine asked me if I would help her

240
0:13:40.12,000 --> 0:13:41,000
with some organization work.

241
0:13:41.64,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I assumed she meant community organizing

242
0:13:44.48,000 --> 0:13:48,000
along the lines of what President Obama did in Chicago.

243
0:13:48.6,000 --> 0:13:5,000
She meant organizing somebody's closet.

244
0:13:51.6,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I said, "I'm not doing that."

245
0:13:53.04,000 --> 0:13:55,000
She said, "Get off your throne. Money is green."

246
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It's not easy being part of the advance team

247
0:14:01.92,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that is ushering in this new era of work and living.

248
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
First is always hardest.

249
0:14:08.12,000 --> 0:14:11,000
First is before there are networks

250
0:14:11.4,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and pathways and role models ...

251
0:14:14.8,000 --> 0:14:19,000
before there are policies and ways to show us

252
0:14:20.56,000 --> 0:14:21,000
how to go forward.

253
0:14:23.04,000 --> 0:14:26,000
We're in the middle of a seismic shift,

254
0:14:26.2,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and we're going to have to find bridgework to get us through.

255
0:14:31.08,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Bridgework is what we do in the meantime;

256
0:14:33.72,000 --> 0:14:34,000
bridgework is what we do

257
0:14:35.28,000 --> 0:14:37,000
while we're trying to figure out what is next.

258
0:14:38.44,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Bridgework is also letting go of this notion

259
0:14:41.08,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that our worth and our value depend on our income

260
0:14:45.68,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and our titles and our jobs.

261
0:14:48.24,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Bridgework can look crazy or cool depending on how you were rolling

262
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
when your personal financial crisis hit.

263
0:14:55.44,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I have friends with PhDs who are working at the Container Store

264
0:14:59.28,000 --> 0:15:01,000
or driving Uber or Lyft,

265
0:15:01.4,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and then I have other friends who are partnering with other boomers

266
0:15:05.28,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and doing really cool entrepreneurial ventures.

267
0:15:09.96,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Bridgework doesn't mean that we don't want

268
0:15:14.36,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to build on our past careers,

269
0:15:16.28,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that we don't want meaningful work.

270
0:15:19.36,000 --> 0:15:2,000
We do.

271
0:15:20.68,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Bridgework is what we do in the meantime

272
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
while we're figuring out what is next.

273
0:15:28.12,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I've also learned to think strategy not failure

274
0:15:31.72,000 --> 0:15:36,000
when I'm sort of processing all these things that I don't want to do.

275
0:15:37.52,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And I say that that's an approach

276
0:15:39.48,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that I would invite you to consider as well.

277
0:15:42.28,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So if you need to move in with your brother to make ends meet,

278
0:15:46.64,000 --> 0:15:47,000
call him.

279
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:53,000
If you need to take in a boarder to help you pay your mortgage

280
0:15:53.52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
or pay your rent,

281
0:15:55.04,000 --> 0:15:56,000
do it.

282
0:15:56.28,000 --> 0:15:58,000
If you need to get food stamps,

283
0:15:58.64,000 --> 0:15:59,000
get the darn food stamps.

284
0:16:00.6,000 --> 0:16:05,000
AARP says only a third of older adults who are eligible actually get them.

285
0:16:07.2,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Do what you need to do to go another round.

286
0:16:11.44,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Know that there are millions of us.

287
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Come out of the shadows.

288
0:16:17.48,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Cut back,

289
0:16:18.72,000 --> 0:16:19,000
small up;

290
0:16:20.08,000 --> 0:16:22,000
think strategy, not failure;

291
0:16:23.44,000 --> 0:16:24,000
get off your throne

292
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and find the bridgework to get your through the lean times.

293
0:16:30.8,000 --> 0:16:33,000
As a country, we have achieved longevity,

294
0:16:34.32,000 --> 0:16:39,000
investing billions of dollars in the diagnosis, treatment

295
0:16:39.56,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and management of disease.

296
0:16:41.88,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It's not enough to just live a long time.

297
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
We want to live well.

298
0:16:48.96,000 --> 0:16:53,000
We haven't invested nearly as much in the physical infrastructure

299
0:16:54.28,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to ensure that that happens.

300
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
We need now a new way of thinking

301
0:17:00.6,000 --> 0:17:03,000
about what it means to be old in America.

302
0:17:04.56,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And we need guidance and ideas about how to live

303
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
a richly textured life

304
0:17:12.2,000 --> 0:17:14,000
on a much more modest income.

305
0:17:15.04,000 --> 0:17:18,000
So I am calling on change agents

306
0:17:18.359,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and social entrepreneurs,

307
0:17:20.44,000 --> 0:17:21,000
artists and elders

308
0:17:22.319,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and impact investors.

309
0:17:23.839,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I'm calling on developers and disrupters of the status quo.

310
0:17:29.079,000 --> 0:17:31,000
We need you to help us imagine

311
0:17:33.76,000 --> 0:17:38,000
how to invest in the services and products and infrastructure

312
0:17:39.24,000 --> 0:17:41,000
that will support our dignity,

313
0:17:41.76,000 --> 0:17:44,000
our independence and our well-being

314
0:17:44.96,000 --> 0:17:47,000
in these many, many decades that we're going to live.

315
0:17:49.04,000 --> 0:17:53,000
My journey has taken me from a place of fear and shame

316
0:17:53.48,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to one of humility and understanding.

317
0:17:56.76,000 --> 0:18:,000
I'm ready now to link shields with others,

318
0:18:00.92,000 --> 0:18:02,000

Translator: Thu-Huong Ha Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:15.946,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is the skyline of my hometown, New Orleans.

3
0:00:21.026,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It was a great place to grow up,

4
0:00:23.663,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but it's one of the most vulnerable spots in the world.

5
0:00:27.398,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Half the city is already below sea level.

6
0:00:30.105,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In 2005, the world watched as New Orleans

7
0:00:33.557,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.

8
0:00:37.06,000 --> 0:00:43,000
One thousand, eight hundred and thirty-six people died. Nearly 300,000 homes were lost.

9
0:00:43.27,000 --> 0:00:45,000
These are my mother's, at the top --

10
0:00:45.541,000 --> 0:00:46,000
although that's not her car,

11
0:00:46.995,000 --> 0:00:48,000
it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof --

12
0:00:49.543,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and that's my sister's, below.

13
0:00:51.641,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Fortunately, they and other family members got out in time,

14
0:00:55.493,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but they lost their homes, and as you can see,

15
0:00:57.708,000 --> 0:00:59,000
just about everything in them.

16
0:01:00.558,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Other parts of the world have been hit by storms

17
0:01:02.868,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in even more devastating ways.

18
0:01:04.852,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath

19
0:01:07.73,000 --> 0:01:1,000
killed 138,000 in Myanmar.

20
0:01:11.072,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Climate change is affecting our homes, our communities,

21
0:01:14.504,000 --> 0:01:16,000
our way of life. We should be preparing

22
0:01:16.952,000 --> 0:01:19,000
at every scale and at every opportunity.

23
0:01:20.609,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This talk is about being prepared for, and resilient to

24
0:01:24.464,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes

25
0:01:27.25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and our collective home, the Earth.

26
0:01:29.804,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The changes in these times won't affect us all equally.

27
0:01:34.156,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There are important distributional consequences,

28
0:01:36.466,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and they're not what you always might think.

29
0:01:38.634,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In New Orleans, the elderly and female-headed households

30
0:01:41.876,000 --> 0:01:43,000
were among the most vulnerable.

31
0:01:44.156,000 --> 0:01:46,000
For those in vulnerable, low-lying nations,

32
0:01:46.244,000 --> 0:01:48,000
how do you put a dollar value on losing your country

33
0:01:49.092,000 --> 0:01:53,000
where you ancestors are buried? And where will your people go?

34
0:01:53.612,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And how will they cope in a foreign land?

35
0:01:55.743,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Will there be tensions over immigration,

36
0:01:57.82,000 --> 0:02:,000
or conflicts over competition for limited resources?

37
0:02:01.316,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur.

38
0:02:06.308,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Like it or not, ready or not, this is our future.

39
0:02:11.125,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Sure, some are looking for opportunities in this new world.

40
0:02:14.652,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom

41
0:02:17.676,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice.

42
0:02:21.108,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But while there might be some short-term individual winners,

43
0:02:24.37,000 --> 0:02:27,000
our collective losses will far outweigh them.

44
0:02:27.908,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle

45
0:02:30.171,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to cope with mounting catastrophic losses

46
0:02:32.227,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from extreme weather events.

47
0:02:34.653,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The military gets it. They call climate change

48
0:02:37.508,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security,

49
0:02:40.749,000 --> 0:02:42,000
while governments around the world are evaluating

50
0:02:43.638,000 --> 0:02:45,000
how to respond.

51
0:02:45.685,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt?

52
0:02:49.86,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'd like to share three sets of examples, starting with

53
0:02:52.891,000 --> 0:02:54,000
adapting to violent storms and floods.

54
0:02:55.86,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans,

55
0:02:58.548,000 --> 0:03:,000
with sections knocked out in Katrina, have been rebuilt

56
0:03:01.421,000 --> 0:03:04,000
21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge.

57
0:03:05.396,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And these raised and energy-efficient homes

58
0:03:07.942,000 --> 0:03:09,000
were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right

59
0:03:10.804,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for the hard-hit Ninth Ward.

60
0:03:13.62,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The devastated church my mom attends has been

61
0:03:16.716,000 --> 0:03:18,000
not only rebuilt higher, it's poised to become

62
0:03:19.388,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the first Energy Star church in the country.

63
0:03:22.02,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They're selling electricity back to the grid

64
0:03:24.14,000 --> 0:03:27,000
thanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more.

65
0:03:27.787,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars.

66
0:03:30.364,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way,

67
0:03:34.677,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind.

68
0:03:39.573,000 --> 0:03:42,000
For example, in Galveston, here's a resilient home

69
0:03:43.356,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that survived Hurricane Ike,

70
0:03:45.804,000 --> 0:03:47,000
when others on neighboring lots clearly did not.

71
0:03:48.42,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And around the world, satellites and warning systems

72
0:03:51.597,000 --> 0:03:55,000
are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.

73
0:03:56.005,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But as important as technology and infrastructure are,

74
0:03:59.117,000 --> 0:04:02,000
perhaps the human element is even more critical.

75
0:04:02.853,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We need better planning and systems for evacuation.

76
0:04:06.236,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We need to better understand how people make decisions

77
0:04:09.325,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in times of crisis, and why.

78
0:04:11.421,000 --> 0:04:15,000
While it's true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation,

79
0:04:15.533,000 --> 0:04:18,000
others who did refused to leave as the storm approached,

80
0:04:18.733,000 --> 0:04:21,000
often because available transportation and shelters

81
0:04:22.555,000 --> 0:04:24,000
refused to allow them to take their pets.

82
0:04:25.069,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue.

83
0:04:30.089,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Fortunately in 2006, Congress passed

84
0:04:32.964,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act (Laughter)

85
0:04:36.438,000 --> 0:04:4,000
— it spells "PETS" — to change that.

86
0:04:40.976,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Second, preparing for heat and drought.

87
0:04:43.861,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia

88
0:04:46.734,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to Africa, from Australia to Oklahoma,

89
0:04:49.238,000 --> 0:04:51,000
while heat waves linked with climate change

90
0:04:51.605,000 --> 0:04:53,000
have killed tens of thousands of people

91
0:04:54.006,000 --> 0:05:,000
in Western Europe in 2003, and again in Russia in 2010.

92
0:05:00.238,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In Ethiopia, 70 percent, that's 7-0 percent of the population,

93
0:05:05.189,000 --> 0:05:07,000
depends on rainfall for its livelihood.

94
0:05:07.798,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Oxfam and Swiss Re, together with Rockefeller Foundation,

95
0:05:11.51,000 --> 0:05:14,000
are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces

96
0:05:15.166,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and find other ways to conserve water,

97
0:05:17.797,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but they're also providing for insurance when the droughts do come.

98
0:05:21.798,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The stability this provides is giving the farmers

99
0:05:24.156,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the confidence to invest.

100
0:05:25.982,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's giving them access to affordable credit.

101
0:05:28.624,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's allowing them to become more productive so that

102
0:05:30.272,000 --> 0:05:33,000
they can afford their own insurance over time, without assistance.

103
0:05:34.182,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's a virtuous cycle, and one that could be replicated

104
0:05:36.826,000 --> 0:05:38,000
throughout the developing world.

105
0:05:39.177,000 --> 0:05:41,000
After a lethal 1995 heat wave

106
0:05:42.022,000 --> 0:05:44,000
turned refrigerator trucks from the popular

107
0:05:44.622,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues,

108
0:05:47.815,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Chicago became a recognized leader,

109
0:05:50.062,000 --> 0:05:52,000
tamping down on the urban heat island impact

110
0:05:52.893,000 --> 0:05:53,000
through opening cooling centers,

111
0:05:54.91,000 --> 0:05:57,000
outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods, planting trees,

112
0:05:58.119,000 --> 0:06:,000
creating cool white or vegetated green roofs.

113
0:06:01.046,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is City Hall's green roof, next to Cook County's [portion of the] roof,

114
0:06:04.69,000 --> 0:06:07,000
which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface.

115
0:06:08.206,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Washington, D.C., last year, actually led the nation

116
0:06:12.302,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in new green roofs installed, and they're funding this in part

117
0:06:15.614,000 --> 0:06:18,000
thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags.

118
0:06:19.068,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They're splitting the cost of installing these green roofs

119
0:06:21.854,000 --> 0:06:22,000
with home and building owners.

120
0:06:23.566,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact

121
0:06:26.097,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but they save energy, and therefore money,

122
0:06:28.454,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the emissions that cause climate change,

123
0:06:30.607,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and they also reduce stormwater runoff.

124
0:06:33.102,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins.

125
0:06:37.854,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Third, adapting to rising seas.

126
0:06:41.616,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems, agriculture,

127
0:06:45.262,000 --> 0:06:48,000
even major cities. This is what one to two meters

128
0:06:48.646,000 --> 0:06:5,000
of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta.

129
0:06:51.646,000 --> 0:06:53,000
That's where half of Vietnam's rice is grown.

130
0:06:54.297,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Infrastructure is going to be affected.

131
0:06:57.43,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Airports around the world are located on the coast.

132
0:06:59.95,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It makes sense, right? There's open space,

133
0:07:01.974,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the planes can take off and land without worrying about

134
0:07:04.619,000 --> 0:07:06,000
creating noise or avoiding tall buildings.

135
0:07:06.834,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Here's just one example, San Francisco Airport,

136
0:07:09.97,000 --> 0:07:11,000
with 16 inches or more of flooding.

137
0:07:12.684,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting

138
0:07:15.586,000 --> 0:07:18,000
this vital infrastructure with levees.

139
0:07:18.94,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But there might be some changes in store

140
0:07:20.869,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that you might not imagine. For example,

141
0:07:23.076,000 --> 0:07:25,000
planes require more runway for takeoff

142
0:07:25.637,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because the heated, less dense air, provides for less lift.

143
0:07:29.503,000 --> 0:07:32,000
San Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars

144
0:07:32.988,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment,

145
0:07:36.178,000 --> 0:07:39,000
as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater,

146
0:07:39.508,000 --> 0:07:41,000
causing backups at the plant, harming the bacteria

147
0:07:42.477,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that are needed to treat the waste.

148
0:07:44.168,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted

149
0:07:46.288,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to shut seawater off from entering the system.

150
0:07:49.444,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Beyond these technical solutions, our work

151
0:07:52.372,000 --> 0:07:53,000
at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities

152
0:07:54.14,000 --> 0:07:57,000
encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available

153
0:07:57.908,000 --> 0:08:,000
and to consider how they can accommodate change.

154
0:08:01.484,000 --> 0:08:03,000
For example, in land use, which areas do you want

155
0:08:04.436,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to protect, through adding a seawall, for example,

156
0:08:07.396,000 --> 0:08:1,000
alter, by raising buildings, or retreat from,

157
0:08:11.172,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to allow the migration of important natural systems,

158
0:08:13.98,000 --> 0:08:15,000
such as wetlands or beaches?

159
0:08:16.707,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Other examples to consider. In the U.K.,

160
0:08:18.964,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge.

161
0:08:22.418,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The Asian Cities Climate [Change] Resilience Network

162
0:08:24.964,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves.

163
0:08:28.162,000 --> 0:08:31,000
These are not only important ecosystems in their own right,

164
0:08:31.252,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities.

165
0:08:35.548,000 --> 0:08:38,000
New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms,

166
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
as you can see from this clever sign, and to sea level rise,

167
0:08:42.943,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and to storm surge, as you can see from the subway flooding.

168
0:08:46.103,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But back above ground, these raised ventilation grates

169
0:08:49.513,000 --> 0:08:51,000
for the subway system show that solutions can be both

170
0:08:52.061,000 --> 0:08:54,000
functional and attractive. In fact, in New York,

171
0:08:54.727,000 --> 0:08:57,000
San Francisco and London, designers have envisioned

172
0:08:57.879,000 --> 0:08:59,000
ways to better integrate the natural and built environments

173
0:09:00.767,000 --> 0:09:02,000
with climate change in mind.

174
0:09:03.175,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I think these are inspiring examples of what's possible

175
0:09:06.079,000 --> 0:09:09,000
when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different.

176
0:09:09.246,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But now, a word of caution.

177
0:09:12.264,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Adaptation's too important to be left to the experts.

178
0:09:15.143,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Why? Well, there are no experts.

179
0:09:18.495,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We're entering uncharted territory, and yet

180
0:09:21.815,000 --> 0:09:24,000
our expertise and our systems are based on the past.

181
0:09:25.711,000 --> 0:09:27,000
"Stationarity" is the notion that we can anticipate the future

182
0:09:28.688,000 --> 0:09:3,000
based on the past, and plan accordingly,

183
0:09:31.559,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and this principle governs much of our engineering,

184
0:09:34.012,000 --> 0:09:37,000
our design of critical infrastructure, city water systems,

185
0:09:37.061,000 --> 0:09:41,000
building codes, even water rights and other legal precedents.

186
0:09:41.182,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms.

187
0:09:44.311,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We're operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations

188
0:09:48.671,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years.

189
0:09:53.178,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The larger point I'm trying to make is this.

190
0:09:56.491,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It's up to us to look at our homes and our communities,

191
0:10:00.187,000 --> 0:10:02,000
our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk,

192
0:10:02.874,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and to find ways to not just survive, but to thrive,

193
0:10:06.419,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and it's up to us to plan and to prepare

194
0:10:09.163,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and to call on our government leaders and require them

195
0:10:11.759,000 --> 0:10:13,000
to do the same, even while they address

196
0:10:13.819,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the underlying causes of climate change.

197
0:10:17.058,000 --> 0:10:18,000
There are no quick fixes.

198
0:10:18.714,000 --> 0:10:21,000
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions.

199
0:10:21.989,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We're all learning by doing.

200
0:10:23.898,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But the operative word is doing.

201
0:10:28.003,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Thank you.

202
0:10:29.306,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

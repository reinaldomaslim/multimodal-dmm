1
0:00:12.933,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So in 2011,

2
0:00:14.557,000 --> 0:00:16,000
someone broke into my sister's office

3
0:00:16.741,000 --> 0:00:18,000
at the university where she teaches in Nigeria.

4
0:00:20.277,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now thankfully, the person was caught, arrested and charged to court.

5
0:00:25.182,000 --> 0:00:26,000
When I get into court,

6
0:00:26.887,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the clerks who were assigned to my sister's case informed her

7
0:00:30.292,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that they wouldn't be able to process the paperwork

8
0:00:32.783,000 --> 0:00:33,000
unless she paid a bribe.

9
0:00:35.035,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, at first she thought it was part of a practical joke.

10
0:00:38.348,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But then she realized they were serious.

11
0:00:40.74,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And then she became furious.

12
0:00:42.653,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I mean, think about it: here she was, the recent victim of a crime,

13
0:00:47.765,000 --> 0:00:49,000
with the very people who were supposed to help her,

14
0:00:50.761,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and they were demanding a bribe from her.

15
0:00:53.906,000 --> 0:00:55,000
That's just one of the many ways

16
0:00:56.114,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that corruption impacts millions of people in my country.

17
0:01:00.252,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You know, growing up in Nigeria,

18
0:01:02.073,000 --> 0:01:05,000
corruption permeated virtually every element of the society.

19
0:01:06.182,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Reports of politicians embezzling millions of dollars were common.

20
0:01:11.463,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Police officers stealing money

21
0:01:14.035,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or extorting money from everyday hardworking citizens

22
0:01:17.597,000 --> 0:01:18,000
was routine practice.

23
0:01:20.214,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I felt that development could never actually happen,

24
0:01:23.974,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so long as corruption persisted.

25
0:01:27.279,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But over the past several years,

26
0:01:28.964,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in my research on innovation and prosperity,

27
0:01:32.436,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I've learned that corruption is actually not the problem hindering our development.

28
0:01:37.794,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In fact,

29
0:01:38.969,000 --> 0:01:41,000
conventional thinking on corruption and its relationship to development

30
0:01:42.884,000 --> 0:01:47,000
is not only wrong, but it's holding many poor countries backwards.

31
0:01:48.827,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So, the thinking goes like this:

32
0:01:50.754,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in a society that's poor and corrupt,

33
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:57,000
our best shot at reducing corruption is to create good laws,

34
0:01:57.497,000 --> 0:01:58,000
enforce them well,

35
0:01:59.044,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and this will make way for development and innovation to flourish.

36
0:02:03.631,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, it makes sense on paper,

37
0:02:05.147,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which is why many governments and development organizations

38
0:02:08.343,000 --> 0:02:1,000
invest billions of dollars annually

39
0:02:11.092,000 --> 0:02:14,000
on institutional reform and anti-corruption programs.

40
0:02:15.354,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But many of these programs fail to reduce corruption,

41
0:02:18.595,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because we have the equation backwards.

42
0:02:21.729,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You see, societies don't develop because they've reduced corruption.

43
0:02:26.965,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They're able to reduce corruption because they've developed.

44
0:02:32.034,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And societies develop through investments in innovation.

45
0:02:37.156,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, at first, I thought this was impossible.

46
0:02:39.29,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Why would anyone in their right mind

47
0:02:41.102,000 --> 0:02:44,000
invest in a society where, at least on the surface,

48
0:02:44.559,000 --> 0:02:46,000
it seems a terrible place to do business?

49
0:02:47.094,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You know, a society where politicians are corrupt

50
0:02:50.066,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and consumers are poor?

51
0:02:52.39,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But then, the more I learned about

52
0:02:54.109,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the relationship between innovation and corruption,

53
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the more I started to see things differently.

54
0:03:01.073,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Here's how this played out in sub-Saharan Africa

55
0:03:04.072,000 --> 0:03:07,000
as the region developed its telecommunications industry.

56
0:03:08.096,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In the late 1990s,

57
0:03:09.533,000 --> 0:03:13,000
fewer than five percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa had phones.

58
0:03:13.7,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In Nigeria, for example, the country had more than 110 million people

59
0:03:18.656,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but fewer than half a million phones in the whole nation.

60
0:03:22.084,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now, this scarcity fueled widespread corruption in the industry.

61
0:03:26.6,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I mean, public officials who worked for the state-owned phone companies

62
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
demanded bribes from people who wanted phones.

63
0:03:32.918,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And because most people couldn't afford to pay the bribes,

64
0:03:35.677,000 --> 0:03:37,000
phones were only available to those who were wealthy.

65
0:03:39.314,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Then an entrepreneur named Mo Ibrahim

66
0:03:41.692,000 --> 0:03:44,000
decided that he would set up a telecommunications company

67
0:03:45.01,000 --> 0:03:46,000
on the continent.

68
0:03:46.721,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, when he told his colleagues about his idea, they just laughed at him.

69
0:03:50.927,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But Mo Ibrahim was undeterred.

70
0:03:52.76,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so in 1998, he set up Celtel.

71
0:03:57.116,000 --> 0:04:,000
The company provided affordable mobile phones and cell service

72
0:04:00.524,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to millions of Africans,

73
0:04:02.224,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in some of the poorest and most corrupt countries in the region --

74
0:04:05.839,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I mean countries such as Congo, Malawi,

75
0:04:08.689,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Sierra Leone and Uganda.

76
0:04:12.401,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You see, in our research, we call what Mo Ibrahim built

77
0:04:15.871,000 --> 0:04:17,000
a "market-creating innovation."

78
0:04:19.208,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Market-creating innovations transform complicated and expensive products

79
0:04:24.155,000 --> 0:04:26,000
into products that are simple and affordable,

80
0:04:26.319,000 --> 0:04:29,000
so that many more people in society could access them.

81
0:04:30.775,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now in this case, phones were expensive

82
0:04:32.915,000 --> 0:04:34,000
before Celtel made them much more affordable.

83
0:04:36.855,000 --> 0:04:39,000
As other investors -- some of his colleagues, actually --

84
0:04:39.884,000 --> 0:04:42,000
saw that it was possible to create a successful mobile phone company

85
0:04:43.697,000 --> 0:04:44,000
on the continent,

86
0:04:45.036,000 --> 0:04:48,000
they flooded in with billions of dollars of investments.

87
0:04:48.374,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And this led to significant growth in the industry.

88
0:04:52.187,000 --> 0:04:54,000
From barely nothing in 2000,

89
0:04:54.617,000 --> 0:04:56,000
today, virtually every African country now has

90
0:04:57.431,000 --> 0:04:59,000
a vibrant mobile telecommunications industry.

91
0:05:00.756,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The sector now supports close to one billion phone connections,

92
0:05:05.246,000 --> 0:05:08,000
it has created nearly four million jobs

93
0:05:08.477,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and generates billions of dollars in taxes every year.

94
0:05:13.002,000 --> 0:05:17,000
These are taxes that governments can now reinvest into the economy

95
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to build their institutions.

96
0:05:20.114,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And here's the thing:

97
0:05:21.656,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because most people no longer have to bribe public officials

98
0:05:24.816,000 --> 0:05:25,000
just to get a phone,

99
0:05:26.334,000 --> 0:05:3,000
corruption -- at least within this industry -- has reduced.

100
0:05:32.469,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, if Mo Ibrahim had waited for corruption to be fixed

101
0:05:35.731,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in all of sub-Saharan Africa before he invested,

102
0:05:39.104,000 --> 0:05:4,000
he would still be waiting today.

103
0:05:41.858,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You know, most people who engage in corruption know they shouldn't.

104
0:05:46.889,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I mean, the public officials who were demanding bribes from people

105
0:05:50.506,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to get phones

106
0:05:51.681,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and the people who were paying the bribes --

107
0:05:53.76,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they knew they were breaking the law.

108
0:05:55.575,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But they did it anyways.

109
0:05:57.638,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The question is: Why?

110
0:05:59.967,000 --> 0:06:,000
The answer?

111
0:06:01.346,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Scarcity.

112
0:06:04.128,000 --> 0:06:06,000
See, whenever people would benefit from gaining access

113
0:06:06.772,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to something that scarce,

114
0:06:08.309,000 --> 0:06:1,000
this makes corruption attractive.

115
0:06:11.642,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You know, in poor countries, we complain a lot about corrupt politicians

116
0:06:15.692,000 --> 0:06:16,000
who embezzle state funds.

117
0:06:17.213,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But in many of those countries, economic opportunity is scarce,

118
0:06:21.167,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and so corruption becomes an attractive way to gain wealth.

119
0:06:25.986,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We also complain about civil servants like police officers,

120
0:06:29.496,000 --> 0:06:32,000
who extort money from everyday hardworking citizens.

121
0:06:33.86,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But most civil servants are grossly underpaid

122
0:06:36.715,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and are leading desperate lives.

123
0:06:38.73,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And so for them, extortion or corruption is a good way to make a living.

124
0:06:46.241,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You know, this phenomenon also plays itself out in wealthy countries as well.

125
0:06:51.72,000 --> 0:06:53,000
When rich parents bribe university officials --

126
0:06:54.541,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:59.22,000 --> 0:07:01,000
When rich parents bribe university officials

128
0:07:02.152,000 --> 0:07:06,000
so their children can gain admission into elite colleges,

129
0:07:06.898,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the circumstance is different,

130
0:07:09.201,000 --> 0:07:1,000
but the principle is the same.

131
0:07:11.36,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I mean, admission into elite colleges is scarce,

132
0:07:14.278,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and so bribery becomes attractive.

133
0:07:19.938,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The thing is,

134
0:07:21.14,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I'm not trying to say there shouldn't be things that are scarce in society

135
0:07:25.196,000 --> 0:07:26,000
or things that are selective.

136
0:07:27.435,000 --> 0:07:28,000
What I'm just trying to explain

137
0:07:29.134,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is this relationship between corruption and scarcity.

138
0:07:33.424,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And in most poor countries, way too many basic things are scarce.

139
0:07:38.348,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I mean things like food,

140
0:07:40.014,000 --> 0:07:41,000
education,

141
0:07:41.407,000 --> 0:07:42,000
health care,

142
0:07:42.716,000 --> 0:07:43,000
economic opportunity,

143
0:07:44.289,000 --> 0:07:45,000
jobs.

144
0:07:46.522,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This creates the perfect breeding ground for corruption to thrive.

145
0:07:51.884,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now, in no way does this excuse corrupt behavior.

146
0:07:55.112,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It just helps us understand it a bit better.

147
0:07:58.672,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Investing in businesses that make things affordable

148
0:08:02.517,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and accessible to so many more people

149
0:08:05.023,000 --> 0:08:06,000
attacks this scarcity

150
0:08:06.764,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and creates the revenues for governments to reinvest in their economies.

151
0:08:11.992,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now, when this happens on a countrywide level,

152
0:08:15.152,000 --> 0:08:17,000
it can revolutionize nations.

153
0:08:18.284,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Consider the impact in South Korea.

154
0:08:21.822,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now, in the 1950s,

155
0:08:23.326,000 --> 0:08:26,000
South Korea was a desperately poor country,

156
0:08:26.888,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and it was very corrupt.

157
0:08:29.513,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The country was ruled by an authoritarian government

158
0:08:32.699,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and engaged in bribery and embezzlement.

159
0:08:35.858,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In fact, economists at the time said South Korea was trapped in poverty,

160
0:08:41.55,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and they referred to it as "an economic basket case."

161
0:08:46.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
When you looked at South Korea's institutions,

162
0:08:48.454,000 --> 0:08:49,000
even as late as the 1980s,

163
0:08:50.039,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they were on par with some of the poorest and most corrupt African countries

164
0:08:53.963,000 --> 0:08:54,000
at the time.

165
0:08:55.938,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But as companies like Samsung, Kia, Hyundai

166
0:09:00.693,000 --> 0:09:03,000
invested in innovations that made things much more affordable

167
0:09:04.449,000 --> 0:09:06,000
for so many more people,

168
0:09:06.657,000 --> 0:09:08,000
South Korea ultimately became prosperous.

169
0:09:09.925,000 --> 0:09:11,000
As the country grew prosperous,

170
0:09:12.706,000 --> 0:09:15,000
it was able to transition from an authoritarian government

171
0:09:15.808,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to a democratic government

172
0:09:18.033,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and has been able to reinvest in building its institutions.

173
0:09:22.453,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And this has paid off tremendously.

174
0:09:25.698,000 --> 0:09:26,000
For instance, in 2018,

175
0:09:27.684,000 --> 0:09:3,000
South Korea's president was sentenced to 25 years in prison

176
0:09:31.664,000 --> 0:09:32,000
on corruption-related charges.

177
0:09:34.259,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This could never have happened decades ago when the country was poor

178
0:09:38.344,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and ruled by an authoritarian government.

179
0:09:42.45,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In fact, as we looked at most prosperous countries today, what we found was,

180
0:09:47.119,000 --> 0:09:51,000
they were able to reduce corruption as they became prosperous --

181
0:09:51.196,000 --> 0:09:52,000
not before.

182
0:09:53.91,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And so where does that leave us?

183
0:09:56.673,000 --> 0:10:,000
I know it may sound like I'm saying we should just ignore corruption.

184
0:10:01.259,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's not what I'm saying at all.

185
0:10:03.85,000 --> 0:10:04,000
What I'm suggesting, though,

186
0:10:05.394,000 --> 0:10:09,000
is that corruption, especially for most people in poor countries,

187
0:10:10.195,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is a work-around.

188
0:10:12.196,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's a utility

189
0:10:13.371,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in a place where there are fewer better options to solve a problem.

190
0:10:17.77,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Investing in innovations that make products much more affordable

191
0:10:21.38,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for many people

192
0:10:23.163,000 --> 0:10:25,000
not only attacks this scarcity

193
0:10:25.4,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but it creates a sustainable source of revenue

194
0:10:28.141,000 --> 0:10:31,000
for governments to reinvest into the economies

195
0:10:31.393,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to strengthen their institutions.

196
0:10:34.497,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This is the critical missing piece in the economic development puzzle

197
0:10:38.239,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that will ultimately help us reduce corruption.

198
0:10:43.013,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You know, I lost hope in Nigeria when I was 16.

199
0:10:46.405,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And in some ways, the country has actually gotten worse.

200
0:10:50.105,000 --> 0:10:54,000
In addition to widespread poverty and endemic corruption,

201
0:10:54.304,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Nigeria now actually deals with terrorist organizations

202
0:10:57.213,000 --> 0:10:58,000
like Boko Haram.

203
0:10:59.788,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But somehow, I am more hopeful about Nigeria today

204
0:11:03.302,000 --> 0:11:04,000
than I have ever been before.

205
0:11:05.474,000 --> 0:11:08,000
When I see organizations investing in innovations

206
0:11:09.36,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that are creating jobs for people

207
0:11:11.695,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and making things affordable --

208
0:11:13.837,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I mean organizations like Lifestores Pharmacy,

209
0:11:16.873,000 --> 0:11:2,000
making drugs and pharmaceuticals more affordable for people;

210
0:11:21.277,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or Metro Africa Xpress,

211
0:11:23.437,000 --> 0:11:28,000
tackling the scarcity of distribution and logistics for many small businesses;

212
0:11:28.475,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or Andela, creating economic opportunity for software developers --

213
0:11:33.626,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I am optimistic about the future.

214
0:11:36.396,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I hope you will be, too.

215
0:11:38.149,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Thank you.

216
0:11:39.361,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I begin with an advertisement

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
inspired by George Orwell

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that Apple ran in 1984.

4
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Video) Big Brother: We are one people

5
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with one will, one resolve,

6
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
one cause.

7
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Our enemies shall talk themselves to death,

8
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and we will fight them with their own confusion.

9
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We shall prevail.

10
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Narrator: On January 24th,

11
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.

12
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And you'll see why 1984

13
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
won't be like "1984."

14
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Rebecca MacKinnon: So the underlying message of this video

15
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
remains very powerful even today.

16
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Technology created by innovative companies

17
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
will set us all free.

18
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Fast-forward more than two decades:

19
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Apple launches the iPhone in China

20
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and censors the Dalai Lama out

21
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
along with several other politically sensitive applications

22
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
at the request of the Chinese government

23
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
for its Chinese app store.

24
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The American political cartoonist

25
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Mark Fiore

26
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
also had his satire application

27
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
censored in the United States

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because some of Apple's staff

29
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
were concerned it would be offensive to some groups.

30
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
His app wasn't reinstated

31
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
until he won the Pulitzer Prize.

32
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The German magazine Stern, a news magazine,

33
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
had its app censored

34
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because the Apple nannies deemed it

35
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to be a little bit too racy for their users,

36
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and despite the fact that this magazine

37
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is perfectly legal for sale

38
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
on newsstands throughout Germany.

39
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And more controversially, recently,

40
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Apple censored a Palestinian protest app

41
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
after the Israeli government voiced concerns

42
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that it might be used to organize violent attacks.

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So here's the thing.

44
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We have a situation where private companies

45
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
are applying censorship standards

46
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that are often quite arbitrary

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and generally more narrow

48
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
than the free speech constitutional standards

49
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that we have in democracies.

50
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Or they're responding to censorship requests

51
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
by authoritarian regimes

52
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that do not reflect consent of the governed.

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Or they're responding to requests and concerns

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by governments that have no jurisdiction

55
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
over many, or most, of the users and viewers

56
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
who are interacting with the content in question.

57
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So here's the situation.

58
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In a pre-Internet world,

59
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
sovereignty over our physical freedoms,

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
or lack thereof,

61
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
was controlled almost entirely

62
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by nation-states.

63
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But now we have this new layer

64
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of private sovereignty

65
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in cyberspace.

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And their decisions about software coding,

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
engineering, design, terms of service

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
all act as a kind of law

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that shapes what we can and cannot do with our digital lives.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And their sovereignties,

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
cross-cutting, globally interlinked,

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
can in some ways

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
challenge the sovereignties of nation-states

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in very exciting ways,

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but sometimes also act

76
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to project and extend it

77
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
at a time when control

78
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
over what people can and cannot do

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
with information

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
has more effect than ever

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
on the exercise of power

82
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in our physical world.

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
After all, even the leader of the free world

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
needs a little help from the sultan of Facebookistan

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
if he wants to get reelected next year.

86
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And these platforms

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
were certainly very helpful

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to activists in Tunisia and Egypt

89
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
this past spring and beyond.

90
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
As Wael Ghonim,

91
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the Google-Egyptian-executive by day,

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
secret-Facebook-activist by night,

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
famously said to CNN

94
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
after Mubarak stepped down,

95
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"If you want to liberate a society,

96
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
just give them the Internet."

97
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But overthrowing a government is one thing

98
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and building a stable democracy

99
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is a bit more complicated.

100
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
On the left there's a photo taken by an Egyptian activist

101
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
who was part of the storming

102
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of the Egyptian state security offices in March.

103
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And many of the agents

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
shredded as many of the documents as they could

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and left them behind in piles.

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But some of the files were left behind intact,

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and activists, some of them,

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
found their own surveillance dossiers

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
full of transcripts of their email exchanges,

110
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
their cellphone text message exchanges,

111
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
even Skype conversations.

112
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And one activist actually found

113
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a contract from a Western company

114
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
for the sale of surveillance technology

115
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to the Egyptian security forces.

116
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And Egyptian activists are assuming

117
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that these technologies for surveillance

118
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
are still being used

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
by the transitional authorities running the networks there.

120
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And in Tunisia, censorship actually began to return in May --

121
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
not nearly as extensively

122
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
as under President Ben Ali.

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But you'll see here a blocked page

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of what happens when you try to reach

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
certain Facebook pages and some other websites

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that the transitional authorities

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
have determined might incite violence.

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
In protest over this,

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
blogger Slim Amamou,

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who had been jailed under Ben Ali

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and then became part of the transitional government

132
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
after the revolution,

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
he resigned in protest from the cabinet.

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But there's been a lot of debate in Tunisia

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
about how to handle this kind of problem.

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In fact, on Twitter,

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
there were a number of people who were supportive of the revolution

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
who said, "Well actually,

139
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
we do want democracy and free expression,

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but there is some kinds of speech that need to be off-bounds

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because it's too violent and it might be destabilizing for our democracy.

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But the problem is,

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
how do you decide who is in power to make these decisions

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and how do you make sure

145
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that they do not abuse their power?

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
As Riadh Guerfali,

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the veteran digital activist from Tunisia,

148
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
remarked over this incident,

149
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"Before, things were simple:

150
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other.

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Today, things are a lot more subtle."

152
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Welcome to democracy, our Tunisian and Egyptian friends.

153
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The reality is

154
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that even in democratic societies today,

155
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we do not have good answers

156
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for how you balance the need

157
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for security and law enforcement on one hand

158
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and protection of civil liberties

159
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and free speech on the other

160
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in our digital networks.

161
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In fact, in the United States,

162
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
whatever you may think of Julian Assange,

163
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
even people who are not necessarily big fans of his

164
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
are very concerned about the way

165
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in which the United States government and some companies have handled Wikileaks.

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Amazon webhosting dropped Wikileaks as a customer

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
after receiving a complaint from U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman,

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
despite the fact

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that Wikileaks had not been charged,

170
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
let alone convicted,

171
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
of any crime.

172
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So we assume

173
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that the Internet is a border-busting technology.

174
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is a map of social networks worldwide,

175
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and certainly Facebook has conquered much of the world --

176
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
which is either a good or a bad thing,

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
depending on how you like

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the way Facebook manages its service.

179
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But borders do persist

180
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in some parts of cyberspace.

181
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
In Brazil and Japan,

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it's for unique cultural and linguistic reasons.

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But if you look at China, Vietnam

184
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and a number of the former Soviet states,

185
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
what's happening there is more troubling.

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
You have a situation

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
where the relationship between government

188
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and local social networking companies

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
is creating a situation

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
where, effectively,

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the empowering potential of these platforms

192
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is being constrained

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because of these relationships

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
between companies and government.

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now in China,

196
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
you have the "great firewall," as it's well-known,

197
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that blocks Facebook

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and Twitter and now Google+

199
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and many of the other overseas websites.

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And that's done in part with the help from Western technology.

201
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But that's only half of the story.

202
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The other part of the story

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
are requirements that the Chinese government places

204
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
on all companies operating on the Chinese Internet,

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
known as a system of self-discipline.

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In plain English, that means censorship and surveillance

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of their users.

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And this is a ceremony I actually attended in 2009

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
where the Internet Society of China presented awards

210
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to the top 20 Chinese companies

211
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that are best at exercising self-discipline --

212
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
i.e. policing their content.

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And Robin Li, CEO of Baidu,

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
China's dominant search engine,

215
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
was one of the recipients.

216
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In Russia, they do not generally block the Internet

217
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and directly censor websites.

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But this is a website called Rospil

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that's an anti-corruption site.

220
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And earlier this year,

221
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
there was a troubling incident

222
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
where people who had made donations to Rospil

223
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
through a payments processing system

224
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
called Yandex Money

225
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
suddenly received threatening phone calls

226
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
from members of a nationalist party

227
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who had obtained details

228
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
about donors to Rospil

229
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
through members of the security services

230
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
who had somehow obtained this information

231
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
from people at Yandex Money.

232
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This has a chilling effect

233
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
on people's ability to use the Internet

234
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to hold government accountable.

235
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So we have a situation in the world today

236
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where in more and more countries

237
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the relationship between citizens and governments

238
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
is mediated through the Internet,

239
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is comprised primarily

240
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of privately owned and operated services.

241
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So the important question, I think,

242
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is not this debate over whether the Internet

243
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is going to help the good guys more than the bad guys.

244
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Of course, it's going to empower

245
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
whoever is most skilled at using the technology

246
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and best understands the Internet

247
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
in comparison with whoever their adversary is.

248
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The most urgent question we need to be asking today

249
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is how do we make sure

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that the Internet evolves

251
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in a citizen-centric manner.

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Because I think all of you will agree

253
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that the only legitimate purpose of government

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
is to serve citizens,

255
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and I would argue

256
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that the only legitimate purpose of technology

257
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is to improve our lives,

258
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
not to manipulate or enslave us.

259
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So the question is,

260
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we know how to hold government accountable.

261
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We don't necessarily always do it very well,

262
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but we have a sense of what the models are,

263
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
politically and institutionally, to do that.

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
How do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace

265
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
accountable to the public interest

266
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
when most CEO's argue

267
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that their main obligation

268
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
is to maximize shareholder profit?

269
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And government regulation

270
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
often isn't helping all that much.

271
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You have situations, for instance, in France

272
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
where president Sarkozy

273
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
tells the CEO's of Internet companies,

274
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
"We're the only legitimate representatives

275
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
of the public interest."

276
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But then he goes and champions laws

277
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
like the infamous "three-strikes" law

278
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that would disconnect citizens from the Internet

279
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
for file sharing,

280
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
which has been condemned by the U.N. Special Rapporteur

281
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
on Freedom of Expression

282
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
as being a disproportionate violation

283
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
of citizens' right to communications,

284
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and has raised questions amongst civil society groups

285
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
about whether

286
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
some political representatives

287
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
are more interested in preserving

288
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the interests of the entertainment industry

289
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
than they are in defending the rights of their citizens.

290
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And here in the United Kingdom

291
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
there's also concern over

292
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
a law called the Digital Economy Act

293
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that's placing more onus

294
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
on private intermediaries

295
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to police citizen behavior.

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So what we need to recognize

297
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is that if we want to have

298
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
a citizen-centric Internet in the future,

299
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we need a broader and more sustained

300
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Internet freedom movement.

301
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
After all, companies didn't stop polluting groundwater

302
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
as a matter of course,

303
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
or employing 10-year-olds as a matter of course,

304
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
just because executives woke up one day

305
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and decided it was the right thing to do.

306
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It was the result of decades of sustained activism,

307
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
shareholder advocacy

308
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and consumer advocacy.

309
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Similarly, governments don't enact

310
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
intelligent environmental and labor laws

311
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
just because politicians wake up one day.

312
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's the result of very sustained and prolonged

313
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
political activism

314
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
that you get the right regulations,

315
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and that you get the right corporate behavior.

316
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We need to make the same approach

317
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
with the Internet.

318
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We also are going to need

319
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
political innovation.

320
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Eight hundred years ago, approximately,

321
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the barons of England decided

322
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that the Divine Right of Kings

323
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
was no longer working for them so well,

324
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and they forced King John

325
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to sign the Magna Carta,

326
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which recognized

327
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that even the king

328
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
who claimed to have divine rule

329
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
still had to abide by a basic set of rules.

330
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This set off a cycle

331
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
of what we can call political innovation,

332
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
which led eventually to the idea of consent of the governed --

333
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
which was implemented for the first time

334
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
by that radical revolutionary government

335
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in America across the pond.

336
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So now we need to figure out

337
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
how to build consent of the networked.

338
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And what does that look like?

339
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
At the moment, we still don't know.

340
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But it's going to require innovation

341
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that's not only going to need

342
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to focus on politics,

343
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
on geopolitics,

344
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but it's also going to need

345
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to deal with questions

346
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
of business management, investor behavior,

347
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
consumer choice

348
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and even software design and engineering.

349
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Each and every one of us has a vital part to play

350
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
in building the kind of world

351
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
in which government and technology

352
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
serve the world's people and not the other way around.

353
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Thank you very much.

354
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000

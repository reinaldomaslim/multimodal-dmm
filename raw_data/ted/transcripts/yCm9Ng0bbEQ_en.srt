1
0:00:13.68,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Many people face the news each morning

2
0:00:16.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with trepidation and dread.

3
0:00:18.92,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Every day, we read of shootings,

4
0:00:21.6,000 --> 0:00:24,000
inequality, pollution, dictatorship,

5
0:00:25.52,000 --> 0:00:28,000
war and the spread of nuclear weapons.

6
0:00:28.72,000 --> 0:00:29,000
These are some of the reasons

7
0:00:30.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that 2016 was called the "Worst. Year. Ever."

8
0:00:35.96,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Until 2017 claimed that record --

9
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and left many people longing for earlier decades,

11
0:00:42.24,000 --> 0:00:45,000
when the world seemed safer, cleaner and more equal.

12
0:00:46.56,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But is this a sensible way to understand the human condition

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in the 21st century?

14
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
As Franklin Pierce Adams pointed out,

15
0:00:54.96,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"Nothing is more responsible for the good old days

16
0:00:57.68,000 --> 0:00:58,000
than a bad memory."

17
0:00:58.92,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:01.68,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You can always fool yourself into seeing a decline

19
0:01:05.08,000 --> 0:01:07,000
if you compare bleeding headlines of the present

20
0:01:07.8,000 --> 0:01:1,000
with rose-tinted images of the past.

21
0:01:10.92,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What does the trajectory of the world look like

22
0:01:13.36,000 --> 0:01:17,000
when we measure well-being over time using a constant yardstick?

23
0:01:17.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Let's compare the most recent data on the present

24
0:01:20.36,000 --> 0:01:22,000
with the same measures 30 years ago.

25
0:01:23.32,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Last year, Americans killed each other at a rate of 5.3 per hundred thousand,

26
0:01:28.48,000 --> 0:01:31,000
had seven percent of their citizens in poverty

27
0:01:31.88,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and emitted 21 million tons of particulate matter

28
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and four million tons of sulfur dioxide.

29
0:01:38.28,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But 30 years ago, the homicide rate was 8.5 per hundred thousand,

30
0:01:42.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
poverty rate was 12 percent

31
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and we emitted 35 million tons of particulate matter

32
0:01:47.76,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide.

33
0:01:51.4,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What about the world as a whole?

34
0:01:53.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Last year, the world had 12 ongoing wars,

35
0:01:56.92,000 --> 0:01:58,000
60 autocracies,

36
0:01:59.08,000 --> 0:02:02,000
10 percent of the world population in extreme poverty

37
0:02:02.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and more than 10,000 nuclear weapons.

38
0:02:05.72,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But 30 years ago, there were 23 wars,

39
0:02:08.24,000 --> 0:02:09,000
85 autocracies,

40
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
37 percent of the world population in extreme poverty

41
0:02:13.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and more than 60,000 nuclear weapons.

42
0:02:17.2,000 --> 0:02:21,000
True, last year was a terrible year for terrorism in Western Europe,

43
0:02:21.759,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with 238 deaths,

44
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but 1988 was worse with 440 deaths.

45
0:02:28.44,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What's going on?

46
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Was 1988 a particularly bad year?

47
0:02:33.52,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Or are these improvements a sign that the world, for all its struggles,

48
0:02:37.6,000 --> 0:02:38,000
gets better over time?

49
0:02:39.8,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Might we even invoke the admittedly old-fashioned notion of progress?

50
0:02:45.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
To do so is to court a certain amount of derision,

51
0:02:49.2,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because I have found that intellectuals hate progress.

52
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Applause)

54
0:02:57.68,000 --> 0:03:,000
And intellectuals who call themselves progressive really hate progress.

55
0:03:01.4,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:02.56,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, it's not that they hate the fruits of progress, mind you.

57
0:03:05.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Most academics and pundits

58
0:03:08.56,000 --> 0:03:11,000
would rather have their surgery with anesthesia than without it.

59
0:03:13.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's the idea of progress that rankles the chattering class.

60
0:03:17.36,000 --> 0:03:2,000
If you believe that humans can improve their lot, I have been told,

61
0:03:21.12,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that means that you have a blind faith

62
0:03:23.52,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and a quasi-religious belief in the outmoded superstition

63
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the false promise of the myth of the onward march

64
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:33,000
of inexorable progress.

65
0:03:34.64,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You are a cheerleader for vulgar American can-doism,

66
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
with the rah-rah spirit of boardroom ideology,

67
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Silicon Valley and the Chamber of Commerce.

68
0:03:45.32,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You are a practitioner of Whig history,

69
0:03:48.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a naive optimist, a Pollyanna and, of course, a Pangloss,

70
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
alluding to the Voltaire character who declared,

71
0:03:55.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds."

72
0:03:58.4,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Well, Professor Pangloss, as it happens, was a pessimist.

73
0:04:01.92,000 --> 0:04:03,000
A true optimist believes there can be much better worlds

74
0:04:04.6,000 --> 0:04:05,000
than the one we have today.

75
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But all of this is irrelevant,

76
0:04:07.84,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because the question of whether progress has taken place

77
0:04:10.64,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is not a matter of faith

78
0:04:12.4,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or having an optimistic temperament or seeing the glass as half full.

79
0:04:16.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's a testable hypothesis.

80
0:04:18.72,000 --> 0:04:19,000
For all their differences,

81
0:04:20.12,000 --> 0:04:24,000
people largely agree on what goes into human well-being:

82
0:04:24.52,000 --> 0:04:29,000
life, health, sustenance, prosperity, peace, freedom, safety, knowledge,

83
0:04:30.24,000 --> 0:04:31,000
leisure, happiness.

84
0:04:32.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
All of these things can be measured.

85
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If they have improved over time, that, I submit, is progress.

86
0:04:38.52,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Let's go to the data,

87
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
beginning with the most precious thing of all, life.

88
0:04:43.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
For most of human history, life expectancy at birth was around 30.

89
0:04:48.4,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Today, worldwide, it is more than 70,

90
0:04:51.2,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and in the developed parts of the world,

91
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
more than 80.

92
0:04:55.04,000 --> 0:04:58,000
250 years ago, in the richest countries of the world,

93
0:04:58.2,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a third of the children did not live to see their fifth birthday,

94
0:05:02.24,000 --> 0:05:05,000
before the risk was brought down a hundredfold.

95
0:05:05.6,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Today, that fate befalls less than six percent of children

96
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in the poorest countries of the world.

97
0:05:11.6,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Famine is one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

98
0:05:15.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It could bring devastation to any part of the world.

99
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Today, famine has been banished

100
0:05:20.28,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to the most remote and war-ravaged regions.

101
0:05:23.68,000 --> 0:05:26,000
200 years ago, 90 percent of the world's population

102
0:05:26.84,000 --> 0:05:28,000
subsisted in extreme poverty.

103
0:05:29.04,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Today, fewer than 10 percent of people do.

104
0:05:32.72,000 --> 0:05:33,000
For most of human history,

105
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the powerful states and empires

106
0:05:36.32,000 --> 0:05:38,000
were pretty much always at war with each other,

107
0:05:38.96,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and peace was a mere interlude between wars.

108
0:05:42.44,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Today, they are never at war with each other.

109
0:05:44.72,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The last great power war

110
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:49,000
pitted the United States against China 65 years ago.

111
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
More recently, wars of all kinds have become fewer and less deadly.

112
0:05:54.92,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The annual rate of war has fallen from about 22 per hundred thousand per year

113
0:05:59.4,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in the early '50s to 1.2 today.

114
0:06:03.04,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Democracy has suffered obvious setbacks

115
0:06:05.64,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in Venezuela, in Russia, in Turkey

116
0:06:09.28,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and is threatened by the rise of authoritarian populism

117
0:06:12.4,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in Eastern Europe and the United States.

118
0:06:15.04,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Yet the world has never been more democratic

119
0:06:17.76,000 --> 0:06:18,000
than it has been in the past decade,

120
0:06:19.76,000 --> 0:06:22,000
with two-thirds of the world's people living in democracies.

121
0:06:24.28,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Homicide rates plunge whenever anarchy and the code of vendetta

122
0:06:28.44,000 --> 0:06:3,000
are replaced by the rule of law.

123
0:06:30.84,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It happened when feudal Europe was brought under the control of centralized kingdoms,

124
0:06:35.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
so that today a Western European

125
0:06:37.24,000 --> 0:06:39,000
has 1/35th the chance of being murdered

126
0:06:39.84,000 --> 0:06:41,000
compared to his medieval ancestors.

127
0:06:42.44,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It happened again in colonial New England,

128
0:06:44.92,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in the American Wild West when the sheriffs moved to town,

129
0:06:48.48,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and in Mexico.

130
0:06:50.2,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Indeed, we've become safer in just about every way.

131
0:06:54.56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Over the last century, we've become 96 percent less likely

132
0:06:58.12,000 --> 0:07:,000
to be killed in a car crash,

133
0:07:00.4,000 --> 0:07:03,000
88 percent less likely to be mowed down on the sidewalk,

134
0:07:04.36,000 --> 0:07:07,000
99 percent less likely to die in a plane crash,

135
0:07:08.12,000 --> 0:07:11,000
95 percent less likely to be killed on the job,

136
0:07:11.8,000 --> 0:07:14,000
89 percent less likely to be killed by an act of God,

137
0:07:15.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
such as a drought, flood, wildfire, storm, volcano,

138
0:07:19.4,000 --> 0:07:21,000
landslide, earthquake or meteor strike,

139
0:07:22.08,000 --> 0:07:25,000
presumably not because God has become less angry with us

140
0:07:25.36,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but because of improvements in the resilience of our infrastructure.

141
0:07:30.12,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And what about the quintessential act of God,

142
0:07:33.4,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the projectile hurled by Zeus himself?

143
0:07:36.92,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Yes, we are 97 percent less likely to be killed by a bolt of lightning.

144
0:07:43.48,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Before the 17th century,

145
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
no more than 15 percent of Europeans could read or write.

146
0:07:48.72,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Europe and the United States achieved universal literacy

147
0:07:51.88,000 --> 0:07:52,000
by the middle of the 20th century,

148
0:07:53.84,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and the rest of the world is catching up.

149
0:07:56.36,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Today, more than 90 percent of the world's population

150
0:07:59.8,000 --> 0:08:01,000
under the age of 25 can read and write.

151
0:08:03.44,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In the 19th century, Westerners worked more than 60 hours per week.

152
0:08:07.44,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Today, they work fewer than 40.

153
0:08:10.44,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Thanks to the universal penetration of running water and electricity

154
0:08:14.88,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in the developed world

155
0:08:16.28,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and the widespread adoption of washing machines, vacuum cleaners,

156
0:08:20.28,000 --> 0:08:23,000
refrigerators, dishwashers, stoves and microwaves,

157
0:08:24.28,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the amount of our lives that we forfeit to housework

158
0:08:27.2,000 --> 0:08:29,000
has fallen from 60 hours a week

159
0:08:29.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to fewer than 15 hours a week.

160
0:08:32.76,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Do all of these gains in health, wealth, safety, knowledge and leisure

161
0:08:37.32,000 --> 0:08:38,000
make us any happier?

162
0:08:39.04,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The answer is yes.

163
0:08:40.28,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In 86 percent of the world's countries,

164
0:08:42.48,000 --> 0:08:44,000
happiness has increased in recent decades.

165
0:08:45.799,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Well, I hope to have convinced you

166
0:08:47.559,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that progress is not a matter of faith or optimism,

167
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but is a fact of human history,

168
0:08:53.159,000 --> 0:08:55,000
indeed the greatest fact in human history.

169
0:08:56.48,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And how has this fact been covered in the news?

170
0:08:59.32,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:03.36,000 --> 0:09:06,000
A tabulation of positive and negative emotion words in news stories

172
0:09:07.36,000 --> 0:09:1,000
has shown that during the decades in which humanity has gotten healthier,

173
0:09:11.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
wealthier, wiser, safer and happier,

174
0:09:13.88,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the "New York Times" has become increasingly morose

175
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and the world's broadcasts too have gotten steadily glummer.

176
0:09:22.72,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Why don't people appreciate progress?

177
0:09:25.44,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Part of the answer comes from our cognitive psychology.

178
0:09:28.44,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We estimate risk using a mental shortcut called the "availability heuristic."

179
0:09:33.48,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The easier it is to recall something from memory,

180
0:09:36.28,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the more probable we judge it to be.

181
0:09:39.2,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The other part of the answer comes from the nature of journalism,

182
0:09:42.84,000 --> 0:09:45,000
captured in this satirical headline from "The Onion,"

183
0:09:46.24,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"CNN Holds Morning Meeting to Decide

184
0:09:48.32,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What Viewers Should Panic About For Rest of Day."

185
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:52.36,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Applause)

187
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
News is about stuff that happens, not stuff that doesn't happen.

188
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
You never see a journalist who says,

189
0:10:03.4,000 --> 0:10:07,000
"I'm reporting live from a country that has been at peace for 40 years,"

190
0:10:07.64,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or a city that has not been attacked by terrorists.

191
0:10:10.96,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Also, bad things can happen quickly,

192
0:10:13.32,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but good things aren't built in a day.

193
0:10:15.76,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The papers could have run the headline,

194
0:10:17.68,000 --> 0:10:21,000
"137,000 people escaped from extreme poverty yesterday"

195
0:10:22.08,000 --> 0:10:24,000
every day for the last 25 years.

196
0:10:24.96,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That's one and a quarter billion people leaving poverty behind,

197
0:10:29.2,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but you never read about it.

198
0:10:31.24,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Also, the news capitalizes on our morbid interest

199
0:10:34.56,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in what can go wrong,

200
0:10:35.84,000 --> 0:10:39,000
captured in the programming policy, "If it bleeds, it leads."

201
0:10:40.2,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Well, if you combine our cognitive biases with the nature of news,

202
0:10:43.96,000 --> 0:10:45,000
you can see why the world has been coming to an end

203
0:10:46.68,000 --> 0:10:47,000
for a very long time indeed.

204
0:10:50.84,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Let me address some questions about progress

205
0:10:52.96,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that no doubt have occurred to many of you.

206
0:10:56.32,000 --> 0:10:58,000
First, isn't it good to be pessimistic

207
0:10:59.08,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to safeguard against complacency,

208
0:11:01.52,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to rake the muck, to speak truth to power?

209
0:11:04.2,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Well, not exactly.

210
0:11:06.2,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It's good to be accurate.

211
0:11:08.2,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Of course we should be aware of suffering and danger

212
0:11:10.68,000 --> 0:11:11,000
wherever they occur,

213
0:11:12.12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but we should also be aware of how they can be reduced,

214
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because there are dangers to indiscriminate pessimism.

215
0:11:18.68,000 --> 0:11:19,000
One of them is fatalism.

216
0:11:20.36,000 --> 0:11:22,000
If all our efforts at improving the world

217
0:11:22.56,000 --> 0:11:23,000
have been in vain,

218
0:11:23.88,000 --> 0:11:24,000
why throw good money after bad?

219
0:11:25.76,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The poor will always be with you.

220
0:11:28.28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And since the world will end soon --

221
0:11:30.6,000 --> 0:11:31,000
if climate change doesn't kill us all,

222
0:11:32.48,000 --> 0:11:34,000
then runaway artificial intelligence will --

223
0:11:34.96,000 --> 0:11:37,000
a natural response is to enjoy life while we can,

224
0:11:38.6,000 --> 0:11:4,000
eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.

225
0:11:42.84,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The other danger of thoughtless pessimism is radicalism.

226
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
If our institutions are all failing and beyond hope for reform,

227
0:11:50.2,000 --> 0:11:53,000
a natural response is to seek to smash the machine,

228
0:11:53.88,000 --> 0:11:54,000
drain the swamp,

229
0:11:55.12,000 --> 0:11:56,000
burn the empire to the ground,

230
0:11:56.92,000 --> 0:11:59,000
on the hope that whatever rises out of the ashes

231
0:12:00.24,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is bound to be better than what we have now.

232
0:12:03.92,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Well, if there is such a thing as progress,

233
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:07,000
what causes it?

234
0:12:07.28,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Progress is not some mystical force or dialectic lifting us ever higher.

235
0:12:12.48,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's not a mysterious arc of history bending toward justice.

236
0:12:16.08,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's the result of human efforts governed by an idea,

237
0:12:19.84,000 --> 0:12:23,000
an idea that we associate with the 18th century Enlightenment,

238
0:12:23.88,000 --> 0:12:27,000
namely that if we apply reason and science

239
0:12:28.24,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that enhance human well-being,

240
0:12:30.32,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we can gradually succeed.

241
0:12:32.68,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Is progress inevitable? Of course not.

242
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Progress does not mean that everything becomes better

243
0:12:39.2,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for everyone everywhere all the time.

244
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
That would be a miracle, and progress is not a miracle

245
0:12:45.44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but problem-solving.

246
0:12:47.36,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Problems are inevitable

247
0:12:49.24,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and solutions create new problems which have to be solved in their turn.

248
0:12:53.76,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The unsolved problems facing the world today are gargantuan,

249
0:12:57.48,000 --> 0:12:59,000
including the risks of climate change

250
0:13:00.28,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and nuclear war,

251
0:13:01.92,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but we must see them as problems to be solved,

252
0:13:04.48,000 --> 0:13:06,000
not apocalypses in waiting,

253
0:13:06.92,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and aggressively pursue solutions

254
0:13:09.2,000 --> 0:13:11,000
like Deep Decarbonization for climate change

255
0:13:12.08,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and Global Zero for nuclear war.

256
0:13:15.76,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Finally, does the Enlightenment go against human nature?

257
0:13:19.68,000 --> 0:13:21,000
This is an acute question for me,

258
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
because I'm a prominent advocate of the existence of human nature,

259
0:13:25.44,000 --> 0:13:28,000
with all its shortcomings and perversities.

260
0:13:28.88,000 --> 0:13:29,000
In my book "The Blank Slate,"

261
0:13:30.32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I argued that the human prospect is more tragic than utopian

262
0:13:34.48,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and that we are not stardust, we are not golden

263
0:13:37.24,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and there's no way we are getting back to the garden.

264
0:13:39.8,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

265
0:13:42.32,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But my worldview has lightened up

266
0:13:44.64,000 --> 0:13:46,000
in the 15 years since "The Blank Slate" was published.

267
0:13:47.6,000 --> 0:13:49,000
My acquaintance with the statistics of human progress,

268
0:13:50.56,000 --> 0:13:51,000
starting with violence

269
0:13:51.92,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but now encompassing every other aspect of our well-being,

270
0:13:55.72,000 --> 0:13:56,000
has fortified my belief

271
0:13:57.32,000 --> 0:14:,000
that in understanding our tribulations and woes,

272
0:14:00.52,000 --> 0:14:01,000
human nature is the problem,

273
0:14:02.32,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but human nature, channeled by Enlightenment norms and institutions,

274
0:14:06.68,000 --> 0:14:07,000
is also the solution.

275
0:14:09.2,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Admittedly, it's not easy to replicate my own data-driven epiphany

276
0:14:14.12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
with humanity at large.

277
0:14:16.48,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Some intellectuals have responded

278
0:14:18.32,000 --> 0:14:2,000
with fury to my book "Enlightenment Now,"

279
0:14:21.04,000 --> 0:14:25,000
saying first how dare he claim that intellectuals hate progress,

280
0:14:25.32,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and second, how dare he claim that there has been progress.

281
0:14:28.48,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Laughter)

282
0:14:32.24,000 --> 0:14:35,000
With others, the idea of progress just leaves them cold.

283
0:14:35.88,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Saving the lives of billions,

284
0:14:37.6,000 --> 0:14:39,000
eradicating disease, feeding the hungry,

285
0:14:40.52,000 --> 0:14:41,000
teaching kids to read?

286
0:14:42.56,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Boring.

287
0:14:44.72,000 --> 0:14:48,000
At the same time, the most common response I have received from readers is gratitude,

288
0:14:49.24,000 --> 0:14:51,000
gratitude for changing their view of the world

289
0:14:51.64,000 --> 0:14:53,000
from a numb and helpless fatalism

290
0:14:54.2,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to something more constructive,

291
0:14:55.88,000 --> 0:14:56,000
even heroic.

292
0:14:57.64,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I believe that the ideals of the Enlightenment

293
0:14:59.84,000 --> 0:15:01,000
can be cast a stirring narrative,

294
0:15:01.88,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and I hope that people with greater artistic flare

295
0:15:04.72,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and rhetorical power than I

296
0:15:06.76,000 --> 0:15:09,000
can tell it better and spread it further.

297
0:15:09.8,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It goes something like this.

298
0:15:12.32,000 --> 0:15:14,000
We are born into a pitiless universe,

299
0:15:14.92,000 --> 0:15:17,000
facing steep odds against life-enabling order

300
0:15:18.12,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and in constant jeopardy of falling apart.

301
0:15:21.36,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We were shaped by a process that is ruthlessly competitive.

302
0:15:25.72,000 --> 0:15:26,000
We are made from crooked timber,

303
0:15:27.52,000 --> 0:15:3,000
vulnerable to illusions, self-centeredness

304
0:15:30.56,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and at times astounding stupidity.

305
0:15:33.8,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Yet human nature has also been blessed with resources

306
0:15:36.56,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that open a space for a kind of redemption.

307
0:15:39.64,000 --> 0:15:42,000
We are endowed with the power to combine ideas recursively,

308
0:15:42.92,000 --> 0:15:44,000
to have thoughts about our thoughts.

309
0:15:45.4,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We have an instinct for language,

310
0:15:47.32,000 --> 0:15:5,000
allowing us to share the fruits of our ingenuity and experience.

311
0:15:51.76,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We are deepened with the capacity for sympathy,

312
0:15:54.44,000 --> 0:15:58,000
for pity, imagination, compassion, commiseration.

313
0:15:59.48,000 --> 0:16:02,000
These endowments have found ways to magnify their own power.

314
0:16:03.28,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The scope of language has been augmented

315
0:16:05.32,000 --> 0:16:07,000
by the written, printed and electronic word.

316
0:16:09.28,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Our circle of sympathy has been expanded

317
0:16:11.32,000 --> 0:16:14,000
by history, journalism and the narrative arts.

318
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And our puny rational faculties have been multiplied

319
0:16:18.04,000 --> 0:16:2,000
by the norms and institutions of reason,

320
0:16:20.76,000 --> 0:16:23,000
intellectual curiosity, open debate,

321
0:16:24.08,000 --> 0:16:26,000
skepticism of authority and dogma

322
0:16:26.8,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and the burden of proof to verify ideas

323
0:16:29.2,000 --> 0:16:3,000
by confronting them against reality.

324
0:16:32.32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
As the spiral of recursive improvement

325
0:16:34.88,000 --> 0:16:35,000
gathers momentum,

326
0:16:36.52,000 --> 0:16:39,000
we eke out victories against the forces that grind us down,

327
0:16:40.08,000 --> 0:16:43,000
not least the darker parts of our own nature.

328
0:16:43.36,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We penetrate the mysteries of the cosmos, including life and mind.

329
0:16:48.12,000 --> 0:16:51,000
We live longer, suffer less, learn more,

330
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:54,000
get smarter and enjoy more small pleasures

331
0:16:54.88,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and rich experiences.

332
0:16:57.08,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Fewer of us are killed, assaulted, enslaved, exploited

333
0:17:01.72,000 --> 0:17:03,000
or oppressed by the others.

334
0:17:03.76,000 --> 0:17:07,000
From a few oases, the territories with peace and prosperity are growing

335
0:17:08.28,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and could someday encompass the globe.

336
0:17:11.84,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Much suffering remains

337
0:17:13.76,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and tremendous peril,

338
0:17:15.52,000 --> 0:17:17,000
but ideas on how to reduce them have been voiced,

339
0:17:18.28,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and an infinite number of others are yet to be conceived.

340
0:17:22.2,000 --> 0:17:24,000
We will never have a perfect world,

341
0:17:24.64,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and it would be dangerous to seek one.

342
0:17:26.92,000 --> 0:17:28,000
But there's no limit to the betterments we can attain

343
0:17:29.48,000 --> 0:17:32,000
if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing.

344
0:17:34.76,000 --> 0:17:37,000
This heroic story is not just another myth.

345
0:17:37.92,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Myths are fictions, but this one is true,

346
0:17:41,000 --> 0:17:44,000
true to the best of our knowledge, which is the only truth we can have.

347
0:17:44.96,000 --> 0:17:45,000
As we learn more,

348
0:17:46.2,000 --> 0:17:5,000
we can show which parts of the story continue to be true and which ones false,

349
0:17:50.68,000 --> 0:17:52,000
as any of them might be and any could become.

350
0:17:54.32,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And this story belongs not to any tribe

351
0:17:56.88,000 --> 0:17:57,000
but to all of humanity,

352
0:17:58.76,000 --> 0:18:01,000
to any sentient creature with the power of reason

353
0:18:02.48,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and the urge to persist in its being,

354
0:18:05.4,000 --> 0:18:06,000
for it requires only the convictions

355
0:18:07.36,000 --> 0:18:09,000
that life is better than death,

356
0:18:09.56,000 --> 0:18:1,000
health is better than sickness,

357
0:18:11.52,000 --> 0:18:13,000
abundance is better than want,

358
0:18:13.68,000 --> 0:18:15,000
freedom is better than coercion,

359
0:18:16.12,000 --> 0:18:18,000
happiness is better than suffering

360
0:18:18.32,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and knowledge is better than ignorance and superstition.

361
0:18:22.52,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Thank you.

362
0:18:23.76,000 --> 0:18:26,000
(Applause)

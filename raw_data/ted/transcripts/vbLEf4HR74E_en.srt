1
0:00:12.531,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, I guess it is a result of globalization

2
0:00:16.57,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that you can find Coca-Cola tins on top of Everest

3
0:00:20.198,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and a Buddhist monk in Monterey.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:25.04,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And so I just came, two days ago, from the Himalayas

6
0:00:30.159,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to your kind invitation.

7
0:00:31.603,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I would like to invite you, also, for a while, to the Himalayas themselves.

8
0:00:37.257,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And to show the place where meditators, like me,

9
0:00:43.374,000 --> 0:00:46,000
who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute,

10
0:00:47.37,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and found their way to the mountains.

11
0:00:51.811,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So these are a few images I was lucky to take and be there.

12
0:00:58.871,000 --> 0:01:02,000
There's Mount Kailash in Eastern Tibet -- wonderful setting.

13
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is from Marlboro country.

14
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

15
0:01:11.553,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is a turquoise lake.

16
0:01:13.925,000 --> 0:01:14,000
A meditator.

17
0:01:16.033,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.

18
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the night before, we camped, and my Tibetan friends said,

19
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"We are going to sleep outside."

20
0:01:28.421,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I said, "Why? We have enough space in the tent."

21
0:01:31.032,000 --> 0:01:32,000
They said, "Yes, but it's summertime."

22
0:01:32.88,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:37.455,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So now, we are going to speak of happiness.

24
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
As a Frenchman, I must say

25
0:01:42.979,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that there are a lot of French intellectuals

26
0:01:45.051,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that think happiness is not at all interesting.

27
0:01:48.136,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I just wrote an essay on happiness, and there was a controversy.

29
0:01:52.709,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And someone wrote an article saying,

30
0:01:54.984,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Don't impose on us the dirty work of happiness."

31
0:01:58.034,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"We don't care about being happy. We need to live with passion.

33
0:02:03.39,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We like the ups and downs of life.

34
0:02:05.765,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while."

35
0:02:09.231,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is what I see from the balcony of my hermitage in the Himalayas.

37
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time.

38
0:02:21.563,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:23.795,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, let's come to happiness or well-being.

40
0:02:28.781,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And first of all, you know, despite what the French intellectuals say,

41
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking,

42
0:02:36.614,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"May I suffer the whole day?"

43
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:39.519,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Which means that somehow, consciously or not,

45
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
directly or indirectly, in the short or the long term,

46
0:02:48.533,000 --> 0:02:52,000
whatever we do, whatever we hope, whatever we dream --

47
0:02:53.059,000 --> 0:02:58,000
somehow, is related to a deep, profound desire for well-being or happiness.

48
0:03:00.088,000 --> 0:03:03,000
As Pascal said, even the one who hangs himself,

49
0:03:03.529,000 --> 0:03:07,000
somehow, is looking for cessation of suffering.

50
0:03:08.593,000 --> 0:03:09,000
He finds no other way.

51
0:03:11.358,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But then, if you look in the literature, East and West,

52
0:03:14.669,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you can find incredible diversity of definition of happiness.

53
0:03:19.615,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Some people say, I only believed in remembering the past,

54
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
imagining the future, never the present.

55
0:03:26.617,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Some people say happiness is right now;

56
0:03:29.554,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it's the quality of the freshness of the present moment.

57
0:03:33.842,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And that led Henri Bergson, the French philosopher, to say,

58
0:03:37.703,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"All the great thinkers of humanity have left happiness in the vague

59
0:03:41.582,000 --> 0:03:44,000
so that each of them could define their own terms."

60
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Well, that would be fine if it was just a secondary preoccupation in life.

61
0:03:51.953,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But now, if it is something that is going to determine

62
0:03:54.954,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the quality of every instant of our life,

63
0:03:57.755,000 --> 0:04:,000
then we better know what it is, have some clearer idea.

64
0:04:02.834,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often,

65
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.

66
0:04:11.449,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Although we want to avoid suffering,

67
0:04:13.268,000 --> 0:04:15,000
it seems we are running somewhat towards it.

68
0:04:16.349,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And that can also come from some kind of confusions.

69
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
One of the most common ones is happiness and pleasure.

70
0:04:23.754,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But if you look at the characteristics of those two,

71
0:04:27.76,000 --> 0:04:32,000
pleasure is contingent upon time, upon its object,

72
0:04:33.022,000 --> 0:04:34,000
upon the place.

73
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It is something that -- changes of nature.

74
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Beautiful chocolate cake: first serving is delicious,

75
0:04:43.741,000 --> 0:04:45,000
second one not so much, then we feel disgust.

76
0:04:46.742,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:49.541,000 --> 0:04:5,000
That's the nature of things.

78
0:04:51.088,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We get tired.

79
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I used to be a fan of Bach.

80
0:04:55.464,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I used to play it on the guitar, you know.

81
0:04:57.489,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I can hear it two, three, five times.

82
0:04:59.322,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring.

83
0:05:04.422,000 --> 0:05:07,000
If you are feeling very cold, you come near a fire, it's so wonderful.

84
0:05:08.603,000 --> 0:05:1,000
After some moments, you just go a little back,

85
0:05:10.776,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and then it starts burning.

86
0:05:12.803,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It sort of uses itself as you experience it.

87
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And also, again, it can -- also, it's something that you --

88
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it is not something that is radiating outside.

89
0:05:25.375,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Like, you can feel intense pleasure

90
0:05:27.665,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and some others around you can be suffering a lot.

91
0:05:32.314,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now, what, then, will be happiness?

92
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And happiness, of course, is such a vague word, so let's say well-being.

93
0:05:41.572,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And so, I think the best definition, according to the Buddhist view,

94
0:05:45.924,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is that well-being is not just a mere pleasurable sensation.

95
0:05:53.31,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It is a deep sense of serenity and fulfillment.

96
0:05:59.201,000 --> 0:06:05,000
A state that actually pervades

97
0:06:05.581,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and underlies all emotional states,

98
0:06:09.326,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and all the joys and sorrows that can come one's way.

99
0:06:13.648,000 --> 0:06:15,000
For you, that might be surprising.

100
0:06:15.795,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Can we have this kind of well-being while being sad?

101
0:06:19.367,000 --> 0:06:2,000
In a way, why not?

102
0:06:21.403,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Because we are speaking of a different level.

103
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Look at the waves coming near the shore.

104
0:06:31.08,000 --> 0:06:33,000
When you are at the bottom of the wave, you hit the bottom.

105
0:06:35.04,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You hit the solid rock.

106
0:06:36.785,000 --> 0:06:38,000
When you are surfing on the top, you are all elated.

107
0:06:39.454,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So you go from elation to depression -- there's no depth.

108
0:06:43.779,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Now, if you look at the high sea,

109
0:06:46.945,000 --> 0:06:49,000
there might be beautiful, calm ocean, like a mirror.

110
0:06:50.693,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There might be storms,

111
0:06:52.839,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but the depth of the ocean is still there, unchanged.

112
0:06:58.669,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So now, how is that?

113
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It can only be a state of being, not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.

114
0:07:04.925,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness.

115
0:07:08.695,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But there's also wicked joy, you can rejoice in someone's suffering.

116
0:07:13.597,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So how do we proceed in our quest for happiness?

117
0:07:18.125,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Very often, we look outside.

118
0:07:21.77,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We think that if we could gather this and that, all the conditions,

119
0:07:26.098,000 --> 0:07:29,000
something that we say, "Everything to be happy --

120
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to have everything to be happy."

121
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
That very sentence already reveals the doom, destruction of happiness.

122
0:07:35.88,000 --> 0:07:36,000
To have everything.

123
0:07:37.159,000 --> 0:07:39,000
If we miss something, it collapses.

124
0:07:40.985,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And also, when things go wrong, we try to fix the outside so much,

125
0:07:44.808,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but our control of the outer world is limited,

126
0:07:50.344,000 --> 0:07:52,000
temporary, and often, illusory.

127
0:07:54.263,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So now, look at inner conditions.

128
0:07:57.248,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Aren't they stronger?

129
0:07:58.673,000 --> 0:08:,000
Isn't it the mind that translates

130
0:08:01.462,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the outer condition into happiness and suffering?

131
0:08:04.308,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And isn't that stronger?

132
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We know, by experience,

133
0:08:07.933,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that we can be what we call "a little paradise,"

134
0:08:11.291,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and yet, be completely unhappy within.

135
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The Dalai Lama was once in Portugal,

136
0:08:18.372,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and there was a lot of construction going on everywhere.

137
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So one evening, he said, "Look, you are doing all these things,

138
0:08:24.184,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but isn't it nice, also, to build something within?"

139
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And he said, "[Without] that -- even if you get a high-tech flat

140
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
on the 100th floor of a super-modern and comfortable building,

141
0:08:37.434,000 --> 0:08:38,000
if you are deeply unhappy within,

142
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
all you are going to look for is a window from which to jump."

143
0:08:44.61,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So now, at the opposite,

144
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
we know a lot of people who, in very difficult circumstances,

145
0:08:50.62,000 --> 0:08:55,000
manage to keep serenity, inner strength, inner freedom, confidence.

146
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So now, if the inner conditions are stronger --

147
0:08:59.423,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of course, the outer conditions do influence,

148
0:09:02.07,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and it's wonderful to live longer, healthier,

149
0:09:05.678,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to have access to information, education,

150
0:09:08.495,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to be able to travel, to have freedom.

151
0:09:11.169,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's highly desirable.

152
0:09:13.689,000 --> 0:09:14,000
However, this is not enough.

153
0:09:15.272,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Those are just auxiliary, help conditions.

154
0:09:20.463,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The experience that translates everything is within the mind.

155
0:09:24.643,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So then, when we ask oneself

156
0:09:26.352,000 --> 0:09:3,000
how to nurture the condition for happiness,

157
0:09:30.756,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the inner conditions, and which are those which will undermine happiness.

158
0:09:36.968,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So then, this just needs to have some experience.

159
0:09:40.349,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We have to know from ourselves, there are certain states of mind

160
0:09:43.428,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that are conducive to this flourishing, to this well-being,

161
0:09:46.761,000 --> 0:09:48,000
what the Greeks called eudaimonia, flourishing.

162
0:09:51.048,000 --> 0:09:54,000
There are some which are adverse to this well-being.

163
0:09:55.905,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And so, if we look from our own experience,

164
0:09:59.488,000 --> 0:10:03,000
anger, hatred, jealousy, arrogance,

165
0:10:03.721,000 --> 0:10:07,000
obsessive desire, strong grasping,

166
0:10:08.51,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they don't leave us in such a good state after we have experienced it.

167
0:10:12.857,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And also, they are detrimental to others' happiness.

168
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So we may consider that the more those are invading our mind,

169
0:10:21.87,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and, like a chain reaction,

170
0:10:23.545,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the more we feel miserable, we feel tormented.

171
0:10:27.699,000 --> 0:10:3,000
At the opposite, everyone knows deep within

172
0:10:31.273,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that an act of selfless generosity,

173
0:10:33.496,000 --> 0:10:37,000
if from the distance, without anyone knowing anything about it,

174
0:10:37.805,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we could save a child's life, make someone happy.

175
0:10:42.031,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We don't need the recognition. We don't need any gratitude.

176
0:10:45.605,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Just the mere fact of doing that

177
0:10:48.35,000 --> 0:10:51,000
fills such a sense of adequation with our deep nature.

178
0:10:52.77,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And we would like to be like that all the time.

179
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So is that possible,

180
0:10:57.765,000 --> 0:11:,000
to change our way of being, to transform one's mind?

181
0:11:02.67,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Aren't those negative emotions, or destructive emotions,

182
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
inherent to the nature of mind?

183
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Is change possible in our emotions, in our traits, in our moods?

184
0:11:15.024,000 --> 0:11:17,000
For that we have to ask, what is the nature of mind?

185
0:11:18.072,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And if we look from the experiential point of view,

186
0:11:22.658,000 --> 0:11:24,000
there is a primary quality of consciousness

187
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that's just the mere fact to be cognitive, to be aware.

188
0:11:30.31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it.

189
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
You can have ugly faces, beautiful faces in the mirror.

190
0:11:38.318,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The mirror allows that, but the mirror is not tainted,

191
0:11:41.814,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is not modified, is not altered by those images.

192
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Likewise, behind every single thought

193
0:11:49.117,000 --> 0:11:53,000
there is the bare consciousness, pure awareness.

194
0:11:53.967,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is the nature.

195
0:11:55.306,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It cannot be tainted intrinsically with hatred or jealousy because then,

196
0:11:59.931,000 --> 0:12:,000
if it was always there --

197
0:12:01.562,000 --> 0:12:04,000
like a dye that would permeate the whole cloth --

198
0:12:05.49,000 --> 0:12:07,000
then it would be found all the time, somewhere.

199
0:12:08.382,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We know we're not always angry, always jealous, always generous.

200
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So, because the basic fabric of consciousness

201
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone,

202
0:12:20.476,000 --> 0:12:23,000
there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting.

203
0:12:24.302,000 --> 0:12:26,000
That is the ground for mind training.

204
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors

205
0:12:31.998,000 --> 0:12:32,000
cannot happen at the same time.

206
0:12:34.263,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You could go from love to hate.

207
0:12:36.236,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But you cannot, at the same time, toward the same object,

208
0:12:39.477,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the same person, want to harm and want to do good.

209
0:12:42.88,000 --> 0:12:45,000
You cannot, in the same gesture, shake hand and give a blow.

210
0:12:47.587,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So, there are natural antidotes to emotions

211
0:12:50.871,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that are destructive to our inner well-being.

212
0:12:54.603,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So that's the way to proceed.

213
0:12:57.106,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Rejoicing compared to jealousy.

214
0:13:00.61,000 --> 0:13:02,000
A kind of sense of inner freedom

215
0:13:02.994,000 --> 0:13:05,000
as opposite to intense grasping and obsession.

216
0:13:07.904,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Benevolence, loving kindness against hatred.

217
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But, of course, each emotion then would need a particular antidote.

218
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Another way is to try to find a general antidote to all emotions,

219
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and that's by looking at the very nature.

220
0:13:26.04,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Usually, when we feel annoyed, hatred or upset with someone,

221
0:13:31.523,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or obsessed with something,

222
0:13:33.84,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the mind goes again and again to that object.

223
0:13:36.398,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Each time it goes to the object,

224
0:13:38.248,000 --> 0:13:41,000
it reinforces that obsession or that annoyance.

225
0:13:41.906,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So then, it's a self-perpetuating process.

226
0:13:45.874,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So what we need to look for now is,

227
0:13:47.658,000 --> 0:13:49,000
instead of looking outward, we look inward.

228
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Look at anger itself.

229
0:13:52.368,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It looks very menacing,

230
0:13:53.93,000 --> 0:13:57,000
like a billowing monsoon cloud or thunderstorm.

231
0:13:58.817,000 --> 0:14:,000
We think we could sit on the cloud,

232
0:14:01.104,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but if you go there, it's just mist.

233
0:14:03.485,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Likewise, if you look at the thought of anger,

234
0:14:06.651,000 --> 0:14:09,000
it will vanish like frost under the morning sun.

235
0:14:10.538,000 --> 0:14:12,000
If you do this again and again, the propensity,

236
0:14:13.421,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the tendencies for anger to arise again

237
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
will be less and less each time you dissolve it.

238
0:14:19.509,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And, at the end, although it may rise,

239
0:14:21.546,000 --> 0:14:22,000
it will just cross the mind,

240
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track.

241
0:14:26.53,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So this is the principal of mind training.

242
0:14:30.358,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Now, it takes time,

243
0:14:33.887,000 --> 0:14:39,000
because it took time for all those faults in our mind, the tendencies, to build up,

244
0:14:40.882,000 --> 0:14:42,000
so it will take time to unfold them as well.

245
0:14:43.647,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But that's the only way to go.

246
0:14:45.607,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Mind transformation -- that is the very meaning of meditation.

247
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
It means familiarization with a new way of being,

248
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
new way of perceiving things,

249
0:14:54.838,000 --> 0:14:56,000
which is more in adequation with reality,

250
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
with interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation,

251
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
which our being and our consciousness is.

252
0:15:04.119,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So, the interface with cognitive science,

253
0:15:06.12,000 --> 0:15:09,000
since we need to come to that, it was, I suppose, the subject of --

254
0:15:09.304,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we have to deal in such a short time -- with brain plasticity.

255
0:15:12.852,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The brain was thought to be more or less fixed.

256
0:15:15.849,000 --> 0:15:17,000
All the nominal connections, in numbers and quantities,

257
0:15:18.515,000 --> 0:15:2,000
were thought, until the last 20 years,

258
0:15:21.48,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to be more or less fixed when we reached adult age.

259
0:15:25.384,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Now, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot.

260
0:15:28.655,000 --> 0:15:31,000
A violinist, as we heard, who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice,

261
0:15:32.581,000 --> 0:15:36,000
some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot,

262
0:15:37.426,000 --> 0:15:39,000
increasing reinforcement of the synaptic connections.

263
0:15:41.44,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So can we do that with human qualities?

264
0:15:44.758,000 --> 0:15:47,000
With loving kindness, with patience, with openness?

265
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So that's what those great meditators have been doing.

266
0:15:53.378,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Some of them who came to the labs,

267
0:15:56.912,000 --> 0:15:59,000
like in Madison, Wisconsin, or in Berkeley,

268
0:16:00.836,000 --> 0:16:03,000
did 20 to 40,000 hours of meditation.

269
0:16:04.936,000 --> 0:16:07,000
They do, like, three years' retreat, where they do meditate 12 hours a day.

270
0:16:08.488,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And then, the rest of their life, they will do three or four hours a day.

271
0:16:11.972,000 --> 0:16:13,000
They are real Olympic champions of mind training.

272
0:16:14.973,000 --> 0:16:15,000
(Laughter)

273
0:16:17.974,000 --> 0:16:2,000
This is the place where the meditators -- you can see it's kind of inspiring.

274
0:16:21.842,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Now, here with 256 electrodes.

275
0:16:27.977,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Laughter)

276
0:16:31.056,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So what did they find?

277
0:16:32.261,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Of course, same thing.

278
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
The scientific embargo --

279
0:16:36.881,000 --> 0:16:4,000
a paper has been submitted to "Nature," hopefully, it will be accepted.

280
0:16:41.406,000 --> 0:16:44,000
It deals with the state of compassion, unconditional compassion.

281
0:16:45.421,000 --> 0:16:48,000
We asked meditators, who have been doing that for years and years,

282
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
to put their mind in a state where there's nothing but loving kindness,

283
0:16:53.877,000 --> 0:16:54,000
total availability to sentient being.

284
0:16:56.311,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Of course, during the training, we do that with objects.

285
0:16:58.961,000 --> 0:17:,000
We think of people suffering, of people we love,

286
0:17:01.271,000 --> 0:17:04,000
but at some point, it can be a state which is all pervading.

287
0:17:05.324,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Here is the preliminary result,

288
0:17:07.867,000 --> 0:17:09,000
which I can show because it's already been shown.

289
0:17:10.221,000 --> 0:17:14,000
The bell curve shows 150 controls,

290
0:17:15.145,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and what is being looked at

291
0:17:17.358,000 --> 0:17:2,000
is the difference between the right and the left frontal lobe.

292
0:17:20.75,000 --> 0:17:22,000
In very short, people who have more activity

293
0:17:23.609,000 --> 0:17:25,000
in the right side of the prefrontal cortex

294
0:17:26.296,000 --> 0:17:28,000
are more depressed, withdrawn.

295
0:17:29.772,000 --> 0:17:31,000
They don't describe a lot of positive affect.

296
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
It's the opposite on the left side:

297
0:17:36.124,000 --> 0:17:38,000
more tendency to altruism,

298
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
to happiness, to express, and curiosity and so forth.

299
0:17:42.897,000 --> 0:17:46,000
So there's a basic line for people. And also, it can be changed.

300
0:17:47.014,000 --> 0:17:49,000
If you see a comic movie, you go off to the left side.

301
0:17:49.562,000 --> 0:17:52,000
If you are happy about something, you'll go more to the left side.

302
0:17:53.002,000 --> 0:17:55,000
If you have a bout of depression, you'll go to the right side.

303
0:17:56.71,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Here, the -0.5 is the full standard deviation

304
0:18:02.44,000 --> 0:18:04,000
of a meditator who meditated on compassion.

305
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
It's something that is totally out of the bell curve.

306
0:18:09.292,000 --> 0:18:12,000
So, I've no time to go into all the different scientific results.

307
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Hopefully, they will come.

308
0:18:14.722,000 --> 0:18:16,000
But they found that -- this is after three and a half hours

309
0:18:17.517,000 --> 0:18:18,000
in an fMRI,

310
0:18:19.484,000 --> 0:18:22,000
it's like coming out of a space ship.

311
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Also, it has been shown in other labs --

312
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
for instance, Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --

313
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
that some meditators are able, also,

314
0:18:32.719,000 --> 0:18:35,000
to control their emotional response more than it could be thought.

315
0:18:36.557,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Like the startle experiments, for example.

316
0:18:38.596,000 --> 0:18:39,000
If you sit a guy on a chair

317
0:18:40.151,000 --> 0:18:42,000
with all this apparatus measuring your physiology,

318
0:18:42.604,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and there's kind of a bomb that goes off,

319
0:18:44.596,000 --> 0:18:46,000
it's such an instinctive response that,

320
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
in 20 years, they never saw anyone who would not jump.

321
0:18:51.616,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Some meditators, without trying to stop it,

322
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:56,000
but simply by being completely open,

323
0:18:56.558,000 --> 0:19:01,000
thinking that that bang is just going to be a small event like a shooting star,

324
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
they are able not to move at all.

325
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
So the whole point of that is not, sort of, to make, like,

326
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump, or whatever.

327
0:19:14.985,000 --> 0:19:16,000
It's more to say that mind training matters.

328
0:19:18.351,000 --> 0:19:21,000
That this is not just a luxury.

329
0:19:21.658,000 --> 0:19:25,000
This is not a supplementary vitamin for the soul.

330
0:19:26.08,000 --> 0:19:29,000
This is something that's going to determine

331
0:19:29.836,000 --> 0:19:31,000
the quality of every instant of our lives.

332
0:19:31.921,000 --> 0:19:34,000
We are ready to spend 15 years achieving education.

333
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
We love to do jogging, fitness.

334
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
We do all kinds of things to remain beautiful.

335
0:19:43.072,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Yet, we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most --

336
0:19:50.073,000 --> 0:19:52,000
the way our mind functions --

337
0:19:52.341,000 --> 0:19:55,000
which, again, is the ultimate thing

338
0:19:56.112,000 --> 0:19:58,000
that determines the quality of our experience.

339
0:19:58.775,000 --> 0:20:,000
Now, compassion is supposed to be put in action.

340
0:20:02.032,000 --> 0:20:04,000
That's what we try to do in different places.

341
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Just this one example is worth a lot of work.

342
0:20:09.456,000 --> 0:20:11,000
This lady with bone TB, left alone in a tent,

343
0:20:12.362,000 --> 0:20:14,000
was going to die with her only daughter.

344
0:20:15.588,000 --> 0:20:17,000
One year later, how she is.

345
0:20:20.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
Different schools and clinics we've been doing in Tibet.

346
0:20:26.639,000 --> 0:20:3,000
And just, I leave you with the beauty of those looks

347
0:20:30.869,000 --> 0:20:34,000
that tells more about happiness than I could ever say.

348
0:20:34.902,000 --> 0:20:35,000
(Laughter)

349
0:20:36.069,000 --> 0:20:37,000
And jumping monks of Tibet.

350
0:20:37.553,000 --> 0:20:38,000
(Laughter)

351
0:20:39.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Flying monks.

352
0:20:48.134,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Thank you very much.

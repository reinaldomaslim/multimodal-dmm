1
0:00:13.24,000 --> 0:00:15,000
A few years ago, I broke into my own house.

2
0:00:16.88,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I had just driven home,

3
0:00:18.12,000 --> 0:00:2,000
it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter,

4
0:00:20.68,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town,

5
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees --

6
0:00:27.8,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,

7
0:00:30.92,000 --> 0:00:32,000
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --

8
0:00:33.4,000 --> 0:00:34,000
it was very cold.

9
0:00:34.68,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,

10
0:00:37.92,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I found I didn't have my keys.

11
0:00:40.2,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In fact, I could see them through the window,

12
0:00:42.32,000 --> 0:00:45,000
lying on the dining room table where I had left them.

13
0:00:45.44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,

14
0:00:48.6,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and they were locked tight.

15
0:00:50.2,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone,

16
0:00:53.367,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,

17
0:00:56.72,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and it was cold.

18
0:01:00.421,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,

20
0:01:05.851,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.

21
0:01:08.4,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, desperate and freezing cold,

22
0:01:10.92,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window,

23
0:01:14.56,000 --> 0:01:15,000
cleared out the shards of glass,

24
0:01:16.56,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I crawled through,

25
0:01:17.92,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening,

26
0:01:21.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport,

27
0:01:24.004,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.

28
0:01:26.8,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This was going to be expensive,

29
0:01:28.301,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,

30
0:01:31.88,000 --> 0:01:35,000
so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.

31
0:01:36.92,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training

32
0:01:39.12,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.

33
0:01:43.24,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,

34
0:01:46.8,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it modulates adrenaline levels

35
0:01:49.08,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and it clouds your thinking.

36
0:01:51.08,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So the next morning,

37
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:55,000
when I woke up on too little sleep,

38
0:01:55.56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
worrying about the hole in the window,

39
0:01:58.32,000 --> 0:02:,000
and a mental note that I had to call my contractor,

40
0:02:01.12,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and the freezing temperatures,

41
0:02:02.84,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,

42
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain,

43
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:09,000
my thinking was cloudy,

44
0:02:10.28,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.

45
0:02:13.72,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:15.24,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,

47
0:02:18.52,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that I realized I didn't have my passport.

48
0:02:20.8,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:22.84,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes,

50
0:02:26.32,000 --> 0:02:28,000
got my passport, raced back to the airport,

51
0:02:28.8,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I made it just in time,

52
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but they had given away my seat to someone else,

53
0:02:32.903,000 --> 0:02:34,000
so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms,

54
0:02:35.903,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.

55
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.

56
0:02:43.36,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:44.52,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I started wondering, are there things that I can do,

58
0:02:47.2,000 --> 0:02:48,000
systems that I can put into place,

59
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that will prevent bad things from happening?

60
0:02:51.64,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Or at least if bad things happen,

61
0:02:53.56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe.

62
0:02:59.36,000 --> 0:03:,000
So I started thinking about that,

63
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later.

64
0:03:03.842,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,

65
0:03:07.56,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,

66
0:03:10.96,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and, you know, forgotten my passport,

67
0:03:13.4,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and Danny shared with me

68
0:03:14.64,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.

69
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:20.92,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein,

71
0:03:24.087,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who had written about it a few years before,

72
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
also called the pre-mortem.

73
0:03:28.28,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.

74
0:03:30.257,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Whenever there's a disaster,

75
0:03:31.76,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?

76
0:03:36.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,

77
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:41,000
you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,

78
0:03:42.44,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and then you try to figure out what you can do

79
0:03:45.04,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.

80
0:03:48.56,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So what I want to talk to you about today

81
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.

82
0:03:55.08,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.

83
0:03:58,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I'll start with the obvious ones.

84
0:03:59.96,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.

85
0:04:05.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is,

86
0:04:09.56,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but there's a lot of science to back this up,

87
0:04:12.12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
based on the way our spatial memory works.

88
0:04:15.44,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,

89
0:04:18.32,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that evolved over tens of thousands of years,

90
0:04:21.28,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to keep track of the locations of important things --

91
0:04:25.08,000 --> 0:04:27,000
where the well is, where fish can be found,

92
0:04:27.52,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that stand of fruit trees,

93
0:04:30.04,000 --> 0:04:32,000
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.

94
0:04:32.68,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The hippocampus is the part of the brain

95
0:04:34.609,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.

96
0:04:38.12,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.

97
0:04:41.84,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment

98
0:04:44.722,000 --> 0:04:46,000
where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,

99
0:04:47.52,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and they could still find their nuts.

100
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,

101
0:04:52.2,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.

102
0:04:57.24,000 --> 0:05:,000
But it's really good for things that don't move around much,

103
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:03,000
not so good for things that move around.

104
0:05:03.48,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.

105
0:05:07.8,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So in the home, designate a spot for your keys --

106
0:05:10.32,000 --> 0:05:12,000
a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.

107
0:05:13.2,000 --> 0:05:15,000
For your passport, a particular drawer.

108
0:05:15.32,000 --> 0:05:17,000
For your reading glasses, a particular table.

109
0:05:18.12,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,

110
0:05:21.6,000 --> 0:05:23,000
your things will always be there when you look for them.

111
0:05:24.44,000 --> 0:05:25,000
What about travel?

112
0:05:25.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards,

113
0:05:28.08,000 --> 0:05:3,000
your driver's license, your passport,

114
0:05:30.4,000 --> 0:05:32,000
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.

115
0:05:32.68,000 --> 0:05:36,000
If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.

116
0:05:37.08,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now these are some rather obvious things.

117
0:05:39.72,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.

118
0:05:43.28,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.

119
0:05:46.52,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem

120
0:05:49.08,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,

121
0:05:53.36,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and you should put systems in place.

122
0:05:55.68,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation

123
0:05:58.64,000 --> 0:06:01,000
than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.

124
0:06:02.08,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,

125
0:06:05.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
where we have to make a very important decision

126
0:06:07.8,000 --> 0:06:1,000
about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,

127
0:06:11.12,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to help them with a decision.

128
0:06:12.8,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And so I want to talk about that.

129
0:06:14.44,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.

130
0:06:17.48,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,

131
0:06:21.04,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making --

132
0:06:25.08,000 --> 0:06:27,000
any kind of decision you have to make

133
0:06:27.36,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.

134
0:06:31.4,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,

135
0:06:34.56,000 --> 0:06:38,000
"I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."

136
0:06:39.24,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Now, you all know that high cholesterol

137
0:06:42.28,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,

138
0:06:46.44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
heart attack, stroke.

139
0:06:47.88,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And so you're thinking

140
0:06:49.12,000 --> 0:06:51,000
having high cholesterol isn't the best thing,

141
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug

142
0:06:54.28,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."

143
0:06:57.08,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And you've probably heard of statins,

144
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs

145
0:07:01.834,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in the world today,

146
0:07:03.032,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you probably even know people who take them.

147
0:07:05.135,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."

148
0:07:07.541,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But there's a question you should ask at this point,

149
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:11,000
a statistic you should ask for

150
0:07:11.88,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that most doctors don't like talking about,

151
0:07:14.36,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.

152
0:07:18.8,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's for the number needed to treat.

153
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now, what is this, the NNT?

154
0:07:23.2,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's the number of people that need to take a drug

155
0:07:26.28,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure

156
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
before one person is helped.

157
0:07:31.56,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?

158
0:07:34.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The number should be one.

159
0:07:35.68,000 --> 0:07:37,000
My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me

160
0:07:37.76,000 --> 0:07:38,000
if it's not going to help.

161
0:07:39.069,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.

162
0:07:41.578,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And it's not the doctor's fault,

163
0:07:43.134,000 --> 0:07:45,000
if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.

164
0:07:46.077,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.

165
0:07:48.966,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates

166
0:07:51.4,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.

167
0:07:56.4,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin,

168
0:08:00.24,000 --> 0:08:02,000
what do you suppose it is?

169
0:08:02.4,000 --> 0:08:04,000
How many people have to take it before one person is helped?

170
0:08:05.24,000 --> 0:08:06,000
300.

171
0:08:07.075,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is according to research

172
0:08:08.48,000 --> 0:08:11,000
by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,

173
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.

174
0:08:14.8,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I ran through the numbers myself.

175
0:08:17.92,000 --> 0:08:19,000
300 people have to take the drug for a year

176
0:08:20.32,000 --> 0:08:23,000
before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.

177
0:08:24.32,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now you're probably thinking,

178
0:08:25.725,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.

179
0:08:28.56,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."

180
0:08:30.8,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But you should ask at this point for another statistic,

181
0:08:33.68,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?

182
0:08:36.28,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So for this particular drug,

183
0:08:37.96,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.

184
0:08:41.64,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And they include terrible things --

185
0:08:43.331,000 --> 0:08:47,000
debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress --

186
0:08:47.799,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but now you're thinking, "Five percent,

187
0:08:49.682,000 --> 0:08:51,000
not very likely it's going to happen to me,

188
0:08:51.72,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I'll still take the drug."

189
0:08:52.982,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But wait a minute.

190
0:08:54.2,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly.

191
0:08:56.56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time,

192
0:08:59.75,000 --> 0:09:02,000
so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.

193
0:09:02.973,000 --> 0:09:04,000
300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped,

194
0:09:05.489,000 --> 0:09:07,000
five percent of those 300 have side effects,

195
0:09:07.92,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that's 15 people.

196
0:09:09.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug

197
0:09:13.72,000 --> 0:09:15,000
than you are to be helped by the drug.

198
0:09:16.56,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not.

199
0:09:19.489,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.

200
0:09:22.656,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Medical ethics requires it,

201
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
it's part of the principle of informed consent.

202
0:09:26.32,000 --> 0:09:29,000
You have the right to have access to this kind of information

203
0:09:29.56,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.

204
0:09:33.48,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Now you might be thinking

205
0:09:34.72,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,

206
0:09:37.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.

207
0:09:40.72,000 --> 0:09:44,000
For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50,

208
0:09:45.36,000 --> 0:09:47,000
removal of the prostate for cancer,

209
0:09:47.6,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the number needed to treat is 49.

210
0:09:50.2,000 --> 0:09:54,000
That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.

211
0:09:54.4,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.

212
0:09:59.08,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They include impotence, erectile dysfunction,

213
0:10:01.96,000 --> 0:10:03,000
urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,

214
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:05,000
fecal incontinence.

215
0:10:06.24,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,

216
0:10:09.76,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they'll only last for a year or two.

217
0:10:12.88,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time

218
0:10:16.52,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to the questions that you might be able to ask

219
0:10:19.08,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that will push the conversation forward.

220
0:10:21.48,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.

221
0:10:24.6,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And you also want to think about things like quality of life.

222
0:10:27.52,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Because you have a choice oftentimes,

223
0:10:29.32,000 --> 0:10:31,000
do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,

224
0:10:31.64,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?

225
0:10:35.44,000 --> 0:10:37,000
These are things to talk about and think about now,

226
0:10:37.88,000 --> 0:10:38,000
with your family and your loved ones.

227
0:10:39.72,000 --> 0:10:41,000
You might change your mind in the heat of the moment,

228
0:10:42.24,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.

229
0:10:45.32,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,

230
0:10:49.96,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and one of the things that happens at that moment

231
0:10:52.32,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is a whole bunch on systems shut down.

232
0:10:54.28,000 --> 0:10:55,000
There's an evolutionary reason for this.

233
0:10:56.209,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,

234
0:10:59.64,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or your libido, or your immune system,

235
0:11:02.12,000 --> 0:11:05,000
because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things

236
0:11:05.8,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and you don't react quickly,

237
0:11:07.48,000 --> 0:11:1,000
you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.

238
0:11:11.48,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Unfortunately,

239
0:11:12.92,000 --> 0:11:15,000
one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress

240
0:11:16.56,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is rational, logical thinking,

241
0:11:18.56,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.

242
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead

243
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to these kinds of situations.

244
0:11:27.48,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.

245
0:11:33.68,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We all are going to fail now and then.

246
0:11:36.56,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,

247
0:11:40.2,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,

248
0:11:44.12,000 --> 0:11:47,000
or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.

249
0:11:48.28,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal,

250
0:11:50.96,000 --> 0:11:51,000
when I got back from my trip,

251
0:11:52.72,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door,

252
0:11:56.6,000 --> 0:11:59,000
with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination.

253
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And I have to admit,

254
0:12:01.4,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,

255
0:12:04.84,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and piles of emails that I haven't gone through.

256
0:12:07.44,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So I'm not completely organized,

257
0:12:09.24,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but I see organization as a gradual process,

258
0:12:12.4,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and I'm getting there.

259
0:12:13.64,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thank you very much.

260
0:12:14.88,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Applause)

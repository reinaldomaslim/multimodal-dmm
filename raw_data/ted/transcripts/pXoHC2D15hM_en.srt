1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.

3
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.

4
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,

5
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer

6
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
within reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.

7
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.

8
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
One is what's on the Boston Public Library.

9
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Carved above their door is, "Free to All."

10
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's kind of an inspiring statement,

11
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I'll go back at the end of this.

12
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge

13
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to as many people as want to read it.

14
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And the idea of using technology is perfect for us.

15
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.

16
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,

17
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they were able to build the Library of Alexandria --

18
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.

19
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.

20
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.

21
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.

22
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I'm going to try to argue only one point today:

23
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.

24
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,

25
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,

26
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
everything that was ever meant for distribution,

27
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.

28
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Yes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,

29
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and that's still being refigured out.

30
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,

31
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
so we can actually achieve that.

32
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But I'm going to go over the technological, social

33
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.

34
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,

35
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,

36
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?

37
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?

38
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?

39
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If you wanted to put all of the published works online

40
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?

41
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world

42
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.

43
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.

44
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,

45
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.

46
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --

47
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.

48
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,

49
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.

50
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --

51
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.

52
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That's pretty neat.

53
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Then the question is, what do you get?

54
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
You know, is it worth trying to get there?

55
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Do you actually want it online?

56
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers

57
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.

58
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.

59
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.

60
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces

61
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that look a whole lot like books in certain ways,

62
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --

63
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
still very book-like -- on your laptop.

64
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But I don't know, reading things on a laptop --

65
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.

66
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.

67
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.

68
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It's starting to be a little bit more specified.

69
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.

70
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I like the physical book.

71
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,

72
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
put them on the Net, and then download,

73
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
print them and bind them, and end up with books again.

74
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And we sort of said, well, how hard is this?

75
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And it turns out to not be very hard.

76
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We actually went off to make a bookmobile.

77
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,

78
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.

79
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.

80
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And they actually come out kind of nice looking.

81
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You can actually get really good-looking books

82
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.

83
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So the idea of -- this technology actually may end up

84
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
putting books back in people's hands again.

85
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
There are some other bookmobiles running around.

86
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond -- Thoreau's works.

87
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,

88
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
for competing with the bookstore there.

89
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.

90
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,

91
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.

92
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It was quite popularly attended.

93
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And kids starting to make their own books,

94
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.

95
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So the idea of being able to use this technology

96
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,

97
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but I think it still has its place.

98
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian

99
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
sort of world,

100
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,

101
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we might have something.

102
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.

103
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,

104
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection

105
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
at the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,

106
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and get a program going making books in rural Uganda.

107
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And it actually -- so technologically, it works.

108
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.

109
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,

110
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.

111
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.

112
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.

113
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
There are some newer technologies for delivering

114
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.

115
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.

116
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.

117
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.

118
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,"

119
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.

120
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,

121
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,

122
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is some of these new little screens that are coming out.

123
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.

124
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And I don't mean to steal any thunder here,

125
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.

126
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So here's one of the beta units and you can --

127
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.

128
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,

129
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and it turns out that 200 dots per inch

130
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.

131
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.

132
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We're in good enough shape.

133
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.

134
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.

135
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But how do you go about doing all this scanning?

136
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.

137
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --

138
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.

139
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.

140
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.

141
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.

142
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.

143
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,

144
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
especially if they're valuable books.

145
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,

146
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because you could just buy another one,

147
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.

148
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But do things that you love.

149
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --

150
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
about 300,000 now -- doing very well.

151
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.

152
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
But we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.

153
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down

154
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
so that it's a cost point that we could afford?

155
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.

156
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,

157
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
make it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --

158
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we would have achieved something.

159
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?

160
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --

161
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
sort of these auto-page-turning things.

162
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.

163
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.

164
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,

165
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,

166
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,

167
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you can go and get the proper intonation.

168
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.

169
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job

170
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
as you're going through these libraries.

171
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.

172
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.

173
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.

174
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
People seem to love it.

175
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.

176
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

177
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,

178
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in languages that you can read.

179
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.

180
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.

181
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --

182
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?

183
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,

184
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.

185
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And what we've been able to do is get into libraries.

186
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,

187
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and libraries are up for having their books scanned.

188
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,

189
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
which is where we have one these scanning centers,

190
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.

191
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.

192
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
The thing we're missing is the 10 cents.

193
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.

194
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We've scanned about 200,000 books.

195
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,

196
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.

197
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So all in all, that's going very well.

198
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright

199
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
into the out-of-print world.

200
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,

201
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.

202
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,

203
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and have the classic thing that you have,

204
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.

205
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.

206
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.

207
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,

208
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries

209
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that are starting to participate in this program,

210
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to try out this model of where does a library stop

211
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and where does the bookstore take over.

212
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.

213
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.

214
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month

215
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and we've got about 250,000 books online,

216
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
counting all the other projects that are starting to add in.

217
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.

218
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.

219
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,

220
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.

221
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And then, there's business model issues

222
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.

223
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,

224
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
at least for the out of print and out of copyright,

225
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.

226
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Now let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.

227
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So how much is there?

228
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks

229
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
having been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --

230
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
or at least that's the largest archives of published materials

231
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
we've been able to sort of point at.

232
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk

233
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and put it online, if you're doing things in volume.

234
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.

235
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
This is a fairly heavily litigated area,

236
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
so we've found that there are niches in the music world

237
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.

238
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And we've been starting to make these available by going

239
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and offering shelf space on the Net.

240
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?

241
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
If you give something to a charity or to the public,

242
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
you get a pat on the back and a tax donation --

243
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
except on the Net, where you can go broke.

244
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,

245
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
you can lose your guitars or your house.

246
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
This doesn't make any sense.

247
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,

248
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.

249
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.

250
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,

251
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
as long as nobody made any money. You could --

252
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,

253
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.

254
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And we get about two or three bands a day signing up.

255
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.

256
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,

257
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.

258
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.

259
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We've got a lot of collections now --

260
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
a couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time.

261
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Moving images: if you think of theatrical releases,

262
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
there are not that many of them.

263
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever

264
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.

265
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But half of those were Indian.

266
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But anyway, it's doable,

267
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
but we've only found about a thousand of these things that --

268
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
to be out of copyright.

269
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So we've digitized those and made those available.

270
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies

271
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.

272
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,

273
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.

274
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.

275
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We're not quite a YouTube.

276
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We tended towards longer-term things

277
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,

278
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
which has just been great fun.

279
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Television comes quite a bit larger.

280
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.

281
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.

282
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --

283
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --

284
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
24 hours a day.

285
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We only put one week up,

286
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,

287
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?

288
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.

289
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Were they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.

290
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote

291
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and being able to compare what happened in the past?

292
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,

293
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.

294
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.

295
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,

296
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively

297
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and have them up on the Net.

298
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.

299
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.

300
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.

301
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.

302
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
But we've worked through some of those,

303
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
but we've still got real problems in Washington.

304
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web.

305
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.

306
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.

307
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,

308
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
which donates this collection to the Internet Archive.

309
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.

310
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And we've made a Wayback Machine

311
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.

312
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
If you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,

313
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
the different versions of it that we have,

314
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,

315
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and this is what it looked like at Stanford.

316
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.

317
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.

318
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,

319
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
which is probably best known for burning,

320
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
is, don't just have one copy.

321
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this

322
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.

323
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.

324
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.

325
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,

326
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:52,000
flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...

327
0:18:52.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
so we're hedging our bets here.

328
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.

329
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
There's a political and social question out of this.

330
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?

331
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
There's some large companies that have seen this vision,

332
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
that are doing large-scale digitization,

333
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
but they're locking up the public domain.

334
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?

335
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?

336
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries

337
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?

338
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
So universal access to all knowledge --

339
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,

340
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.

341
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
It could be something that we're remembered for,

342
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
for millennia, for having achieved.

343
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
And as I said before, I'll end with something

344
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.

345
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country --

346
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:54,000
carved above his legacy, "Free to the People."

347
0:19:54.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:12.896,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, 2014 was a big year for me.

2
0:00:15.461,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Do you ever have that,

3
0:00:16.651,000 --> 0:00:18,000
just like a big year, like a banner year?

4
0:00:19.198,000 --> 0:00:2,000
For me, it went like this:

5
0:00:20.659,000 --> 0:00:23,000
October 3, I lost my second pregnancy.

6
0:00:23.982,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And then October 8, my dad died of cancer.

7
0:00:27.101,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And then on November 25, my husband Aaron died

8
0:00:29.895,000 --> 0:00:31,000
after three years with stage-four glioblastoma,

9
0:00:32.697,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which is just a fancy word for brain cancer.

10
0:00:36.822,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So, I'm fun.

11
0:00:38.639,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:40.036,000 --> 0:00:43,000
People love to invite me out all the time.

13
0:00:43.901,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Packed social life.

14
0:00:45.331,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Usually, when I talk about this period of my life,

15
0:00:48.419,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the reaction I get is essentially:

16
0:00:51.657,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Sighs)

17
0:00:53.616,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"I can't -- I can't imagine."

18
0:00:57.061,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I do think you can.

19
0:00:59.696,000 --> 0:01:,000
I think you can.

20
0:01:00.871,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I think that you should

21
0:01:02.262,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because, someday, it's going to happen to you.

22
0:01:04.903,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Maybe not these specific losses in this specific order or at this speed,

23
0:01:09.585,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but like I said, I'm very fun

24
0:01:10.999,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the research that I have seen will stun you:

25
0:01:14.72,000 --> 0:01:17,000
everyone you love has a 100 percent chance of dying.

26
0:01:18.354,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:20.974,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And that's why you came to TED.

28
0:01:22.569,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:24.655,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Applause)

30
0:01:28.292,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So, since all of this loss happened,

31
0:01:30.046,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I've made it a career to talk about death and loss,

32
0:01:34.363,000 --> 0:01:36,000
not just my own, because it's pretty easy to recap,

33
0:01:36.807,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but the losses and tragedies that other people have experienced.

34
0:01:40.877,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's a niche, I have to say.

35
0:01:43.24,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:45.005,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's a small niche, and I wish I made more money, but ...

37
0:01:48.128,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:49.482,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I've written some very uplifting books,

39
0:01:52.617,000 --> 0:01:55,000
host a very uplifting podcast, I started a little nonprofit.

40
0:01:56.334,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm just trying to do what I can

41
0:01:57.958,000 --> 0:02:,000
to make more people comfortable with the uncomfortable,

42
0:02:01.506,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and grief is so uncomfortable.

43
0:02:04.014,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's so uncomfortable, especially if it's someone else's grief.

44
0:02:09.323,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So part of that work is this group that I started with my friend Moe,

45
0:02:13.569,000 --> 0:02:14,000
who is also a widow;

46
0:02:14.815,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we call it the Hot Young Widows Club.

47
0:02:17.374,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:18.772,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And it's real, we have membership cards

49
0:02:21.271,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and T-shirts.

50
0:02:23.272,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And when your person dies, your husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend,

51
0:02:26.976,000 --> 0:02:27,000
literally don't care if you were married,

52
0:02:28.991,000 --> 0:02:3,000
your friends and your family are just going to look around

53
0:02:31.766,000 --> 0:02:33,000
through friends of friends of friends of friends

54
0:02:34.146,000 --> 0:02:36,000
until they find someone who's gone through something similar,

55
0:02:37.034,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and then they'll push you towards each other

56
0:02:39.419,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so you can talk amongst yourselves and not get your sad on other people.

57
0:02:43.81,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:45.993,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So that's what we do.

59
0:02:47.418,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's just a series of small groups,

60
0:02:50.934,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where men, women, gay, straight, married, partnered,

61
0:02:54.507,000 --> 0:02:58,000
can talk about their dead person,

62
0:02:58.8,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and say the things

63
0:03:00.07,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that the other people in their lives aren't ready or willing to hear yet.

64
0:03:03.813,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Huge range of conversations.

65
0:03:06.315,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Like, "My husband died two weeks ago,

66
0:03:08.127,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I can't stop thinking about sex, is that normal?"

67
0:03:10.469,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Yeah.

68
0:03:11.647,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"What if it's one of the Property Brothers?"

69
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Less normal, but I'll accept it.

70
0:03:15.29,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:18.91,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Things like, "Look, when I'm out in public and I see old people holding hands,

72
0:03:22.775,000 --> 0:03:24,000
couples who have clearly been together for decades,

73
0:03:25.385,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and then I look at them and I imagine

74
0:03:27.736,000 --> 0:03:29,000
all of the things they've been through together,

75
0:03:30.006,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the good things, the bad things,

76
0:03:31.569,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the arguments they've had over who should take out the trash ...

77
0:03:34.664,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I just find my heart filled with rage."

78
0:03:37.72,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:38.745,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And that example is personal to me.

80
0:03:42.077,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Most of the conversations that we have in the group

81
0:03:45.252,000 --> 0:03:46,000
can and will just stay amongst ourselves,

82
0:03:47.253,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but there are things that we talk about

83
0:03:49.196,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that the rest of the world -- the world that is grief-adjacent

84
0:03:52.403,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but not yet grief-stricken --

85
0:03:53.941,000 --> 0:03:54,000
could really benefit from hearing.

86
0:03:55.871,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And if you can't tell,

87
0:03:57.173,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'm only interested in / capable of unscientific studies,

88
0:04:01.577,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so what I did was go to The Hot Young Widows Club

89
0:04:03.975,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and say, "Hello, friends, remember when your person died?" They did.

90
0:04:08.609,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"Do you remember all the things people said to you?"

91
0:04:11.118,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Oh, yeah."

92
0:04:12.313,000 --> 0:04:13,000
"Which ones did you hate the most?"

93
0:04:14.1,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I got a lot of comments, lot of answers, people say a lot of things,

94
0:04:17.331,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but two rose to the top pretty quickly.

95
0:04:20.99,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"Moving on."

96
0:04:23.561,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, since 2014,

97
0:04:26.195,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I will tell you I have remarried a very handsome man named Matthew,

98
0:04:30.267,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we have four children in our blended family,

99
0:04:33.394,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we live in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.

100
0:04:36.911,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We have a rescue dog.

101
0:04:38.355,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:39.686,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I drive a minivan,

103
0:04:41.122,000 --> 0:04:43,000
like the kind where doors open and I don't even touch them.

104
0:04:43.962,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:45.17,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Like, by any "mezhure," life is good.

106
0:04:48.387,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I've also never said "mezhure," I've never once said it that way.

107
0:04:51.483,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

108
0:04:56.786,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I don't know where that came from.

109
0:04:58.461,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:00.246,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I've never heard anyone else say it that way.

111
0:05:02.545,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It looks like it should be said that way,

112
0:05:04.546,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and that's why the English language is trash, so ...

113
0:05:07.127,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:08.205,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So impressed with anyone who, like, speaks it

115
0:05:10.355,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in addition to a language that makes sense -- good job.

116
0:05:13.252,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:15.268,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But by any measure ...

118
0:05:16.728,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:18.252,000 --> 0:05:23,000
By any measure, life is really, really good, but I haven't "moved on."

120
0:05:24.085,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I haven't moved on, and I hate that phrase so much,

121
0:05:27.133,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and I understand why other people do.

122
0:05:28.948,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Because what it says

123
0:05:30.122,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is that Aaron's life and death and love are just moments

124
0:05:34.734,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that I can leave behind me -- and that I probably should.

125
0:05:38.561,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And when I talk about Aaron, I slip so easily into the present tense,

126
0:05:42.815,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I've always thought that made me weird.

127
0:05:45.395,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And then I noticed that everybody does it.

128
0:05:48.595,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And it's not because we are in denial or because we're forgetful,

129
0:05:52.786,000 --> 0:05:54,000
it's because the people we love, who we've lost,

130
0:05:55.071,000 --> 0:05:57,000
are still so present for us.

131
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:,000
So, when I say, "Oh, Aaron is ..."

132
0:06:02.276,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's because Aaron still is.

133
0:06:05.831,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And it's not in the way that he was before,

134
0:06:07.895,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which was much better,

135
0:06:09.102,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and it's not in the way that churchy people try to tell me that he would be.

136
0:06:12.768,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It's just that he's indelible,

137
0:06:17.411,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and so he is present for me.

138
0:06:20.61,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Here,

139
0:06:21.784,000 --> 0:06:23,000
he's present for me in the work that I do,

140
0:06:24.067,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in the child that we had together,

141
0:06:26.699,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in these three other children I'm raising,

142
0:06:28.778,000 --> 0:06:3,000
who never met him, who share none of his DNA,

143
0:06:31.588,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but who are only in my life because I had Aaron

144
0:06:35.477,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and because I lost Aaron.

145
0:06:38.302,000 --> 0:06:4,000
He's present in my marriage to Matthew,

146
0:06:40.677,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because Aaron's life and love and death

147
0:06:43.906,000 --> 0:06:45,000
made me the person that Matthew wanted to marry.

148
0:06:46.596,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So I've not moved on from Aaron,

149
0:06:50.853,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I've moved forward with him.

150
0:06:56.925,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

151
0:07:02.995,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We spread Aaron's ashes in his favorite river in Minnesota,

152
0:07:07.686,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and when the bag was empty --

153
0:07:09.217,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because when you're cremated, you fit into a plastic bag --

154
0:07:13.962,000 --> 0:07:15,000
there were still ashes stuck to my fingers.

155
0:07:16.906,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And I could have just put my hands in the water and rinsed them,

156
0:07:20.017,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but instead, I licked my hands clean,

157
0:07:23.617,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because I was so afraid of losing more than I had already lost,

158
0:07:27.363,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I was so desperate to make sure that he would always be a part of me.

159
0:07:32.371,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But of course he would be.

160
0:07:34.878,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Because when you watch your person fill himself with poison for three years,

161
0:07:39.363,000 --> 0:07:41,000
just so he can stay alive a little bit longer with you,

162
0:07:42.047,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that stays with you.

163
0:07:45.196,000 --> 0:07:49,000
When you watch him fade from the healthy person he was the night you met

164
0:07:49.87,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to nothing, that stays with you.

165
0:07:51.477,000 --> 0:07:53,000
When you watch your son, who isn't even two years old yet,

166
0:07:54.338,000 --> 0:07:56,000
walk up to his father's bed on the last day of his life,

167
0:07:57.053,000 --> 0:07:59,000
like he knows what's coming in a few hours,

168
0:07:59.347,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and say, "I love you. All done. Bye, bye."

169
0:08:05.776,000 --> 0:08:06,000
That stays with you.

170
0:08:09.347,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Just like when you fall in love, finally, like really fall in love

171
0:08:14.061,000 --> 0:08:16,000
with someone who gets you and sees you

172
0:08:16.427,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and you even see, "Oh, my God, I've been wrong this entire time.

173
0:08:19.548,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Love is not a contest or a reality show -- it's so quiet,

174
0:08:24.356,000 --> 0:08:27,000
it's this invisible thread of calm that connects the two of us

175
0:08:28.069,000 --> 0:08:29,000
even when everything is chaos,

176
0:08:29.861,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when things are falling apart, even when he's gone."

177
0:08:34.474,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That stays with you.

178
0:08:38.958,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We used to do this thing --

179
0:08:40.353,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because my hands are always freezing and he's so warm,

180
0:08:43.012,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where I would take my ice-cold hands and shove them up his shirt ...

181
0:08:46.886,000 --> 0:08:48,000
press them against his hot bod.

182
0:08:48.919,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:51.405,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And he hated it so much,

184
0:08:53.944,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:54.989,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but he loved me,

186
0:08:56.371,000 --> 0:09:,000
and after he died, I laid in bed with Aaron

187
0:09:01.252,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and I put my hands underneath him

188
0:09:05.355,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and I felt his warmth.

189
0:09:10.374,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And I can't even tell you if my hands were cold,

190
0:09:13.905,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but I can tell you

191
0:09:15.485,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that I knew it was the last time I would ever do that.

192
0:09:20.209,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And that that memory is always going to be sad.

193
0:09:23.733,000 --> 0:09:24,000
That memory will always hurt.

194
0:09:26.051,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Even when I'm 600 years old and I'm just a hologram.

195
0:09:28.919,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

196
0:09:32.204,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Just like the memory of meeting him is always going to make me laugh.

197
0:09:39.86,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Grief doesn't happen in this vacuum,

198
0:09:41.678,000 --> 0:09:47,000
it happens alongside of and mixed in with all of these other emotions.

199
0:09:50.024,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So, I met Matthew, my current husband --

200
0:09:54.596,000 --> 0:09:55,000
who doesn't love that title,

201
0:09:56.492,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

202
0:10:00.713,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but it's so accurate.

203
0:10:02.213,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

204
0:10:05.935,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I met Matthew, and ...

205
0:10:09.577,000 --> 0:10:12,000
there was this audible sigh of relief among the people who love me,

206
0:10:12.932,000 --> 0:10:14,000
like, "It's over!

207
0:10:16.68,000 --> 0:10:17,000
She did it.

208
0:10:19.069,000 --> 0:10:21,000
She got a happy ending, we can all go home.

209
0:10:21.561,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And we did good."

210
0:10:23.586,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And that narrative is so appealing even to me,

211
0:10:26.633,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and I thought maybe I had gotten that, too, but I didn't.

212
0:10:30.499,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I got another chapter.

213
0:10:33.061,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it's such a good chapter -- I love you, honey --

214
0:10:37.03,000 --> 0:10:38,000
it's such a good chapter.

215
0:10:39.419,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But especially at the beginning, it was like an alternate universe,

216
0:10:43.304,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or one of those old "choose your own adventure" books from the '80s

217
0:10:46.486,000 --> 0:10:47,000
where there are two parallel plot lines.

218
0:10:48.438,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So I opened my heart to Matthew,

219
0:10:50.056,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and my brain was like, "Would you like to think about Aaron?

220
0:10:54.409,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Like, the past, the present, future, just get in there," and I did.

221
0:10:59.052,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And all of a sudden, those two plots were unfurling at once,

222
0:11:02.165,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and falling in love with Matthew really helped me realize the enormity

223
0:11:05.776,000 --> 0:11:07,000
of what I lost when Aaron died.

224
0:11:09.68,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And just as importantly,

225
0:11:10.867,000 --> 0:11:13,000
it helped me realize that my love for Aaron

226
0:11:14.641,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and my grief for Aaron,

227
0:11:16.776,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and my love for Matthew, are not opposing forces.

228
0:11:22.68,000 --> 0:11:24,000
They are just strands to the same thread.

229
0:11:26.111,000 --> 0:11:27,000
They're the same stuff.

230
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I'm ... what would my parents say?

231
0:11:33.27,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I'm not special.

232
0:11:35.645,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

233
0:11:36.684,000 --> 0:11:38,000
They had four kids, they were like ... frankly.

234
0:11:39.244,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:41.053,000 --> 0:11:42,000
But I'm not, I'm not special.

236
0:11:42.845,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I know that, I'm fully aware

237
0:11:44.927,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that all day, every day, all around the world,

238
0:11:47.458,000 --> 0:11:48,000
terrible things are happening.

239
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
All the time.

240
0:11:50.435,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Like I said, fun person.

241
0:11:52.204,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But terrible things are happening,

242
0:11:54.714,000 --> 0:12:,000
people are experiencing deeply formative and traumatic losses every day.

243
0:12:01.132,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And as part of my job,

244
0:12:03.744,000 --> 0:12:04,000
this weird podcast that I have,

245
0:12:05.45,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I sometimes talk to people

246
0:12:06.722,000 --> 0:12:08,000
about the worst thing that's ever happened to them.

247
0:12:09.73,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And sometimes, that's the loss of someone they love,

248
0:12:12.785,000 --> 0:12:16,000
sometimes days ago or weeks ago, years ago, even decades ago.

249
0:12:18.373,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And these people that I interview,

250
0:12:20.927,000 --> 0:12:22,000
they haven't closed themselves around this loss

251
0:12:23.259,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and made it the center of their lives.

252
0:12:25.911,000 --> 0:12:29,000
They've lived, their worlds have kept spinning.

253
0:12:31.478,000 --> 0:12:34,000
But they're talking to me, a total stranger,

254
0:12:34.644,000 --> 0:12:35,000
about the person they love who has died,

255
0:12:36.603,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because these are the experiences

256
0:12:39.767,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that mark us and make us just as much as the joyful ones.

257
0:12:45.355,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And just as permanently.

258
0:12:48.895,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Long after you get your last sympathy card

259
0:12:51.49,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or your last hot dish.

260
0:12:53.546,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Like, we don't look at the people around us

261
0:12:55.601,000 --> 0:12:59,000
experiencing life's joys and wonders and tell them to "move on," do we?

262
0:13:00.124,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We don't send a card that's like, "Congratulations on your beautiful baby,"

263
0:13:03.704,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and then, five years later, think like, "Another birthday party? Get over it."

264
0:13:07.419,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Laughter)

265
0:13:09.109,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Yeah, we get it, he's five.

266
0:13:10.792,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Laughter)

267
0:13:12.244,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Wow.

268
0:13:13.442,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:16.148,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But grief is kind of one of those things,

270
0:13:18.188,000 --> 0:13:21,000
like, falling in love or having a baby or watching "The Wire" on HBO,

271
0:13:21.991,000 --> 0:13:25,000
where you don't get it until you get it, until you do it.

272
0:13:27.219,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And once you do it, once it's your love or your baby,

273
0:13:32.546,000 --> 0:13:37,000
once it's your grief and your front row at the funeral,

274
0:13:37.76,000 --> 0:13:38,000
you get it.

275
0:13:39.315,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You understand what you're experiencing is not a moment in time,

276
0:13:43.475,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it's not a bone that will reset,

277
0:13:45.441,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but that you've been touched by something chronic.

278
0:13:48.919,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Something incurable.

279
0:13:50.141,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's not fatal, but sometimes grief feels like it could be.

280
0:13:55.269,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And if we can't prevent it in one another,

281
0:13:58.872,000 --> 0:13:59,000
what can we do?

282
0:14:02.554,000 --> 0:14:06,000
What can we do other than try to remind one another

283
0:14:06.898,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that some things can't be fixed,

284
0:14:10.136,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and not all wounds are meant to heal?

285
0:14:14.493,000 --> 0:14:17,000
We need each other to remember,

286
0:14:17.708,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to help each other remember,

287
0:14:19.494,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that grief is this multitasking emotion.

288
0:14:22.287,000 --> 0:14:27,000
That you can and will be sad, and happy; you'll be grieving, and able to love

289
0:14:28.108,000 --> 0:14:31,000
in the same year or week, the same breath.

290
0:14:32.982,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We need to remember that a grieving person is going to laugh again and smile again.

291
0:14:39.498,000 --> 0:14:42,000
If they're lucky, they'll even find love again.

292
0:14:43.697,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But yes, absolutely, they're going to move forward.

293
0:14:48.071,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But that doesn't mean that they've moved on.

294
0:14:52.253,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Thank you.

295
0:14:53.436,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Applause)

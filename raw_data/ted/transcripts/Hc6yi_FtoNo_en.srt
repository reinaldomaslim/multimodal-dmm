1
0:00:16.069,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well, the subject of difficult negotiation

2
0:00:18.458,000 --> 0:00:21,000
reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the Middle East,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of a man who left to his three sons, 17 camels.

4
0:00:26.038,000 --> 0:00:28,000
To the first son, he left half the camels;

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to the second son, he left a third of the camels;

6
0:00:30.674,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and to the youngest son, he left a ninth of the camels.

7
0:00:33.293,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The three sons got into a negotiation -- 17 doesn't divide by two.

8
0:00:37.131,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It doesn't divide by three.

9
0:00:38.893,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It doesn't divide by nine.

10
0:00:40.456,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Brotherly tempers started to get strained.

11
0:00:42.726,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Finally, in desperation,

12
0:00:44.029,000 --> 0:00:47,000
they went and they consulted a wise old woman.

13
0:00:47.714,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The wise old woman thought about their problem for a long time,

14
0:00:50.713,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and finally she came back and said, "Well, I don't know if I can help you,

15
0:00:54.241,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but at least, if you want, you can have my camel."

16
0:00:56.642,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So then, they had 18 camels.

17
0:00:58.134,000 --> 0:01:,000
The first son took his half -- half of 18 is nine.

18
0:01:01.016,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six.

19
0:01:03.734,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The youngest son took his ninth -- a ninth of 18 is two.

20
0:01:07.63,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You get 17.

21
0:01:09.843,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They had one camel left over.

22
0:01:11.677,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They gave it back to the wise old woman.

23
0:01:13.629,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now, if you think about that story for a moment,

25
0:01:17.523,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I think it resembles a lot of the difficult negotiations

26
0:01:21.118,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we get involved in.

27
0:01:22.356,000 --> 0:01:24,000
They start off like 17 camels, no way to resolve it.

28
0:01:24.856,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Somehow, what we need to do

29
0:01:26.316,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is step back from those situations, like that wise old woman,

30
0:01:30.021,000 --> 0:01:32,000
look at the situation through fresh eyes

31
0:01:32.077,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and come up with an 18th camel.

32
0:01:35.133,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Finding that 18th camel in the world's conflicts

33
0:01:37.923,000 --> 0:01:39,000
has been my life passion.

34
0:01:40.105,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I basically see humanity a bit like those three brothers.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We're all one family.

36
0:01:45.405,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We know that scientifically,

37
0:01:47.378,000 --> 0:01:48,000
thanks to the communications revolution,

38
0:01:49.348,000 --> 0:01:52,000
all the tribes on the planet -- all 15,000 tribes --

39
0:01:52.94,000 --> 0:01:53,000
are in touch with each other.

40
0:01:55.543,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And it's a big family reunion.

41
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And yet, like many family reunions,

42
0:01:59.666,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it's not all peace and light.

43
0:02:01.913,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There's a lot of conflict,

44
0:02:03.838,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and the question is: How do we deal with our differences?

45
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
How do we deal with our deepest differences,

46
0:02:09.38,000 --> 0:02:11,000
given the human propensity for conflict

47
0:02:12.113,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the human genius at devising weapons of enormous destruction?

48
0:02:16.664,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's the question.

49
0:02:18.437,000 --> 0:02:22,000
As I've spent the last better part of three decades, almost four,

50
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
traveling the world,

51
0:02:25.339,000 --> 0:02:28,000
trying to work, getting involved in conflicts

52
0:02:28.732,000 --> 0:02:31,000
ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East

53
0:02:32.136,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to Chechnya to Venezuela --

54
0:02:33.884,000 --> 0:02:36,000
some of the most difficult conflicts on the face of the planet --

55
0:02:36.981,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I've been asking myself that question.

56
0:02:39.096,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I think I've found, in some ways, what is the secret to peace.

57
0:02:42.516,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's actually surprisingly simple.

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's not easy, but it's simple.

59
0:02:48.46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's not even new.

60
0:02:49.715,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It may be one of our most ancient human heritages.

61
0:02:53.113,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The secret to peace is us.

62
0:02:55.922,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's us who act as a surrounding community around any conflict,

63
0:03:01.088,000 --> 0:03:03,000
who can play a constructive role.

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Let me give you just a story, an example.

65
0:03:07.204,000 --> 0:03:08,000
About 20 years ago,

66
0:03:08.38,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I was in South Africa, working with the parties in that conflict,

67
0:03:11.645,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I had an extra month,

68
0:03:12.932,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so I spent some time living with several groups of San Bushmen.

69
0:03:17.522,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I was curious about them, about the way in which they resolve conflict.

70
0:03:21.49,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Because, after all, within living memory, they were hunters and gatherers,

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
living pretty much like our ancestors lived

72
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for maybe 99 percent of the human story.

73
0:03:30.473,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting --

74
0:03:33.86,000 --> 0:03:34,000
absolutely fatal.

75
0:03:35.402,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So how do they deal with their differences?

76
0:03:37.72,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities,

77
0:03:42.333,000 --> 0:03:45,000
someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush,

78
0:03:45.928,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and then everyone sits around in a circle like this,

79
0:03:49.587,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and they sit and they talk and they talk.

80
0:03:52.563,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It may take two days, three days, four days,

81
0:03:54.898,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but they don't rest until they find a resolution

82
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or better yet -- a reconciliation.

83
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And if tempers are still too high,

84
0:04:02.317,000 --> 0:04:04,000
then they send someone off to visit some relatives,

85
0:04:04.88,000 --> 0:04:05,000
as a cooling-off period.

86
0:04:06.658,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Well, that system is, I think, probably the system

87
0:04:09.667,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that kept us alive to this point,

88
0:04:11.427,000 --> 0:04:12,000
given our human tendencies.

89
0:04:14.101,000 --> 0:04:17,000
That system, I call "the third side."

90
0:04:17.316,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Because if you think about it, normally when we think of conflict,

91
0:04:20.459,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when we describe it,

92
0:04:21.634,000 --> 0:04:22,000
there's always two sides --

93
0:04:23.031,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management,

94
0:04:25.761,000 --> 0:04:28,000
husband versus wife, Republicans versus Democrats.

95
0:04:28.936,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But what we don't often see

96
0:04:30.745,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is that there's always a third side,

97
0:04:33.135,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and the third side of the conflict is us, it's the surrounding community,

98
0:04:36.831,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it's the friends, the allies,

99
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the family members, the neighbors.

100
0:04:40.092,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we can play an incredibly constructive role.

101
0:04:43.48,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Perhaps the most fundamental way in which the third side can help

102
0:04:48.319,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is to remind the parties of what's really at stake.

103
0:04:51.596,000 --> 0:04:53,000
For the sake of the kids, for the sake of the family,

104
0:04:54.124,000 --> 0:04:56,000
for the sake of the community, for the sake of the future,

105
0:04:56.918,000 --> 0:04:58,000
let's stop fighting for a moment and start talking.

106
0:05:00.066,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Because, the thing is,

107
0:05:01.565,000 --> 0:05:02,000
when we're involved in conflict,

108
0:05:03.162,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it's very easy to lose perspective.

109
0:05:05.745,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It's very easy to react.

110
0:05:07.808,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Human beings -- we're reaction machines.

111
0:05:10.705,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And as the saying goes,

112
0:05:12.102,000 --> 0:05:14,000
when angry, you will make the best speech

113
0:05:14.649,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you will ever regret.

114
0:05:16.158,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:17.84,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so the third side reminds us of that.

116
0:05:20.86,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The third side helps us go to the balcony,

117
0:05:22.909,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which is a metaphor for a place of perspective,

118
0:05:25.639,000 --> 0:05:27,000
where we can keep our eyes on the prize.

119
0:05:28.069,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Let me tell you a little story from my own negotiating experience.

120
0:05:31.673,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Some years ago, I was involved as a facilitator in some very tough talks

121
0:05:36.768,000 --> 0:05:39,000
between the leaders of Russia and the leaders of Chechnya.

122
0:05:40.689,000 --> 0:05:41,000
There was a war going on, as you know.

123
0:05:43.055,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And we met in the Hague, in the Peace Palace,

124
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in the same room where the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal was taking place.

125
0:05:51.391,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And the talks got off to a rather rocky start

126
0:05:54.287,000 --> 0:05:57,000
when the vice president of Chechnya began by pointing at the Russians

127
0:05:57.719,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and said, "You should stay right here in your seats,

128
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
because you're going to be on trial for war crimes."

129
0:06:03.095,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And then he turned to me and said,

130
0:06:04.929,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"You're an American.

131
0:06:06.135,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico."

132
0:06:09.385,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico? What do I know about Puerto Rico?"

133
0:06:13.032,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I started reacting.

134
0:06:14.208,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:15.233,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But then, I tried to remember to go to the balcony.

136
0:06:18.093,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And then when he paused

137
0:06:19.315,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and everyone looked at me for a response,

138
0:06:21.42,000 --> 0:06:24,000
from a balcony perspective, I was able to thank him for his remarks

139
0:06:24.822,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and say, "I appreciate your criticism of my country

140
0:06:27.623,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and I take it as a sign that we're among friends

141
0:06:30.094,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and can speak candidly to one another."

142
0:06:32.009,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:33.034,000 --> 0:06:36,000
"And what we're here to do is not to talk about Puerto Rico or the past.

144
0:06:36.439,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We're here to see if we can figure out a way

145
0:06:38.644,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya."

146
0:06:42.111,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The conversation got back on track.

147
0:06:44.45,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's the role of the third side,

148
0:06:46.133,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to help the parties go to the balcony.

149
0:06:49.082,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now let me take you, for a moment,

150
0:06:51.333,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to what's widely regarded as the world's most difficult conflict,

151
0:06:54.422,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or the most impossible conflict, the Middle East.

152
0:06:56.987,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Question is: where's the third side there?

153
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
How could we possibly go to the balcony?

154
0:07:02.765,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now, I don't pretend to have an answer to the Middle East conflict,

155
0:07:06.766,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but I think I've got a first step -- literally, a first step --

156
0:07:10.75,000 --> 0:07:12,000
something that any one of us could do as third-siders.

157
0:07:13.761,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Let me just ask you one question first.

158
0:07:15.992,000 --> 0:07:18,000
How many of you in the last years

159
0:07:20.009,000 --> 0:07:23,000
have ever found yourself worrying about the Middle East

160
0:07:23.068,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and wondering what anyone could do?

161
0:07:24.844,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Just out of curiosity, how many of you?

162
0:07:26.985,000 --> 0:07:28,000
OK, so the great majority of us.

163
0:07:29.977,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And here, it's so far away.

164
0:07:31.605,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict?

165
0:07:34.545,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Is it the number of deaths?

166
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There are a hundred times more people who die in a conflict in Africa

167
0:07:39.681,000 --> 0:07:4,000
than in the Middle East.

168
0:07:40.856,000 --> 0:07:42,000
No, it's because of the story,

169
0:07:42.967,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because we feel personally involved in that story.

170
0:07:46.699,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews, religious or non-religious,

171
0:07:50.552,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we feel we have a personal stake in it.

172
0:07:52.449,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Stories matter;

173
0:07:53.624,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as an anthropologist, I know that.

174
0:07:55.406,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Stories are what we use to transmit knowledge.

175
0:07:59.048,000 --> 0:08:,000
They give meaning to our lives.

176
0:08:00.593,000 --> 0:08:02,000
That's what we tell here at TED, we tell stories.

177
0:08:03.314,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Stories are the key.

178
0:08:04.492,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And so my question is --

179
0:08:07.73,000 --> 0:08:11,000
yes, let's try and resolve the politics there in the Middle East,

180
0:08:11.93,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but let's also take a look at the story.

181
0:08:14.478,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Let's try to get at the root of what it's all about.

182
0:08:16.946,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Let's see if we can apply the third side to it.

183
0:08:19.19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
What would that mean? What is the story there?

184
0:08:22.018,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, as anthropologists, we know that every culture has an origin story.

185
0:08:26.756,000 --> 0:08:28,000
What's the origin story of the Middle East?

186
0:08:28.881,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In a phrase, it's:

187
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Four thousand years ago,

188
0:08:31.875,000 --> 0:08:34,000
a man and his family walked across the Middle East,

189
0:08:35.889,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and the world has never been the same since.

190
0:08:39.071,000 --> 0:08:41,000
That man, of course, was Abraham.

191
0:08:42.569,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And what he stood for was unity, the unity of the family;

192
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
he's the father of us all.

193
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But it's not just what he stood for, it's what his message was.

194
0:08:51.273,000 --> 0:08:52,000
His basic message was unity too,

195
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all.

196
0:08:56.494,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And his basic value was respect,

197
0:08:59.828,000 --> 0:09:,000
was kindness toward strangers.

198
0:09:01.72,000 --> 0:09:04,000
That's what he's known for, his hospitality.

199
0:09:05.308,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So in that sense,

200
0:09:06.959,000 --> 0:09:09,000
he's the symbolic third side of the Middle East.

201
0:09:10.943,000 --> 0:09:14,000
He's the one who reminds us that we're all part of a greater whole.

202
0:09:15.707,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Now, think about that for a moment.

203
0:09:19.674,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Today, we face the scourge of terrorism.

204
0:09:22.551,000 --> 0:09:23,000
What is terrorism?

205
0:09:24.408,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger

206
0:09:27.691,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and treating them as an enemy whom you kill in order to create fear.

207
0:09:32.863,000 --> 0:09:33,000
What's the opposite of terrorism?

208
0:09:35.236,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's taking an innocent stranger

209
0:09:36.98,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and treating them as a friend whom you welcome into your home,

210
0:09:41.391,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in order to sow and create understanding

211
0:09:44.107,000 --> 0:09:45,000
or respect, or love.

212
0:09:46.853,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So what if, then, you took the story of Abraham,

213
0:09:51.537,000 --> 0:09:52,000
which is a third-side story,

214
0:09:53.194,000 --> 0:09:55,000
what if that could be --

215
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because Abraham stands for hospitality --

216
0:09:58.605,000 --> 0:10:01,000
what if that could be an antidote to terrorism?

217
0:10:01.843,000 --> 0:10:04,000
What if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance?

218
0:10:05.689,000 --> 0:10:07,000
How would you bring that story to life?

219
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now, it's not enough just to tell a story.

220
0:10:11.046,000 --> 0:10:14,000
That's powerful, but people need to experience the story.

221
0:10:14.464,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They need to be able to live the story.

222
0:10:16.442,000 --> 0:10:17,000
How would you do that?

223
0:10:17.742,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And that was my thinking of how would you do that.

224
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And that's what comes to the first step here.

225
0:10:22.427,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Because the simple way to do that is:

226
0:10:25.174,000 --> 0:10:26,000
you go for a walk.

227
0:10:26.983,000 --> 0:10:29,000
You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham.

228
0:10:30.422,000 --> 0:10:32,000
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham.

229
0:10:33.374,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Because walking has a real power.

230
0:10:36.67,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human.

231
0:10:39.751,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's funny -- when you walk, you walk side-by-side,

232
0:10:43.97,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in the same common direction.

233
0:10:46.612,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face

234
0:10:48.697,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and come this close to you,

235
0:10:50.967,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you would feel threatened.

236
0:10:54.977,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,

237
0:10:57.056,000 --> 0:10:58,000
even touching shoulders,

238
0:10:58.961,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it's no problem.

239
0:11:00.668,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Who fights while they walk?

240
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
That's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough,

241
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
people go for walks in the woods.

242
0:11:07.679,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So the idea came to me of, what about inspiring a path,

243
0:11:13.125,000 --> 0:11:16,000
a route -- think the Silk Route, think the Appalachian Trail --

244
0:11:16.787,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that followed in the footsteps of Abraham?

245
0:11:21.037,000 --> 0:11:22,000
People said, "That's crazy. You can't.

246
0:11:22.886,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You can't retrace the footsteps of Abraham -- it's too insecure,

247
0:11:25.922,000 --> 0:11:26,000
you've got to cross all these borders,

248
0:11:27.804,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it goes across 10 different countries in the Middle East,

249
0:11:30.51,000 --> 0:11:31,000
because it unites them all."

250
0:11:32.35,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And so we studied the idea at Harvard.

251
0:11:34.21,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We did our due diligence.

252
0:11:35.464,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And then a few years ago,

253
0:11:36.687,000 --> 0:11:38,000
a group of us, about 25 of us from 10 different countries,

254
0:11:39.441,000 --> 0:11:42,000
decided to see if we could retrace the footsteps of Abraham,

255
0:11:42.645,000 --> 0:11:44,000
going from his initial birthplace in the city of Urfa

256
0:11:45.169,000 --> 0:11:47,000
in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.

257
0:11:47.848,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And we then took a bus and took some walks

258
0:11:50.832,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and went to Harran, where, in the Bible, he sets off on his journey.

259
0:11:55.013,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo,

260
0:11:57.59,000 --> 0:11:59,000
which, turns out, is named after Abraham.

261
0:11:59.962,000 --> 0:12:,000
We went to Damascus,

262
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
which has a long history associated with Abraham.

263
0:12:04.028,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We then came to Northern Jordan,

264
0:12:06.814,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to Jerusalem -- which is all about Abraham -- to Bethlehem,

265
0:12:11.864,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and finally, to the place where he's buried, in Hebron.

266
0:12:15.259,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So effectively, we went from womb to tomb.

267
0:12:17.566,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We showed it could be done.

268
0:12:18.891,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It was an amazing journey.

269
0:12:20.594,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Let me ask you a question.

270
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
How many of you have had the experience of being in a strange neighborhood

271
0:12:26.647,000 --> 0:12:28,000
or strange land,

272
0:12:28.887,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and a total stranger, perfect stranger,

273
0:12:32.076,000 --> 0:12:34,000
comes up to you and shows you some kindness --

274
0:12:34.822,000 --> 0:12:36,000
maybe invites you into their home, gives you a drink,

275
0:12:37.345,000 --> 0:12:38,000
gives you a coffee, gives you a meal?

276
0:12:39.148,000 --> 0:12:41,000
How many of you have ever had that experience?

277
0:12:41.342,000 --> 0:12:43,000
That's the essence of the Abraham Path.

278
0:12:44.157,000 --> 0:12:47,000
That's what you discover as you go into these villages in the Middle East

279
0:12:47.698,000 --> 0:12:48,000
where you expect hostility,

280
0:12:49.057,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and you get the most amazing hospitality,

281
0:12:51.628,000 --> 0:12:52,000
all associated with Abraham:

282
0:12:53.061,000 --> 0:12:56,000
"In the name of Father Ibrahim, let me offer you some food."

283
0:12:56.845,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So what we discovered

284
0:12:58.052,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is that Abraham is not just a figure out of a book for those people;

285
0:13:01.284,000 --> 0:13:04,000
he's alive, he's a living presence.

286
0:13:04.464,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And to make a long story short,

287
0:13:06.615,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in the last couple of years now,

288
0:13:08.701,000 --> 0:13:12,000
thousands of people have begun to walk parts of the path of Abraham

289
0:13:13.561,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in the Middle East,

290
0:13:14.918,000 --> 0:13:17,000
enjoying the hospitality of the people there.

291
0:13:17.997,000 --> 0:13:2,000
They've begun to walk in Israel and Palestine,

292
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.

293
0:13:24.004,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It's an amazing experience.

294
0:13:25.337,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Men, women, young people, old people --

295
0:13:27.646,000 --> 0:13:29,000
more women than men, actually, interestingly.

296
0:13:30.501,000 --> 0:13:31,000
For those who can't walk,

297
0:13:32.46,000 --> 0:13:34,000
who are unable to get there right now,

298
0:13:34.999,000 --> 0:13:37,000
people started to organize walks in cities, in their own communities.

299
0:13:38.643,000 --> 0:13:4,000
In Cincinnati, for instance, they organized a walk

300
0:13:41.041,000 --> 0:13:44,000
from a church to a mosque to a synagogue and all had an Abrahamic meal together.

301
0:13:44.907,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It was Abraham Path Day.

302
0:13:46.393,000 --> 0:13:48,000
In São Paulo, Brazil, it's become an annual event

303
0:13:48.823,000 --> 0:13:51,000
for thousands of people to run in a virtual Abraham Path Run,

304
0:13:52.675,000 --> 0:13:53,000
uniting the different communities.

305
0:13:54.47,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The media love it; they really adore it.

306
0:13:57.474,000 --> 0:14:,000
They lavish attention on it because it's visual

307
0:14:00.952,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and it spreads the idea,

308
0:14:02.64,000 --> 0:14:06,000
this idea of Abrahamic hospitality, of kindness towards strangers.

309
0:14:07.046,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And just a couple weeks ago, there was an NPR story on it.

310
0:14:11.849,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Last month,

311
0:14:13.041,000 --> 0:14:18,000
there was a piece in the Manchester Guardian about it,

312
0:14:18.982,000 --> 0:14:19,000
two whole pages.

313
0:14:21.609,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And they quoted a villager

314
0:14:24.853,000 --> 0:14:27,000
who said, "This walk connects us to the world."

315
0:14:27.964,000 --> 0:14:29,000
He said, "It was like a light that went on in our lives --

316
0:14:30.805,000 --> 0:14:31,000
it brought us hope."

317
0:14:32.696,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And so that's what it's about.

318
0:14:34.802,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But it's not just about psychology;

319
0:14:36.632,000 --> 0:14:37,000
it's about economics.

320
0:14:38.132,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Because as people walk, they spend money.

321
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad,

322
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan.

323
0:14:47.434,000 --> 0:14:48,000
She's desperately poor.

324
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
She's partially blind, her husband can't work,

325
0:14:52.929,000 --> 0:14:53,000
she's got seven kids.

326
0:14:55.373,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But what she can do is cook.

327
0:14:57.931,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And so she's begun to cook for some groups of walkers

328
0:15:00.496,000 --> 0:15:03,000
who come through the village and have a meal in her home.

329
0:15:04.124,000 --> 0:15:07,000
They sit on the floor -- she doesn't even have a tablecloth.

330
0:15:07.448,000 --> 0:15:08,000
She makes the most delicious food,

331
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside.

332
0:15:12.406,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And so more and more walkers have come,

333
0:15:14.557,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and lately she's begun to earn an income to support her family.

334
0:15:18.475,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And so she told our team there, she said,

335
0:15:21.376,000 --> 0:15:24,000
"You have made me visible

336
0:15:24.566,000 --> 0:15:27,000
in a village where people were once ashamed to look at me."

337
0:15:29.015,000 --> 0:15:31,000
That's the potential of the Abraham Path.

338
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
There are literally hundreds of those kinds of communities

339
0:15:34.046,000 --> 0:15:36,000
across the Middle East, across the path.

340
0:15:37.456,000 --> 0:15:39,000
The potential is basically to change the game.

341
0:15:40.719,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And to change the game, you have to change the frame, the way we see things --

342
0:15:44.449,000 --> 0:15:49,000
to change the frame from hostility to hospitality,

343
0:15:49.791,000 --> 0:15:51,000
from terrorism to tourism.

344
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And in that sense, the Abraham Path

345
0:15:55.021,000 --> 0:15:56,000
is a game-changer.

346
0:15:57.147,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Let me just show you one thing.

347
0:15:58.949,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I have a little acorn here

348
0:16:00.583,000 --> 0:16:03,000
that I picked up while I was walking on the path earlier this year.

349
0:16:04.626,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Now, the acorn is associated with the oak tree, of course --

350
0:16:07.497,000 --> 0:16:1,000
grows into an oak tree, which is associated with Abraham.

351
0:16:10.599,000 --> 0:16:11,000
The path right now is like an acorn;

352
0:16:12.566,000 --> 0:16:13,000
it's still in its early phase.

353
0:16:14.653,000 --> 0:16:15,000
What would the oak tree look like?

354
0:16:16.597,000 --> 0:16:17,000
When I think back to my childhood,

355
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
a good part of which I spent, after being born here in Chicago,

356
0:16:21.237,000 --> 0:16:22,000
I spent in Europe.

357
0:16:23.071,000 --> 0:16:29,000
If you had been in the ruins of, say, London in 1945, or Berlin,

358
0:16:29.801,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and you had said,

359
0:16:31.024,000 --> 0:16:32,000
"Sixty years from now,

360
0:16:32.731,000 --> 0:16:35,000
this is going to be the most peaceful, prosperous part of the planet,"

361
0:16:36.08,000 --> 0:16:39,000
people would have thought you were certifiably insane.

362
0:16:39.418,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe,

363
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and a common economy.

364
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So my question is, if it can be done in Europe,

365
0:16:48.593,000 --> 0:16:49,000
why not in the Middle East?

366
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Why not, thanks to a common identity, which is the story of Abraham,

367
0:16:54.971,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and thanks to a common economy that would be based, in good part, on tourism?

368
0:17:00.45,000 --> 0:17:02,000
So let me conclude, then,

369
0:17:02.681,000 --> 0:17:05,000
by saying that in the last 35 years,

370
0:17:06.054,000 --> 0:17:08,000
as I've worked in some of the most dangerous,

371
0:17:08.495,000 --> 0:17:1,000
difficult and intractable conflicts around the planet,

372
0:17:11.446,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I have yet to see one conflict that I felt could not be transformed.

373
0:17:17.598,000 --> 0:17:18,000
It's not easy, of course.

374
0:17:19.963,000 --> 0:17:2,000
But it's possible.

375
0:17:21.726,000 --> 0:17:22,000
It was done in South Africa.

376
0:17:23.69,000 --> 0:17:24,000
It was done in Northern Ireland.

377
0:17:25.599,000 --> 0:17:26,000
It could be done anywhere.

378
0:17:27.14,000 --> 0:17:29,000
It simply depends on us.

379
0:17:29.79,000 --> 0:17:31,000
It depends on us taking the third side.

380
0:17:33.182,000 --> 0:17:36,000
So let me invite you to consider taking the third side,

381
0:17:36.818,000 --> 0:17:37,000
even as a very small step.

382
0:17:38.508,000 --> 0:17:4,000
We're about to take a break in a moment.

383
0:17:40.754,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Just go up to someone

384
0:17:42.755,000 --> 0:17:44,000
who's from a different culture, a different country,

385
0:17:45.422,000 --> 0:17:47,000
a different ethnicity -- some difference --

386
0:17:47.801,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and engage them in a conversation.

387
0:17:49.462,000 --> 0:17:5,000
Listen to them.

388
0:17:50.72,000 --> 0:17:51,000
That's a third-side act.

389
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
That's walking Abraham's Path.

390
0:17:54.568,000 --> 0:17:55,000
After a TED Talk,

391
0:17:56.117,000 --> 0:17:57,000
why not a TED Walk?

392
0:17:57.59,000 --> 0:17:58,000
(Laughter)

393
0:17:59.035,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So let me just leave you with three things.

394
0:18:03.222,000 --> 0:18:07,000
One is, the secret to peace is the third side.

395
0:18:08.646,000 --> 0:18:1,000
The third side is us.

396
0:18:11.09,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Each of us, with a single step,

397
0:18:14.685,000 --> 0:18:16,000
can take the world, can bring the world

398
0:18:17.429,000 --> 0:18:18,000
a step closer to peace.

399
0:18:20.578,000 --> 0:18:22,000
There's an old African proverb that goes:

400
0:18:22.658,000 --> 0:18:24,000
"When spiderwebs unite,

401
0:18:24.848,000 --> 0:18:26,000
they can halt even the lion."

402
0:18:27.93,000 --> 0:18:31,000
If we're able to unite our third-side webs of peace,

403
0:18:32.229,000 --> 0:18:35,000
we can even halt the lion of war.

404
0:18:35.261,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Thank you very much.

405
0:18:36.436,000 --> 0:18:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,

3
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which we will hope to see happen.

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.

6
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions

7
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that will change the lives of many people.

8
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
At the present time, it takes an average of three hours

9
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient,

10
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:04,000
before that patient arrives at an emergency room.

11
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And people with silent ischemia --

12
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms --

13
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.

14
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction,

15
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money --

16
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
-- means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans.

18
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Mortality: 300,000 people dying each year.

19
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:36,000
About half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart

20
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that will cause them to have very bad problems later on.

21
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Thus 900,000 people either have died

22
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or have significant damage to their heart muscle.

23
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Symptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men,

24
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because we are very brave. We are very brave,

25
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.

26
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Then, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.

27
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
What are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives?

28
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.

29
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Well, what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack?

30
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.

31
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.

32
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The means consist of noting something a little technical,

33
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
ST segment elevation of the electrogram --

34
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
translated into English, that means that

35
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
if there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG --

36
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which we call the ST segment -- elevates,

37
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that is a sure sign of a heart attack.

38
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,

39
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we could know, before they even have symptoms,

40
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that they're having a heart attack, to save their life.

41
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage

42
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that will trigger an emergency alarm,

43
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:1,000
vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.

44
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,

45
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.

46
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So we have to try these devices out

47
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because the FDA won't just let us use them on people

48
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
unless we try it out first,

49
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the best model for this happens to be pigs.

50
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,

51
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
like you see in an emergency room,

52
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.

53
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,

54
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
which does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.

55
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Well, with the pig, at the baseline,

56
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:58,000
before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.

57
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:03,000
After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,

58
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and after three minutes -- well,

59
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
if you really studied it, you'd see a difference.

60
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?

61
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There was the baseline -- first of all, a much bigger and more reliable signal.

62
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Second of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,

63
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.

64
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much --

65
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
every layperson could see that difference,

66
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.

67
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Then, look at that after three minutes.

68
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We see that the signal that's actually in the heart,

69
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack

70
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
even before they have symptoms so we can save their life.

71
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Then we tried it with my son, Dr. Tim Fischell,

72
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.

73
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Well, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,

74
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.

75
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And it's not hard to see that -- the baseline

76
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is the first picture on the upper left.

77
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,

78
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
then this rise -- that's the ST elevation.

79
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And if we had a computer that could detect it,

80
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early

81
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.

82
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later

83
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,

84
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,

85
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:46,000
with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.

86
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And computers don't go to sleep.

87
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We have a little battery and on this little battery

88
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that computer will run for five years without needing replacement.

89
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
What does the system look like?

90
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,

91
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it.

92
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.

93
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's implanted with very conventional techniques.

94
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.

95
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room

96
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:25,000
when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.

97
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,

98
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.

99
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The FDA says, OK, test this final device after it's built in some animal,

100
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:46,000
which we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.

101
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,

102
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
so we said, well, we're experts in stents.

103
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents.

104
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We said, so we'll put in a stent,

105
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.

106
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We're putting in a copper stent,

107
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.

108
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
That's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.

109
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,

110
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and let me show you the result that's very gratifying

111
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
as far as people who have heart disease are concerned.

112
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So there it was, Thursday morning we stopped the pig's medication

113
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart

114
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
coming out by radio telemetry.

115
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Then, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,

116
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which later we had the pig run around --

117
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I'm not going to go into this early stage.

118
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication

119
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that kept him from having a heart attack.

120
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?

121
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation?

122
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.

123
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:12,000
What happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?

124
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Your rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.

125
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats --

126
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:29,000
this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line.

127
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.

128
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Well, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,

129
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
because we need to do this type of animal research for humans.

130
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.

131
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.

132
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?

133
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.

134
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.

135
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Several hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.

136
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Finally, you go to the emergency room.

137
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,

138
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains

139
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:23,000
don't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.

140
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They finally see you. It takes more time

141
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,

142
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,

143
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
which the computer we put in you gets.

144
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Finally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,

145
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but the heart muscle has died.

146
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not Africa --

147
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.

148
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So we developed the AngelMed Guardian System

149
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.

150
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:,000
And when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off

151
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,

152
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago

153
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room

154
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and show them, and say, take care of me right away.

155
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Then it goes to a network operations center,

156
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
where they get your data from your patient database

157
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.

158
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,

159
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:32,000
your signal appears on the screen of a computer

160
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the computer analyzes what your problem is.

161
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you --

162
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:41,000
this is also a cell phone -- and says,

163
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:44,000
"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.

164
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.

165
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.

166
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,

167
0:10:57,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and we're going to send the signal to the hospital

168
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and we're going to have it analyzed there,

169
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and there you're going to be with your doctor

170
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."

171
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:1,000
That's the first invention that I wanted to describe.

172
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Applause)

173
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And now I want to talk about something entirely different.

174
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:21,000
At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem

175
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
because I'd never had a migraine headache,

176
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,

177
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and their lives are being totally ruined by it.

178
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,

179
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches

180
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:41,000
by the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse

181
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
applied, as needed, by the patient."

182
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now, you're probably very few physicists here.

183
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,

184
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:55,000
which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water --

185
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that's your brains by the way --

186
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:02,000
it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain

187
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
can erase a migraine headache.

188
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:06,000
That's what we have discovered.

189
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So here's a picture of what we're doing.

190
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:14,000
The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura

191
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:18,000
have a band of excited neurons -- that's shown in red --

192
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.

193
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.

194
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:33,000
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,

195
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture --

196
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but it sort of begins with little dancing lights,

197
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.

198
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.

199
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.

200
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And here's one of the patients who has an aura

201
0:12:56,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?

202
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:04,000
This is what an aura looks like.

203
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.

204
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.

205
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:18,000
In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,

206
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."

207
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:

208
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.

209
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
What does that mean?

210
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:35,000
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current

211
0:13:35,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.

212
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And finally he says, "OK, now I'm going to -- "

213
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:47,000
all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.

214
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What is the result? We designed a magnetic depolarizer

215
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that looks like this, that you could have -- a lady, in her pocket book --

216
0:13:56,000 --> 0:14:,000
and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.

217
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Well, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,

218
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Channel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.

219
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Anchor: For anyone who suffers from migraine headaches --

220
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight: a possible answer.

221
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine

222
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that literally zaps your migraines away.

223
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Christina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was --

224
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.

225
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Stacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying

226
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:34,000
if it could stop a migraine.

227
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,

228
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:45,000
but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,

229
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
say it is scientifically sound --

230
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,

231
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:54,000
it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.

232
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.

233
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,

234
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:06,000
rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.

235
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:08,000
SS: But is it safe to use everyday?

236
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,

237
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.

238
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
CS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.

239
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:24,000
SS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.

240
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Robert Fischell: And that is the invention to treat migraines.

241
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Applause)

242
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:33,000
You see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,

243
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.

244
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,

245
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
which has something to do with this.

246
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,

247
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:51,000
is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.

248
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:56,000
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,

249
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:,000
and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,

250
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:04,000
not only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.

251
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.

252
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.

253
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
(Applause)

254
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The third and last invention began with an idea.

255
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.

256
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Now, why do we use -- add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?

257
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,

258
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:38,000
have to get into all these technical words.

259
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Well, "responsive electrical stimulation" means

260
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus,"

261
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:53,000
which is where the epileptic seizure begins --

262
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we sense there, that it's going to happen,

263
0:16:56,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,

264
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
which erases the errant signal

265
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:09,000
so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.

266
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:14,000
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.

267
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
We thought we could adapt it for the brain.

268
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
The device could be implanted under the scalp

269
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:22,000
to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,

270
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:26,000
which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.

271
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,

272
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:35,000
as well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain

273
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:39,000
are a result of some electrical malfunction in it,

274
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:44,000
that causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.

275
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:48,000
We formed a company called NeuroPace

276
0:17:48,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and we started work on responsive neurostimulation,

277
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and this is a picture of what the device looked like,

278
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:57,000
that's placed into the cranial bone.

279
0:17:57,000 --> 0:17:59,000
This is probably a better picture.

280
0:17:59,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Here we have our device in which we put in a frame.

281
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:1,000
There's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;

282
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:12,000
he marks it around, and uses a dental burr

283
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:17,000
to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.

284
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.

285
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:24,000
And then with four screws, we put in a frame,

286
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:27,000
then we snap in the device and we run with wires --

287
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:32,000
the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,

288
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:35,000
to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,

289
0:18:35,000 --> 0:18:38,000
where we can sense the electrical signal

290
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current

291
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:46,000
to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.

292
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:49,000
In the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.

293
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:54,000
If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.

294
0:18:54,000 --> 0:18:57,000
The comprehensive solution: this is the device;

295
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:,000
it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,

296
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:04,000
just the thickness of most cranial bones.

297
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:07,000
The advantages of responsive neurostimulation:

298
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:11,000
It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,

299
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:14,000
provide stimulation only when needed,

300
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:19,000
can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects --

301
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:22,000
as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,

302
0:19:22,000 --> 0:19:27,000
we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted --

303
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:3,000
and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,

304
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:33,000
so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,

305
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.

306
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:4,000
And this shows what an electroencephalogram is,

307
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:44,000
and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.

308
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line

309
0:19:48,000 --> 0:19:52,000
and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,

310
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:55,000
which means they did not get the epileptic seizure.

311
0:19:55,000 --> 0:20:,000
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy,

312
0:20:,000 --> 0:20:04,000
which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.

313
0:20:04,000 --> 0:20:08,000
(Applause)

314
0:20:08,000 --> 0:20:13,000
I have three wishes. Well, I can't do much about Africa.

315
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:16,000
I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,

316
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:2,000
which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.

317
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:25,000
The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,

318
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:3,000
called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym --

319
0:20:3,000 --> 0:20:32,000
for the treatment of other brain disorders.

320
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:37,000
Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?

321
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Then you saw what that device looked like,

322
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:42,000
that the woman was using to fix her migraines?

323
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:47,000
I tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,

324
0:20:47,000 --> 0:20:49,000
not a real designer of good equipment.

325
0:20:49,000 --> 0:20:51,000
(Laughter)

326
0:20:51,000 --> 0:20:54,000
We want to have some people, who really know how to do this,

327
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:58,000
perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design

328
0:20:58,000 --> 0:21:01,000
for the portable device for treating migraine headaches.

329
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:06,000
And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.

330
0:21:06,000 --> 0:21:09,000
Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees

331
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:13,000
to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,

332
0:21:13,000 --> 0:21:16,000
where we have problems that Africa doesn't have.

333
0:21:16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
And by reducing malpractice litigation --

334
0:21:19,000 --> 0:21:23,000
malpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.

335
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:26,000
(Applause)

336
0:21:26,000 --> 0:21:29,000
So, to get quickly to my first wish --

337
0:21:29,000 --> 0:21:32,000
the brain operates by electrical signals.

338
0:21:32,000 --> 0:21:35,000
If the electrical signals create a brain disorder,

339
0:21:35,000 --> 0:21:39,000
electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.

340
0:21:39,000 --> 0:21:43,000
In other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,

341
0:21:43,000 --> 0:21:47,000
maybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,

342
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:5,000
we can counteract that.

343
0:21:5,000 --> 0:21:53,000
A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction

344
0:21:53,000 --> 0:21:56,000
might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation

345
0:21:56,000 --> 0:21:58,000
like we're doing with epilepsy.

346
0:21:58,000 --> 0:22:,000
But even if there is no signal,

347
0:22:,000 --> 0:22:05,000
electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.

348
0:22:05,000 --> 0:22:09,000
And consider treating psychotic disorders --

349
0:22:09,000 --> 0:22:12,000
and I want this involved with the TED group --

350
0:22:12,000 --> 0:22:14,000
such as obsessive-compulsive disorder

351
0:22:14,000 --> 0:22:2,000
that, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.

352
0:22:2,000 --> 0:22:24,000
And Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe

353
0:22:24,000 --> 0:22:3,000
that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.

354
0:22:3,000 --> 0:22:33,000
That is the first wish.

355
0:22:33,000 --> 0:22:38,000
(Applause)

356
0:22:38,000 --> 0:22:41,000
The second wish is, at the present time,

357
0:22:41,000 --> 0:22:46,000
the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators --

358
0:22:46,000 --> 0:22:5,000
that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches --

359
0:22:5,000 --> 0:22:52,000
appears to be quite successful.

360
0:22:52,000 --> 0:22:54,000
Well, that's the good news.

361
0:22:54,000 --> 0:22:56,000
The present portable device is far from optimally designed,

362
0:22:56,000 --> 0:22:59,000
both as to human factors as appearance.

363
0:22:59,000 --> 0:23:03,000
I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.

364
0:23:03,000 --> 0:23:05,000
(Laughter)

365
0:23:05,000 --> 0:23:07,000
Engage a company having prior successes

366
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:1,000
for human factors engineering and industrial design

367
0:23:1,000 --> 0:23:15,000
to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device

368
0:23:15,000 --> 0:23:18,000
that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches.

369
0:23:18,000 --> 0:23:2,000
And that is the second wish.

370
0:23:2,000 --> 0:23:25,000
(Applause)

371
0:23:25,000 --> 0:23:29,000
And, of the 100,000-dollar prize money, that TED was so generous to give me,

372
0:23:29,000 --> 0:23:33,000
I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people

373
0:23:33,000 --> 0:23:38,000
to get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,

374
0:23:38,000 --> 0:23:42,000
and I'm making another 50,000 available for a company

375
0:23:42,000 --> 0:23:45,000
to optimize the design of the device for migraines.

376
0:23:45,000 --> 0:23:49,000
And that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money.

377
0:23:49,000 --> 0:23:55,000
(Applause)

378
0:23:55,000 --> 0:23:57,000
Well, the third and final wish is somewhat --

379
0:23:57,000 --> 0:24:02,000
unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.

380
0:24:02,000 --> 0:24:04,000
(Laughter)

381
0:24:04,000 --> 0:24:06,000
Well, medical malpractice litigation in the US

382
0:24:06,000 --> 0:24:08,000
has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance,

383
0:24:08,000 --> 0:24:11,000
so that competent physicians are leaving their practice.

384
0:24:11,000 --> 0:24:15,000
Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share

385
0:24:15,000 --> 0:24:2,000
of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.

386
0:24:2,000 --> 0:24:25,000
The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.

387
0:24:25,000 --> 0:24:3,000
I've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Today

388
0:24:3,000 --> 0:24:33,000
showing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor.

389
0:24:33,000 --> 0:24:37,000
Well, how can the TED community help with this situation?

390
0:24:37,000 --> 0:24:4,000
I have a couple of ideas to begin with.

391
0:24:4,000 --> 0:24:44,000
As a starting point for discussion with the TED group,

392
0:24:44,000 --> 0:24:47,000
a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent

393
0:24:47,000 --> 0:24:51,000
of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.

394
0:24:51,000 --> 0:24:54,000
For example, I asked the epilepsy people

395
0:24:54,000 --> 0:24:56,000
what are they using for informed consent.

396
0:24:56,000 --> 0:25:,000
Would you believe, 12 pages, single space,

397
0:25:,000 --> 0:25:05,000
the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy?

398
0:25:05,000 --> 0:25:09,000
What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?

399
0:25:09,000 --> 0:25:11,000
They don't understand what the hell it's about.

400
0:25:11,000 --> 0:25:13,000
(Laughter)

401
0:25:13,000 --> 0:25:16,000
That's the present system. How about making a video?

402
0:25:16,000 --> 0:25:18,000
We have entertainment people here;

403
0:25:18,000 --> 0:25:2,000
we have people who know how to do videos,

404
0:25:2,000 --> 0:25:24,000
with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.

405
0:25:24,000 --> 0:25:29,000
Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing

406
0:25:29,000 --> 0:25:33,000
that can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video

407
0:25:33,000 --> 0:25:38,000
and they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.

408
0:25:38,000 --> 0:25:4,000
Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation.

409
0:25:4,000 --> 0:25:43,000
Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.

410
0:25:43,000 --> 0:25:46,000
Well, press the button and you're on record, you understand.

411
0:25:46,000 --> 0:25:49,000
And that is one of the ideas.

412
0:25:49,000 --> 0:25:52,000
Now, also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter,

413
0:25:52,000 --> 0:25:57,000
with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,

414
0:25:57,000 --> 0:26:,000
including all the possible failure modes.

415
0:26:,000 --> 0:26:02,000
The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit

416
0:26:02,000 --> 0:26:05,000
if one of the known procedure failures occurs.

417
0:26:05,000 --> 0:26:11,000
Now, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.

418
0:26:11,000 --> 0:26:15,000
However, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,

419
0:26:15,000 --> 0:26:17,000
and you have it all in the video file,

420
0:26:17,000 --> 0:26:2,000
it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer

421
0:26:2,000 --> 0:26:25,000
will take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.

422
0:26:25,000 --> 0:26:3,000
If a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement

423
0:26:3,000 --> 0:26:35,000
for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.

424
0:26:35,000 --> 0:26:4,000
That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States

425
0:26:4,000 --> 0:26:43,000
and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.

426
0:26:43,000 --> 0:26:46,000
These are just some starting points.

427
0:26:46,000 --> 0:26:5,000
And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.

428
0:26:5,000 --> 0:26:54,000
I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.

429
0:26:54,000 --> 0:26:57,000
(Applause)

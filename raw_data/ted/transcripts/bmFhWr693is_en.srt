2
0:00:12.703,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Let's face it:

3
0:00:14.617,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Driving is dangerous.

4
0:00:17.062,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's one of the things that we don't like to think about,

5
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms

6
0:00:23.812,000 --> 0:00:27,000
show up on dashboards around the world

7
0:00:28.602,000 --> 0:00:32,000
betrays the fact that we know this to be true.

8
0:00:32.739,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Car accidents are the leading cause of death

9
0:00:36.333,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States --

10
0:00:40.503,000 --> 0:00:42,000
leading cause of death --

11
0:00:43.346,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do

12
0:00:47.209,000 --> 0:00:49,000
with drugs or alcohol.

13
0:00:49.494,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So what happens?

14
0:00:51.755,000 --> 0:00:55,000
No one can say for sure, but I remember my first accident.

15
0:00:55.974,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was a young driver out on the highway,

16
0:00:59.777,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the car in front of me, I saw the brake lights go on.

17
0:01:02.035,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I'm like, "Okay, all right, this guy is slowing down,

18
0:01:03.835,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'll slow down too."

19
0:01:05.117,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I step on the brake.

20
0:01:07.043,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But no, this guy isn't slowing down.

21
0:01:09.297,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This guy is stopping, dead stop, dead stop on the highway.

22
0:01:12.475,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It was just going 65 -- to zero?

23
0:01:15.015,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I slammed on the brakes.

24
0:01:16.535,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I felt the ABS kick in, and the car is still going,

25
0:01:19.594,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and it's not going to stop, and I know it's not going to stop,

26
0:01:22.29,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and the air bag deploys, the car is totaled,

27
0:01:25.229,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and fortunately, no one was hurt.

28
0:01:28.786,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But I had no idea that car was stopping,

29
0:01:32.997,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I think we can do a lot better than that.

30
0:01:36.642,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I think we can transform the driving experience

31
0:01:40.787,000 --> 0:01:43,000
by letting our cars talk to each other.

32
0:01:44.666,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I just want you to think a little bit

33
0:01:46.09,000 --> 0:01:48,000
about what the experience of driving is like now.

34
0:01:48.978,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Get into your car. Close the door. You're in a glass bubble.

35
0:01:53.006,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You can't really directly sense the world around you.

36
0:01:55.922,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You're in this extended body.

37
0:01:58.103,000 --> 0:02:,000
You're tasked with navigating it down

38
0:02:00.266,000 --> 0:02:02,000
partially-seen roadways,

39
0:02:02.322,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in and amongst other metal giants, at super-human speeds.

40
0:02:06.746,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Okay? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes.

41
0:02:11.226,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Okay, so that's all you have,

42
0:02:12.988,000 --> 0:02:13,000
eyes that weren't really designed for this task,

43
0:02:14.723,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but then people ask you to do things like,

44
0:02:18.474,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you want to make a lane change,

45
0:02:20.023,000 --> 0:02:22,000
what's the first thing they ask you do?

46
0:02:22.344,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Take your eyes off the road. That's right.

47
0:02:25.439,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Stop looking where you're going, turn,

48
0:02:27.535,000 --> 0:02:29,000
check your blind spot,

49
0:02:29.553,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and drive down the road without looking where you're going.

50
0:02:33.024,000 --> 0:02:36,000
You and everyone else. This is the safe way to drive.

51
0:02:36.159,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Why do we do this? Because we have to,

52
0:02:38.4,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we have to make a choice, do I look here or do I look here?

53
0:02:40.979,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What's more important?

54
0:02:42.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And usually we do a fantastic job

55
0:02:45.211,000 --> 0:02:48,000
picking and choosing what we attend to on the road.

56
0:02:48.98,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But occasionally we miss something.

57
0:02:52.63,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late.

58
0:02:57.091,000 --> 0:02:58,000
In countless accidents, the driver says,

59
0:02:59.079,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"I didn't see it coming."

60
0:03:01.387,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I believe that. I believe that.

61
0:03:04.668,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We can only watch so much.

62
0:03:07.593,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But the technology exists now that can help us improve that.

63
0:03:12.737,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In the future, with cars exchanging data with each other,

64
0:03:17.033,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we will be able to see not just three cars ahead

65
0:03:20.961,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and three cars behind, to the right and left,

66
0:03:22.555,000 --> 0:03:25,000
all at the same time, bird's eye view,

67
0:03:25.721,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we will actually be able to see into those cars.

68
0:03:28.849,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us,

69
0:03:31.22,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to see how fast that guy's going or stopping.

70
0:03:34.46,000 --> 0:03:38,000
If that guy's going down to zero, I'll know.

71
0:03:38.97,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And with computation and algorithms and predictive models,

72
0:03:42.829,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we will be able to see the future.

73
0:03:46.102,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You may think that's impossible.

74
0:03:47.658,000 --> 0:03:49,000
How can you predict the future? That's really hard.

75
0:03:50.389,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Actually, no. With cars, it's not impossible.

76
0:03:54.008,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Cars are three-dimensional objects

77
0:03:56.74,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that have a fixed position and velocity.

78
0:03:59.072,000 --> 0:04:,000
They travel down roads.

79
0:04:00.703,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Often they travel on pre-published routes.

80
0:04:03.115,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's really not that hard to make reasonable predictions

81
0:04:07.053,000 --> 0:04:09,000
about where a car's going to be in the near future.

82
0:04:09.917,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Even if, when you're in your car

83
0:04:11.919,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom! --

84
0:04:13.913,000 --> 0:04:15,000
85 miles an hour down, lane-splitting --

85
0:04:16.209,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I know you've had this experience --

86
0:04:18.756,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that guy didn't "just come out of nowhere."

87
0:04:21.359,000 --> 0:04:24,000
That guy's been on the road probably for the last half hour.

88
0:04:25.002,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:26.192,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Right? I mean, somebody's seen him.

90
0:04:29.781,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Ten, 20, 30 miles back, someone's seen that guy,

91
0:04:32.549,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and as soon as one car sees that guy

92
0:04:34.933,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and puts him on the map, he's on the map --

93
0:04:37.164,000 --> 0:04:39,000
position, velocity,

94
0:04:39.34,000 --> 0:04:41,000
good estimate he'll continue going 85 miles an hour.

95
0:04:41.661,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You'll know, because your car will know, because

96
0:04:43.845,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that other car will have whispered something in his ear,

97
0:04:46.12,000 --> 0:04:47,000
like, "By the way, five minutes,

98
0:04:48.043,000 --> 0:04:5,000
motorcyclist, watch out."

99
0:04:50.818,000 --> 0:04:52,000
You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave.

100
0:04:53.521,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I mean, they're Newtonian objects.

101
0:04:54.886,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That's very nice about them.

102
0:04:57.795,000 --> 0:05:,000
So how do we get there?

103
0:05:00.829,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We can start with something as simple

104
0:05:03.095,000 --> 0:05:05,000
as sharing our position data between cars,

105
0:05:05.965,000 --> 0:05:06,000
just sharing GPS.

106
0:05:07.857,000 --> 0:05:09,000
If I have a GPS and a camera in my car,

107
0:05:10.301,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I have a pretty precise idea of where I am

108
0:05:12.532,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and how fast I'm going.

109
0:05:14.264,000 --> 0:05:15,000
With computer vision, I can estimate where

110
0:05:15.921,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the cars around me are, sort of, and where they're going.

111
0:05:19.458,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And same with the other cars.

112
0:05:20.428,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They can have a precise idea of where they are,

113
0:05:22.242,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are.

114
0:05:24.388,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What happens if two cars share that data,

115
0:05:27.619,000 --> 0:05:28,000
if they talk to each other?

116
0:05:29.574,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I can tell you exactly what happens.

117
0:05:32.352,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Both models improve.

118
0:05:34.691,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Everybody wins.

119
0:05:36.746,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Professor Bob Wang and his team

120
0:05:39.323,000 --> 0:05:41,000
have done computer simulations of what happens

121
0:05:42.061,000 --> 0:05:45,000
when fuzzy estimates combine, even in light traffic,

122
0:05:45.492,000 --> 0:05:47,000
when cars just share GPS data,

123
0:05:48.116,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we've moved this research out of the computer simulation

124
0:05:50.629,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors

125
0:05:53.656,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that are in cars now on these robots:

126
0:05:56.789,000 --> 0:05:57,000
stereo cameras, GPS,

127
0:05:58.627,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and the two-dimensional laser range finders

128
0:06:00.501,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that are common in backup systems.

129
0:06:02.741,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We also attach a discrete short-range communication radio,

130
0:06:07.225,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and the robots talk to each other.

131
0:06:09.134,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When these robots come at each other,

132
0:06:10.673,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they track each other's position precisely,

133
0:06:13.644,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they can avoid each other.

134
0:06:16.381,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We're now adding more and more robots into the mix,

135
0:06:19.607,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and we encountered some problems.

136
0:06:21.078,000 --> 0:06:23,000
One of the problems, when you get too much chatter,

137
0:06:23.437,000 --> 0:06:26,000
it's hard to process all the packets, so you have to prioritize,

138
0:06:27.165,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and that's where the predictive model helps you.

139
0:06:29.522,000 --> 0:06:33,000
If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories,

140
0:06:33.894,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you don't pay as much attention to those packets.

141
0:06:35.661,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You prioritize the one guy

142
0:06:37.364,000 --> 0:06:38,000
who seems to be going a little off course.

143
0:06:38.697,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That guy could be a problem.

144
0:06:41.223,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And you can predict the new trajectory.

145
0:06:44.225,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So you don't only know that he's going off course, you know how.

146
0:06:46.988,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way.

147
0:06:50.713,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone?

148
0:06:53.346,000 --> 0:06:56,000
How can these cars whisper, "You need to get out of the way?"

149
0:06:56.529,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Well, it depends on two things:

150
0:06:58.046,000 --> 0:07:,000
one, the ability of the car,

151
0:07:00.215,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and second the ability of the driver.

152
0:07:03.432,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If one guy has a really great car,

153
0:07:04.937,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but they're on their phone or, you know, doing something,

154
0:07:07.862,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they're not probably in the best position

155
0:07:09.792,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to react in an emergency.

156
0:07:12.762,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So we started a separate line of research

157
0:07:14.427,000 --> 0:07:16,000
doing driver state modeling.

158
0:07:16.978,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And now, using a series of three cameras,

159
0:07:19.307,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we can detect if a driver is looking forward,

160
0:07:21.577,000 --> 0:07:23,000
looking away, looking down, on the phone,

161
0:07:24.437,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or having a cup of coffee.

162
0:07:27.498,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We can predict the accident

163
0:07:29.568,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and we can predict who, which cars,

164
0:07:33.219,000 --> 0:07:36,000
are in the best position to move out of the way

165
0:07:36.705,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to calculate the safest route for everyone.

166
0:07:39.714,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Fundamentally, these technologies exist today.

167
0:07:44.349,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I think the biggest problem that we face

168
0:07:47.173,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is our own willingness to share our data.

169
0:07:50.186,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I think it's a very disconcerting notion,

170
0:07:52.817,000 --> 0:07:54,000
this idea that our cars will be watching us,

171
0:07:55.203,000 --> 0:07:58,000
talking about us to other cars,

172
0:07:58.574,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that we'll be going down the road in a sea of gossip.

173
0:08:02.001,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy,

174
0:08:05.898,000 --> 0:08:08,000
just like right now, when I look at your car from the outside,

175
0:08:09.639,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I don't really know about you.

176
0:08:12.002,000 --> 0:08:13,000
If I look at your license plate number,

177
0:08:13.139,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I don't really know who you are.

178
0:08:15.025,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs.

179
0:08:19.274,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:22.249,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And I think it's going to be a great thing.

181
0:08:25.434,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I want you to consider for a moment

182
0:08:27.084,000 --> 0:08:31,000
if you really don't want the distracted teenager behind you

183
0:08:31.202,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to know that you're braking,

184
0:08:33.322,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that you're coming to a dead stop.

185
0:08:36.246,000 --> 0:08:38,000
By sharing our data willingly,

186
0:08:38.987,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we can do what's best for everyone.

187
0:08:41.799,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So let your car gossip about you.

188
0:08:44.875,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's going to make the roads a lot safer.

189
0:08:47.913,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Thank you.

190
0:08:49.704,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.682,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was raised by lesbians in the mountains,

2
0:00:14.794,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I sort of came like a forest gnome to New York City a while back.

3
0:00:18.392,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:19.55,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Really messed with my head, but I'll get into that later.

5
0:00:24.969,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'll start with when I was eight years old.

6
0:00:27.739,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I took a wood box,

7
0:00:29.679,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I buried a dollar bill, a pen and a fork inside this box in Colorado.

8
0:00:35.131,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I thought some strange humanoids or aliens in 500 years would find this box

9
0:00:40.739,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and learn about the way our species exchanged ideas,

10
0:00:45.289,000 --> 0:00:47,000
maybe how we ate our spaghetti.

11
0:00:47.347,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I really didn't know.

12
0:00:49.401,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Anyway, this is kind of funny,

13
0:00:50.862,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.

14
0:00:56.289,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, at some point I was in Hawaii --

15
0:00:59.296,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I like to hike and surf and do all that weird stuff,

16
0:01:01.822,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and I was making a collage for my ma.

17
0:01:04.35,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I took a dictionary and I ripped it up,

18
0:01:06.462,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and I made it into a sort of Agnes Martin grid,

19
0:01:09.221,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I poured resin all over it and a bee got stuck.

20
0:01:11.816,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, she's afraid of bees and she's allergic to them,

21
0:01:14.558,000 --> 0:01:18,000
so I poured more resin on the canvas, thinking I could hide it or something.

22
0:01:18.817,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Instead, the opposite happened:

23
0:01:20.381,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It sort of created a magnification,

24
0:01:22.087,000 --> 0:01:24,000
like a magnifying glass, on the dictionary text.

25
0:01:25.278,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So what did I do? I built more boxes.

26
0:01:27.958,000 --> 0:01:3,000
This time, I started putting electronics, frogs,

27
0:01:31.886,000 --> 0:01:34,000
strange bottles I'd find in the street -- anything I could find --

28
0:01:35.457,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because I was always finding things my whole life,

29
0:01:37.83,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects.

30
0:01:41.896,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So I started drawing around the objects,

31
0:01:44.301,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and I realized: Holy moly, I can draw in space!

32
0:01:47.637,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I can make free-floating lines,

33
0:01:49.66,000 --> 0:01:52,000
like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene.

34
0:01:52.707,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I took the objects out,

35
0:01:54.007,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I created my own taxonomy of invented specimens.

36
0:01:57.46,000 --> 0:02:,000
First, botanical -- which you can kind of get a sense of.

37
0:02:01.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Then I made some weird insects and creatures.

38
0:02:05.992,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It was really fun; I was just drawing on the layers of resin.

39
0:02:08.89,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it was cool, because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff,

40
0:02:12.372,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I was making some money, I could take my girlfriend for dinner,

41
0:02:15.368,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and like, go to Sizzler.

42
0:02:16.647,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It was some good shit, man.

43
0:02:18.076,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:19.728,000 --> 0:02:22,000
At some point, I got up to the human form,

45
0:02:23.658,000 --> 0:02:27,000
life-size resin sculptures with drawings of humans inside the layers.

46
0:02:28.309,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This was great, except for one thing:

47
0:02:30.792,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I was going to die.

48
0:02:32.536,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.

49
0:02:35.623,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.

50
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So I tried using glass.

51
0:02:40.476,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I started drawing on the layers of glass,

52
0:02:42.489,000 --> 0:02:45,000
almost like if you drew on a window, then you put another window,

53
0:02:45.585,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and another window, and you had all these windows together

54
0:02:48.352,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that made a three-dimensional composition.

55
0:02:50.511,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And this really worked, because I could stop using the resin.

56
0:02:53.937,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So I did this for years,

57
0:02:55.342,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which culminated in a very large work, which I call "The Triptych."

58
0:03:00.127,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"The Triptych" was largely inspired

59
0:03:02.072,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by Hieronymus Bosch's "[The] Garden of Earthly Delights,"

60
0:03:05.033,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which is a painting in the [Museo del] Prado in Spain.

61
0:03:07.681,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Do you guys know this painting?

62
0:03:09.404,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Good, it's a cool painting.

63
0:03:10.721,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's kind of ahead of its time, they say.

64
0:03:12.719,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So, "The Triptych." I'll walk you through this piece.

65
0:03:15.234,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It weighs 24,000 pounds.

66
0:03:18.905,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's 18 feet long.

67
0:03:20.906,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's double-sided, so it's 36 feet of composition.

68
0:03:23.681,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's kind of weird.

69
0:03:26.648,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Well, that's the blood fountain.

70
0:03:29.084,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:31.321,000 --> 0:03:33,000
To the left, you have Jesus and the locusts.

72
0:03:34.472,000 --> 0:03:35,000
There's a cave

73
0:03:35.703,000 --> 0:03:38,000
where all these animal-headed creatures travel between two worlds.

74
0:03:38.974,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They go from the representational world,

75
0:03:40.92,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to this analog-mesh underworld, where they're hiding.

76
0:03:43.828,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is where the animal-headed creatures are by the lighthouse,

77
0:03:46.915,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and they're all about to commit mass suicide into the ocean.

78
0:03:49.778,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The ocean is made up of thousands of elements.

79
0:03:52.77,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is a bird god tied up to a battleship.

80
0:03:55.093,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:56.155,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Billy Graham is in the ocean;

82
0:03:57.783,000 --> 0:04:01,000
the Horizon from the oil spill; Waldo; Osama Bin Laden's shelter --

83
0:04:02.034,000 --> 0:04:04,000
there's all kinds of weird stuff that you can find

84
0:04:04.401,000 --> 0:04:05,000
if you look really hard, in the ocean.

85
0:04:06.741,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Anyway, this is a lady creature.

86
0:04:09.184,000 --> 0:04:12,000
She's coming out of the ocean, and she's spitting oil into one hand

87
0:04:12.658,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and she has clouds coming out of her other hand.

88
0:04:15.199,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Her hands are like scales,

89
0:04:16.83,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and she has the mythological reference of the Earth and cosmos in balance.

90
0:04:22.07,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So that's one side of "The Triptych."

91
0:04:23.905,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's a little narrative thing.

92
0:04:25.389,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That's her hand that she's spitting into.

93
0:04:28.19,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And then, when you go to the other side,

94
0:04:30.13,000 --> 0:04:32,000
she has like a trunk, like a bird's beak,

95
0:04:32.263,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and she's spitting clouds out of her trunk.

96
0:04:34.662,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Then she has an 18-foot-long serpent's tail that connects "The Triptych."

97
0:04:38.746,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Anyway, her tail catches on fire from the back of the volcano.

98
0:04:41.759,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:42.86,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I don't know why that happened.

100
0:04:44.572,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:46.154,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That happens, you know.

102
0:04:48.473,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Her tail terminates in a cycloptic eyeball,

103
0:04:51.969,000 --> 0:04:53,000
made out of 1986 terrorist cards.

104
0:04:54.524,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Have you guys seen those?

105
0:04:55.753,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They were made in the 1980's, they're like baseball cards of terrorists.

106
0:04:59.175,000 --> 0:05:,000
Way ahead of their time.

107
0:05:00.358,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:02.715,000 --> 0:05:03,000
That will bring you to my latest project.

109
0:05:04.736,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I'm in the middle of two projects:

110
0:05:06.413,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One's called "Psychogeographies."

111
0:05:08.057,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's about a six-year project to make 100 of these humans.

112
0:05:11.161,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Each one is an archive of our culture,

113
0:05:13.555,000 --> 0:05:14,000
through our ripped-up media and matter,

114
0:05:15.578,000 --> 0:05:18,000
whether it's encyclopedias or dictionaries or magazines.

115
0:05:18.886,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But each one acts as a sort of an archive in the shape of a human,

116
0:05:22.083,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and they travel in groups of 20, 4, or 12 at a time.

117
0:05:25.516,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They're like cells -- they come together, they divide.

118
0:05:28.826,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And you kind of walk through them. It's taking me years.

119
0:05:31.486,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Each one is basically a 3,000-pound microscope slide

120
0:05:35.495,000 --> 0:05:36,000
with a human stuck inside.

121
0:05:38.208,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This one has a little cave in his chest.

122
0:05:40.679,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That's his head; there's the chest, you can kind of see the beginning.

123
0:05:43.998,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I'm going to go down the body for you:

124
0:05:46.053,000 --> 0:05:5,000
There's a waterfall coming out of his chest,

125
0:05:50.115,000 --> 0:05:52,000
covering his penis -- or not-penis, or whatever it is,

126
0:05:52.743,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a kind of androgynous thing.

127
0:05:54.655,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I'll take you quickly through these works,

128
0:05:57.568,000 --> 0:05:59,000
because I can't explain them for too long.

129
0:06:00.449,000 --> 0:06:02,000
There are the layers, you can kind of see it.

130
0:06:03.812,000 --> 0:06:05,000
That's a body getting split in half.

131
0:06:06.351,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This one has two heads,

132
0:06:07.622,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and it's communicating between the two heads.

133
0:06:10.319,000 --> 0:06:11,000
You can see the pills coming out,

134
0:06:12.119,000 --> 0:06:14,000
going into one head from this weird statue.

135
0:06:14.484,000 --> 0:06:16,000
There's a little forest scene inside the chest cavity.

136
0:06:17.339,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Can you see that?

137
0:06:18.521,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Anyway, this talk's all about these boxes,

138
0:06:20.632,000 --> 0:06:21,000
like the boxes we're in.

139
0:06:22.904,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This box we're in, the solar system is a box.

140
0:06:25.815,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This brings you to my latest box.

141
0:06:28.382,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It's a brick box. It's called Pioneer Works.

142
0:06:30.857,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Cheers)

143
0:06:32.194,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Inside of this box is a physicist,

144
0:06:36.73,000 --> 0:06:39,000
a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician,

145
0:06:39.88,000 --> 0:06:44,000
a writer, a radio station, a museum, a school,

146
0:06:45.231,000 --> 0:06:5,000
a publishing arm to disseminate all the content we make there into the world;

147
0:06:50.412,000 --> 0:06:51,000
a garden.

148
0:06:52.132,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We shake this box up,

149
0:06:53.553,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and all these people kind of start hitting each other like particles.

150
0:06:56.828,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And I think that's the way you change the world.

151
0:06:59.151,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You redefine your insides and the box that you're living in.

152
0:07:03.057,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And you come together to realize that we're all in this together,

153
0:07:06.645,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that this delusion of difference --

154
0:07:08.415,000 --> 0:07:13,000
this idea of countries, of borders, of religion -- doesn't work.

155
0:07:13.931,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We're all really made up of the same stuff, in the same box.

156
0:07:18.584,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And if we don't start exchanging that stuff sweetly and nicely,

157
0:07:22.632,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we're all going to die real soon.

158
0:07:25.299,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Thank you very much.

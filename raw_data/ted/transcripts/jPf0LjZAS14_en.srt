1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a journalist,

2
0:00:14.115,000 --> 0:00:16,000
so I like to look for the untold stories,

3
0:00:16.69,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the lives that quietly play out under the scream of headlines.

4
0:00:20.977,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've also been going about the business of putting down roots,

5
0:00:24.458,000 --> 0:00:26,000
choosing a partner, making babies.

6
0:00:27.206,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So for the last few years,

7
0:00:29.461,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I've been trying to understand

8
0:00:30.948,000 --> 0:00:33,000
what constitutes the 21st-century good life,

9
0:00:35.085,000 --> 0:00:39,000
both because I'm fascinated by the moral and philosophical implications,

10
0:00:39.719,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but also because I'm in desperate need of answers myself.

11
0:00:43.641,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We live in tenuous times.

12
0:00:46.402,000 --> 0:00:49,000
In fact, for the first time in American history,

13
0:00:49.611,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the majority of parents do not think that their kids will be better off

14
0:00:53.755,000 --> 0:00:54,000
than they were.

15
0:00:55.211,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is true of rich and poor, men and women.

16
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now, some of you might hear this and feel sad.

17
0:01:01.589,000 --> 0:01:03,000
After all, America is deeply invested

18
0:01:04.605,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in this idea of economic transcendence,

19
0:01:07.508,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that every generation kind of leapfrogs the one before it,

20
0:01:11.092,000 --> 0:01:14,000
earning more, buying more, being more.

21
0:01:15.299,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We've exported this dream all over the world,

22
0:01:17.481,000 --> 0:01:19,000
so kids in Brazil and China and even Kenya

23
0:01:20.414,000 --> 0:01:22,000
inherit our insatiable expectation

24
0:01:23.195,000 --> 0:01:24,000
for more.

25
0:01:25.063,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But when I read this historic poll for the first time,

26
0:01:28.144,000 --> 0:01:29,000
it didn't actually make me feel sad.

27
0:01:30.593,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It felt like a provocation.

28
0:01:33.181,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Better off" -- based on whose standards?

29
0:01:37.03,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Is "better off" finding a secure job

30
0:01:39.137,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that you can count on for the rest of your life?

31
0:01:42.027,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Those are nearly extinct.

32
0:01:43.788,000 --> 0:01:46,000
People move jobs, on average, every 4.7 years,

33
0:01:47.809,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and it's estimated that by 2020,

34
0:01:49.794,000 --> 0:01:51,000
nearly half of Americans will be freelancers.

35
0:01:53.523,000 --> 0:01:55,000
OK, so is better off just a number?

36
0:01:56.498,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Is it about earning as much as you possibly can?

37
0:02:00.06,000 --> 0:02:03,000
By that singular measurement, we are failing.

38
0:02:03.316,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Median per capita income has been flat since about 2000,

39
0:02:07.537,000 --> 0:02:08,000
adjusted for inflation.

40
0:02:10.005,000 --> 0:02:14,000
All right, so is better off getting a big house with a white picket fence?

41
0:02:14.71,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Less of us are doing that.

42
0:02:16.718,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Nearly five million people lost their homes in the Great Recession,

43
0:02:20.398,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and even more of us sobered up about the lengths we were willing to go --

44
0:02:24.796,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or be tricked into going, in many predatory cases --

45
0:02:27.567,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to hold that deed.

46
0:02:29.575,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Home-ownership rates are at their lowest since 1995.

47
0:02:34.117,000 --> 0:02:37,000
All right, so we're not finding steady employment,

48
0:02:37.489,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we're not earning as much money,

49
0:02:39.246,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we're not living in big fancy houses.

50
0:02:42.372,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Toll the funeral bells

51
0:02:44.111,000 --> 0:02:46,000
for everything that made America great.

52
0:02:48.147,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But,

53
0:02:49.767,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are those the best measurements of a country's greatness,

54
0:02:53.697,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of a life well lived?

55
0:02:55.87,000 --> 0:02:58,000
What I think makes America great is its spirit of reinvention.

56
0:03:00.034,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In the wake of the Great Recession,

57
0:03:01.776,000 --> 0:03:05,000
more and more Americans are redefining what "better off" really means.

58
0:03:06.412,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Turns out, it has more to do with community and creativity

59
0:03:10.422,000 --> 0:03:11,000
than dollars and cents.

60
0:03:12.917,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now, let me be very clear:

61
0:03:15.48,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the 14.8 percent of Americans living in poverty need money,

62
0:03:20.697,000 --> 0:03:21,000
plain and simple.

63
0:03:22.101,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And all of us need policies that protect us from exploitation

64
0:03:25.786,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by employers and financial institutions.

65
0:03:29.011,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Nothing that follows is meant to suggest that the gap between rich and poor

66
0:03:33.686,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is anything but profoundly immoral.

67
0:03:38.224,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But,

68
0:03:39.553,000 --> 0:03:41,000
too often we let the conversation stop there.

69
0:03:42.804,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We talk about poverty as if it were a monolithic experience;

70
0:03:46.553,000 --> 0:03:48,000
about the poor as if they were solely victims.

71
0:03:50.126,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Part of what I've learned in my research and reporting

72
0:03:53.007,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is that the art of living well

73
0:03:55.437,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is often practiced most masterfully

74
0:03:58.449,000 --> 0:04:,000
by the most vulnerable.

75
0:04:02.253,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, if necessity is the mother of invention,

76
0:04:04.769,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I've come to believe

77
0:04:06.491,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that recession can be the father of consciousness.

78
0:04:10.879,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It confronts us with profound questions,

79
0:04:13.741,000 --> 0:04:16,000
questions we might be too lazy or distracted to ask

80
0:04:16.908,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in times of relative comfort.

81
0:04:19.047,000 --> 0:04:2,000
How should we work?

82
0:04:20.634,000 --> 0:04:21,000
How should we live?

83
0:04:22.766,000 --> 0:04:24,000
All of us, whether we realize it or not,

84
0:04:25.029,000 --> 0:04:26,000
seek answers to these questions,

85
0:04:26.625,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with our ancestors kind of whispering in our ears.

86
0:04:31.02,000 --> 0:04:35,000
My great-grandfather was a drunk in Detroit,

87
0:04:35.167,000 --> 0:04:37,000
who sometimes managed to hold down a factory job.

88
0:04:38.611,000 --> 0:04:4,000
He had, as unbelievable as it might sound,

89
0:04:41.551,000 --> 0:04:42,000
21 children,

90
0:04:43.446,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with one woman, my great-grandmother,

91
0:04:45.852,000 --> 0:04:48,000
who died at 47 years old of ovarian cancer.

92
0:04:49.945,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now, I'm pregnant with my second child,

93
0:04:51.904,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I cannot even fathom what she must have gone through.

94
0:04:56.502,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And if you're trying to do the math -- there were six sets of twins.

95
0:05:00.81,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So my grandfather, their son,

96
0:05:03.572,000 --> 0:05:04,000
became a traveling salesman,

97
0:05:05.295,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and he lived boom and bust.

98
0:05:06.814,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So my dad grew up answering the door for debt collectors

99
0:05:10.524,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and pretending his parents weren't home.

100
0:05:12.979,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He actually took his braces off himself with pliers in the garage,

101
0:05:17.183,000 --> 0:05:19,000
when his father admitted he didn't have money

102
0:05:19.366,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to go back to the orthodontist.

103
0:05:21.778,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So my dad, unsurprisingly,

104
0:05:24.573,000 --> 0:05:26,000
became a bankruptcy lawyer.

105
0:05:26.665,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Couldn't write this in a novel, right?

106
0:05:29.236,000 --> 0:05:32,000
He was obsessed with providing a secure foundation

107
0:05:32.541,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for my brother and I.

108
0:05:34.521,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So I ask these questions by way of a few generations of struggle.

109
0:05:38.895,000 --> 0:05:41,000
My parents made sure that I grew up on a kind of steady ground

110
0:05:41.976,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that allows one to question and risk and leap.

111
0:05:45.909,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And ironically, and probably sometimes to their frustration,

112
0:05:49.247,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it is their steadfast commitment to security

113
0:05:52.555,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that allows me to question its value,

114
0:05:55.044,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or at least its value as we've historically defined it

115
0:05:58.046,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in the 21st century.

116
0:06:00.87,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So let's dig into this first question:

117
0:06:03.267,000 --> 0:06:04,000
How should we work?

118
0:06:06.397,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We should work like our mothers.

119
0:06:09.754,000 --> 0:06:11,000
That's right -- we've spent decades

120
0:06:11.917,000 --> 0:06:15,000
trying to fit women into a work world built for company men.

121
0:06:16.358,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And many have done backbends to fit in,

122
0:06:18.272,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but others have carved a more unconventional path,

123
0:06:21.652,000 --> 0:06:23,000
creating a patchwork of meaning and money

124
0:06:23.875,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with enough flexibility to do what they need to do

125
0:06:26.62,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for those that they love.

126
0:06:28.993,000 --> 0:06:3,000
My mom called it "just making it work."

127
0:06:31.574,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Today I hear life coaches call it "a portfolio career."

128
0:06:35.956,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Whatever you call it,

129
0:06:37.639,000 --> 0:06:42,000
more and more men are craving these whole, if not harried, lives.

130
0:06:43.332,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They're waking up to their desire and duty to be present fathers and sons.

131
0:06:48.547,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Now, artist Ann Hamilton has said,

132
0:06:51.008,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"Labor is a way of knowing."

133
0:06:54.458,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Labor is a way of knowing.

134
0:06:55.77,000 --> 0:06:57,000
In other words, what we work on

135
0:06:57.802,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is what we understand about the world.

136
0:07:01.043,000 --> 0:07:03,000
If this is true, and I think it is,

137
0:07:03.266,000 --> 0:07:06,000
then women who have disproportionately cared for the little ones

138
0:07:06.862,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and the sick ones and the aging ones,

139
0:07:08.863,000 --> 0:07:1,000
have disproportionately benefited

140
0:07:11.819,000 --> 0:07:14,000
from the most profound kind of knowing there is:

141
0:07:15.373,000 --> 0:07:17,000
knowing the human condition.

142
0:07:18.442,000 --> 0:07:2,000
By prioritizing care,

143
0:07:20.618,000 --> 0:07:22,000
men are, in a sense, staking their claim

144
0:07:23.218,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to the full range of human existence.

145
0:07:27.097,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Now, this means the nine-to-five no longer works for anyone.

146
0:07:30.685,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Punch clocks are becoming obsolete, as are career ladders.

147
0:07:33.535,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Whole industries are being born and dying every day.

148
0:07:36.627,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's all nonlinear from here.

149
0:07:39.09,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So we need to stop asking kids,

150
0:07:41.126,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

151
0:07:43.206,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and start asking them, "How do you want to be when you grow up?"

152
0:07:47.247,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Their work will constantly change.

153
0:07:49.17,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The common denominator is them.

154
0:07:51.504,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So the more they understand their gifts

155
0:07:53.469,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and create crews of ideal collaborators,

156
0:07:55.948,000 --> 0:07:56,000
the better off they will be.

157
0:07:58.717,000 --> 0:08:,000
The challenge ahead is to reinvent the social safety net

158
0:08:01.404,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to fit this increasingly fragmented economy.

159
0:08:04.365,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We need portable health benefits.

160
0:08:06.248,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We need policies that reflect that everyone deserves to be vulnerable

161
0:08:09.881,000 --> 0:08:1,000
or care for vulnerable others,

162
0:08:11.403,000 --> 0:08:12,000
without becoming destitute.

163
0:08:13.035,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We need to seriously consider a universal basic income.

164
0:08:15.707,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We need to reinvent labor organizing.

165
0:08:18.682,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The promise of a work world that is structured to actually fit

166
0:08:22.572,000 --> 0:08:23,000
our 21st century values,

167
0:08:24.496,000 --> 0:08:26,000
not some archaic idea about bringing home the bacon,

168
0:08:27.457,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is long overdue --

169
0:08:29.671,000 --> 0:08:3,000
just ask your mother.

170
0:08:31.877,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, how about the second question:

171
0:08:33.603,000 --> 0:08:34,000
How should we live?

172
0:08:35.737,000 --> 0:08:36,000
We should live

173
0:08:37.507,000 --> 0:08:39,000
like our immigrant ancestors.

174
0:08:41.174,000 --> 0:08:42,000
When they came to America,

175
0:08:42.635,000 --> 0:08:46,000
they often shared apartments, survival tactics, child care --

176
0:08:46.889,000 --> 0:08:48,000
always knew how to fill one more belly,

177
0:08:48.919,000 --> 0:08:5,000
no matter how small the food available.

178
0:08:51.77,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But they were told that success meant leaving the village behind

179
0:08:55.36,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and pursuing that iconic symbol of the American Dream,

180
0:08:58.436,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the white picket fence.

181
0:09:00.46,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And even today, we see a white picket fence

182
0:09:02.508,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and we think success, self-possession.

183
0:09:04.905,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But when you strip away the sentimentality,

184
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
what it really does is divides us.

185
0:09:10.14,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Many Americans are rejecting the white picket fence

186
0:09:12.737,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and the kind of highly privatized life that happened within it,

187
0:09:16.076,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and reclaiming village life,

188
0:09:17.89,000 --> 0:09:19,000
reclaiming interdependence instead.

189
0:09:21.311,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Fifty million of us, for example,

190
0:09:22.938,000 --> 0:09:24,000
live in intergenerational households.

191
0:09:26.018,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This number exploded with the Great Recession,

192
0:09:28.77,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but it turns out people actually like living this way.

193
0:09:31.432,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Two-thirds of those who are living with multiple generations under one roof

194
0:09:35.304,000 --> 0:09:37,000
say it's improved their relationships.

195
0:09:38.145,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Some people are choosing to share homes not with family,

196
0:09:40.993,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but with other people who understand the health and economic benefits

197
0:09:44.377,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of daily community.

198
0:09:46.082,000 --> 0:09:49,000
CoAbode, an online platform for single moms looking to share homes

199
0:09:49.74,000 --> 0:09:5,000
with other single moms,

200
0:09:51.127,000 --> 0:09:52,000
has 50,000 users.

201
0:09:53.761,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And people over 65 are especially prone

202
0:09:56.422,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to be looking for these alternative living arrangements.

203
0:10:00.074,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They understand that their quality of life

204
0:10:02.597,000 --> 0:10:06,000
depends on a mix of solitude and solidarity.

205
0:10:07.727,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Which is true of all of us when you think about it,

206
0:10:10.244,000 --> 0:10:11,000
young and old alike.

207
0:10:11.632,000 --> 0:10:15,000
For too long, we've pretended that happiness is a king in his castle.

208
0:10:16.306,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But all the research proves otherwise.

209
0:10:19.006,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It shows that the healthiest, happiest and even safest --

210
0:10:22.033,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in terms of both climate change disaster, in terms of crime, all of that --

211
0:10:28.131,000 --> 0:10:31,000
are Americans who live lives intertwined with their neighbors.

212
0:10:32.661,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Now, I've experienced this firsthand.

213
0:10:35.076,000 --> 0:10:38,000
For the last few years, I've been living in a cohousing community.

214
0:10:38.292,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's 1.5 acres of persimmon trees,

215
0:10:41.925,000 --> 0:10:44,000
this prolific blackberry bush that snakes around a community garden,

216
0:10:45.701,000 --> 0:10:48,000
all smack-dab, by the way, in the middle of urban Oakland.

217
0:10:49.447,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The nine units are all built to be different,

218
0:10:51.59,000 --> 0:10:52,000
different sizes, different shapes,

219
0:10:53.263,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but they're meant to be as green as possible.

220
0:10:55.401,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So big, shiny black solar cells on our roof

221
0:10:57.568,000 --> 0:10:58,000
mean our electricity bill rarely exceeds

222
0:10:59.526,000 --> 0:11:,000
more than five bucks in a month.

223
0:11:01.787,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The 25 of us who live there are all different ages and political persuasions

224
0:11:05.622,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and professions,

225
0:11:06.804,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and we live in homes that have everything a typical home would have.

226
0:11:10.106,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But additionally,

227
0:11:11.284,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we share an industrial-sized kitchen and eating area,

228
0:11:13.824,000 --> 0:11:15,000
where we have common meals twice a week.

229
0:11:15.913,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now, people, when I tell them I live like this,

230
0:11:18.176,000 --> 0:11:19,000
often have one of two extreme reactions.

231
0:11:20.106,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Either they say, "Why doesn't everyone live like this?"

232
0:11:22.779,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Or they say, "That sounds totally horrifying.

233
0:11:25.531,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I would never want to do that."

234
0:11:27.054,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So let me reassure you: there is a sacred respect for privacy among us,

235
0:11:32.614,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but also a commitment to what we call "radical hospitality" --

236
0:11:37.535,000 --> 0:11:39,000
not the kind advertised by the Four Seasons,

237
0:11:40.704,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but the kind that says that every single person is worthy of kindness,

238
0:11:46.355,000 --> 0:11:47,000
full stop, end of sentence.

239
0:11:49.129,000 --> 0:11:52,000
The biggest surprise for me of living in a community like this?

240
0:11:53.335,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You share all the domestic labor -- the repairing, the cooking, the weeding --

241
0:11:57.11,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but you also share the emotional labor.

242
0:11:59.573,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Rather than depending only on the idealized family unit

243
0:12:02.62,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to get all of your emotional needs met,

244
0:12:04.512,000 --> 0:12:06,000
you have two dozen other people that you can go to

245
0:12:06.945,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to talk about a hard day at work

246
0:12:08.805,000 --> 0:12:1,000
or troubleshoot how to handle an abusive teacher.

247
0:12:12.038,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Teenagers in our community will often go to an adult that is not their parent

248
0:12:17.626,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to ask for advice.

249
0:12:19.31,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It's what bell hooks called "revolutionary parenting,"

250
0:12:22.853,000 --> 0:12:23,000
this humble acknowledgment

251
0:12:24.675,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that kids are healthier when they have a wider range of adults

252
0:12:27.795,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to emulate and count on.

253
0:12:30.451,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Turns out, adults are healthier, too.

254
0:12:33.568,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It's a lot of pressure,

255
0:12:35.18,000 --> 0:12:38,000
trying to be that perfect family behind that white picket fence.

256
0:12:40.29,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The "new better off," as I've come to call it,

257
0:12:42.658,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is less about investing in the perfect family

258
0:12:45.638,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and more about investing in the imperfect village,

259
0:12:49.147,000 --> 0:12:51,000
whether that's relatives living under one roof,

260
0:12:51.397,000 --> 0:12:52,000
a cohousing community like mine,

261
0:12:53.261,000 --> 0:12:55,000
or just a bunch of neighbors who pledge to really know

262
0:12:56.215,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and look out for one another.

263
0:12:58.134,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's good common sense, right?

264
0:13:00.466,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And yet, money has often made us dumb

265
0:13:03.297,000 --> 0:13:04,000
about reaching out.

266
0:13:05.575,000 --> 0:13:07,000
The most reliable wealth

267
0:13:07.632,000 --> 0:13:09,000
is found in relationship.

268
0:13:11.511,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The new better off is not an individual prospect at all.

269
0:13:15.384,000 --> 0:13:18,000
In fact, if you're a failure or you think you're a failure,

270
0:13:18.477,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I've got some good news for you:

271
0:13:20.112,000 --> 0:13:23,000
you might be a success by standards you have not yet honored.

272
0:13:24.404,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Maybe you're a mediocre earner but a masterful father.

273
0:13:28.477,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Maybe you can't afford your dream home,

274
0:13:30.383,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but you throw legendary neighborhood parties.

275
0:13:34.462,000 --> 0:13:35,000
If you're a textbook success,

276
0:13:36.25,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the implications of what I'm saying could be more grim for you.

277
0:13:40.344,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You might be a failure by standards you hold dear

278
0:13:43.709,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but that the world doesn't reward.

279
0:13:46.719,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Only you can know.

280
0:13:49.31,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I know that I am not a tribute

281
0:13:52.55,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to my great-grandmother,

282
0:13:54.06,000 --> 0:13:56,000
who lived such a short and brutish life,

283
0:13:56.753,000 --> 0:13:59,000
if I earn enough money to afford every creature comfort.

284
0:14:00.614,000 --> 0:14:03,000
You can't buy your way out of suffering or into meaning.

285
0:14:03.767,000 --> 0:14:04,000
There is no home big enough

286
0:14:05.525,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to erase the pain that she must have endured.

287
0:14:09.435,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I am a tribute to her

288
0:14:10.709,000 --> 0:14:14,000
if I live a life as connected and courageous as possible.

289
0:14:16.256,000 --> 0:14:19,000
In the midst of such widespread uncertainty,

290
0:14:19.281,000 --> 0:14:21,000
we may, in fact, be insecure.

291
0:14:22.334,000 --> 0:14:24,000
But we can let that insecurity make us brittle

292
0:14:25.216,000 --> 0:14:26,000
or supple.

293
0:14:26.859,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We can turn inward, lose faith in the power of institutions to change --

294
0:14:31.89,000 --> 0:14:32,000
even lose faith in ourselves.

295
0:14:34.332,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Or we can turn outward,

296
0:14:36.3,000 --> 0:14:41,000
cultivate faith in our ability to reach out, to connect, to create.

297
0:14:43.063,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Turns out, the biggest danger

298
0:14:46.02,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is not failing to achieve the American Dream.

299
0:14:49.624,000 --> 0:14:51,000
The biggest danger is achieving a dream

300
0:14:52.086,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that you don't actually believe in.

301
0:14:55.362,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So don't do that.

302
0:14:57.046,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Do the harder, more interesting thing,

303
0:14:59.712,000 --> 0:15:03,000
which is to compose a life where what you do every single day,

304
0:15:03.784,000 --> 0:15:06,000
the people you give your best love and ingenuity and energy to,

305
0:15:07.486,000 --> 0:15:1,000
aligns as closely as possible with what you believe.

306
0:15:11.01,000 --> 0:15:14,000
That, not something as mundane as making money,

307
0:15:14.439,000 --> 0:15:15,000
is a tribute to your ancestors.

308
0:15:16.432,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That is the beautiful struggle.

309
0:15:20.861,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Thank you.

310
0:15:22.076,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Applause)

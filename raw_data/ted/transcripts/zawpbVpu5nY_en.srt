1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We live in a time of fear,

2
0:00:15.62,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and our response to fear can either be to contract

3
0:00:19.02,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and attempt to guard ourselves

4
0:00:21.82,000 --> 0:00:24,000
or to extend ourselves, hold on to each other,

5
0:00:24.98,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and face our fears together.

6
0:00:27.98,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What is your instinct?

7
0:00:30.5,000 --> 0:00:31,000
What do you see more of in the world?

8
0:00:34.06,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The problem with the first approach

9
0:00:36.06,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is that in our mounting isolation,

10
0:00:38.42,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we divide ourselves from others.

11
0:00:41.06,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Our sense of isolation grows,

12
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:45,000
because our imagination goes into overdrive

13
0:00:45.66,000 --> 0:00:48,000
about the people and the spaces that we no longer engage with.

14
0:00:49.22,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Our sense of otherness grows, and we lose empathy.

15
0:00:54.38,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Today I'm going to tell you about a group of people

16
0:00:56.82,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that took the global challenge of terrorism

17
0:00:58.98,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and began creating spaces where strangers connect in solidarity.

18
0:01:04.74,000 --> 0:01:07,000
My own obsession with what I see as irrational divisions began as a child.

19
0:01:09.66,000 --> 0:01:13,000
As a fourth-generation Kenyan Muslim of Indian origin,

20
0:01:13.86,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it bothered me that in four generations,

21
0:01:15.82,000 --> 0:01:17,000
there wasn't a single marriage in my family

22
0:01:17.9,000 --> 0:01:19,000
outside of my small religious community.

23
0:01:20.7,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And I wondered what that was about.

24
0:01:23.42,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Was it fear?

25
0:01:25.22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Was it racism?

26
0:01:28.06,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Was it cultural preservation?

27
0:01:30.58,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Did it have something to do with colonialism?

28
0:01:34.06,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Certainly, we didn't share a lot of the same public spaces with others.

29
0:01:39.5,000 --> 0:01:42,000
These divisions bothered me deeply, and they drove my career choices.

30
0:01:44.22,000 --> 0:01:49,000
When I was 20, the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.

31
0:01:50.9,000 --> 0:01:52,000
A year later, I was on my way to the Middle East

32
0:01:53.18,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to study conflict resolution.

33
0:01:55.7,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And then from that point on,

34
0:01:57.1,000 --> 0:02:,000
it wasn't very hard for me to find insecure environments to work in,

35
0:02:00.66,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because the world was quickly shifting

36
0:02:02.54,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in what we now know as the time of terrorism.

37
0:02:05.74,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I was in Washington, DC when 9/11 happened,

38
0:02:09.02,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and then I moved back home to Kenya to work with refugees

39
0:02:12.5,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and then later worked in Pakistan

40
0:02:14.66,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and in Afghanistan.

41
0:02:17.94,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In all of these places, what I noticed

42
0:02:20.62,000 --> 0:02:22,000
was how important physical spaces are

43
0:02:23.18,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to making us feel safe

44
0:02:25.58,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and well

45
0:02:26.9,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and like we belong.

46
0:02:29.58,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In 2013, I came back home to Nairobi from Afghanistan.

47
0:02:34.46,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Al-Shabaab operatives had besieged Westgate shopping center,

48
0:02:37.62,000 --> 0:02:41,000
killing 67 people in a day of utter horror.

49
0:02:43.86,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Soon after that,

50
0:02:45.78,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I could see how Nairobi was beginning to change,

51
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and it was beginning to feel more like the fear and terror-weary

52
0:02:53.22,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and war-torn cities that I had worked in.

53
0:02:57.06,000 --> 0:03:,000
And Nairobi continues to grow in fear-driven ways.

54
0:03:01.14,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We see more walls, more barriers,

55
0:03:03.7,000 --> 0:03:04,000
more security.

56
0:03:05.82,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And like other parts of the world,

57
0:03:07.5,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we are experiencing an erosion of human connection.

58
0:03:12.14,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Divisions along religious lines are deepening,

59
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and we're doubting more and more how much we have in common.

60
0:03:20.42,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We are at a pivotal time

61
0:03:21.74,000 --> 0:03:24,000
when we need to restore our confidence in humanity

62
0:03:25.3,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and stand boldly and visibly together.

63
0:03:29.7,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So in 2014, I brought together a group of people in Nairobi

64
0:03:32.5,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to figure out what to do:

65
0:03:34.5,000 --> 0:03:38,000
public intellectuals, diplomats, artists, development workers.

66
0:03:40.34,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And the group articulated our challenge as threefold:

67
0:03:44.82,000 --> 0:03:47,000
one, to reclaim the city from the narrative of terrorism

68
0:03:48.78,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and back into the hands of the people that live there;

69
0:03:52.02,000 --> 0:03:56,000
two, introduce a language beyond race, tribe or religion

70
0:03:56.1,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that would help us transcend our differences;

71
0:03:59.5,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and three, provide a gesture that would help restore empathy

72
0:04:04.06,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and conversation and trust.

73
0:04:08.34,000 --> 0:04:1,000
One of the people in this group was an artist and architect,

74
0:04:11.34,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Yazmany Arboleda.

75
0:04:13.86,000 --> 0:04:15,000
He and I have collaborated in other parts of the world

76
0:04:16.66,000 --> 0:04:17,000
over many years.

77
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
He has a history

78
0:04:19.82,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of disrupting urban environments

79
0:04:22.38,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and making strangers connect

80
0:04:24.06,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in incredible, beautiful and spectacular ways.

81
0:04:28.7,000 --> 0:04:29,000
He had an idea.

82
0:04:30.46,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The idea was to unite people of different faiths

83
0:04:33.62,000 --> 0:04:36,000
by getting them to paint each other's houses of worship,

84
0:04:36.82,000 --> 0:04:39,000
mosques, temples, synagogues, churches,

85
0:04:40.54,000 --> 0:04:41,000
paint them yellow

86
0:04:42.5,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in the name of love.

87
0:04:45.98,000 --> 0:04:48,000
By focusing on icons of faith,

88
0:04:49.34,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we would get people to reexamine the true essence of their faith,

89
0:04:53.42,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the common belief that we share in kindness, generosity and friendship.

90
0:04:58.62,000 --> 0:05:01,000
By creating pathways between houses of worship

91
0:05:01.66,000 --> 0:05:02,000
within one neighborhood,

92
0:05:03.3,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we would create islands of stability

93
0:05:05.22,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and networks of people

94
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that could withstand threats.

95
0:05:09.98,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And neighbors, by picking up a paintbrush with other neighbors,

96
0:05:14.54,000 --> 0:05:16,000
would engage not just with their heads

97
0:05:16.58,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but with their hands and with their hearts.

98
0:05:20.14,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And the painted buildings would become sculptures in the landscape

99
0:05:23.3,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that speak of people from very different backgrounds

100
0:05:25.98,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that stand together.

101
0:05:29.34,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We'd call the project "Colour in Faith."

102
0:05:32.22,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We loved the idea and we immediately began approaching houses of worship:

103
0:05:36.3,000 --> 0:05:38,000
churches, temples, mosques, synagogues.

104
0:05:39.1,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Door to door, we went to more than 60 rabbis,

105
0:05:41.78,000 --> 0:05:43,000
imams, pastors and priests.

106
0:05:44.98,000 --> 0:05:45,000
As you can imagine,

107
0:05:46.46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
bringing these communities together

108
0:05:48.18,000 --> 0:05:51,000
when prejudices are reinforced by a global pandemic of fear

109
0:05:51.42,000 --> 0:05:52,000
is not easy.

110
0:05:52.7,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It was complicated.

111
0:05:55.38,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We were confronted with the hierarchy of decision-making

112
0:05:58.06,000 --> 0:05:59,000
within religious establishments.

113
0:06:00.34,000 --> 0:06:02,000
For example, with Catholic churches,

114
0:06:02.86,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we were told that the archbishop would have to make the decision.

115
0:06:06.18,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And so we wrote a letter to the archbishop.

116
0:06:08.3,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We wrote a letter to the Vatican.

117
0:06:10.66,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We're still waiting to hear back.

118
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

119
0:06:14.14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And with other houses of worship,

120
0:06:16.22,000 --> 0:06:19,000
we were told that the patrons, the people that pay for the building

121
0:06:19.42,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and the construction and the painting of the buildings

122
0:06:21.98,000 --> 0:06:22,000
would have to make a decision.

123
0:06:24.82,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And then we came head-to-head

124
0:06:26.3,000 --> 0:06:28,000
with the long legacy of missionary and donor dependence

125
0:06:29.02,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that so impedes unconditional civic action,

126
0:06:32.34,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we learned this the hard way.

127
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There was one community

128
0:06:35.86,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that in our repeated conversations would keep asking us

129
0:06:39.22,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to appreciate them.

130
0:06:41.58,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And so we would keep going back

131
0:06:43.62,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and telling them that we appreciate them,

132
0:06:45.82,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and of course,

133
0:06:47.66,000 --> 0:06:5,000
if we didn't appreciate them, we wouldn't be here.

134
0:06:52.9,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And then we learned painfully late in the game

135
0:06:55.42,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that the word "appreciation" is code for getting paid to participate.

136
0:07:01.3,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And so we challenged them

137
0:07:04.42,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and we asked the question,

138
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"So what will it cost?

139
0:07:08.46,000 --> 0:07:09,000
How much could we pay you?

140
0:07:11.58,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And if we pay for your faith, is it really faith?"

141
0:07:15.66,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We started the project asking the question,

142
0:07:18.3,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"Where does your faith live?"

143
0:07:20.5,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And here we found ourselves asking the question,

144
0:07:22.78,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"How much does your faith cost?"

145
0:07:26.1,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But the most difficult issue was the perceived risk of standing apart.

146
0:07:30.5,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We had one synagogue that flat-out refused to participate

147
0:07:34.42,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because it feared drawing attention to itself

148
0:07:36.66,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and becoming a target.

149
0:07:38.82,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Similarly, we had a mosque that also feared becoming a target.

150
0:07:43.42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And these fears are justified.

151
0:07:47.3,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And yet, there were 25 houses of worship that pledged to participate.

152
0:07:53.18,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Applause)

153
0:07:58.58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
These bold leaders took the gesture and reinforced it with their own meaning.

154
0:08:03.1,000 --> 0:08:05,000
For some, it was to tell the world that they're not terrorists.

155
0:08:06.74,000 --> 0:08:1,000
For others, it was to welcome people through their doors to ask questions.

156
0:08:11.46,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And for some, it was to bridge the gap

157
0:08:13.34,000 --> 0:08:15,000
between the older and the younger generation,

158
0:08:15.5,000 --> 0:08:19,000
which by the way is something that many faiths are grappling with right now.

159
0:08:20.02,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And for some it was simply to build neighborhood solidarity

160
0:08:23.86,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in advance of feared election violence.

161
0:08:27.7,000 --> 0:08:28,000
When asked why yellow,

162
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
one imam beautifully said,

163
0:08:31.54,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"Yellow is the color of the sun.

164
0:08:34.22,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The sun shines on us all equally.

165
0:08:36.78,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It does not discriminate."

166
0:08:39.3,000 --> 0:08:41,000
He and others spread the word through their congregations

167
0:08:42.02,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and over the radio.

168
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Municipal government officials stepped forward and helped

169
0:08:45.979,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with permits and with convening civil society organizations.

170
0:08:50.18,000 --> 0:08:53,000
A paint company donated a thousand liters of yellow paint

171
0:08:53.82,000 --> 0:08:56,000
mixed especially for us in what they now call "optimistic yellow."

172
0:08:57.46,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:58.78,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Applause)

174
0:09:03.86,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And a poetry collective joined forces with a university

175
0:09:07.14,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and hosted a series of tweet chats

176
0:09:09.42,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that challenged the nation on issues of faith,

177
0:09:11.62,000 --> 0:09:13,000
our faith not just in the context of religion,

178
0:09:14.3,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but our faith in politicians and tribe and nation,

179
0:09:18.02,000 --> 0:09:21,000
our faith in the older generation and in the younger generation.

180
0:09:23.18,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And then Colour in Faith was launched at a gallery event

181
0:09:27.06,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that invited an incredible mix of gallerygoers

182
0:09:30.58,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and religious leaders and artists and businesspeople.

183
0:09:35.38,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Already, even before picking up a paintbrush,

184
0:09:38.06,000 --> 0:09:42,000
we had accomplished so much of the conversation and connection

185
0:09:42.3,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that we had hoped for.

186
0:09:44.82,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And then we began to paint.

187
0:09:49.74,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Muslims stood by Christians

188
0:09:51.9,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and atheists and agnostics and Hindus

189
0:09:55.14,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and painted a mosque yellow.

190
0:10:01.86,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And then they all came together again and painted a church yellow,

191
0:10:06.94,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and then another mosque,

192
0:10:09.06,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and then another church.

193
0:10:11.66,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Poets and musicians performed while we painted.

194
0:10:14.98,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We painted in Nairobi,

195
0:10:17.14,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and then we painted in Mombasa.

196
0:10:20.66,000 --> 0:10:23,000
The local and international press did features on Colour in Faith

197
0:10:24.54,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in English and French and Swahili

198
0:10:27.58,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and Spanish and Somali.

199
0:10:30.22,000 --> 0:10:35,000
CNN highlighted Colour in Faith as a way of bringing communities together.

200
0:10:37.34,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And our social media platforms lit up,

201
0:10:40.22,000 --> 0:10:42,000
connecting more and more people.

202
0:10:42.78,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And these neighbors continued to stay in touch.

203
0:10:46.66,000 --> 0:10:49,000
There are some that are pursuing politics with a platform of peace,

204
0:10:50.3,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and we have communities as far as Argentina and the US

205
0:10:53.38,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and as close as Mali and Rwanda

206
0:10:55.66,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that are asking for our help.

207
0:10:57.5,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And we would love to help.

208
0:10:59.78,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's our dream that this project, this idea, spreads across the world,

209
0:11:03.98,000 --> 0:11:04,000
with or without our support.

210
0:11:07.3,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Colour in Faith is literally highlighting those who mean well in yellow.

211
0:11:12.82,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Colour in Faith is binding neighborhoods together,

212
0:11:15.38,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and it's our hope that when threats come knocking,

213
0:11:17.9,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they will collectively sift fact from rumor

214
0:11:20.3,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and stand in solidarity.

215
0:11:23.14,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We've proven that the human family can come together and send a message

216
0:11:26.82,000 --> 0:11:28,000
far brighter and more powerful

217
0:11:29.22,000 --> 0:11:31,000
than the voices of those that wish to do us harm.

218
0:11:33.14,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Though fear is infectious,

219
0:11:34.86,000 --> 0:11:36,000
we are showing that so is hope.

220
0:11:38.66,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Thank you.

221
0:11:39.94,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Applause)

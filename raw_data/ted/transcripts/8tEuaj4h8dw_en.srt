1
0:00:16.014,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota.

2
0:00:19.664,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Many of you may have heard of the Lakota,

3
0:00:21.839,000 --> 0:00:22,000
or at least the larger group of tribes,

4
0:00:23.803,000 --> 0:00:24,000
called the Sioux.

5
0:00:25.928,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The Lakota are one of many tribes that were moved off their land

6
0:00:29.087,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to prisoner-of-war camps,

7
0:00:30.516,000 --> 0:00:31,000
now called reservations.

8
0:00:32.757,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The Pine Ridge Reservation,

9
0:00:34.868,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the subject of today's slide show,

10
0:00:37.024,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is located about 75 miles southeast of the Black Hills in South Dakota.

11
0:00:41.35,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It is sometimes referred to as Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,

12
0:00:46.301,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and it is where the Lakota now live.

13
0:00:48.451,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,

14
0:00:50.661,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the American Indian Movement,

15
0:00:52.605,000 --> 0:00:53,000
or of Russell Means,

16
0:00:54.471,000 --> 0:00:55,000
or Leonard Peltier,

17
0:00:56.883,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or of the standoff at Oglala,

18
0:00:58.994,000 --> 0:01:02,000
then you know Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the US.

19
0:01:04.517,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So I've been asked to talk a little bit today

20
0:01:06.699,000 --> 0:01:08,000
about my relationship with the Lakota,

21
0:01:08.891,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and that's a very difficult one for me,

22
0:01:10.891,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because, if you haven't noticed from my skin color,

23
0:01:13.373,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm white,

24
0:01:14.786,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation.

25
0:01:19.373,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today.

26
0:01:21.827,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I've become very close with them, and they've welcomed me like family.

27
0:01:25.168,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They've called me "brother" and "uncle,"

28
0:01:27.11,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and invited me again and again over five years.

29
0:01:29.438,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But on Pine Ridge,

30
0:01:30.66,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I will always be what is called "wasichu."

31
0:01:33.66,000 --> 0:01:36,000
"Wasichu" is a Lakota word

32
0:01:36.85,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that means "non-Indian,"

33
0:01:38.975,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but another version of this word

34
0:01:41.078,000 --> 0:01:44,000
means "the one who takes the best meat for himself."

35
0:01:44.667,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And that's what I want to focus on --

36
0:01:46.512,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the one who takes the best part of the meat.

37
0:01:49.113,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It means "greedy."

38
0:01:51.318,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So take a look around this auditorium today.

39
0:01:54.13,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We are at a private school in the American West,

40
0:01:57.214,000 --> 0:01:59,000
sitting in red velvet chairs

41
0:01:59.66,000 --> 0:02:,000
with money in our pockets.

42
0:02:01.961,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And if we look at our lives,

43
0:02:03.731,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we have indeed taken the best part of the meat.

44
0:02:07.596,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So let's look today at a set of photographs

45
0:02:10.66,000 --> 0:02:11,000
of a people who lost

46
0:02:12.322,000 --> 0:02:13,000
so that we could gain,

47
0:02:14.323,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and know that when you see these people's faces,

48
0:02:17.564,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that these are not just images of the Lakota;

49
0:02:20.192,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they stand for all indigenous people.

50
0:02:25.62,000 --> 0:02:26,000
On this piece of paper

51
0:02:27.299,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is the history the way I learned it from my Lakota friends and family.

52
0:02:32.883,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The following is a time line of treaties made, treaties broken

53
0:02:37.17,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and massacres disguised as battles.

54
0:02:39.928,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I'll begin in 1824.

55
0:02:42.161,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs

56
0:02:44.297,000 --> 0:02:45,000
was created within the War Department,

57
0:02:46.151,000 --> 0:02:47,000
setting an early tone of aggression

58
0:02:47.865,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in our dealings with the Native Americans.

59
0:02:49.928,000 --> 0:02:5,000
1851:

60
0:02:51.495,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,

61
0:02:53.684,000 --> 0:02:55,000
clearly marking the boundaries of the Lakota Nation.

62
0:02:57.017,000 --> 0:03:,000
According to the treaty, those lands are a sovereign nation.

63
0:03:00.66,000 --> 0:03:02,000
If the boundaries of this treaty had held --

64
0:03:02.78,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and there is a legal basis that they should --

65
0:03:05.431,000 --> 0:03:07,000
then this is what the US would look like today.

66
0:03:11.015,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Ten years later.

67
0:03:12.58,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The Homestead Act, signed by President Lincoln,

68
0:03:15.326,000 --> 0:03:17,000
unleashed a flood of white settlers into Native lands.

69
0:03:18.605,000 --> 0:03:19,000
1863:

70
0:03:20.308,000 --> 0:03:22,000
An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota

71
0:03:22.83,000 --> 0:03:24,000
ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,

72
0:03:25.762,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the largest mass execution in US history.

73
0:03:29.295,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The execution was ordered by President Lincoln,

74
0:03:31.558,000 --> 0:03:35,000
only two days after he signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

75
0:03:37.829,000 --> 0:03:4,000
1866: The beginning of the Transcontinental Railroad --

76
0:03:41.425,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a new era.

77
0:03:43.023,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We appropriated land for trails and trains

78
0:03:45.237,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to shortcut through the heart of the Lakota Nation.

79
0:03:47.66,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The treaties were out the window.

80
0:03:49.5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In response, three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud

81
0:03:52.991,000 --> 0:03:53,000
attacked and defeated the US army,

82
0:03:54.721,000 --> 0:03:55,000
many times over.

83
0:03:55.943,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I want to repeat that part:

84
0:03:57.292,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The Lakota defeat the US army.

85
0:04:01.03,000 --> 0:04:04,000
1868: The second Fort Laramie Treaty clearly guarantees

86
0:04:04.903,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation

87
0:04:06.943,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the Lakotas' ownership of the sacred Black Hills.

88
0:04:10.09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The government also promises land and hunting rights

89
0:04:12.568,000 --> 0:04:13,000
in the surrounding states.

90
0:04:13.916,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We promise that the Powder River country

91
0:04:16.003,000 --> 0:04:18,000
will henceforth be closed to all whites.

92
0:04:18.761,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The treaty seemed to be a complete victory

93
0:04:20.843,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for Red Cloud and the Sioux.

94
0:04:22.327,000 --> 0:04:24,000
In fact, this is the only war in American history

95
0:04:26.072,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in which the government negotiated a peace

96
0:04:28.332,000 --> 0:04:3,000
by conceding everything demanded by the enemy.

97
0:04:34.013,000 --> 0:04:37,000
1869: The Transcontinental Railroad was completed.

98
0:04:37.779,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It began carrying, among other things, large numbers of hunters,

99
0:04:41.19,000 --> 0:04:43,000
who began the wholesale killing of buffalo,

100
0:04:43.56,000 --> 0:04:46,000
eliminating a source of food, clothing and shelter for the Sioux.

101
0:04:47.142,000 --> 0:04:48,000
1871:

102
0:04:48.937,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The Indian Appropriation Act

103
0:04:50.621,000 --> 0:04:52,000
makes all Indians wards of the federal government.

104
0:04:53.559,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In addition, the military issued orders

105
0:04:55.734,000 --> 0:04:57,000
forbidding western Indians from leaving reservations.

106
0:04:59.414,000 --> 0:05:03,000
All western Indians at that point in time were now prisoners of war.

107
0:05:04.163,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Also in 1871,

108
0:05:05.634,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we ended the time of treaty-making.

109
0:05:07.635,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations,

110
0:05:11.351,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we can't have that.

111
0:05:12.545,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We had plans.

112
0:05:14.814,000 --> 0:05:15,000
1874:

113
0:05:16.061,000 --> 0:05:19,000
General George Custer announced the discovery of gold in Lakota territory,

114
0:05:19.641,000 --> 0:05:2,000
specifically the Black Hills.

115
0:05:21.35,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The news of gold creates a massive influx of white settlers

116
0:05:24.185,000 --> 0:05:25,000
into Lakota Nation.

117
0:05:25.974,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Custer recommends that Congress find a way

118
0:05:28.031,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to end the treaties with the Lakota as soon as possible.

119
0:05:31.308,000 --> 0:05:34,000
1875: The Lakota war begins

120
0:05:34.365,000 --> 0:05:36,000
over the violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty.

121
0:05:37.811,000 --> 0:05:38,000
1876:

122
0:05:39.582,000 --> 0:05:4,000
On July 26th,

123
0:05:41.264,000 --> 0:05:43,000
on its way to attack a Lakota village,

124
0:05:43.507,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed

125
0:05:45.595,000 --> 0:05:46,000
at the battle of Little Big Horn.

126
0:05:48.006,000 --> 0:05:49,000
1877:

127
0:05:49.845,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The great Lakota warrior and chief named Crazy Horse

128
0:05:52.913,000 --> 0:05:53,000
surrendered at Fort Robinson.

129
0:05:55.103,000 --> 0:05:57,000
He was later killed while in custody.

130
0:06:01.195,000 --> 0:06:05,000
1877 is also the year we found a way to get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.

131
0:06:05.907,000 --> 0:06:08,000
A new agreement was presented to Sioux chiefs and their leading men,

132
0:06:09.224,000 --> 0:06:11,000
under a campaign known as "Sell or Starve" --

133
0:06:11.66,000 --> 0:06:13,000
sign the paper, or no food for your tribe.

134
0:06:14.416,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Only 10 percent of the adult male population signed.

135
0:06:17.846,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The Fort Laramie Treaty called for at least three-quarters of the tribe

136
0:06:21.589,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to sign away land.

137
0:06:23.514,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That clause was obviously ignored.

138
0:06:25.969,000 --> 0:06:27,000
1887: The Dawes Act.

139
0:06:29.071,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Communal ownership of reservation lands ends.

140
0:06:31.66,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Reservations are cut up into 160-acre sections,

141
0:06:34.775,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and distributed to individual Indians

142
0:06:36.78,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with the surplus disposed of.

143
0:06:38.66,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Tribes lost millions of acres.

144
0:06:41.582,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The American dream of individual land ownership

145
0:06:43.853,000 --> 0:06:44,000
turned out to be a very clever way

146
0:06:45.872,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to divide the reservation until nothing was left.

147
0:06:49.301,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The move destroyed the reservations,

148
0:06:51.171,000 --> 0:06:53,000
making it easier to further subdivide and to sell

149
0:06:54.145,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with every passing generation.

150
0:06:56.415,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Most of the surplus land

151
0:06:58.154,000 --> 0:07:,000
and many of the plots within reservation boundaries

152
0:07:00.814,000 --> 0:07:01,000
are now in the hands of white ranchers.

153
0:07:03.294,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Once again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu.

154
0:07:07.421,000 --> 0:07:11,000
1890: A date I believe to be the most important in this slide show.

155
0:07:12.428,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre.

156
0:07:15.497,000 --> 0:07:16,000
On December 29,

157
0:07:16.942,000 --> 0:07:19,000
US troops surrounded a Sioux encampment at Wounded Knee Creek,

158
0:07:20.148,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and massacred Chief Big Foot and 300 prisoners of war,

159
0:07:24.221,000 --> 0:07:27,000
using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells,

160
0:07:27.747,000 --> 0:07:28,000
called a Hotchkiss gun.

161
0:07:29.81,000 --> 0:07:3,000
For this so-called "battle,"

162
0:07:31.414,000 --> 0:07:34,000
20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor

163
0:07:34.441,000 --> 0:07:35,000
were given to the 7th Cavalry.

164
0:07:37.66,000 --> 0:07:38,000
To this day,

165
0:07:40.265,000 --> 0:07:44,000
this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle.

166
0:07:45.279,000 --> 0:07:46,000
More Medals of Honor were given

167
0:07:46.923,000 --> 0:07:48,000
for the indiscriminate slaughter of women and children

168
0:07:49.477,000 --> 0:07:51,000
than for any battle in World War One,

169
0:07:52.373,000 --> 0:07:53,000
World War Two,

170
0:07:53.738,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Korea, Vietnam,

171
0:07:56.073,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Iraq or Afghanistan.

172
0:08:00.071,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The Wounded Knee Massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars.

173
0:08:05.102,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee,

174
0:08:08.586,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux,

175
0:08:13.012,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.

176
0:08:18.49,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The holy man Black Elk, said,

177
0:08:21.054,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"I did not know then how much was ended.

178
0:08:24.997,000 --> 0:08:27,000
When I look back now from this high hill of my old age,

179
0:08:28.438,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I can still see the butchered women and children

180
0:08:31.043,000 --> 0:08:35,000
lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch,

181
0:08:39.011,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as plain as when I saw them

182
0:08:40.97,000 --> 0:08:41,000
with eyes still young.

183
0:08:46.262,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud

184
0:08:51.235,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and was buried in the blizzard.

185
0:08:54.643,000 --> 0:08:55,000
A people's dream died there.

186
0:08:57.783,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And it was a beautiful dream."

187
0:09:02.338,000 --> 0:09:03,000
With this event,

188
0:09:03.818,000 --> 0:09:06,000
a new era in Native American history began.

189
0:09:07.66,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after,

190
0:09:12.66,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because it was in this moment,

191
0:09:14.451,000 --> 0:09:17,000
with the fingers on the triggers of the Hotchkiss guns,

192
0:09:17.762,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that the US government openly declared its position on Native rights.

193
0:09:22.119,000 --> 0:09:23,000
They were tired of treaties.

194
0:09:24.055,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They were tired of sacred hills.

195
0:09:26.047,000 --> 0:09:27,000
They were tired of ghost dances.

196
0:09:28.936,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux.

197
0:09:32.555,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So they brought out their cannons.

198
0:09:35.973,000 --> 0:09:37,000
"You want to be an Indian now?" they said,

199
0:09:38.324,000 --> 0:09:39,000
finger on the trigger.

200
0:09:45.816,000 --> 0:09:46,000
1900:

201
0:09:47.808,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the US Indian population reached its low point --

202
0:09:51.302,000 --> 0:09:53,000
less than 250,000,

203
0:09:53.858,000 --> 0:09:56,000
compared to an estimated eight million in 1492.

204
0:09:59.756,000 --> 0:10:,000
Fast-forward.

205
0:10:01.66,000 --> 0:10:02,000
1980:

206
0:10:03.493,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The longest-running court case in US history,

207
0:10:06.216,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the Sioux Nation versus the United States,

208
0:10:08.821,000 --> 0:10:1,000
was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.

209
0:10:12.533,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The court determined that when the Sioux were resettled onto reservations

210
0:10:16.08,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and seven million acres of their land were opened up

211
0:10:19.191,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to prospectors and homesteaders,

212
0:10:21.265,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty

213
0:10:23.852,000 --> 0:10:24,000
had been violated.

214
0:10:25.792,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The court stated that the Black Hills were illegally taken,

215
0:10:29.556,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and that the initial offering price, plus interest,

216
0:10:32.195,000 --> 0:10:33,000
should be paid to the Sioux Nation.

217
0:10:34.56,000 --> 0:10:35,000
As payment for the Black Hills,

218
0:10:36.136,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the court awarded only 106 million dollars to the Sioux Nation.

219
0:10:40.592,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The Sioux refused the money with the rallying cry,

220
0:10:43.66,000 --> 0:10:44,000
"The Black Hills are not for sale."

221
0:10:46.89,000 --> 0:10:47,000
2010:

222
0:10:48.589,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Statistics about Native population today,

223
0:10:51.405,000 --> 0:10:54,000
more than a century after the massacre at Wounded Knee,

224
0:10:54.66,000 --> 0:10:56,000
reveal the legacy of colonization,

225
0:10:57.269,000 --> 0:10:58,000
forced migration

226
0:10:58.561,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and treaty violations.

227
0:11:01.155,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Unemployment on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation

228
0:11:03.609,000 --> 0:11:05,000
fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.

229
0:11:06.949,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The housing office is unable to build new structures,

230
0:11:09.822,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and existing structures are falling apart.

231
0:11:12.29,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Many are homeless,

232
0:11:13.483,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and those with homes are packed into rotting buildings

233
0:11:16.066,000 --> 0:11:17,000
with up to five families.

234
0:11:17.858,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge

235
0:11:20.089,000 --> 0:11:21,000
have no electricity.

236
0:11:21.784,000 --> 0:11:23,000
At least 60 percent of the homes on the reservation

237
0:11:24.477,000 --> 0:11:25,000
are infested with black mold.

238
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:31,000
More than 90 percent of the population lives below the federal poverty line.

239
0:11:32.074,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge

240
0:11:34.258,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is approximately eight times higher than the US national average.

241
0:11:37.875,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent,

242
0:11:41.129,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and is about three times higher than the US national average.

243
0:11:44.461,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Cervical cancer is five times higher

244
0:11:46.88,000 --> 0:11:47,000
than the US national average.

245
0:11:48.715,000 --> 0:11:5,000
The school dropout rate is up to 70 percent.

246
0:11:52.059,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Teacher turnover is eight times higher than the US national average.

247
0:11:56.66,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Frequently, grandparents are raising their grandchildren

248
0:12:00.053,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because parents, due to alcoholism,

249
0:12:02.395,000 --> 0:12:04,000
domestic violence and general apathy,

250
0:12:05.144,000 --> 0:12:06,000
cannot raise them.

251
0:12:07.342,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Fifty percent of the population over the age of 40

252
0:12:10.437,000 --> 0:12:11,000
suffers from diabetes.

253
0:12:12.894,000 --> 0:12:17,000
The life expectancy for men is between 46 and 48 years old --

254
0:12:19.525,000 --> 0:12:23,000
roughly the same as in Afghanistan and Somalia.

255
0:12:25.398,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The last chapter in any successful genocide

256
0:12:28.962,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is the one in which the oppressor

257
0:12:30.963,000 --> 0:12:32,000
can remove their hands and say,

258
0:12:33.527,000 --> 0:12:36,000
"My god -- what are these people doing to themselves?

259
0:12:37.013,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They're killing each other.

260
0:12:38.733,000 --> 0:12:39,000
They're killing themselves

261
0:12:40.66,000 --> 0:12:41,000
while we watch them die."

262
0:12:43.501,000 --> 0:12:45,000
This is how we came to own these United States.

263
0:12:46.96,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This is the legacy

264
0:12:48.279,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of Manifest Destiny.

265
0:12:50.713,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Prisoners are still born into prisoner of war camps,

266
0:12:54.964,000 --> 0:12:55,000
long after the guards are gone.

267
0:12:59.709,000 --> 0:13:03,000
These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken.

268
0:13:07.151,000 --> 0:13:08,000
A long time ago,

269
0:13:08.493,000 --> 0:13:09,000
a series of events was set in motion

270
0:13:10.494,000 --> 0:13:13,000
by a people who look like me, by wasichu,

271
0:13:14.02,000 --> 0:13:17,000
eager to take the land and the water and the gold in the hills.

272
0:13:18.462,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end.

273
0:13:22.588,000 --> 0:13:25,000
As removed as we, the dominant society, may feel

274
0:13:27.414,000 --> 0:13:29,000
from a massacre in 1890,

275
0:13:30.031,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago,

276
0:13:34.231,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I still have to ask you the question:

277
0:13:37.344,000 --> 0:13:39,000
How should you feel about the statistics of today?

278
0:13:41.138,000 --> 0:13:44,000
What is the connection between these images of suffering

279
0:13:44.326,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and the history that I just read to you?

280
0:13:47.19,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And how much of this history do you need to own, even?

281
0:13:50.739,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Is any of this your responsibility today?

282
0:13:54.533,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I have been told that there must be something we can do.

283
0:13:57.25,000 --> 0:13:59,000
There must be some call to action.

284
0:14:00.957,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Because for so long, I've been standing on the sidelines,

285
0:14:04.469,000 --> 0:14:05,000
content to be a witness,

286
0:14:06.119,000 --> 0:14:07,000
just taking photographs.

287
0:14:08.921,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Because the solutions seem so far in the past,

288
0:14:11.544,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I needed nothing short of a time machine to access them.

289
0:14:15.94,000 --> 0:14:2,000
The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix.

290
0:14:21.9,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It's not something everyone can get behind

291
0:14:23.94,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the way they get behind helping Haiti,

292
0:14:25.813,000 --> 0:14:27,000
or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.

293
0:14:28.999,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The "fix," as it's called,

294
0:14:30.989,000 --> 0:14:32,000
may be much more difficult for the dominant society

295
0:14:33.66,000 --> 0:14:35,000
than, say, a $50 check

296
0:14:35.981,000 --> 0:14:38,000
or a church trip to paint some graffiti-covered houses,

297
0:14:39.302,000 --> 0:14:4,000
or a suburban family

298
0:14:40.937,000 --> 0:14:42,000
donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore.

299
0:14:44.556,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So where does that leave us?

300
0:14:46.436,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Shrugging our shoulders in the dark?

301
0:14:50.27,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The United States continues on a daily basis to violate the terms

302
0:14:54.974,000 --> 0:14:58,000
of the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.

303
0:14:59.983,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The call to action I offer today --

304
0:15:03.152,000 --> 0:15:05,000
my TED wish -- is this:

305
0:15:06.611,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Honor the treaties.

306
0:15:08.485,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Give back the Black Hills.

307
0:15:10.579,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It's not your business what they do with them.

308
0:15:15.158,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Applause)

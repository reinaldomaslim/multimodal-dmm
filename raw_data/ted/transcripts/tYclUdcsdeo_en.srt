2
0:00:16.395,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Everyone is both a learner

3
0:00:18.371,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and a teacher.

4
0:00:19.883,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is me being inspired

5
0:00:22.339,000 --> 0:00:23,000
by my first tutor,

6
0:00:23.53,000 --> 0:00:23,000
my mom,

7
0:00:24.475,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and this is me teaching

8
0:00:27.098,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

9
0:00:29.051,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to 200 students

10
0:00:30.291,000 --> 0:00:31,000
at Stanford University.

11
0:00:31.563,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Now the students and I

12
0:00:33.019,000 --> 0:00:34,000
enjoyed the class,

13
0:00:34.195,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but it occurred to me

14
0:00:35.611,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that while the subject matter

15
0:00:37.322,000 --> 0:00:38,000
of the class is advanced

16
0:00:38.611,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and modern,

17
0:00:39.299,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the teaching technology isn't.

18
0:00:41.618,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In fact, I use basically

19
0:00:43.954,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the same technology as

20
0:00:46.324,000 --> 0:00:48,000
this 14th-century classroom.

21
0:00:48.954,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Note the textbook,

22
0:00:51.754,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the sage on the stage,

23
0:00:54.698,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the sleeping guy

24
0:00:56.597,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in the back. (Laughter)

25
0:00:57.498,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Just like today.

26
0:01:00.435,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So my co-teacher,

27
0:01:03.546,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Sebastian Thrun, and I thought,

28
0:01:05.186,000 --> 0:01:06,000
there must be a better way.

29
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We challenged ourselves

30
0:01:08.614,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to create an online class

31
0:01:09.905,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that would be equal or better

32
0:01:11.536,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in quality to our Stanford class,

33
0:01:13.872,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but to bring it to anyone

34
0:01:16.082,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in the world for free.

35
0:01:17.712,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We announced the class on July 29th,

36
0:01:20.28,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and within two weeks, 50,000 people

37
0:01:23.489,000 --> 0:01:24,000
had signed up for it.

38
0:01:24.896,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And that grew to 160,000 students

39
0:01:28.001,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from 209 countries.

40
0:01:30.065,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We were thrilled to have

41
0:01:31.873,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that kind of audience,

42
0:01:32.994,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and just a bit terrified that we

43
0:01:35.633,000 --> 0:01:37,000
hadn't finished preparing the class yet. (Laughter)

44
0:01:37.944,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So we got to work.

45
0:01:39.556,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We studied what others had done,

46
0:01:41.192,000 --> 0:01:43,000
what we could copy and what we could change.

47
0:01:43.515,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Benjamin Bloom had showed

48
0:01:46.176,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that one-on-one tutoring works best,

49
0:01:47.985,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so that's what we tried to emulate,

50
0:01:50.113,000 --> 0:01:51,000
like with me and my mom,

51
0:01:51.553,000 --> 0:01:52,000
even though we knew

52
0:01:53.058,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it would be one-on-thousands.

53
0:01:54.976,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Here, an overhead video camera

54
0:01:57.177,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is recording me as I'm talking

55
0:01:59.009,000 --> 0:02:,000
and drawing on a piece of paper.

56
0:02:00.688,000 --> 0:02:02,000
A student said, "This class felt

57
0:02:03.097,000 --> 0:02:04,000
like sitting in a bar

58
0:02:04.249,000 --> 0:02:05,000
with a really smart friend

59
0:02:05.728,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who's explaining something

60
0:02:06.932,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you haven't grasped, but are about to."

61
0:02:09.233,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And that's exactly what we were aiming for.

62
0:02:11.349,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, from Khan Academy, we saw

63
0:02:14.137,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that short 10-minute videos

64
0:02:15.961,000 --> 0:02:16,000
worked much better than trying

65
0:02:17.737,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to record an hour-long lecture

66
0:02:19.808,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and put it on the small-format screen.

67
0:02:22.225,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We decided to go even shorter

68
0:02:24.417,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and more interactive.

69
0:02:26.065,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Our typical video is two minutes,

70
0:02:28.312,000 --> 0:02:29,000
sometimes shorter, never more

71
0:02:30.064,000 --> 0:02:32,000
than six, and then we pause for

72
0:02:32.753,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a quiz question, to make it

73
0:02:34.12,000 --> 0:02:35,000
feel like one-on-one tutoring.

74
0:02:35.998,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Here, I'm explaining how a computer uses

75
0:02:38.4,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the grammar of English

76
0:02:39.648,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to parse sentences, and here,

77
0:02:41.825,000 --> 0:02:43,000
there's a pause and the student

78
0:02:43.889,000 --> 0:02:45,000
has to reflect, understand what's going on

79
0:02:46.126,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and check the right boxes

80
0:02:47.766,000 --> 0:02:48,000
before they can continue.

81
0:02:49.183,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Students learn best when

82
0:02:51.631,000 --> 0:02:52,000
they're actively practicing.

83
0:02:52.879,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We wanted to engage them, to have them grapple

84
0:02:55.175,000 --> 0:02:57,000
with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize

85
0:02:58.143,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the key ideas themselves.

86
0:02:59.808,000 --> 0:03:,000
We mostly avoid questions

87
0:03:01.52,000 --> 0:03:02,000
like, "Here's a formula, now

88
0:03:03.231,000 --> 0:03:04,000
tell me the value of Y

89
0:03:04.306,000 --> 0:03:05,000
when X is equal to two."

90
0:03:05.518,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We preferred open-ended questions.

91
0:03:07.335,000 --> 0:03:1,000
One student wrote, "Now I'm seeing

92
0:03:10.513,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Bayes networks and examples of

93
0:03:12.375,000 --> 0:03:13,000
game theory everywhere I look."

94
0:03:13.943,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I like that kind of response.

95
0:03:15.681,000 --> 0:03:16,000
That's just what we were going for.

96
0:03:17.487,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We didn't want students to memorize the formulas;

97
0:03:19.681,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we wanted to change the way

98
0:03:20.871,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they looked at the world.

99
0:03:21.961,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And we succeeded.

100
0:03:23.287,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Or, I should say, the students succeeded.

101
0:03:25.687,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And it's a little bit ironic

102
0:03:27.606,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that we set about to disrupt traditional education,

103
0:03:30.519,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and in doing so, we ended up

104
0:03:32.535,000 --> 0:03:33,000
making our online class

105
0:03:34.119,000 --> 0:03:36,000
much more like a traditional college class

106
0:03:36.446,000 --> 0:03:37,000
than other online classes.

107
0:03:38.287,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Most online classes, the videos are always available.

108
0:03:41.502,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You can watch them any time you want.

109
0:03:43.319,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But if you can do it any time,

110
0:03:45.606,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that means you can do it tomorrow,

111
0:03:47.111,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and if you can do it tomorrow,

112
0:03:48.519,000 --> 0:03:5,000
well, you may not ever

113
0:03:50.681,000 --> 0:03:51,000
get around to it. (Laughter)

114
0:03:52.439,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So we brought back the innovation

115
0:03:54.631,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of having due dates. (Laughter)

116
0:03:56.718,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You could watch the videos

117
0:03:58.03,000 --> 0:03:59,000
any time you wanted during the week,

118
0:03:59.942,000 --> 0:04:,000
but at the end of the week,

119
0:04:01.097,000 --> 0:04:02,000
you had to get the homework done.

120
0:04:02.814,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This motivated the students to keep going, and it also

121
0:04:04.727,000 --> 0:04:06,000
meant that everybody was working

122
0:04:07.583,000 --> 0:04:08,000
on the same thing at the same time,

123
0:04:09.101,000 --> 0:04:1,000
so if you went into a discussion forum,

124
0:04:10.598,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you could get an answer from a peer within minutes.

125
0:04:13.302,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now, I'll show you some of the forums, most of which

126
0:04:16.241,000 --> 0:04:18,000
were self-organized by the students themselves.

127
0:04:19.007,000 --> 0:04:22,000
From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng, we learned

128
0:04:22.231,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the concept of "flipping" the classroom.

129
0:04:24.227,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Students watched the videos

130
0:04:25.522,000 --> 0:04:26,000
on their own, and then they

131
0:04:27.11,000 --> 0:04:28,000
come together to discuss them.

132
0:04:28.82,000 --> 0:04:31,000
From Eric Mazur, I learned about peer instruction,

133
0:04:31.977,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that peers can be the best teachers,

134
0:04:34.601,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because they're the ones

135
0:04:36.033,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that remember what it's like to not understand.

136
0:04:38.881,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that.

137
0:04:41.562,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Of course, we couldn't have

138
0:04:43.961,000 --> 0:04:44,000
a classroom discussion with

139
0:04:45.593,000 --> 0:04:46,000
tens of thousands of students,

140
0:04:47.139,000 --> 0:04:5,000
so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums.

141
0:04:50.625,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And finally, from Teach For America,

142
0:04:53.673,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I learned that a class is not

143
0:04:55.154,000 --> 0:04:56,000
primarily about information.

144
0:04:56.65,000 --> 0:04:58,000
More important is motivation and determination.

145
0:04:59.481,000 --> 0:05:,000
It was crucial that the students see

146
0:05:01.321,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that we're working hard for them and

147
0:05:03.121,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they're all supporting each other.

148
0:05:04.53,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now, the class ran 10 weeks,

149
0:05:07.498,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and in the end, about half of the 160,000 students watched

150
0:05:11.409,000 --> 0:05:12,000
at least one video each week,

151
0:05:12.972,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and over 20,000 finished all the homework,

152
0:05:15.665,000 --> 0:05:16,000
putting in 50 to 100 hours.

153
0:05:17.329,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They got this statement of accomplishment.

154
0:05:18.882,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So what have we learned?

155
0:05:21.001,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Well, we tried some old ideas

156
0:05:23.817,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and some new and put them together,

157
0:05:25.474,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but there are more ideas to try.

158
0:05:27.556,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Sebastian's teaching another class now.

159
0:05:29.37,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I'll do one in the fall.

160
0:05:30.738,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Stanford Coursera, Udacity, MITx

161
0:05:34.498,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and others have more classes coming.

162
0:05:36.769,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's a really exciting time.

163
0:05:38.257,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But to me, the most exciting

164
0:05:39.729,000 --> 0:05:41,000
part of it is the data that we're gathering.

165
0:05:42.705,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We're gathering thousands

166
0:05:45.401,000 --> 0:05:46,000
of interactions per student per class,

167
0:05:47.057,000 --> 0:05:49,000
billions of interactions altogether,

168
0:05:49.265,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and now we can start analyzing that,

169
0:05:51.769,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and when we learn from that,

170
0:05:53.233,000 --> 0:05:54,000
do experimentations,

171
0:05:54.474,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that's when the real revolution will come.

172
0:05:56.714,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And you'll be able to see the results from

173
0:05:59.49,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a new generation of amazing students.

174
0:06:01.753,000 --> 0:06:03,000

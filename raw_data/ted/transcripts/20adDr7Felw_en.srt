1
0:00:12.794,000 --> 0:00:14,000
There's something really incredible happening.

2
0:00:14.961,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So there's over a billion people

3
0:00:17.619,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who have no access to energy whatsoever across the world,

4
0:00:20.833,000 --> 0:00:22,000
620 million of them here in Africa.

5
0:00:23.734,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It costs about 1,500 dollars to connect each household up to the grid.

6
0:00:28.663,000 --> 0:00:31,000
If you are going to wait for it, it takes about nine years, on average,

7
0:00:32.021,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and that feels like a lifetime when you're trying to make that happen.

8
0:00:35.331,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That's kind of unbelievable,

9
0:00:36.76,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and it's also unacceptable.

10
0:00:39.744,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So let's do something about it.

11
0:00:42.269,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The lightbulb comes from this idea that you have an energy system

12
0:00:45.976,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that's made up of the ideas of Tesla

13
0:00:49.824,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the ideas of Thomas Edison.

14
0:00:52.29,000 --> 0:00:55,000
There was an evolution that said it's not just about the lightbulb,

15
0:00:55.46,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it's about the whole system,

16
0:00:56.819,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the whole energy system that goes with that lightbulb,

17
0:00:59.377,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and what happened in that gilded age

18
0:01:02.805,000 --> 0:01:04,000
was the creation of an industrial system

19
0:01:05.075,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that every country around the world has now started to emulate.

20
0:01:08.052,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So to get to the appliances, you need to have power stations.

21
0:01:11.155,000 --> 0:01:13,000
From power stations, you need to have infrastructure,

22
0:01:13.663,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and that infrastructure takes you to the point of having electricity,

23
0:01:16.97,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and you get to the lightbulbs and the appliances

24
0:01:19.233,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that we all take for granted.

25
0:01:20.997,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But the amazing thing, in a way, is that there's a revolution happening

26
0:01:25.003,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in the villages and towns all around us here in East Africa.

27
0:01:28.894,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And the revolution is an echo of the cell phone revolution.

28
0:01:34.457,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's wireless,

29
0:01:36.046,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and that revolution is about solar and it's about distributed solar.

30
0:01:39.634,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Photons are wireless,

31
0:01:40.936,000 --> 0:01:42,000
they fall on every rooftop,

32
0:01:42.996,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and they generate enough power to be sufficient for every household need.

33
0:01:49.123,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So that's an incredible thing.

34
0:01:50.989,000 --> 0:01:51,000
There's also a problem with it.

35
0:01:53.408,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Up until now, the technology hasn't been there to make it happen,

36
0:01:56.528,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and the mindset has been that we have to have the grid

37
0:02:02.346,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to provide industrial growth

38
0:02:04.133,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and let countries develop and create jobs and industrialize.

39
0:02:09.243,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So we've gotten ourselves to the point

40
0:02:12.625,000 --> 0:02:15,000
where actually the costs of building these grids

41
0:02:15.683,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and following that pattern of development

42
0:02:17.665,000 --> 0:02:18,000
are really unsustainable.

43
0:02:20.065,000 --> 0:02:25,000
If you add up the deficits that all of the utilities run in Africa,

44
0:02:25.983,000 --> 0:02:27,000
sub-Saharan Africa,

45
0:02:28.383,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you get to a number of 21 billion dollars every year

46
0:02:32.36,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to maintain that system and keep it going.

47
0:02:35.907,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So an extraordinary amount of resources

48
0:02:37.923,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that's been put in to creating a system

49
0:02:40.225,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that ultimately we will have to wait a very long time for,

50
0:02:44.456,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and when it comes,

51
0:02:46.965,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it often doesn't come with sufficient robustness

52
0:02:49.973,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to allow us to go down that path to development.

53
0:02:52.371,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So what a shame.

54
0:02:54.323,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But here's what's happening,

55
0:02:55.878,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and here's the opportunity that I think we should all get excited about.

56
0:02:59.696,000 --> 0:03:,000
So there's a group of companies

57
0:03:01.57,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that have been chipping away at this problem over the last 10 years,

58
0:03:05.149,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and this group of companies

59
0:03:07.244,000 --> 0:03:11,000
have recognized the reality that there's a great big nuclear reactor

60
0:03:11.269,000 --> 0:03:12,000
up there in the sky,

61
0:03:12.463,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and that Africa is more endowed with that solar power

62
0:03:18.138,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that comes from the sky, the sun,

63
0:03:20.765,000 --> 0:03:21,000
than almost any other continent.

64
0:03:22.657,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So the opportunity has come to convert some of that solar power,

65
0:03:27.472,000 --> 0:03:31,000
wireless power, into energy at the household level.

66
0:03:31.644,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And three things have happened at the same time.

67
0:03:34.153,000 --> 0:03:37,000
First, the costs of solar productivity have come down.

68
0:03:37.422,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So putting a panel on your roof and generating power from it,

69
0:03:40.362,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that cost has absolutely collapsed over the last 30 years,

70
0:03:43.441,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and it's gone down by 95 percent.

71
0:03:46.583,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Second, the appliance network.

72
0:03:49.243,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So the group of appliances that we've all gotten used to,

73
0:03:51.966,000 --> 0:03:54,000
we all want and we all need, we all see as part of our everyday lives

74
0:03:55.371,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that give us health and security,

75
0:03:57.228,000 --> 0:03:59,000
those appliances have come down in cost.

76
0:03:59.315,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So if you take the LED lightbulb, for example, a very simple thing,

77
0:04:02.516,000 --> 0:04:06,000
they're now 85 percent less than they were five years ago,

78
0:04:07.293,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and their efficiency, when you compare them to an incandescent bulb,

79
0:04:12.905,000 --> 0:04:15,000
like the lightbulb I showed in the previous slide,

80
0:04:16.194,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is incredible.

81
0:04:17.384,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They give you 10 times the amount of light,

82
0:04:20.596,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and they last 30 times as long.

83
0:04:22.455,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And then the last thing that's happened is of course the cell phone revolution,

84
0:04:26.216,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so we're piggybacking off the cell phone revolution,

85
0:04:28.693,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and we can now make decentralized customers make small payments

86
0:04:32.272,000 --> 0:04:35,000
for bits of equipment and appliances

87
0:04:35.352,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where actually they're now affordable.

88
0:04:38.048,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We can pay them off over a daily or a weekly schedule.

89
0:04:40.992,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So this is an incredible change in the economy that's happening,

90
0:04:44.054,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and it's really opened up something very, very innovative.

91
0:04:47.372,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So I'm going to introduce you to a lady I met with last week.

92
0:04:50.607,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Her name's Susan.

93
0:04:51.782,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It may not look like it,

94
0:04:53.299,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but Susan is a representative of a $27 billion market.

95
0:04:59.083,000 --> 0:05:02,000
27 billion dollars is what people like Susan spend every year

96
0:05:02.583,000 --> 0:05:05,000
on cell phone charging,

97
0:05:05.646,000 --> 0:05:09,000
flashlight batteries and kerosene to light their homes.

98
0:05:10.31,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So Susan is a proud owner of a small solar system.

99
0:05:14.546,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's a kit rather than a planetary thing,

100
0:05:16.913,000 --> 0:05:17,000
so a small solar system,

101
0:05:18.494,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and her small solar system allows her to have a couple of lightbulbs,

102
0:05:22.406,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and she's made this transition, this jump, from kerosene into light.

103
0:05:26.653,000 --> 0:05:27,000
She has four or five lights and a radio.

104
0:05:28.583,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's fantastic, and she talks about it.

105
0:05:30.507,000 --> 0:05:33,000
She talks about her kids doing homework at night because she has light.

106
0:05:34.249,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I'm not sure what the kids feel about that.

107
0:05:36.273,000 --> 0:05:41,000
She talks about the fact that she can go out at 4am and look after the cows,

108
0:05:41.832,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and she's not so worried,

109
0:05:43.107,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but also, with a little twinkle in her eye,

110
0:05:46.132,000 --> 0:05:5,000
she talks about how light turns her house into a home at night.

111
0:05:50.957,000 --> 0:05:52,000
She's not scared of her own house at night,

112
0:05:53.052,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because it has light in it, and I thought that was amazing.

113
0:05:56.687,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So Susan does something that many customers of these companies

114
0:06:00.164,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that I talked about do,

115
0:06:01.739,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and she forces us to innovate.

116
0:06:03.962,000 --> 0:06:06,000
She challenges companies, saying, "I've got the radio and the lights.

117
0:06:07.463,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You know what? I'd like a TV.

118
0:06:08.913,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I'd like to entertain, educate me and my kids.

119
0:06:14.778,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And then I would like to have some hair clippers for my kids,

120
0:06:17.714,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you know, to cut my kids' hair, and I'd love to have a fridge.

121
0:06:20.676,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And she's coined something

122
0:06:22.669,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that the energy world is really hungry to do.

123
0:06:27.106,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The idea that she's coined is the energy ladder.

124
0:06:29.738,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It starts, again, with a lightbulb. Right?

125
0:06:32.714,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And the lightbulb is an idea that we can get our kids to do homework,

126
0:06:37.501,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and very cheap, about five dollars,

127
0:06:40.08,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and we can get it distributed.

128
0:06:41.93,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But then let's go up from there.

129
0:06:43.637,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is the kit that Susan has:

130
0:06:45.903,000 --> 0:06:48,000
four lightbulbs, radio, maybe a little flashlight,

131
0:06:49.529,000 --> 0:06:51,000
a little solar panel on the roof.

132
0:06:51.578,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And then let's go up again.

133
0:06:53.969,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We can get maybe at about 500 dollars,

134
0:06:58.018,000 --> 0:07:,000
the previous kit was maybe $150,

135
0:07:01.034,000 --> 0:07:02,000
again, paid for over time,

136
0:07:03.01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
two years to pay it all off,

137
0:07:04.519,000 --> 0:07:05,000
you can get the TV,

138
0:07:05.868,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so the lightbulbs and the TV.

139
0:07:08.265,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And you start to ask yourself, "So where is this headed?"

140
0:07:11.398,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Is this headed here,

141
0:07:13.757,000 --> 0:07:15,000
where we can have distributed systems

142
0:07:16.454,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with the right infrastructure to provide power

143
0:07:18.807,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for our hospitals and our schools?

144
0:07:21.268,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And really how far can this go?

145
0:07:23.555,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And this is the mindset shift that I think is really exciting.

146
0:07:27.317,000 --> 0:07:28,000
How far can we go?

147
0:07:29.258,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Could it get up to here?

148
0:07:31.156,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You know, this is the conceptual design for one of the world's biggest factories,

149
0:07:35.727,000 --> 0:07:38,000
designed to be fully solar-powered and fully off grid.

150
0:07:40.032,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Maybe we can get that.

151
0:07:42.794,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So there's a generation of these companies

152
0:07:46.366,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that are out there doing this work and creating thousands of jobs,

153
0:07:52.661,000 --> 0:07:55,000
creating, selling, tens of thousands of these solar systems,

154
0:07:56.539,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so bringing tens of thousands of families into light,

155
0:07:59.486,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and tackling that big $1 billion problem that I talked about at the beginning,

156
0:08:03.27,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and really innovating.

157
0:08:05.675,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And what they're doing is, they're not only energy companies,

158
0:08:09.659,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they're also credit finance companies,

159
0:08:11.612,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so they're bringing people into an economy.

160
0:08:14.46,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They're retail companies,

161
0:08:17.209,000 --> 0:08:2,000
so they're taking products out to people in the connecting markets.

162
0:08:21.15,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And they're appliance companies,

163
0:08:23.679,000 --> 0:08:25,000
so they're developing extraordinary products

164
0:08:25.785,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that are very efficient and very cheap.

165
0:08:29.134,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So an extraordinary thing is happening out there

166
0:08:31.96,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that's worth recognizing.

167
0:08:35.126,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And where does it take us?

168
0:08:36.496,000 --> 0:08:4,000
From a governmental perspective, from a social perspective,

169
0:08:40.983,000 --> 0:08:43,000
it takes us out to two really big goals.

170
0:08:44.147,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We aspire towards energy access for everybody,

171
0:08:47.688,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and we aspire towards a fully-functioning low-carbon economy.

172
0:08:54.035,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And we're getting to the point where we're seeing

173
0:08:56.36,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the fully-functioning low-carbon economy

174
0:08:58.29,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is not just about getting people onto the grid,

175
0:09:03.3,000 --> 0:09:05,000
it's about getting people onto electricity

176
0:09:06.204,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and doing it in a way that's really dignified.

177
0:09:13.248,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So I want us all to picture it for a moment,

178
0:09:16.394,000 --> 0:09:18,000
really picture what this could mean:

179
0:09:18.724,000 --> 0:09:2,000
[New energy ecosystem]

180
0:09:20.983,000 --> 0:09:22,000
an energy system that's not just about subsistence power,

181
0:09:23.972,000 --> 0:09:25,000
getting the family off the kerosene,

182
0:09:26.673,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but it's actually the full suite of appliances and tools

183
0:09:33.204,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and productivity that we've all gotten used to,

184
0:09:36.538,000 --> 0:09:39,000
so actually energy at a scale that can drive industrial development.

185
0:09:41.274,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And it's the ability to have powerful tools.

186
0:09:47.41,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's the ability to be productive in the households, as a farmer,

187
0:09:51.006,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or as a carpenter or as a tailor

188
0:09:53.937,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and get your businesses to work and bring you into the economy.

189
0:09:57.477,000 --> 0:10:,000
And I was working again a couple of days ago with a farmer

190
0:10:00.66,000 --> 0:10:02,000
just outside of Nairobi, small field,

191
0:10:03.49,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and he has an irrigation pump that's run off solar,

192
0:10:06.999,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and he was bragging about how much of a difference it made

193
0:10:10.442,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to his productivity.

194
0:10:12.824,000 --> 0:10:14,000
When we were listening to him, we were asking ourselves,

195
0:10:15.469,000 --> 0:10:17,000
at what point will it be

196
0:10:17.565,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that actually, you will be charging an electric scooter off your rooftop

197
0:10:21.349,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and taking your crops to market

198
0:10:23.38,000 --> 0:10:29,000
with mobility that you've charged yourself, using your own power?

199
0:10:30.516,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And that's an extraordinary thing that's happening,

200
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and if you listen to Susan and Francis,

201
0:10:34.906,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you get to this point where you say,

202
0:10:36.928,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"These guys have this extraordinary sense of dignity

203
0:10:41.167,000 --> 0:10:43,000
about the way they're achieving their power,

204
0:10:43.333,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the sense of ownership and the sense of pride,

205
0:10:46.237,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and I'm going to flip into a little tiny video clip,

206
0:10:49.226,000 --> 0:10:52,000
which is from a distributor of one of these companies that I'm talking about.

207
0:10:52.87,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And he puts it better than anyone I've ever heard it.

208
0:10:55.402,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So just listen to this.

209
0:10:58.743,000 --> 0:11:,000
Martin: So if it does happen that we get to a point

210
0:11:01.727,000 --> 0:11:06,000
where every home has their own independent supply of energy,

211
0:11:06.816,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that will give us the democracy of energy.

212
0:11:09.253,000 --> 0:11:1,000
That's it.

213
0:11:10.514,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And everybody has that choice,

214
0:11:12.31,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and everybody knows when they want to switch it on or off,

215
0:11:15.366,000 --> 0:11:18,000
whether they want to sell access or whether they want to store it.

216
0:11:18.929,000 --> 0:11:21,000
That freedom getting back into the hands of the consumer,

217
0:11:22.376,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that would be the most exciting thing.

218
0:11:27.75,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Amar Inamdar: Brilliant, right? That was Martin,

219
0:11:30.305,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and he has a really wonderful turn of phrase,

220
0:11:32.456,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and what a sense of vision that he captures.

221
0:11:36.467,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So picture that for a moment:

222
0:11:38.892,000 --> 0:11:44,000
every household a proud producer as well as consumer of energy ...

223
0:11:47.905,000 --> 0:11:5,000
the ability to generate power, to share power, to sell power,

224
0:11:51.438,000 --> 0:11:54,000
all coming from your own generating asset sitting on your own property.

225
0:11:56.255,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Maybe even think about crowdsourcing with your neighbors

226
0:11:59.081,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the grid from the ground up,

227
0:12:01.311,000 --> 0:12:04,000
rather than waiting for the government to bring it from the top down.

228
0:12:05.71,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So in Africa, we have this extraordinary opportunity right now,

229
0:12:11.218,000 --> 0:12:13,000
an extraordinary opportunity,

230
0:12:13.676,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to change the world and create an energy system

231
0:12:16.192,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that everybody will be jealous of,

232
0:12:19.711,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and everybody will look to us as the innovators of.

233
0:12:23.834,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And that's the democracy of energy.

234
0:12:27.937,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Thank you very much.

235
0:12:29.112,000 --> 0:12:33,000
(Applause)

236
0:12:33.349,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Chris Anderson: Quick question.

237
0:12:34.929,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So it's a really exciting vision.

238
0:12:36.874,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Help us understand, what are the key roadblocks right now?

239
0:12:39.881,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Like, what could make this go faster?

240
0:12:43.39,000 --> 0:12:47,000
AI: So the first one, I think, is really the intermittency of solar power.

241
0:12:47.524,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So the problem is that the sun only shines for 12 hours a day,

242
0:12:51.278,000 --> 0:12:53,000
so you've got darkness for 12 hours a day,

243
0:12:54.038,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and we need to have storage solutions

244
0:12:56.198,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that are better to help us take us down that path.

245
0:12:58.599,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So storage is really one.

246
0:13:00.273,000 --> 0:13:01,000
CA: And those prices are coming down.

247
0:13:02.103,000 --> 0:13:04,000
AI: And those prices are coming down very quickly.

248
0:13:04.477,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Second, the appliance set.

249
0:13:06.274,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So it needs to get more efficient,

250
0:13:08.005,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and it needs to get more diverse.

251
0:13:09.965,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We need to do more of the things

252
0:13:11.544,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we in Africa want to do with the appliance set.

253
0:13:13.802,000 --> 0:13:14,000
CA: DC appliances.

254
0:13:14.998,000 --> 0:13:15,000
AI: DC appliances,

255
0:13:16.198,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and I think there's a real opportunity there, Chris.

256
0:13:18.652,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I think the opportunity

257
0:13:20.588,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is that we could shift some of these 21 billion dollars of subsidies

258
0:13:25.143,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that governments are spending on the current electricity system

259
0:13:28.389,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and we could promote R&D here in Africa

260
0:13:32.341,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to create some of these products,

261
0:13:34.023,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to be some of these entrepreneurs, and make this happen.

262
0:13:36.85,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So create this new system here.

263
0:13:39.272,000 --> 0:13:41,000
CA: And some of the companies themselves,

264
0:13:41.5,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I mean, there's plenty of demand there.

265
0:13:43.383,000 --> 0:13:45,000
What's holding them back from supplying that demand?

266
0:13:46.326,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I mean, some of them talk about,

267
0:13:47.874,000 --> 0:13:49,000
they would like to sell 10x what they can currently sell.

268
0:13:50.649,000 --> 0:13:52,000
AI: Exactly. So for many of these capitals,

269
0:13:53.391,000 --> 0:13:56,000
it's that markets don't price consumer risk very well,

270
0:13:56.684,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and particularly in markets like ours,

271
0:13:58.94,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in emerging markets and here in Africa.

272
0:14:02.07,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So there's not enough working capital coming into this space

273
0:14:05.534,000 --> 0:14:07,000
because the big financiers look at this space and say,

274
0:14:08.159,000 --> 0:14:11,000
"I don't know how to price that risk, so I'm going to stay away from it."

275
0:14:11.667,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And that's holding a lot of these companies back.

276
0:14:14.052,000 --> 0:14:18,000
CA: Well, it's incredibly exciting to picture what could happen here.

277
0:14:18.219,000 --> 0:14:21,000
In my mind, this might be the biggest leapfrog of them all.

278
0:14:22.007,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And thank you for all you're doing and for sharing that vision

279
0:14:25.013,000 --> 0:14:26,000
so powerfully.

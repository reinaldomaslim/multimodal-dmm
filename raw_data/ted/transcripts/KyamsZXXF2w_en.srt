1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I love video games.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm also slightly in awe of them.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm in awe of their power

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
in terms of imagination, in terms of technology,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in terms of concept.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But I think, above all,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm in awe at their power

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to motivate, to compel us,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to transfix us,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
like really nothing else we've ever invented

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
has quite done before.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
by looking at how we do this.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And in particular, I think we can learn things

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
about learning.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now the video games industry

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is far and away the fastest growing

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of all modern media.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
From about 10 billion in 1990,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and it shows no sign of slowing down.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In four years' time,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That's about three times the recorded music industry.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is pretty stunning,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The thing that really amazes me

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is that, today,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
people spend about

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
eight billion real dollars a year

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
buying virtual items

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that only exist

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
inside video games.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Earlier this year,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
a virtual asteroid in it

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
sold for 330,000 real dollars.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And this

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is a Titan class ship

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in the space game, EVE Online.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And this virtual object

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
takes 200 real people

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
about 56 days of real time to build,

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
plus countless thousands of hours

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of effort before that.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And yet, many of these get built.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
At the other end of the scale,

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the game Farmville that you may well have heard of,

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
has 70 million players

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
around the world

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and most of these players

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
are playing it almost every day.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This may all sound

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
really quite alarming to some people,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
an index of something worrying

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or wrong in society.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But we're here for the good news,

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and the good news is

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that I think we can explore

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
why this very real human effort,

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
this very intense generation of value, is occurring.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And by answering that question,

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I think we can take something

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
extremely powerful away.

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And I think the most interesting way

66
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to think about how all this is going on

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is in terms of rewards.

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And specifically, it's in terms

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of the very intense emotional rewards

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
that playing games offers to people

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
both individually

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and collectively.

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
when they are being engaged,

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
two quite different processes are occurring.

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
On the one hand, there's the wanting processes.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
On the other hand, there's the liking processes,

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
fun and affection

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and delight

81
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.

82
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's a really great image. It's pretty cool.

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,

84
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And this kind of a world,

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
this vast flying beast you can ride around,

87
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
shows why games are so very good

88
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
at doing both the wanting and the liking.

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It gives you great powers.

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's a very great pleasure to fly around.

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And so these combine to form

94
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
a very intense emotional engagement.

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But this isn't the really interesting stuff.

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The really interesting stuff about virtuality

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is what you can measure with it.

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Because what you can measure in virtuality

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is everything.

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Every single thing that every single person

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.

102
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The biggest games in the world today

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
are measuring more than one billion points of data

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
about their players, about what everybody does --

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
far more detail than you'd ever get from any website.

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And this allows something very special

107
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to happen in games.

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's something called the reward schedule.

109
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And by this, I mean looking

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
at what millions upon millions of people have done

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and carefully calibrating the rate,

112
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to keep them engaged

114
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
over staggering amounts of time and effort.

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Now, to try and explain this

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in sort of real terms,

117
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I want to talk about a kind of task

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that might fall to you in so many games.

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Let's say, for the sake of argument,

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
my mission is to get 15 pies

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I can get 15 pies

123
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
by killing these cute, little monsters.

124
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Simple game quest.

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now you can think about this, if you like,

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
as a problem about boxes.

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I've got to keep opening boxes.

128
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I don't know what's inside them until I open them.

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now, if you take a game like Warcraft,

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
you can think about it, if you like,

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as a great box-opening effort.

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
getting better and better stuff in them.

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
This sounds immensely boring

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but games are able

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to make this process

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
incredibly compelling.

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And the way they do this

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is through a combination of probability and data.

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Let's think about probability.

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
If we want to engage someone

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we want to make sure it's neither too easy,

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
nor too difficult, to find a pie.

146
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people --

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers --

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and you work out, if you make the pie rate

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
about 25 percent --

150
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It keeps people engaged.

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies.

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now, I could make a game called Piecraft,

154
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
where all you had to do was get a million pies

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or a thousand pies.

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That would be very boring.

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number.

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You find that -- you know, between five and 20

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is about the right number for keeping people going.

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But we don't just have pies in the boxes.

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There's 100 percent up here.

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
there's something in it, some little reward

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that keeps people progressing and engaged.

165
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In most adventure games,

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But we don't just do that either.

168
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We also say there's going to be loads of other items

169
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
of varying qualities and levels of excitement.

170
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.

171
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance

172
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you get an absolutely awesome item.

173
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And also, we say,

175
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?"

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.

177
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.

178
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So all this is very powerful.

179
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.

180
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So we can do

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
some rather amazing things.

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,

183
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,

184
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.

185
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
They're not rational about probability.

186
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They think this game is unfair.

187
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.

188
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but in a game we can just say, "Right, well.

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now."

191
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do --

192
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
adjust the world to match their expectation.

193
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Our games don't always do this.

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And one thing they certainly do at the moment

195
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,

196
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time

197
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to keep the value, to keep it special.

198
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And the point is really

199
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that we evolved to be satisfied by the world

200
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in particular ways.

201
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years,

202
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we evolved to find certain things stimulating,

203
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and as very intelligent, civilized beings,

204
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.

205
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But now, we can reverse engineer that

206
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and build worlds

207
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.

208
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So what does all this mean in practice?

209
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Well, I've come up

210
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
with seven things

211
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that, I think, show

212
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
how you can take these lessons from games

213
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and use them outside of games.

214
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The first one is very simple:

215
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
experience bars measuring progress --

216
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
something that's been talked about brilliantly

217
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.

218
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.

219
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally

220
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in little bits and pieces,

221
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
you give them one profile character avatar

222
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
which is constantly progressing

223
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.

224
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And everything comes towards that,

225
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.

226
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Second, multiple long and short-term aims --

227
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
5,000 pies, boring,

228
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
15 pies, interesting.

229
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, you give people

230
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
lots and lots of different tasks.

231
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You say, it's about

232
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
doing 10 of these questions,

233
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but another task

234
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is turning up to 20 classes on time,

235
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but another task is collaborating with other people,

236
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
another task is showing you're working five times,

237
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
another task is hitting this particular target.

238
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
You break things down into these calibrated slices

239
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that people can choose and do in parallel

240
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to keep them engaged

241
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and that you can use to point them

242
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
towards individually beneficial activities.

243
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Third, you reward effort.

244
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.

245
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.

246
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort --

247
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick.

248
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.

249
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Fourth, feedback.

250
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This is absolutely crucial,

251
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.

252
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today

253
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that we've been hearing amazing things about,

254
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it's very, very hard for people to learn

255
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if they cannot link consequences to actions.

256
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Pollution, global warming, these things --

257
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the consequences are distant in time and space.

258
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.

259
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But if you can model things for people,

260
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
if you can give things to people that they can manipulate

261
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and play with and where the feedback comes,

262
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
then they can learn a lesson, they can see,

263
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
they can move on, they can understand.

264
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And fifth,

265
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the element of uncertainty.

266
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now this is the neurological goldmine,

267
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
if you like,

268
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
because a known reward

269
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
excites people,

270
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but what really gets them going

271
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is the uncertain reward,

272
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,

273
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.

274
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The 25 percent. This lights the brain up.

275
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And if you think about

276
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
using this in testing,

277
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
in just introducing control elements of randomness

278
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
in all forms of testing and training,

279
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
you can transform the levels of people's engagement

280
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
by tapping into this very powerful

281
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
evolutionary mechanism.

282
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
When we don't quite predict something perfectly,

283
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we get really excited about it.

284
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We just want to go back and find out more.

285
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
As you probably know, the neurotransmitter

286
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
associated with learning is called dopamine.

287
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It's associated with reward-seeking behavior.

288
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen

289
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,

290
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically

291
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
dopamine levels in the brain.

292
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And what this means is we can predict learning,

293
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
we can predict enhanced engagement,

294
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
these windows, these windows of time,

295
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.

296
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And two things really flow from this.

297
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
The first has to do with memory,

298
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that we can find these moments.

299
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
When someone is more likely to remember,

300
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we can give them a nugget in a window.

301
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And the second thing is confidence,

302
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that we can see how game-playing and reward structures

303
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
make people braver, make them more willing to take risks,

304
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
more willing to take on difficulty,

305
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
harder to discourage.

306
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This can all seem very sinister.

307
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts."

308
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The word "addiction" is thrown around.

309
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
There are real concerns there.

310
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people

311
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is other people.

312
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
This is what really excites us.

313
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
In reward terms, it's not money;

314
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
it's not being given cash -- that's nice --

315
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
it's doing stuff with our peers,

316
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
watching us, collaborating with us.

317
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 --

318
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
a video game called EverQuest.

319
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And in this video game,

320
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
there were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them --

321
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.

322
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
That's a problem

323
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
because they dropped two or three decent items.

324
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So players addressed this problem

325
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
by spontaneously coming up with a system

326
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to motivate each other,

327
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
fairly and transparently.

328
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency

329
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
they called "dragon kill points."

330
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And every time you turned up to go on a mission,

331
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
you got paid in dragon kill points.

332
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They tracked these on a separate website.

333
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So they tracked their own private currency,

334
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and then players could bid afterwards

335
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
for cool items they wanted --

336
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
all organized by the players themselves.

337
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,

338
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but that today, a decade on,

339
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
every single video game in the world with this kind of task

340
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
uses a version of this system --

341
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
tens of millions of people.

342
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And the success rate

343
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
is at close to 100 percent.

344
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
This is a player-developed,

345
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
self-enforcing, voluntary currency,

346
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and it's incredibly sophisticated

347
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
player behavior.

348
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And I just want to end by suggesting

349
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
a few ways in which these principles

350
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
could fan out into the world.

351
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Let's start with business.

352
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems

353
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
around something like business are

354
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
recycling and energy conservation.

355
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies

356
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
like real-time energy meters.

357
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I just look at this, and I think, yes,

358
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
we could take that so much further

359
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
by allowing people to set targets

360
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
by setting calibrated targets,

361
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
by using elements of uncertainty,

362
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
by using these multiple targets,

363
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,

364
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
by setting people up

365
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets

366
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to collaborate and compete,

367
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to use these very sophisticated

368
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
group and motivational mechanics we see.

369
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
In terms of education,

370
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
perhaps most obviously of all,

371
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
we can transform how we engage people.

372
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We can offer people the grand continuity

373
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
of experience and personal investment.

374
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We can break things down

375
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
into highly calibrated small tasks.

376
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
We can use calculated randomness.

377
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We can reward effort consistently

378
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
as everything fields together.

379
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
And we can use the kind of group behaviors

380
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that we see evolving when people are at play together,

381
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
these really quite unprecedentedly complex

382
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
cooperative mechanisms.

383
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Government, well, one thing that comes to mind

384
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
is the U.S. government, among others,

385
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
is literally starting to pay people

386
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
to lose weight.

387
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So we're seeing financial reward being used

388
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to tackle the great issue of obesity.

389
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But again, those rewards

390
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
could be calibrated so precisely

391
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
if we were able to use the vast expertise

392
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,

393
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
to take the data, to take the observations,

394
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
of millions of human hours

395
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and plow that feedback

396
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
into increasing engagement.

397
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And in the end, it's this word, "engagement,"

398
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that I want to leave you with.

399
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
It's about how individual engagement

400
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
can be transformed

401
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
by the psychological and the neurological lessons

402
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
we can learn from watching people that are playing games.

403
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But it's also about collective engagement

404
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and about the unprecedented laboratory

405
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
for observing what makes people tick

406
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and work and play and engage

407
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
on a grand scale in games.

408
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And if we can look at these things and learn from them

409
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and see how to turn them outwards,

410
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.

411
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Thank you very much.

412
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Applause)

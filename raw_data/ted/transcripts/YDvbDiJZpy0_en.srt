2
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How many of you have used an electronic spreadsheet,

3
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
like Microsoft Excel?

4
0:00:18.24,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Very good.

5
0:00:19.52,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now, how many of you have run a business with a spreadsheet by hand,

6
0:00:24.12,000 --> 0:00:27,000
like my dad did for his small printing business in Philadelphia?

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
A lot less.

8
0:00:29.92,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Well, that's the way it was done for hundreds of years.

9
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:36,000
In early 1978, I started working on an idea

10
0:00:36.52,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that eventually became VisiCalc.

11
0:00:39.48,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And the next year it shipped

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
running on something new called an Apple II personal computer.

13
0:00:45.24,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You could tell that things had really changed when, six years later,

14
0:00:49.32,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the Wall Street Journal ran an editorial

15
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that assumed you knew what VisiCalc was and maybe even were using it.

16
0:00:55.76,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Steve Jobs back in 1990

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
said that "spreadsheets propelled the industry forward."

18
0:01:02.88,000 --> 0:01:05,000
"VisiCalc propelled the success of Apple more than any other single event."

19
0:01:07.44,000 --> 0:01:08,000
On a more personal note,

20
0:01:09.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Steve said, "If VisiCalc had been written for some other computer,

21
0:01:12.76,000 --> 0:01:14,000
you'd be interviewing somebody else right now."

22
0:01:15.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So, VisiCalc was instrumental in getting personal computers on business desks.

23
0:01:21.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
How did it come about?

24
0:01:23.68,000 --> 0:01:25,000
What was it? What did I go through to make it be what it was?

25
0:01:27.92,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Well, I first learned to program back in 1966, when I was 15 --

26
0:01:33.28,000 --> 0:01:35,000
just a couple months after this photo was taken.

27
0:01:36.2,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Few high schoolers had access to computers in those days.

28
0:01:39.56,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But through luck and an awful lot of perseverance,

29
0:01:43.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I was able to get computer time around the city.

30
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
After sleeping in the mud at Woodstock, I went off to MIT to go to college,

31
0:01:51.52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
where to make money, I worked on the Multics Project.

32
0:01:55.32,000 --> 0:02:,000
Multics was a trailblazing interactive time-sharing system.

33
0:02:00.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Have you heard of the Linux and Unix operating systems?

34
0:02:03.56,000 --> 0:02:04,000
They came from Multics.

35
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I worked on the Multics versions

36
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of what are known as interpreted computer languages,

37
0:02:11.48,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that are used by people in noncomputer fields

38
0:02:13.96,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to do their calculations while seated at a computer terminal.

39
0:02:17.56,000 --> 0:02:19,000
After I graduated from MIT,

40
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I went to work for Digital Equipment Corporation.

41
0:02:23.32,000 --> 0:02:26,000
At DEC, I worked on software

42
0:02:26.52,000 --> 0:02:28,000
for the new area of computerized typesetting.

43
0:02:29.8,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I helped newspapers replace their reporters' typewriters

44
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
with computer terminals.

45
0:02:35.88,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'd write software

46
0:02:37.12,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and then I'd go out in the field to places like the Kansas City Star,

47
0:02:40.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
where I would train users and get feedback.

48
0:02:43.28,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This was real-world experience

49
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that is quite different than what I saw in the lab at MIT.

50
0:02:49.88,000 --> 0:02:51,000
After that, I was project leader

51
0:02:52.52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of the software for DEC's first word processor, again a new field.

52
0:02:57.72,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Like with typesetting, the important thing was crafting a user interface

53
0:03:03.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that was both natural and efficient for noncomputer people to use.

54
0:03:08.36,000 --> 0:03:11,000
After I was at DEC, I went to work for a small company

55
0:03:12.36,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that made microprocessor-based electronic cash registers for the fast-food industry.

56
0:03:19.36,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But I had always wanted to start a company with my friend Bob Frankston

57
0:03:23.08,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that I met on the Multics project at MIT.

58
0:03:25.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So I decided to go back to school to learn as much as I could about business.

59
0:03:29.2,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And in the fall of 1977,

60
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I entered the MBA program at Harvard Business School.

61
0:03:35.84,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I was one of the few percentage of students

62
0:03:38.36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
who had a background in computer programming.

63
0:03:42.08,000 --> 0:03:45,000
There's a picture of me from the yearbook sitting in the front row.

64
0:03:45.28,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:46.32,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, at Harvard, we learned by the case method.

66
0:03:48.96,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We'd do about three cases a day.

67
0:03:50.92,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Cases consist of up to a few dozen pages describing particular business situations.

68
0:03:57.6,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They often have exhibits, and exhibits often have words and numbers

69
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:05,000
laid out in ways that make sense for the particular situation.

70
0:04:05.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They're usually all somewhat different.

71
0:04:07.8,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Here's my homework.

72
0:04:09.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Again, numbers, words, laid out in ways that made sense.

73
0:04:12.24,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Lots of calculations -- we got really close to our calculators.

74
0:04:16.72,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In fact, here's my calculator.

75
0:04:20.2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
For Halloween, I went dressed up as a calculator.

76
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:25.785,000 --> 0:04:28,000
At the beginning of each class, the professor would call on somebody

78
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to present the case.

79
0:04:31.079,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What they would do is they would explain what was going on

80
0:04:33.88,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and then dictate information that the professor would transcribe

81
0:04:37.64,000 --> 0:04:39,000
onto the many motorized blackboards in the front of the class,

82
0:04:40.569,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and then we'd have a discussion.

83
0:04:42.12,000 --> 0:04:46,000
One of the really frustrating things is when you've done all your homework,

84
0:04:46.6,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you come in the next day only to find out that you made an error

85
0:04:49.64,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and all of the other numbers you did were wrong.

86
0:04:52.2,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And you couldn't participate as well.

87
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And we were marked by class participation.

88
0:04:57.32,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, sitting there with 87 other people in the class, I got to daydream a lot.

89
0:05:03.28,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Most programmers in those days worked on mainframes,

90
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
building things like inventory systems, payroll systems and bill-paying systems.

91
0:05:13.52,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But I had worked on interactive word processing

92
0:05:16.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and on-demand personal computation.

93
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Instead of thinking about paper printouts and punch cards,

94
0:05:22.88,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I imagined a magic blackboard

95
0:05:25.68,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that if you erased one number and wrote a new thing in,

96
0:05:29.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
all of the other numbers would automatically change,

97
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:32,000
like word processing with numbers.

98
0:05:34.6,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I imagined that my calculator had mouse hardware on the bottom of it

99
0:05:39.24,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and a head-up display, like in a fighter plane.

100
0:05:42.72,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And I could type some numbers in, and circle it, and press the sum button.

101
0:05:46.88,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And right in the middle of a negotiation I'd be able to get the answer.

102
0:05:50.64,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Now I just had to take my fantasy and turn it into reality.

103
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:56,000
My father taught me about prototyping.

104
0:05:57.56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He showed me mock-ups

105
0:05:59.2,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that he'd make to figure out the placement on the page

106
0:06:02.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
for the things for brochures that he was printing.

107
0:06:05.12,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And he'd use it to get feedback from customers

108
0:06:08.08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and OKs before he sent the job off to the presses.

109
0:06:12.44,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The act of making a simple, working version of what you're trying to build

110
0:06:17.56,000 --> 0:06:19,000
forces you to uncover key problems.

111
0:06:20.72,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And it lets you find solutions to those problems much less expensively.

112
0:06:25.72,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So I decided to build a prototype.

113
0:06:28.76,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I went to a video terminal connected to Harvard's time-sharing system

114
0:06:33.36,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and got to work.

115
0:06:34.88,000 --> 0:06:37,000
One of the first problems that I ran into was:

116
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
How do you represent values in formulas?

117
0:06:41.28,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Let me show you what I mean.

118
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I thought that you would point somewhere,

119
0:06:46.2,000 --> 0:06:49,000
type in some words, then type in some somewhere else,

120
0:06:49.32,000 --> 0:06:52,000
put in some numbers and some more numbers, point where you want the answer.

121
0:06:53.24,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And then point to the first, press minus, point to the second,

122
0:06:56.48,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and get the result.

123
0:06:58.36,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The problem was: What should I put in the formula?

124
0:07:01.8,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It had to be something the computer knew what to put in.

125
0:07:04.444,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And if you looked at the formula,

126
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you needed to know where on the screen it referred to.

127
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The first thing I thought was the programmer way of doing it.

128
0:07:12.76,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The first time you pointed to somewhere,

129
0:07:14.689,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the computer would ask you to type in a unique name.

130
0:07:18.76,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It became pretty clear pretty fast that that was going to be too tedious.

131
0:07:22.56,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The computer had to automatically make up the name and put it inside.

132
0:07:26.6,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So I thought, why not make it be the order in which you create them?

133
0:07:31.48,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I tried that. Value 1, value 2.

134
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Pretty quickly I saw that if you had more than a few values

135
0:07:36.786,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you'd never remember on the screen where things were.

136
0:07:39.32,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Then I said, why not instead of allowing you to put values anywhere,

137
0:07:44.64,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I'll restrict you to a grid?

138
0:07:46.72,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Then when you pointed to a cell,

139
0:07:48.96,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the computer could put the row and column in as a name.

140
0:07:52.64,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And, if I did it like a map and put ABC across the top and numbers along the side,

141
0:07:58.84,000 --> 0:08:,000
if you saw B7 in a formula,

142
0:08:01.76,000 --> 0:08:03,000
you'd know exactly where it was on the screen.

143
0:08:04.64,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And if you had to type the formula in yourself, you'd know what to do.

144
0:08:09.44,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Restricting you to a grid helped solve my problem.

145
0:08:13.2,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It also opened up new capabilities, like the ability to have ranges of cells.

146
0:08:19.36,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But it wasn't too restrictive --

147
0:08:20.96,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you could still put any value, any formula, in any cell.

148
0:08:26.12,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And that's the way we do it to this day, almost 40 years later.

149
0:08:31.109,000 --> 0:08:34,000
My friend Bob and I decided that we were going to build this product together.

150
0:08:34.8,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I did more work figuring out exactly how the program was supposed to behave.

151
0:08:39.24,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I wrote a reference card to act as documentation.

152
0:08:42.52,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It also helped me ensure that the user interface I was defining

153
0:08:47.32,000 --> 0:08:5,000
could be explained concisely and clearly to regular people.

154
0:08:51.52,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Bob worked in the attic of the apartment he rented in Arlington, Massachusetts.

155
0:08:56.96,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This is the inside of the attic.

156
0:09:00.24,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Bob bought time on the MIT Multics System

157
0:09:03.04,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to write computer code on a terminal like this.

158
0:09:06.4,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And then he would download test versions to a borrowed Apple II

159
0:09:09.92,000 --> 0:09:12,000
over a phone line using an acoustic coupler,

160
0:09:13.2,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and then we would test.

161
0:09:14.92,000 --> 0:09:18,000
For one of these tests I prepared for this case about the Pepsi Challenge.

162
0:09:20.72,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Print wasn't working yet, so I had to copy everything down.

163
0:09:24.48,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Save wasn't working, so every time it crashed,

164
0:09:26.92,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I had to type in all of the formulas again, over and over again.

165
0:09:30.24,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The next day in class, I raised my hand; I got called on, and I presented the case.

166
0:09:34.24,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I did five-year projections. I did all sorts of different scenarios.

167
0:09:37.84,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I aced the case. VisiCalc was already useful.

168
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The professor said, "How did you do it?"

169
0:09:45.469,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Well, I didn't want to tell him about our secret program.

170
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:50.2,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So I said, "I took this and added this

172
0:09:52.08,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and multiplied by this and subtracted that."

173
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He said, "Well, why didn't you use a ratio?"

174
0:09:56.32,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I said, "Hah! A ratio -- that wouldn't have been as exact!"

175
0:09:59.36,000 --> 0:10:01,000
What I didn't say was, "Divide isn't working yet."

176
0:10:01.96,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Laughter)

177
0:10:05.08,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Eventually, though, we did finish enough of VisiCalc

178
0:10:08.96,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to be able to show it to the public.

179
0:10:11.44,000 --> 0:10:12,000
My dad printed up a sample reference card

180
0:10:13.44,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that we could use as marketing material.

181
0:10:16.28,000 --> 0:10:21,000
In June of 1979, our publisher announced VisiCalc to the world,

182
0:10:22.08,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in a small booth at the giant National Computer Conference in New York City.

183
0:10:26.8,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The New York Times had a humorous article about the conference.

184
0:10:31.48,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"The machines perform what seem religious rites ...

185
0:10:33.96,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Even as the believers gather,

186
0:10:35.365,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the painters in the Coliseum sign room are adding to the pantheon,

187
0:10:38.485,000 --> 0:10:41,000
carefully lettering 'VISICALC' in giant black on yellow.

188
0:10:41.68,000 --> 0:10:42,000
All hail VISICALC!"

189
0:10:43.52,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Gasp) New York Times: "All hail VISICALC."

190
0:10:47.12,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

191
0:10:48.64,000 --> 0:10:52,000
That was the last mention of the electronic spreadsheet

192
0:10:52.92,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in the popular business press for about two years.

193
0:10:56.84,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Most people didn't get it yet.

194
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:,000
But some did.

195
0:11:00.92,000 --> 0:11:04,000
In October of 1979, we shipped VisiCalc.

196
0:11:05.88,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It came in packaging that looked like this.

197
0:11:08.72,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And it looked like this running on the Apple II.

198
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And the rest, as they say, is history.

199
0:11:14.36,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now, there's an awful lot more to this story,

200
0:11:16.48,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but that'll have to wait for another day.

201
0:11:18.56,000 --> 0:11:2,000
One thing, though, Harvard remembers.

202
0:11:21.4,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Here's that classroom.

203
0:11:23.24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
They put up a plaque to commemorate what happened there.

204
0:11:27.64,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

205
0:11:36.4,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But it also serves as a reminder

206
0:11:39.36,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that you, too, should take your unique backgrounds, skills and needs

207
0:11:44.88,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and build prototypes to discover and work out the key problems,

208
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and through that, change the world.

209
0:11:53.04,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Thank you.

210
0:11:54.28,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Applause)

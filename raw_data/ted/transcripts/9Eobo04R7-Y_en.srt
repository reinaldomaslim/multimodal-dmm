1
0:00:12.9,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I turned 19, I started my career

2
0:00:15.555,000 --> 0:00:17,000
as the first female photojournalist

3
0:00:17.985,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the Gaza Strip, Palestine.

4
0:00:21.18,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My work as a woman photographer

5
0:00:23.294,000 --> 0:00:25,000
was considered a serious insult

6
0:00:25.398,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to local traditions,

7
0:00:27.153,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and created a lasting stigma

8
0:00:29.201,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for me and my family.

9
0:00:32.01,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The male-dominated field made my presence

10
0:00:35.022,000 --> 0:00:38,000
unwelcome by all possible means.

11
0:00:38.092,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They made clear that a woman

12
0:00:39.81,000 --> 0:00:41,000
must not do a man's job.

13
0:00:42.407,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Photo agencies in Gaza refused to train me

14
0:00:44.747,000 --> 0:00:46,000
because of my gender.

15
0:00:47.21,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The "No" sign was pretty clear.

16
0:00:49.933,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Three of my colleagues

17
0:00:51.304,000 --> 0:00:55,000
went as far as to drive me to an open air strike area

18
0:00:56.18,000 --> 0:00:57,000
where the explosion sounds

19
0:00:58.156,000 --> 0:01:,000
were the only thing I could hear.

20
0:01:00.451,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Dust was flying in the air,

21
0:01:02.566,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the ground was shaking like a swing beneath me.

22
0:01:06.525,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I only realized we weren't there to document the event

23
0:01:09.878,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when the three of them got back into the armored Jeep

24
0:01:12.848,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and drove away, waving and laughing,

25
0:01:15.502,000 --> 0:01:19,000
leaving me behind in the open air strike zone.

26
0:01:20.351,000 --> 0:01:23,000
For a moment, I felt terrified,

27
0:01:23.388,000 --> 0:01:27,000
humiliated, and sorry for myself.

28
0:01:27.623,000 --> 0:01:29,000
My colleagues' action was not

29
0:01:29.687,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the only death threat I have received,

30
0:01:32.354,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but it was the most dangerous one.

31
0:01:36.392,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The perception of women's life in Gaza

32
0:01:39.407,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is passive.

33
0:01:41.387,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Until a recent time, a lot of women were not allowed

34
0:01:44.747,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to work or pursue education.

35
0:01:47.717,000 --> 0:01:5,000
At times of such doubled war including

36
0:01:50.788,000 --> 0:01:52,000
both social restrictions on women

37
0:01:52.97,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,

38
0:01:55.954,000 --> 0:01:59,000
women's dark and bright stories were fading away.

39
0:01:59.972,000 --> 0:02:01,000
To men, women's stories were seen

40
0:02:02.3,000 --> 0:02:03,000
as inconsequential.

41
0:02:04.257,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I started paying closer attention

42
0:02:07.329,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to women's lives in Gaza.

43
0:02:09.366,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Because of my gender, I had access

44
0:02:12.065,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to worlds where my colleagues were forbidden.

45
0:02:16.643,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Beyond the obvious pain and struggle,

46
0:02:19.077,000 --> 0:02:2,000
there was a healthy dose

47
0:02:20.862,000 --> 0:02:22,000
of laughter and accomplishments.

48
0:02:23.682,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In front of a police compound in Gaza City

49
0:02:27.201,000 --> 0:02:3,000
during the first war in Gaza,

50
0:02:30.24,000 --> 0:02:33,000
an Israeli air raid managed to destroy the compound

51
0:02:33.593,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and break my nose.

52
0:02:35.74,000 --> 0:02:39,000
For a moment, all I saw was white, bright white,

53
0:02:40.351,000 --> 0:02:42,000
like these lights.

54
0:02:42.848,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I thought to myself I either got blind

55
0:02:46.211,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or I was in heaven.

56
0:02:49.1,000 --> 0:02:52,000
By the time I managed to open my eyes,

57
0:02:52.32,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I had documented this moment.

58
0:02:56.531,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Mohammed Khader, a Palestinian worker

59
0:02:58.874,000 --> 0:03:01,000
who spent two decades in Israel,

60
0:03:02.043,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as his retirement plan,

61
0:03:03.936,000 --> 0:03:06,000
he decided to build a four-floor house,

62
0:03:07.266,000 --> 0:03:11,000
only by the first field operation at his neighborhood,

63
0:03:11.563,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the house was flattened to the ground.

64
0:03:14.995,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Nothing was left but the pigeons he raised

65
0:03:18.544,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and a jacuzzi, a bathtub

66
0:03:21.709,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that he got from Tel Aviv.

67
0:03:23.953,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Mohammed got the bathtub

68
0:03:25.75,000 --> 0:03:26,000
on the top of the rubble

69
0:03:27.516,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and started giving his kids

70
0:03:30.14,000 --> 0:03:34,000
an every morning bubble bath.

71
0:03:34.198,000 --> 0:03:37,000
My work is not meant to hide the scars of war,

72
0:03:37.46,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but to show the full frame

73
0:03:39.541,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of unseen stories of Gazans.

74
0:03:42.748,000 --> 0:03:45,000
As a Palestinian female photographer,

75
0:03:46.122,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the journey of struggle, survival and everyday life

76
0:03:50.83,000 --> 0:03:53,000
has inspired me to overcome the community taboo

77
0:03:54.151,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and see a different side of war and its aftermath.

78
0:03:59.318,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I became a witness with a choice:

79
0:04:03.39,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to run away or stand still.

80
0:04:07.17,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Thank you.

81
0:04:09.408,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.12,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like you to imagine the world anew.

2
0:00:17.84,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'd like to show you some maps,

3
0:00:20.039,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which have been drawn by Ben Hennig,

4
0:00:22.8,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of the planet in a way

5
0:00:24.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that most of you will never have seen the planet depicted before.

6
0:00:30.48,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Here's an image that you're very familiar with.

7
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm old enough that I was actually born before we saw this image.

8
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Apparently some of my first words were "moona, moona,"

9
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but I think that's my mom having a particular fantasy

10
0:00:44.28,000 --> 0:00:46,000
about what her baby boy could see

11
0:00:46.56,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on the flickering black and white TV screen.

12
0:00:51.68,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's only been a few centuries

13
0:00:53.32,000 --> 0:00:56,000
since we've actually, most of us, thought of our planet as spherical.

14
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
When we first saw these images in the 1960s,

15
0:01:01.24,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the world was changing at an incredible rate.

16
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In my own little discipline of human geography,

17
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
a cartographer called Waldo Tobler

18
0:01:13.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
was drawing new maps of the planet,

19
0:01:15.92,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and these maps have now spread,

20
0:01:17.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and I'm going to show you one of them now.

21
0:01:20.2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This map is a map of the world,

22
0:01:23.72,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but it's a map which looks to you

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a little bit strange.

24
0:01:28.2,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's a map in which we stretched places,

25
0:01:32.04,000 --> 0:01:36,000
so that those areas which contain many people are drawn larger,

26
0:01:36.76,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and those areas, like the Sahara and the Himalayas,

27
0:01:39.72,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in which there are few people, have been shrunk away.

28
0:01:42.76,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Everybody on the planet is given an equal amount of space.

29
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The cities are shown shining bright.

30
0:01:50.68,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The lines are showing you submarine cables and trade routes.

31
0:01:54.28,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And there's one particular line that goes from the Chinese port of Dalian

32
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:01:58,000
through past Singapore,

33
0:01:59.68,000 --> 0:02:,000
through the Suez Canal,

34
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:03,000
through the Mediterranean and round to Rotterdam.

35
0:02:03.8,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And it's showing you the route

36
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of what was the world's largest ship just a year ago,

37
0:02:09.28,000 --> 0:02:15,000
a ship which was taking so many containers of goods

38
0:02:15.32,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that when they were unloaded,

39
0:02:17.2,000 --> 0:02:21,000
if the lorries had all gone in convoy, they would have been 100 kilometers long.

40
0:02:22.68,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is how our world is now connected.

41
0:02:25.44,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is the quantity of stuff we are now moving around the world,

42
0:02:31.44,000 --> 0:02:33,000
just on one ship, on one voyage,

43
0:02:34.2,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in five weeks.

44
0:02:38.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We've lived in cities for a very long time,

45
0:02:41.64,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but most of us didn't live in cities.

46
0:02:43.88,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This is Çatalhöyük, one of the world's first cities.

47
0:02:47.04,000 --> 0:02:5,000
At its peak 9,000 years ago,

48
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
people had to walk over the roofs of others' houses to get to their home.

49
0:02:58.08,000 --> 0:03:01,000
If you look carefully at the map of the city,

50
0:03:01.4,000 --> 0:03:02,000
you'll see it has no streets,

51
0:03:04.28,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because streets are something we invented.

52
0:03:07.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The world changes.

53
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It changes by trial and error.

54
0:03:13.4,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We work out slowly and gradually

55
0:03:16.32,000 --> 0:03:17,000
how to live in better ways.

56
0:03:19.48,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And the world has changed incredibly quickly most recently.

57
0:03:25.6,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's only within the last six, seven, or eight generations

58
0:03:29.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that we have actually realized that we are a species.

59
0:03:33.84,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's only within the last few decades

60
0:03:37.24,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that a map like this could be drawn.

61
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Again, the underlying map is the map of world population,

62
0:03:47.56,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but over it, you're seeing arrows showing how we spread out of Africa

63
0:03:53.24,000 --> 0:03:56,000
with dates showing you where we think we arrived

64
0:03:57.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
at particular times.

65
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I have to redraw this map every few months,

66
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because somebody makes a discovery that a particular date was wrong.

67
0:04:08.56,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We are learning about ourselves at an incredible speed.

68
0:04:15.6,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And we're changing.

69
0:04:18.64,000 --> 0:04:2,000
A lot of change is gradual.

70
0:04:20.92,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's accretion.

71
0:04:22.44,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We don't notice the change

72
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because we only have short lives,

73
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
70, 80, if you're lucky 90 years.

74
0:04:30.56,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This graph is showing you

75
0:04:32.6,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the annual rate of population growth in the world.

76
0:04:36.12,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It was very low until around about 1850,

77
0:04:40.08,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and then the rate of population growth

78
0:04:42.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
began to rise

79
0:04:44.84,000 --> 0:04:46,000
so that around the time I was born,

80
0:04:46.88,000 --> 0:04:5,000
when we first saw those images from the moon of our planet,

81
0:04:52.64,000 --> 0:04:55,000
our global population was growing at two percent a year.

82
0:04:57.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
If it had carried on growing at two percent a year

83
0:05:02.6,000 --> 0:05:04,000
for just another couple of centuries,

84
0:05:06.56,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the entire planet would be covered

85
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with a seething mass of human bodies

86
0:05:11.92,000 --> 0:05:13,000
all touching each other.

87
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And people were scared.

88
0:05:16.84,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They were scared of population growth

89
0:05:18.68,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and what they called "the population bomb" in 1968.

90
0:05:22.04,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But then, if you look at the end of the graph,

91
0:05:25.24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the growth began to slow.

92
0:05:28.72,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The decade --

93
0:05:30.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the '70s, the '80s, the '90s, the noughties,

94
0:05:33.6,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and in this decade, even faster --

95
0:05:36.6,000 --> 0:05:37,000
our population growth is slowing.

96
0:05:38.24,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Our planet is stabilizing.

97
0:05:39.52,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We are heading towards nine, 10, or 11 billion people

98
0:05:42.56,000 --> 0:05:43,000
by the end of the century.

99
0:05:44.4,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Within that change, you can see tumult.

100
0:05:47.76,000 --> 0:05:48,000
You can see the Second World War.

101
0:05:49.6,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You can see the pandemic in 1918 from influenza.

102
0:05:53.8,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You can see the great Chinese famine.

103
0:05:56.4,000 --> 0:05:58,000
These are the events we tend to concentrate on.

104
0:05:58.72,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We tend to concentrate on the terrible events in the news.

105
0:06:02.68,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We don't tend to concentrate on the gradual change

106
0:06:06.36,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and the good news stories.

107
0:06:09.48,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We worry about people.

108
0:06:11.2,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We worry about how many people there are.

109
0:06:13.48,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We worry about how you can get away from people.

110
0:06:17.2,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But this is the map of the world changed again to make area large,

111
0:06:21.76,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the further away people are from each area.

112
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So if you want to know where to go to get away from everybody,

113
0:06:30.12,000 --> 0:06:32,000
here's the best places to go.

114
0:06:32.72,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And every year, these areas get bigger,

115
0:06:35.56,000 --> 0:06:38,000
because every year, we are coming off the land globally.

116
0:06:38.84,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We are moving into the cities.

117
0:06:40.32,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We are packing in more densely.

118
0:06:42.52,000 --> 0:06:43,000
There are wolves again in Europe,

119
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and the wolves are moving west across the continent.

120
0:06:49.2,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Our world is changing.

121
0:06:52.92,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You have worries.

122
0:06:55.68,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This is a map showing where the water falls on our planet.

123
0:07:00.6,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We now know that.

124
0:07:02.32,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And you can look at where Çatalhöyük was,

125
0:07:06.12,000 --> 0:07:08,000
where three continents meet, Africa, Asia, and Europe,

126
0:07:08.72,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and you can see there are a large number of people living there

127
0:07:11.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in areas with very little water.

128
0:07:13.32,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And you can see areas in which there is a great deal of rainfall as well.

129
0:07:17.04,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And we can get a bit more sophisticated.

130
0:07:20.44,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Instead of making the map be shaped by people,

131
0:07:23.84,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we can shape the map by water,

132
0:07:26.08,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and then we can change it every month

133
0:07:27.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to show the amount of water

134
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:32,000
falling on every small part of the globe.

135
0:07:33.92,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And you see the monsoons moving around the planet,

136
0:07:37.24,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the planet almost appears to have a heartbeat.

137
0:07:41.72,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And all of this only became possible

138
0:07:46.92,000 --> 0:07:47,000
within my lifetime

139
0:07:48.72,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to see this is where we are living.

140
0:07:52.64,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We have enough water.

141
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This is a map of where we grow our food in the world.

142
0:08:01.28,000 --> 0:08:05,000
This is the areas that we will rely on most for rice and maize and corn.

143
0:08:07.76,000 --> 0:08:09,000
People worry that there won't be enough food, but we know,

144
0:08:10.64,000 --> 0:08:14,000
if we just ate less meat and fed less of the crops to animals,

145
0:08:15.44,000 --> 0:08:17,000
there is enough food for everybody

146
0:08:17.88,000 --> 0:08:21,000
as long as we think of ourselves as one group of people.

147
0:08:24.12,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And we also know

148
0:08:27.28,000 --> 0:08:29,000
about what we do

149
0:08:29.36,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so terribly badly nowadays.

150
0:08:33.48,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You will have seen this map of the world before.

151
0:08:39.48,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is the map

152
0:08:41.44,000 --> 0:08:44,000
produced by taking satellite images,

153
0:08:44.84,000 --> 0:08:46,000
if you remember those satellites around the planet

154
0:08:47.64,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in the very first slide I showed,

155
0:08:51.24,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and producing an image of what the Earth looks like at night.

156
0:08:55.72,000 --> 0:08:56,000
When you normally see that map,

157
0:08:57.64,000 --> 0:09:,000
on a normal map, the kind of map that most of you will be used to,

158
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you think you are seeing a map of where people live.

159
0:09:06.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Where the lights are shining up is where people live.

160
0:09:09.32,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But here, on this image of the world,

161
0:09:13.72,000 --> 0:09:14,000
remember we've stretched the map again.

162
0:09:17.32,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Everywhere has the same density of people on this map.

163
0:09:22.48,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If an area doesn't have people,

164
0:09:24.68,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we've shrunk it away

165
0:09:26.6,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to make it disappear.

166
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So we're showing everybody

167
0:09:30.32,000 --> 0:09:31,000
with equal prominence.

168
0:09:33.32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now, the lights no longer show you where people are,

169
0:09:36.64,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because people are everywhere.

170
0:09:39.12,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now the lights on the map,

171
0:09:41.08,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the lights in London, the lights in Cairo, the lights in Tokyo,

172
0:09:44.08,000 --> 0:09:46,000
the lights on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States,

173
0:09:47.04,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the lights show you where people live

174
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
who are so profligate with energy

175
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that they can afford

176
0:09:55.68,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to spend money

177
0:09:57.24,000 --> 0:10:,000
powering lights to shine up into the sky,

178
0:10:00.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
so satellites can draw an image like this.

179
0:10:04.84,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And the areas that are dark on the map

180
0:10:07.72,000 --> 0:10:1,000
are either areas where people do not have access to that much energy,

181
0:10:12.4,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or areas where people do,

182
0:10:14.52,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but they have learned to stop shining the light up into the sky.

183
0:10:19.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And if I could show you this map animated over time,

184
0:10:23.52,000 --> 0:10:26,000
you would see that Tokyo has actually become darker,

185
0:10:27.12,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because ever since the tsunami in Japan,

186
0:10:30.88,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Japan has had to rely on a quarter less electricity

187
0:10:33.32,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because it turned the nuclear power stations off.

188
0:10:37.24,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And the world didn't end.

189
0:10:39.4,000 --> 0:10:41,000
You just shone less light

190
0:10:41.6,000 --> 0:10:42,000
up into the sky.

191
0:10:45.32,000 --> 0:10:47,000
There are a huge number

192
0:10:48.32,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of good news stories in the world.

193
0:10:51.88,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Infant mortality is falling

194
0:10:55.32,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and has been falling at an incredible rate.

195
0:10:59.92,000 --> 0:11:,000
A few years ago,

196
0:11:02.24,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the number of babies dying in their first year of life in the world

197
0:11:06.2,000 --> 0:11:09,000
fell by five percent in just one year.

198
0:11:11.6,000 --> 0:11:13,000
More children are going to school

199
0:11:14.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and learning to read and write

200
0:11:16.76,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and getting connected to the Internet

201
0:11:19.6,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and going on to go to university

202
0:11:22.64,000 --> 0:11:25,000
than ever before at an incredible rate,

203
0:11:26.56,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and the highest number of young people going to university in the world

204
0:11:32.04,000 --> 0:11:33,000
are women, not men.

205
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I can give you good news story after good news story

206
0:11:39.08,000 --> 0:11:41,000
about what is getting better in the planet,

207
0:11:41.72,000 --> 0:11:43,000
but we tend to concentrate

208
0:11:45.88,000 --> 0:11:47,000
on the bad news that is immediate.

209
0:11:48.64,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Rebecca Solnit, I think, put it brilliantly,

210
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
when she explained: "The accretion of incremental, imperceptible changes

211
0:11:58.52,000 --> 0:12:,000
which can constitute progress and which render our era

212
0:12:01.36,000 --> 0:12:03,000
dramatically different from the past" --

213
0:12:04.2,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the past was much more stable --

214
0:12:07.64,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"a contrast obscured by the undramatic nature of gradual transformation,

215
0:12:12.64,000 --> 0:12:14,000
punctuated by occasional tumult."

216
0:12:16.32,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Occasionally, terrible things happen.

217
0:12:19.44,000 --> 0:12:21,000
You are shown those terrible things

218
0:12:22.2,000 --> 0:12:25,000
on the news every night of the week.

219
0:12:25.88,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You are not told about the population slowing down.

220
0:12:29.88,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You are not told about the world becoming more connected.

221
0:12:32.92,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You are not told about the incredible improvements in understanding.

222
0:12:36.6,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You are not told about how we are learning to begin

223
0:12:39.76,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to waste less and consume less.

224
0:12:42.24,000 --> 0:12:43,000
This is my last map.

225
0:12:44.36,000 --> 0:12:46,000
On this map, we have taken the seas

226
0:12:46.76,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and the oceans out.

227
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now you are just looking

228
0:12:51.52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
at about 7.4 billion people

229
0:12:55.4,000 --> 0:12:57,000
with the map drawn in proportion to those people.

230
0:12:59.24,000 --> 0:13:01,000
You're looking at over a billion in China,

231
0:13:01.32,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and you can see the largest city in the world in China,

232
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but you do not know its name.

233
0:13:07.08,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You can see that India

234
0:13:08.96,000 --> 0:13:1,000
is in the center of this world.

235
0:13:11.64,000 --> 0:13:14,000
You can see that Europe is on the edge.

236
0:13:14.96,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And we in Exeter today

237
0:13:18.04,000 --> 0:13:2,000
are on the far edge of the planet.

238
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We are on a tiny scrap of rock

239
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:25,000
off Europe

240
0:13:25.72,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which contains less than one percent

241
0:13:28.36,000 --> 0:13:3,000
of the world's adults,

242
0:13:30.4,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and less than half a percent

243
0:13:32.96,000 --> 0:13:33,000
of the world's children.

244
0:13:35.64,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We are living in a stabilizing world, an urbanizing world,

245
0:13:40.28,000 --> 0:13:41,000
an aging world,

246
0:13:42.28,000 --> 0:13:44,000
a connecting world.

247
0:13:44.44,000 --> 0:13:47,000
There are many, many things to be frightened about,

248
0:13:48.72,000 --> 0:13:53,000
but there is no need for us to fear each other as much as we do,

249
0:13:53.96,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and we need to see that we are now living in a new world.

250
0:13:58.96,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Thank you very much.

251
0:14:00.2,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

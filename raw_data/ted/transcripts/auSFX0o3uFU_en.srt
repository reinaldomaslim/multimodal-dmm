1
0:00:00.03,000 --> 0:00:04,000
thank you for the questions and I'm here

2
0:00:02.55,000 --> 0:00:07,000
my office in Stockholm and I'm going to

3
0:00:04.62,000 --> 0:00:1,000
answer them one by one but many of you

4
0:00:08.309,000 --> 0:00:13,000
actually put several questions so then I

5
0:00:10.71,000 --> 0:00:17,000
had to pick one of them the first one is

6
0:00:14.28,000 --> 0:00:2,000
from number one what in your mind is the

7
0:00:18.449,000 --> 0:00:22,000
number one lesson to be learned from

8
0:00:20.34,000 --> 0:00:23,000
your way of looking at data what ought

9
0:00:22.5,000 --> 0:00:26,000
our governments do with that they are

10
0:00:24.3,000 --> 0:00:29,000
not doing well it's clearly to

11
0:00:27.09,000 --> 0:00:31,000
collaborate better the world is coming

12
0:00:30.029,000 --> 0:00:34,000
together whether you call it

13
0:00:31.669,000 --> 0:00:36,000
globalization or whatever and we need

14
0:00:34.53,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the better global governance and by the

15
0:00:37.5,000 --> 0:00:42,000
end of the year the first test for a

16
0:00:40.14,000 --> 0:00:45,000
hope for change is the climate

17
0:00:42.719,000 --> 0:00:47,000
negotiations in Copenhagen let's see if

18
0:00:45.809,000 --> 0:00:51,000
we will do better than last time

19
0:00:48.11,000 --> 0:00:54,000
number two Reuben sandwich if you could

20
0:00:52.05,000 --> 0:00:55,000
present your stats to a panel of any

21
0:00:54.12,000 --> 0:00:56,000
five people in the world who would you

22
0:00:56.01,000 --> 0:00:59,000
choose and why

23
0:00:56.91,000 --> 0:01:02,000
oh that's an easy one I would choose

24
0:00:59.55,000 --> 0:01:04,000
president Lula President Putin president

25
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Jintao Prime Minister Singh and

26
0:01:05.25,000 --> 0:01:12,000
President Zuma that is the leaders of

27
0:01:08.7,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Brazil Russia China India and South

28
0:01:12.51,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Africa the leading emerging economies

29
0:01:15.509,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and the middle-income countries that

30
0:01:18.09,000 --> 0:01:24,000
today constitute about three billion of

31
0:01:21.299,000 --> 0:01:26,000
mankind half mankind I think those are

32
0:01:24.6,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the most important leaders because they

33
0:01:26.61,000 --> 0:01:33,000
must on one hand established good and

34
0:01:31.04,000 --> 0:01:36,000
productive relations with a high-income

35
0:01:33.99,000 --> 0:01:37,000
countries that were used to determine

36
0:01:36.479,000 --> 0:01:41,000
everything in this world and on the

37
0:01:38.369,000 --> 0:01:43,000
other hand they have to act decently and

38
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
make good investment in the poorest

39
0:01:44.34,000 --> 0:01:48,000
countries the investments from China and

40
0:01:46.74,000 --> 0:01:49,000
India and Brazil in the poorest

41
0:01:48.63,000 --> 0:01:52,000
countries in Africa are very hopeful if

42
0:01:50.46,000 --> 0:01:54,000
they are managed correctly so it's those

43
0:01:53.03,000 --> 0:01:59,000
future leader of the world from the big

44
0:01:55.439,000 --> 0:02:03,000
nations that I would love to present

45
0:01:59.42,000 --> 0:02:05,000
number three Universal sprout asks in my

46
0:02:04.409,000 --> 0:02:08,000
experience people do not understand

47
0:02:06.39,000 --> 0:02:1,000
statistics and will never change their

48
0:02:08.459,000 --> 0:02:13,000
opinion based on statistics I would like

49
0:02:11.039,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to ask if you agree no I do

50
0:02:14.45,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but statistics has to go together with

51
0:02:18.209,000 --> 0:02:22,000
other information and with experience

52
0:02:20.069,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that's when it's useful I'll give you

53
0:02:22.65,000 --> 0:02:29,000
one example if I search Google in the

54
0:02:27.09,000 --> 0:02:33,000
United States for unemployment rate this

55
0:02:30.06,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is result and if I click in the one box

56
0:02:33.45,000 --> 0:02:39,000
here I will get a new type of graphic

57
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:43,000
showing the unemployment rate for United

58
0:02:40.139,000 --> 0:02:48,000
States from 1990 and onwards today to an

59
0:02:44.04,000 --> 0:02:5,000
all-time high on 9.7% I think most

60
0:02:48.54,000 --> 0:02:52,000
people the United States understand this

61
0:02:50.579,000 --> 0:02:54,000
curve because it relates to them and

62
0:02:52.62,000 --> 0:02:56,000
they are very keen to see whether it

63
0:02:54.959,000 --> 0:02:58,000
will turn around and they would also

64
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
like to see how the unemployment have

65
0:02:59.099,000 --> 0:03:03,000
hit different parts of the countries so

66
0:03:01.409,000 --> 0:03:06,000
they can go here and they would look for

67
0:03:03.359,000 --> 0:03:08,000
California and see that California today

68
0:03:06.659,000 --> 0:03:1,000
actually has a higher unemployment than

69
0:03:08.849,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the average of the country it's all the

70
0:03:10.739,000 --> 0:03:16,000
way up to twelve point one and and some

71
0:03:14.579,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of you perhaps or perhaps are interested

72
0:03:17.28,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of Silicon Valley so then we open

73
0:03:19.979,000 --> 0:03:29,000
California here we go down to Santa

74
0:03:26.669,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Clara County and Santa Clara County look

75
0:03:30.569,000 --> 0:03:35,000
historically they were lower than the

76
0:03:32.97,000 --> 0:03:39,000
average in the 90s but in the dot-com

77
0:03:36.51,000 --> 0:03:42,000
bubble burst in 2002 unemployment rate

78
0:03:40.43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
skyrocketed to nine point one percent

79
0:03:42.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but today it is higher you see

80
0:03:46.349,000 --> 0:03:51,000
if you present and make statistics

81
0:03:48.87,000 --> 0:03:52,000
accessible in this way then many will

82
0:03:51.54,000 --> 0:03:55,000
start to use it and it will be very

83
0:03:53.819,000 --> 0:03:57,000
interesting now to get the August

84
0:03:55.859,000 --> 0:04:,000
figures for United States as a whole and

85
0:03:58.53,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the different countries to see whether

86
0:04:01.049,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the present crisis have come to a

87
0:04:03.509,000 --> 0:04:08,000
plateau or whether it is already

88
0:04:06.359,000 --> 0:04:11,000
starting to go down or continuing to

89
0:04:08.699,000 --> 0:04:14,000
rise people are not stupid they'll

90
0:04:12.299,000 --> 0:04:18,000
understand statistics and they will use

91
0:04:14.759,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it if it's made available in in relevant

92
0:04:18.479,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and interesting ways number four rags

93
0:04:22.56,000 --> 0:04:27,000
seven to nine asks what is

94
0:04:25.77,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the most startling or intriguing

95
0:04:27.569,000 --> 0:04:3,000
correlation you have been counted by

96
0:04:29.37,000 --> 0:04:35,000
playing with different values on the X

97
0:04:31.289,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and y axis at gapminder.org well it's

98
0:04:35.4,000 --> 0:04:41,000
not really the correlation but it is

99
0:04:38.34,000 --> 0:04:44,000
what we can do with animation the trends

100
0:04:42.15,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the change of a time that has been most

101
0:04:45.03,000 --> 0:04:5,000
startling to me and the fact that the

102
0:04:48.06,000 --> 0:04:52,000
middle-income countries are catching up

103
0:04:50.37,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so fast let me show you a classical

104
0:04:52.83,000 --> 0:05:,000
example here in Gapminder world I show

105
0:04:57.539,000 --> 0:05:05,000
total fertility rate on this axis I show

106
0:05:00.84,000 --> 0:05:08,000
life expectancy on this axis and 1800

107
0:05:05.55,000 --> 0:05:11,000
United States had an estimate these are

108
0:05:09.81,000 --> 0:05:13,000
rough historical estimate of seven

109
0:05:12.03,000 --> 0:05:17,000
children per woman and the life

110
0:05:14.159,000 --> 0:05:2,000
expectancy was just a 39-year those were

111
0:05:17.669,000 --> 0:05:22,000
rough time and if I move United States

112
0:05:20.729,000 --> 0:05:25,000
forward what really happens was that

113
0:05:22.94,000 --> 0:05:28,000
family size started to decline and with

114
0:05:26.61,000 --> 0:05:31,000
industrialization life expectancy

115
0:05:29.52,000 --> 0:05:33,000
started to increase it got better and

116
0:05:31.74,000 --> 0:05:36,000
better progress in medical science and

117
0:05:33.99,000 --> 0:05:39,000
health service and after the first world

118
0:05:37.56,000 --> 0:05:43,000
war and off to the Second World War that

119
0:05:40.05,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was a baby boom and that was 1950 1950

120
0:05:44.46,000 --> 0:05:51,000
United States had about three children

121
0:05:47.13,000 --> 0:05:52,000
per woman and 68 years typical for part

122
0:05:52.02,000 --> 0:05:57,000
of the Western world

123
0:05:52.979,000 --> 0:06:,000
now I'll compare that with Vietnam which

124
0:05:57.96,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I find down here that's where Vietnam

125
0:06:01.889,000 --> 0:06:07,000
was 1950 and I'll compare it with Iran

126
0:06:09.199,000 --> 0:06:14,000
two prominent middle-income countries

127
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:18,000
with special relationships to the United

128
0:06:14.58,000 --> 0:06:21,000
States and I could say quite reliable

129
0:06:18.21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
data I know the professionals in these

130
0:06:21.87,000 --> 0:06:29,000
two countries personally that are

131
0:06:24.029,000 --> 0:06:33,000
compiling this data so Vietnam had five

132
0:06:30.389,000 --> 0:06:37,000
children per woman and 39 years like

133
0:06:33.659,000 --> 0:06:38,000
United States 150 years ago Iran 1950

134
0:06:37.8,000 --> 0:06:4,000
was almost like

135
0:06:38.729,000 --> 0:06:42,000
200 years ago in United States and now

136
0:06:41.279,000 --> 0:06:45,000
come my message look how they have

137
0:06:42.93,000 --> 0:06:48,000
catched up in the last 50 years they

138
0:06:46.139,000 --> 0:06:51,000
relive the lost 25 years they have

139
0:06:49.139,000 --> 0:06:53,000
catched up like this and today they are

140
0:06:51.18,000 --> 0:06:56,000
just about one younger Asian Xavier

141
0:06:53.849,000 --> 0:06:58,000
narration of the United States when it

142
0:06:56.279,000 --> 0:06:59,000
comes to size of family and length of

143
0:06:59.009,000 --> 0:07:02,000
life

144
0:06:59.639,000 --> 0:07:06,000
this is what I've amazed me more that

145
0:07:02.849,000 --> 0:07:08,000
really the world is converging as EF

146
0:07:06.749,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Sachs says it is getting more and more

147
0:07:09.809,000 --> 0:07:14,000
similar by this middle three billion

148
0:07:12.509,000 --> 0:07:16,000
people when it comes to human resources

149
0:07:15.18,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and family life they are catching up

150
0:07:17.399,000 --> 0:07:22,000
this surprised me when I got the data so

151
0:07:20.069,000 --> 0:07:26,000
clear in front of me

152
0:07:23.059,000 --> 0:07:28,000
number five Coon John what do you think

153
0:07:26.399,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of the state of statistics education in

154
0:07:28.499,000 --> 0:07:33,000
high school and college well I can't

155
0:07:30.87,000 --> 0:07:35,000
think so much because I don't know it in

156
0:07:33.599,000 --> 0:07:37,000
detail but I have a hope and that is

157
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that the ability to play computer games

158
0:07:38.339,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the ability to develop interesting

159
0:07:41.789,000 --> 0:07:47,000
tools in flash can now be used in school

160
0:07:44.49,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but an obstacle is that many schools

161
0:07:47.939,000 --> 0:07:54,000
block the downloading and installing of

162
0:07:51.479,000 --> 0:07:57,000
of Flash readers so there must be

163
0:07:55.469,000 --> 0:07:59,000
another attitudes in school so that

164
0:07:57.56,000 --> 0:08:,000
students and teachers can access freely

165
0:08:00.36,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the Internet

166
0:08:01.169,000 --> 0:08:08,000
let there be flash in schools and

167
0:08:03.389,000 --> 0:08:12,000
statistics will be found number six

168
0:08:08.509,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Garrus scarcity would you be willing to

169
0:08:12.959,000 --> 0:08:16,000
help the white house presently

170
0:08:14.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
healthcare budget in such a way as to

171
0:08:17.159,000 --> 0:08:23,000
make it easier for the average person to

172
0:08:20.159,000 --> 0:08:27,000
understand the value of public option or

173
0:08:24.059,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a single-payer plan well I'm willing but

174
0:08:27.809,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I don't know if I'm able because there's

175
0:08:30.599,000 --> 0:08:34,000
been a blockage in the United States

176
0:08:32.849,000 --> 0:08:36,000
regarding discussion of the health

177
0:08:34.62,000 --> 0:08:4,000
system let me show you a graph look at

178
0:08:37.469,000 --> 0:08:44,000
this graph at the horizontal axis I show

179
0:08:41.19,000 --> 0:08:46,000
health spending per person in purchasing

180
0:08:44.55,000 --> 0:08:48,000
power dollars that is comparable dollars

181
0:08:46.98,000 --> 0:08:5,000
between countries the size of each

182
0:08:49.11,000 --> 0:08:51,000
bubble is the size of the population of

183
0:08:51.149,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the countries

184
0:08:51.79,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and here we have life expectancy the

185
0:08:54.01,000 --> 0:09:,000
length of life the owl come of health

186
0:08:56.35,000 --> 0:09:03,000
service and there is a color here also

187
0:09:00.37,000 --> 0:09:05,000
showing something it is the percent of

188
0:09:03.45,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the gross national product that is used

189
0:09:06.22,000 --> 0:09:13,000
for health service the United States is

190
0:09:08.35,000 --> 0:09:15,000
hot and red with 15% of the national

191
0:09:13.57,000 --> 0:09:17,000
income being used for health service all

192
0:09:15.73,000 --> 0:09:2,000
other countries in the world use less

193
0:09:18.4,000 --> 0:09:23,000
for health service except one little

194
0:09:20.88,000 --> 0:09:26,000
friend of the United States down there

195
0:09:23.88,000 --> 0:09:28,000
which one is this it's East Timor

196
0:09:27.25,000 --> 0:09:31,000
there's only two countries in the world

197
0:09:29.59,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that use more than fifteen percent of

198
0:09:31.42,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the national income for health service

199
0:09:32.89,000 --> 0:09:38,000
United States and East Timor stands out

200
0:09:36.1,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as an exception but neither of the two

201
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
managed to achieve especially good

202
0:09:41.94,000 --> 0:09:47,000
health in relation to the investment and

203
0:09:45.37,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and and we are also surprised outside

204
0:09:48.49,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the United States that that that

205
0:09:51.24,000 --> 0:09:56,000
President Obama's health plan is

206
0:09:53.53,000 --> 0:09:58,000
regarded as communist or socialist

207
0:09:56.4,000 --> 0:10:01,000
United States can compare with a country

208
0:09:58.81,000 --> 0:10:05,000
like Switzerland Switzerland use 11

209
0:10:02.08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
percent of its national gross national

210
0:10:06.67,000 --> 0:10:12,000
product for health and they achieve 82

211
0:10:10.39,000 --> 0:10:18,000
years of life expectancy United States

212
0:10:13.18,000 --> 0:10:22,000
use 15% and we achieve 78 years the

213
0:10:18.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
United States you don't have to do like

214
0:10:22.45,000 --> 0:10:26,000
like Mike Moore and compare United

215
0:10:25.18,000 --> 0:10:29,000
States with Cuba there's so many

216
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
countries today that use much less money

217
0:10:30.07,000 --> 0:10:37,000
for health but to achieve the same

218
0:10:31.78,000 --> 0:10:41,000
result here chilla here Costa Rica here

219
0:10:37.3,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Singapore here South Korea here Portugal

220
0:10:41.86,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and down here we have Denmark the many

221
0:10:45.58,000 --> 0:10:49,000
many countries that use less money with

222
0:10:47.89,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the same result and it's range United

223
0:10:50.23,000 --> 0:10:54,000
States that is such a competitive

224
0:10:51.82,000 --> 0:10:54,000
country so good in sport so

225
0:10:54.25,000 --> 0:10:58,000
intrapreneurial

226
0:10:55.42,000 --> 0:11:,000
so good in film and everything it seems

227
0:10:58.27,000 --> 0:11:04,000
United States don't want to compete in

228
0:11:00.43,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in health care it must be very sad to be

229
0:11:04.3,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the lost

230
0:11:05.15,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the world in using dollar well for

231
0:11:07.13,000 --> 0:11:12,000
health I think this notion has to change

232
0:11:10.04,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in the population of the United States

233
0:11:12.32,000 --> 0:11:19,000
but I don't know if I'm the person to

234
0:11:14.42,000 --> 0:11:25,000
help in that if I could I will number

235
0:11:20.18,000 --> 0:11:28,000
seven playin asks do you think CUDA is

236
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
an important step in the path of better

237
0:11:28.37,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and richer visualization of data but

238
0:11:31.7,000 --> 0:11:36,000
their player and look at me do I look

239
0:11:34.58,000 --> 0:11:39,000
like a person who know what CUDA is I

240
0:11:37.25,000 --> 0:11:43,000
never heard the term but I look like a

241
0:11:40.37,000 --> 0:11:45,000
person sixty one-year-old who can write

242
0:11:43.339,000 --> 0:11:48,000
codes I've never written code people

243
0:11:46.279,000 --> 0:11:51,000
have given me credit for developing

244
0:11:48.589,000 --> 0:11:53,000
software where I only have expressed the

245
0:11:51.5,000 --> 0:11:55,000
need for the software and had been a

246
0:11:53.6,000 --> 0:11:58,000
keen user the gap behind the software

247
0:11:56.42,000 --> 0:12:02,000
was developed by my son and his wife and

248
0:11:58.88,000 --> 0:12:04,000
a growing team of flesh developers in

249
0:12:02.779,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Sweden that are now moved to Google and

250
0:12:05.12,000 --> 0:12:09,000
now I work together with another team

251
0:12:07.76,000 --> 0:12:11,000
here in Gapminder foundation that

252
0:12:09.68,000 --> 0:12:13,000
developed the stuff that I use in the

253
0:12:11.779,000 --> 0:12:17,000
lectures and don't give too much credit

254
0:12:14.42,000 --> 0:12:19,000
of older males you know they often

255
0:12:18.05,000 --> 0:12:24,000
hasn't done everything you think they've

256
0:12:19.94,000 --> 0:12:26,000
done pepper what are your future plans

257
0:12:24.44,000 --> 0:12:3,000
for Gapminder it is very clear to

258
0:12:27.86,000 --> 0:12:31,000
maintain the users we have and continue

259
0:12:30.74,000 --> 0:12:34,000
with a steady increase but also

260
0:12:32.45,000 --> 0:12:38,000
specifically to develop tools that are

261
0:12:35.66,000 --> 0:12:41,000
suitable for teachers and students in

262
0:12:38.63,000 --> 0:12:44,000
education later this year we will add a

263
0:12:41.779,000 --> 0:12:46,000
part of our webpage called for teachers

264
0:12:44.75,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and there you will get goodies that you

265
0:12:47.089,000 --> 0:12:53,000
can use in education regarding the major

266
0:12:50.27,000 --> 0:12:55,000
global development trends make that

267
0:12:53.69,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Gospel known around the world that

268
0:12:56.12,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Gapminder will provide stuff for schools

269
0:13:00.39,000 --> 0:13:05,000
number nine border groves asks what can

270
0:13:04.5,000 --> 0:13:07,000
be done to encourage governments and

271
0:13:06.209,000 --> 0:13:1,000
international organizations to more

272
0:13:07.89,000 --> 0:13:12,000
actively and effectively collect and

273
0:13:10.32,000 --> 0:13:17,000
publish vital statistics it's easy the

274
0:13:13.68,000 --> 0:13:2,000
World Bank the OECD the FAO the IMF

275
0:13:17.459,000 --> 0:13:23,000
should do as President Obama is doing he

276
0:13:20.97,000 --> 0:13:26,000
nominated the chief information officer

277
0:13:23.88,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Vivek Kundra that started the site

278
0:13:27.32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
data.gov and made the data freely

279
0:13:31.17,000 --> 0:13:37,000
available in both visualization and this

280
0:13:34.32,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is important as data set that could be

281
0:13:38.13,000 --> 0:13:43,000
freely downloadable in relatively

282
0:13:40.74,000 --> 0:13:47,000
uniform format and and totally machine

283
0:13:43.41,000 --> 0:13:5,000
readable so that others companies civil

284
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:53,000
society organizations could innovate and

285
0:13:51.24,000 --> 0:13:57,000
make the data available for special

286
0:13:53.76,000 --> 0:14:,000
groups in new visual ways this is a way

287
0:13:57.24,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to go forward let the data that has been

288
0:14:00.839,000 --> 0:14:07,000
paid for by tax payers be freely

289
0:14:04.14,000 --> 0:14:12,000
available in ways that complement what

290
0:14:07.949,000 --> 0:14:16,000
government is doing with the data then a

291
0:14:12.8,000 --> 0:14:19,000
fad like Buddha but how do you recommend

292
0:14:17.04,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that I or we help the bottom billion I'm

293
0:14:20.43,000 --> 0:14:25,000
wondering about practical ways the top

294
0:14:23.279,000 --> 0:14:3,000
billion can assist the bottom billion

295
0:14:25.56,000 --> 0:14:33,000
with a small unit of organization well

296
0:14:30.769,000 --> 0:14:36,000
it's good that you're using the new term

297
0:14:33.6,000 --> 0:14:39,000
bottom billions that was launched by

298
0:14:37.31,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Paul Collier the professor of economics

299
0:14:40.38,000 --> 0:14:45,000
in Oxford in this book and I strongly

300
0:14:43.17,000 --> 0:14:47,000
recommend you to also read paul cole

301
0:14:45.51,000 --> 0:14:5,000
years lost book sometimes you have to

302
0:14:48.12,000 --> 0:14:53,000
read books also not only read it and and

303
0:14:50.97,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and Ted videos Paul Collier has written

304
0:14:53.49,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Wars guns and votes this is real about

305
0:14:56.25,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the poorest 1 billion people in the

306
0:14:59.279,000 --> 0:15:01,000
world

307
0:14:59.579,000 --> 0:15:06,000
let me show on these graphics who they

308
0:15:02.22,000 --> 0:15:1,000
are this is income per person in dollars

309
0:15:07.079,000 --> 0:15:12,000
per day and and this was 1970 what has

310
0:15:10.23,000 --> 0:15:13,000
happened in the world is that population

311
0:15:12.779,000 --> 0:15:14,000
has grown

312
0:15:13.77,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and many people have moved out of

313
0:15:15.6,000 --> 0:15:22,000
poverty but just a little bit and now in

314
0:15:19.61,000 --> 0:15:25,000
2008 this is more or less where the

315
0:15:22.95,000 --> 0:15:26,000
world is the bottom billion is the

316
0:15:25.62,000 --> 0:15:29,000
people living here still on less than

317
0:15:27.69,000 --> 0:15:33,000
one dollar a day and many of them are

318
0:15:30.36,000 --> 0:15:37,000
living in civil war like in Afghanistan

319
0:15:34.5,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Somalia or in very fragile states that

320
0:15:38.1,000 --> 0:15:42,000
are almost falling down into civil wars

321
0:15:40.14,000 --> 0:15:47,000
on the other side of the line you find

322
0:15:42.99,000 --> 0:15:5,000
countries like Tanzania Zambia Cambodia

323
0:15:47.25,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that has come out of the poverty and now

324
0:15:51.06,000 --> 0:15:55,000
start to move on that's another

325
0:15:52.95,000 --> 0:15:56,000
situation and then here in the middle

326
0:15:55.23,000 --> 0:16:01,000
you find what we call middle-income

327
0:15:57.57,000 --> 0:16:03,000
economies like Vietnam Egypt and Peru

328
0:16:02.1,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that are not doing well and are

329
0:16:04.14,000 --> 0:16:09,000
progressing forward but with great

330
0:16:06.42,000 --> 0:16:12,000
inequity still within countries now you

331
0:16:09.15,000 --> 0:16:14,000
need different forms of support for

332
0:16:12.6,000 --> 0:16:17,000
different companies the bottom billion

333
0:16:14.43,000 --> 0:16:19,000
need humanitarian aid so the answer my

334
0:16:17.64,000 --> 0:16:21,000
question is red cross medicines on

335
0:16:20.22,000 --> 0:16:24,000
frontier and similar humanitarian

336
0:16:22.29,000 --> 0:16:29,000
organization on one hand on the other

337
0:16:24.66,000 --> 0:16:31,000
hand wise and careful security operation

338
0:16:29.76,000 --> 0:16:34,000
led by the United Nations those have to

339
0:16:32.28,000 --> 0:16:38,000
be combined and then help good national

340
0:16:35.07,000 --> 0:16:4,000
leaders to move their countries into a

341
0:16:38.43,000 --> 0:16:42,000
more stable situation that has happened

342
0:16:40.56,000 --> 0:16:45,000
in countries like Mozambique in Cambodia

343
0:16:42.9,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and when we come on the other side of

344
0:16:45.6,000 --> 0:16:51,000
this line then microcredits becomes more

345
0:16:47.88,000 --> 0:16:54,000
important but also long-term aid for

346
0:16:52.08,000 --> 0:16:57,000
health like vaccinations for education

347
0:16:55.23,000 --> 0:16:59,000
for infrastructure and then countries

348
0:16:57.9,000 --> 0:16:59,000
must have a fair trade situation in the

349
0:17:00.18,000 --> 0:17:03,000
world

350
0:17:00.48,000 --> 0:17:06,000
so humanitarian aid on this side

351
0:17:03.62,000 --> 0:17:09,000
microcredits on this side and support to

352
0:17:06.69,000 --> 0:17:13,000
education health and infrastructure

353
0:17:10.31,000 --> 0:17:16,000
number-10 be stranger to love what's it

354
0:17:14.28,000 --> 0:17:18,000
like knowing so many on reddit have

355
0:17:16.71,000 --> 0:17:21,000
intense nerd crushes on you it's

356
0:17:18.87,000 --> 0:17:24,000
wonderful but it's also a challenge it's

357
0:17:21.96,000 --> 0:17:25,000
mainly a challenge how can we make

358
0:17:24.93,000 --> 0:17:28,000
information about the

359
0:17:26.77,000 --> 0:17:31,000
world even better available and how can

360
0:17:29.62,000 --> 0:17:34,000
we reach the many with what we have

361
0:17:32.5,000 --> 0:17:37,000
already succeeded with this is what we

362
0:17:35.17,000 --> 0:17:4,000
are trying now with a small team at

363
0:17:37.62,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Gapminder foundation we try to do our

364
0:17:40.81,000 --> 0:17:45,000
best and we are very interesting to get

365
0:17:43.12,000 --> 0:17:48,000
your comments and to have your help to

366
0:17:45.85,000 --> 0:17:5,000
let more people know about our services

367
0:17:48.46,000 --> 0:17:5,000
thank you very much

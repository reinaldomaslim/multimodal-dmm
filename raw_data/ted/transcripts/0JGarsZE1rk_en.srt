1
0:00:12.869,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have never been arrested,

2
0:00:14.978,000 --> 0:00:15,000
never spent a night in jail,

3
0:00:16.865,000 --> 0:00:19,000
never had a loved one thrown into the back of a squad car

4
0:00:20.71,000 --> 0:00:21,000
or behind bars,

5
0:00:22.39,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or be at the mercy of a scary, confusing system

6
0:00:26.851,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that at best sees them with indifference,

7
0:00:29.925,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and at worst as monstrous.

8
0:00:32.459,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The United States of America locks up more people than any other nation

9
0:00:36.253,000 --> 0:00:37,000
on the planet,

10
0:00:37.684,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and Louisiana is our biggest incarcerator.

11
0:00:41.295,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Most of you are probably like me --

12
0:00:44.201,000 --> 0:00:45,000
lucky.

13
0:00:45.376,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The closest we get to crime and punishment is likely what we see on TV.

14
0:00:50.102,000 --> 0:00:51,000
While making "Unprisoned,"

15
0:00:51.457,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I met a woman who used to be like us --

16
0:00:53.783,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Sheila Phipps.

17
0:00:55.572,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Recording) Sheila Phipps: Before my son went to jail,

18
0:00:58.128,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I used to see people be on television,

19
0:01:00.132,000 --> 0:01:03,000
fighting, saying, "Oh, this person didn't do it and this person is innocent."

20
0:01:03.945,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And you know, you snub them or you dismiss them,

21
0:01:06.683,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and like, "Yeah, whatever."

22
0:01:08.727,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Don't get me wrong,

23
0:01:09.902,000 --> 0:01:11,000
there's a lot of people who deserve to be in prison.

24
0:01:12.43,000 --> 0:01:13,000
There's a lot of criminals out here.

25
0:01:14.274,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But there are a lot of innocent people that's in jail.

26
0:01:18.436,000 --> 0:01:21,000
EA: Sheila's son, McKinley, is one of those innocent people.

27
0:01:21.727,000 --> 0:01:25,000
He served 17 years of a 30-year sentence on a manslaughter charge.

28
0:01:26.611,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He had no previous convictions,

29
0:01:28.434,000 --> 0:01:3,000
there was no forensic evidence in the case.

30
0:01:31.036,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He was convicted solely on the basis of eyewitness testimony,

31
0:01:35.171,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and decades of research have shown

32
0:01:37.354,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that eyewitness testimony isn't as reliable

33
0:01:40.25,000 --> 0:01:41,000
as we once believed it to be.

34
0:01:42.75,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Scientists say that memory isn't precise.

35
0:01:46.12,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's less like playing back a video,

36
0:01:48.575,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and more like putting together a puzzle.

37
0:01:51.997,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Since 1989, when DNA testing was first used to free innocent people,

38
0:01:57.513,000 --> 0:02:02,000
over 70 percent of overturned convictions were based on eyewitness testimony.

39
0:02:03.784,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Last year,

40
0:02:05.114,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the district attorney whose office prosecuted McKinley's case

41
0:02:09.017,000 --> 0:02:12,000
was convicted of unrelated corruption charges.

42
0:02:12.93,000 --> 0:02:15,000
When this district attorney of 30 years stepped down,

43
0:02:16.789,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the eyewitnesses from McKinley's case came forward

44
0:02:19.741,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and said that they had been pressured into testifying by the district attorneys,

45
0:02:24.224,000 --> 0:02:26,000
pressure which included the threat of jail time.

46
0:02:27.465,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Despite this, McKinley is still in prison.

47
0:02:31.099,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Recording) SP: Before this happened,

48
0:02:33.005,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I never would've thought it.

49
0:02:34.485,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And well, I guess it's hard for me to imagine

50
0:02:38.139,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that these things is going on, you know,

51
0:02:40.719,000 --> 0:02:42,000
until this happened to my son.

52
0:02:43.504,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It really opened my eyes.

53
0:02:45.618,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It really, really opened my eyes.

54
0:02:48.092,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I ain't gonna lie to you.

55
0:02:50.85,000 --> 0:02:53,000
EA: Estimates of how many innocent people are locked up

56
0:02:53.987,000 --> 0:02:55,000
range between one and four percent,

57
0:02:56.701,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which maybe doesn't sound like a lot,

58
0:02:58.731,000 --> 0:03:02,000
except that it amounts to around 87,000 people:

59
0:03:02.94,000 --> 0:03:05,000
mothers, fathers, sons locked up,

60
0:03:06.338,000 --> 0:03:07,000
often for decades,

61
0:03:07.711,000 --> 0:03:09,000
for crimes they did not commit.

62
0:03:09.941,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And that's not even counting the roughly half a million people

63
0:03:13.037,000 --> 0:03:15,000
who have been convicted of nothing --

64
0:03:15.293,000 --> 0:03:16,000
those presumed innocent,

65
0:03:17.19,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but who are too poor to bail out of jail

66
0:03:20.047,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and therefore sit behind bars for weeks upon months,

67
0:03:23.93,000 --> 0:03:25,000
waiting for their case to come to trial --

68
0:03:26.123,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or much more likely,

69
0:03:27.828,000 --> 0:03:29,000
waiting to take a plea just to get out.

70
0:03:30.736,000 --> 0:03:33,000
All of those people have family on the outside.

71
0:03:35.089,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Recording) Kortney Williams: My brother missed my high school graduation

72
0:03:38.542,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because the night before,

73
0:03:39.817,000 --> 0:03:4,000
he went to jail.

74
0:03:41.342,000 --> 0:03:43,000
My brother missed my birthday dinner

75
0:03:43.611,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because that day, actually, he went to jail.

76
0:03:47.306,000 --> 0:03:49,000
My brother missed his own birthday dinner

77
0:03:50.17,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

78
0:03:52.653,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Recording) EA: So all these times when he ended up going to jail,

79
0:03:55.773,000 --> 0:03:57,000
were charges pressed or did he just get taken to jail?

80
0:03:58.321,000 --> 0:03:59,000
KW: The charges would be pressed

81
0:03:59.896,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and it would have a bond posted,

82
0:04:02.946,000 --> 0:04:03,000
then the charges will get dropped ...

83
0:04:04.937,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because there was no evidence.

84
0:04:07.248,000 --> 0:04:09,000
EA: I met Kortney Williams when I went to her college classroom

85
0:04:10.226,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to talk about "Unprisoned."

86
0:04:11.741,000 --> 0:04:14,000
She ended up interviewing her aunt, Troylynn Robertson,

87
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for an episode.

88
0:04:17.231,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Recording) KW: With everything that you went through

89
0:04:19.733,000 --> 0:04:2,000
with your children,

90
0:04:20.908,000 --> 0:04:21,000
what is any advice that you would give me

91
0:04:22.914,000 --> 0:04:23,000
if I had any kids?

92
0:04:25.827,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Recording) Troylynn Roberston: I would tell you when you have them,

93
0:04:29.082,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you know the first thing that will initially come to mind is love

94
0:04:32.162,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and protection,

95
0:04:34.158,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but I would tell you,

96
0:04:35.678,000 --> 0:04:38,000
even much with the protection to raise them

97
0:04:38.79,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with knowledge of the judicial system --

98
0:04:42.52,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you know, we always tell our kids about the boogeyman,

99
0:04:46.124,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the bad people, who to watch out for,

100
0:04:49.141,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but we don't teach them how to watch out for the judicial system.

101
0:04:54.364,000 --> 0:04:56,000
EA: Because of the way our criminal legal system

102
0:04:57.055,000 --> 0:04:59,000
disproportionately targets people of color,

103
0:04:59.715,000 --> 0:05:02,000
it's not uncommon for young people like Kortney to know about it.

104
0:05:03.494,000 --> 0:05:06,000
When I started going into high schools to talk to students about "Unprisoned,"

105
0:05:07.36,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I found that roughly one-third of the young people I spoke with

106
0:05:10.877,000 --> 0:05:11,000
had a loved one behind bars.

107
0:05:13.504,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Recording) Girl: The hardest part is like finding out where he's at,

108
0:05:16.767,000 --> 0:05:17,000
or like, when his court date is.

109
0:05:18.759,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Girl: Yeah, he went to jail on my first birthday.

110
0:05:22.415,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Girl: My dad works as a guard.

111
0:05:24.442,000 --> 0:05:25,000
He saw my uncle in jail.

112
0:05:26.527,000 --> 0:05:27,000
He's in there for life.

113
0:05:28.434,000 --> 0:05:3,000
EA: According to the Annie E. Casey Foundation,

114
0:05:31.127,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the number of young people with a father incarcerated rose 500 percent

115
0:05:37.004,000 --> 0:05:39,000
between 1980 and 2000.

116
0:05:40.449,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Over five million of today's children will see a parent incarcerated

117
0:05:44.38,000 --> 0:05:45,000
at some point in their childhoods.

118
0:05:46.798,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But this number disproportionately affects African American children.

119
0:05:52.252,000 --> 0:05:54,000
By the time they reach the age of 14,

120
0:05:54.967,000 --> 0:05:57,000
one in four black children will see their dad go off to prison.

121
0:05:59.198,000 --> 0:06:02,000
That's compared to a rate of one in 30 for white children.

122
0:06:03.191,000 --> 0:06:08,000
One key factor determining the future success of both inmates and their children

123
0:06:08.293,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is whether they can maintain ties during the parent's incarceration,

124
0:06:12.666,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but prisoners' phone calls home can cost 20 to 30 times more

125
0:06:17.033,000 --> 0:06:18,000
than regular phone calls,

126
0:06:18.91,000 --> 0:06:21,000
so many families keep in touch through letters.

127
0:06:23.172,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Recording: Letter being unfolded)

128
0:06:25.381,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Anissa Christmas: Dear big brother,

129
0:06:27.612,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'm making that big 16 this year, LOL.

130
0:06:29.934,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Guess I'm not a baby anymore.

131
0:06:31.617,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You still taking me to prom?

132
0:06:33.25,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I really miss you.

133
0:06:34.523,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You're the only guy that kept it real with me.

134
0:06:37.485,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I wish you were here so I can vent to you.

135
0:06:40.695,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So much has happened since the last time I seen you.

136
0:06:44.847,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Voice breaking up) I have some good news.

137
0:06:46.933,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I won first place in the science fair.

138
0:06:48.79,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I'm a geek.

139
0:06:50.005,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We're going to regionals, can't you believe it?

140
0:06:52.295,000 --> 0:06:54,000
High school is going by super fast.

141
0:06:54.893,000 --> 0:06:55,000
In less than two years,

142
0:06:56.095,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I hope you'll be able to see me walk across the stage.

143
0:06:59.413,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I thought to write to you because I know it's boring in there.

144
0:07:02.342,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I want to put a smile on your face.

145
0:07:05.799,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Anissa wrote these letters to her brother

146
0:07:08.101,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when she was a sophomore in high school.

147
0:07:10.347,000 --> 0:07:12,000
She keeps the letters he writes to her tucked into the frame

148
0:07:13.302,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of her bedroom mirror,

149
0:07:14.504,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and reads them over and over again.

150
0:07:17.004,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'd like to think that there's a good reason

151
0:07:19.141,000 --> 0:07:21,000
why Anissa's brother is locked up.

152
0:07:21.543,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We all want the wheels of justice to properly turn,

153
0:07:25.624,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but we're coming to understand

154
0:07:27.456,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that the lofty ideals we learned in school look really different

155
0:07:31.004,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in our nation's prisons and jails and courtrooms.

156
0:07:34.943,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Recording) Danny Engelberg: You walk into that courtroom and you're just --

157
0:07:38.54,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I've been doing this for a quite a while, and it still catches your breath.

158
0:07:42.097,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You're like, "There are so many people of color here,"

159
0:07:44.659,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and yet I know that the city is not made up of 90 percent African Americans,

160
0:07:49.653,000 --> 0:07:52,000
so why is it that 90 percent of the people who are in orange

161
0:07:53.173,000 --> 0:07:54,000
are African American?

162
0:07:54.348,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Recording) EA: Public defender Danny Engelberg isn't the only one noticing

163
0:07:57.931,000 --> 0:07:59,000
how many black people are in municipal court --

164
0:08:00.146,000 --> 0:08:01,000
or in any court.

165
0:08:01.322,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It's hard to miss.

166
0:08:02.524,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Who's sitting in court waiting to see the judge?

167
0:08:04.819,000 --> 0:08:05,000
What do they look like?

168
0:08:06.044,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Recording) Man: Mostly African-Americans, like me.

169
0:08:08.537,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Man: It's mostly, I could say, 85 percent black.

170
0:08:10.816,000 --> 0:08:13,000
That's all you see in the orange, in the box back there, who locked up.

171
0:08:14.239,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Man: Who's waiting? Mostly black.

172
0:08:16.657,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I mean, there was a couple of white people in there.

173
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Woman: I think it was about 85 percent African-American

174
0:08:21.757,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that was sitting there.

175
0:08:23.923,000 --> 0:08:26,000
EA: How does a young black person growing up in America today

176
0:08:27.755,000 --> 0:08:29,000
come to understand justice?

177
0:08:30.696,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Another "Unprisoned" story was about a troupe of dancers

178
0:08:33.863,000 --> 0:08:35,000
who choreographed a piece called "Hoods Up,"

179
0:08:36.197,000 --> 0:08:38,000
which they performed in front of city council.

180
0:08:38.834,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Dawonta White was in the seventh grade for that performance.

181
0:08:42.986,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Recording) Dawonta White: We was wearing black with hoodies because Trayvon Martin,

182
0:08:47.201,000 --> 0:08:49,000
when he was wearing his hoodie, he was killed.

183
0:08:49.512,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So we looked upon that,

184
0:08:50.892,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and we said we're going to wear hoodies like Trayvon Martin.

185
0:08:53.728,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Recording) EA: Who came up with that idea?

186
0:08:55.87,000 --> 0:08:56,000
DW: The group. We all agreed on it.

187
0:08:57.561,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I was a little nervous, but I had stick through it though,

188
0:09:00.329,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but I felt like it was a good thing so they could notice what we do.

189
0:09:04.601,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Recording) EA: Shraivell Brown was another choreographer and dancer

190
0:09:07.817,000 --> 0:09:08,000
in "Hoods Up."

191
0:09:09.083,000 --> 0:09:11,000
He says the police criticize people who look like him.

192
0:09:11.668,000 --> 0:09:14,000
He feels judged based on things other black people may have done.

193
0:09:15.056,000 --> 0:09:17,000
How would you want the police to look at you,

194
0:09:17.206,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and what would you want them to think?

195
0:09:19.049,000 --> 0:09:2,000
SB: That I'm not no threat.

196
0:09:20.372,000 --> 0:09:22,000
EA: Why would they think you're threatening?

197
0:09:22.445,000 --> 0:09:23,000
What did you say, you're 14?

198
0:09:23.867,000 --> 0:09:28,000
SB: Yes, I'm 14, but because he said a lot of black males

199
0:09:29.067,000 --> 0:09:31,000
are thugs or gangsters and all that,

200
0:09:32.058,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but I don't want them thinking that about me.

201
0:09:35.855,000 --> 0:09:36,000
EA: For folks who look like me,

202
0:09:37.622,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the easiest and most comfortable thing to do is to not pay attention --

203
0:09:41.949,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to assume our criminal legal system is working.

204
0:09:45.615,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But if it's not our responsibility to question those assumptions,

205
0:09:50.125,000 --> 0:09:52,000
whose responsibility is it?

206
0:09:53.001,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There's a synagogue here that's taken on learning about mass incarceration,

207
0:09:56.737,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and many congregants have concluded

208
0:09:58.844,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that because mass incarceration throws so many lives into chaos,

209
0:10:03.019,000 --> 0:10:05,000
it actually creates more crime --

210
0:10:05.242,000 --> 0:10:06,000
makes people less safe.

211
0:10:07.69,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Congregant Teri Hunter says

212
0:10:09.663,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the first step towards action has to be understanding.

213
0:10:13.467,000 --> 0:10:18,000
She says it's crucial for all of us to understand our connection to this issue

214
0:10:19.02,000 --> 0:10:21,000
even if it's not immediately obvious.

215
0:10:23.096,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Recording) Teri Hunter: It's on our shoulders

216
0:10:25.3,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to make sure that we're not just closing that door

217
0:10:28.885,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and saying, "Well, it's not us."

218
0:10:30.842,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And I think as Jews, you know, we've lived that history:

219
0:10:35.224,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"It's not us."

220
0:10:37.042,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And so if a society closes their back on one section,

221
0:10:41.73,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we've seen what happens.

222
0:10:43.436,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And so it is our responsibility as Jews

223
0:10:46.651,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and as members of this community

224
0:10:50.238,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to educate our community --

225
0:10:53.453,000 --> 0:10:55,000
at least our congregation --

226
0:10:56.382,000 --> 0:10:57,000
to the extent that we're able.

227
0:10:59.477,000 --> 0:11:02,000
EA: I've been using the pronouns "us" and "we"

228
0:11:02.763,000 --> 0:11:04,000
because this is our criminal legal system

229
0:11:05.783,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and our children.

230
0:11:07.583,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We elect the district attorneys,

231
0:11:09.776,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the judges and the legislators who operate these systems

232
0:11:13.844,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for we the people.

233
0:11:15.677,000 --> 0:11:16,000
As a society,

234
0:11:16.988,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we are more willing to risk locking up innocent people

235
0:11:20.613,000 --> 0:11:22,000
than we are to let guilty people go free.

236
0:11:24.187,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We elect politicians who fear being labeled "soft on crime,"

237
0:11:27.72,000 --> 0:11:29,000
encouraging them to pass harsh legislation

238
0:11:30.736,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and allocate enormous resources toward locking people up.

239
0:11:35.452,000 --> 0:11:36,000
When a crime is committed,

240
0:11:37.14,000 --> 0:11:41,000
our hunger for swift retribution has fed a police culture

241
0:11:41.918,000 --> 0:11:43,000
bent on finding culprits fast,

242
0:11:44.782,000 --> 0:11:48,000
often without adequate resources to conduct thorough investigations

243
0:11:49.319,000 --> 0:11:52,000
or strict scrutiny of those investigations.

244
0:11:52.926,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We don't put checks on prosecutors.

245
0:11:56.514,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Across the country, over the last couple of decades,

246
0:11:59.674,000 --> 0:12:03,000
as property and violent crimes have both fell,

247
0:12:03.793,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the number of prosecutors employed and cases they have filed has risen.

248
0:12:09.341,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Prosecutors decide whether or not to take legal action

249
0:12:12.072,000 --> 0:12:14,000
against the people police arrest

250
0:12:14.125,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and they decide what charges to file,

251
0:12:17.146,000 --> 0:12:22,000
directly impacting how much time a defendant potentially faces behind bars.

252
0:12:23.706,000 --> 0:12:26,000
One check we do have on prosecutors is defense.

253
0:12:27.943,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Imagine Lady Liberty:

254
0:12:29.659,000 --> 0:12:31,000
the blindfolded woman holding the scale

255
0:12:32.104,000 --> 0:12:35,000
meant to symbolize the balance in our judicial system.

256
0:12:35.854,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Unfortunately, that scale is tipped.

257
0:12:39.48,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The majority of defendants in our country

258
0:12:41.64,000 --> 0:12:44,000
are represented by government-appointed attorneys.

259
0:12:45.046,000 --> 0:12:49,000
These public defenders receive around 30 percent less funding

260
0:12:49.205,000 --> 0:12:5,000
than district attorneys do,

261
0:12:50.967,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and they often have caseloads far outnumbering

262
0:12:54.148,000 --> 0:12:56,000
what the American Bar Association recommends.

263
0:12:57.466,000 --> 0:12:58,000
As Sheila Phipps said,

264
0:12:59.356,000 --> 0:13:01,000
there are people who belong in prison,

265
0:13:02.313,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but it's hard to tell the guilty from the innocent

266
0:13:05.837,000 --> 0:13:08,000
when everyone's outcomes are so similar.

267
0:13:09.603,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We all want justice.

268
0:13:11.83,000 --> 0:13:14,000
But with the process weighed so heavily against defendants,

269
0:13:15.358,000 --> 0:13:16,000
justice is hard to come by.

270
0:13:18.376,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Our criminal legal system operates for we the people.

271
0:13:22.534,000 --> 0:13:24,000
If we don't like what's going on,

272
0:13:24.886,000 --> 0:13:26,000
it is up to us to change it.

273
0:13:28.196,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you very much.

274
0:13:29.371,000 --> 0:13:35,000
(Applause)

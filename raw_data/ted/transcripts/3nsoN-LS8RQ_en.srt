1
0:00:13.459,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Here's a question we need to rethink together:

2
0:00:17.686,000 --> 0:00:19,000
What should be the role of money

3
0:00:20.127,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and markets in our societies?

4
0:00:23.613,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Today, there are very few things

5
0:00:26.107,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that money can't buy.

6
0:00:28.795,000 --> 0:00:29,000
If you're sentenced to a jail term

7
0:00:30.452,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in Santa Barbara, California,

8
0:00:32.903,000 --> 0:00:33,000
you should know

9
0:00:34.255,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that if you don't like the standard accommodations,

10
0:00:36.97,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you can buy a prison cell upgrade.

11
0:00:41.313,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's true. For how much, do you think?

12
0:00:44.159,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What would you guess?

13
0:00:46.1,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Five hundred dollars?

14
0:00:47.805,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's not the Ritz-Carlton. It's a jail!

15
0:00:51.14,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Eighty-two dollars a night.

16
0:00:53.164,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Eighty-two dollars a night.

17
0:00:55.536,000 --> 0:00:57,000
If you go to an amusement park

18
0:00:57.736,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and don't want to stand in the long lines

19
0:01:00.428,000 --> 0:01:01,000
for the popular rides,

20
0:01:01.884,000 --> 0:01:03,000
there is now a solution.

21
0:01:04.771,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In many theme parks, you can pay extra

22
0:01:09.035,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to jump to the head of the line.

23
0:01:10.649,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They call them Fast Track or VIP tickets.

24
0:01:15.164,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And this isn't only happening in amusement parks.

25
0:01:18.753,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In Washington, D.C., long lines,

26
0:01:21.969,000 --> 0:01:22,000
queues sometimes form

27
0:01:23.909,000 --> 0:01:26,000
for important Congressional hearings.

28
0:01:27.778,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now some people don't like to wait in long queues,

29
0:01:31.283,000 --> 0:01:33,000
maybe overnight, even in the rain.

30
0:01:33.788,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So now, for lobbyists and others

31
0:01:35.785,000 --> 0:01:36,000
who are very keen to attend these hearings

32
0:01:37.591,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but don't like to wait, there are companies,

33
0:01:40.31,000 --> 0:01:42,000
line-standing companies,

34
0:01:42.353,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and you can go to them.

35
0:01:44.216,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You can pay them a certain amount of money,

36
0:01:46.105,000 --> 0:01:49,000
they hire homeless people and others who need a job

37
0:01:49.37,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to stand waiting in the line for as long as it takes,

38
0:01:52.653,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the lobbyist, just before the hearing begins,

39
0:01:55.521,000 --> 0:01:57,000
can take his or her place at the head of the line

40
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:02:,000
and a seat in the front of the room.

41
0:02:01.145,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Paid line standing.

42
0:02:04.224,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's happening, the recourse to market mechanisms

43
0:02:07.806,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and market thinking and market solutions,

44
0:02:10.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in bigger arenas.

45
0:02:13.112,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Take the way we fight our wars.

46
0:02:15.783,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Did you know that, in Iraq and Afghanistan,

47
0:02:18.85,000 --> 0:02:22,000
there were more private military contractors on the ground

48
0:02:22.895,000 --> 0:02:25,000
than there were U.S. military troops?

49
0:02:26.715,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Now this isn't because we had a public debate

50
0:02:29.834,000 --> 0:02:31,000
about whether we wanted to outsource war

51
0:02:32.811,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to private companies,

52
0:02:34.982,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but this is what has happened.

53
0:02:37.689,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Over the past three decades,

54
0:02:40.117,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we have lived through a quiet revolution.

55
0:02:44.215,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We've drifted almost without realizing it

56
0:02:49.182,000 --> 0:02:52,000
from having a market economy

57
0:02:52.43,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to becoming market societies.

58
0:02:56.397,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The difference is this: A market economy is a tool,

59
0:02:59.982,000 --> 0:03:,000
a valuable and effective tool,

60
0:03:01.644,000 --> 0:03:04,000
for organizing productive activity,

61
0:03:04.702,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but a market society is a place where

62
0:03:07.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
almost everything is up for sale.

63
0:03:10.608,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It's a way of life, in which market thinking

64
0:03:14.06,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and market values begin to dominate

65
0:03:16.781,000 --> 0:03:19,000
every aspect of life:

66
0:03:20.305,000 --> 0:03:24,000
personal relations, family life, health, education,

67
0:03:25.04,000 --> 0:03:28,000
politics, law, civic life.

68
0:03:28.339,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, why worry? Why worry about our becoming

69
0:03:33.83,000 --> 0:03:35,000
market societies?

70
0:03:36.376,000 --> 0:03:39,000
For two reasons, I think.

71
0:03:39.48,000 --> 0:03:43,000
One of them has to do with inequality.

72
0:03:44.161,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The more things money can buy,

73
0:03:47.494,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the more affluence, or the lack of it, matters.

74
0:03:51.788,000 --> 0:03:53,000
If the only thing that money determined

75
0:03:54.645,000 --> 0:03:59,000
was access to yachts or fancy vacations or BMWs,

76
0:04:00.334,000 --> 0:04:04,000
then inequality wouldn't matter very much.

77
0:04:04.686,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But when money comes increasingly to govern

78
0:04:08.113,000 --> 0:04:12,000
access to the essentials of the good life --

79
0:04:12.95,000 --> 0:04:15,000
decent health care, access to the best education,

80
0:04:16.876,000 --> 0:04:2,000
political voice and influence in campaigns --

81
0:04:21.746,000 --> 0:04:24,000
when money comes to govern all of those things,

82
0:04:25.326,000 --> 0:04:27,000
inequality matters a great deal.

83
0:04:27.876,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And so the marketization of everything

84
0:04:30.131,000 --> 0:04:33,000
sharpens the sting of inequality

85
0:04:33.701,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and its social and civic consequence.

86
0:04:35.885,000 --> 0:04:37,000
That's one reason to worry.

87
0:04:38.871,000 --> 0:04:4,000
There's a second reason

88
0:04:41.108,000 --> 0:04:44,000
apart from the worry about inequality,

89
0:04:45.007,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and it's this:

90
0:04:47.326,000 --> 0:04:5,000
with some social goods and practices,

91
0:04:51.25,000 --> 0:04:56,000
when market thinking and market values enter,

92
0:04:56.716,000 --> 0:04:58,000
they may change the meaning of those practices

93
0:04:59.488,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and crowd out attitudes and norms

94
0:05:02.837,000 --> 0:05:03,000
worth caring about.

95
0:05:04.786,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'd like to take an example

96
0:05:07.41,000 --> 0:05:1,000
of a controversial use of a market mechanism,

97
0:05:11.136,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a cash incentive, and see what you think about it.

98
0:05:15.881,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Many schools struggle with the challenge

99
0:05:19.046,000 --> 0:05:21,000
of motivating kids, especially kids

100
0:05:21.585,000 --> 0:05:24,000
from disadvantaged backgrounds, to study hard,

101
0:05:25.54,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to do well in school, to apply themselves.

102
0:05:28.579,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Some economists have proposed a market solution:

103
0:05:32.067,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Offer cash incentives to kids for getting good grades

104
0:05:36.126,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or high test scores

105
0:05:38.5,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or for reading books.

106
0:05:40.451,000 --> 0:05:41,000
They've tried this, actually.

107
0:05:42.233,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They've done some experiments

108
0:05:43.518,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in some major American cities.

109
0:05:46.949,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In New York, in Chicago, in Washington, D.C.,

110
0:05:50.596,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they've tried this, offering 50 dollars for an A,

111
0:05:54.307,000 --> 0:05:56,000
35 dollars for a B.

112
0:05:56.499,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In Dallas, Texas, they have a program that offers

113
0:05:59.673,000 --> 0:06:03,000
eight-year-olds two dollars for each book they read.

114
0:06:04.093,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So let's see what -- Some people are in favor,

115
0:06:07.012,000 --> 0:06:1,000
some people are opposed to this cash incentive

116
0:06:10.402,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to motivate achievement.

117
0:06:12.1,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Let's see what people here think about it.

118
0:06:14.737,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Imagine that you are the head of a major school system,

119
0:06:19.245,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and someone comes to you with this proposal.

120
0:06:22.23,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And let's say it's a foundation. They will provide the funds.

121
0:06:24.867,000 --> 0:06:25,000
You don't have to take it out of your budget.

122
0:06:26.733,000 --> 0:06:27,000
How many would be in favor

123
0:06:28.015,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and how many would be opposed to giving it a try?

124
0:06:31.609,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Let's see by a show of hands.

125
0:06:33.205,000 --> 0:06:36,000
First, how many think it might at least be worth a try

126
0:06:36.799,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to see if it would work? Raise your hand.

127
0:06:40.695,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And how many would be opposed? How many would --

128
0:06:43.426,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So the majority here are opposed,

129
0:06:46.24,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but a sizable minority are in favor.

130
0:06:49.222,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Let's have a discussion.

131
0:06:50.791,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Let's start with those of you who object,

132
0:06:53.834,000 --> 0:06:55,000
who would rule it out even before trying.

133
0:06:56.715,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What would be your reason?

134
0:06:58.336,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Who will get our discussion started? Yes?

135
0:07:02.208,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Heike Moses: Hello everyone, I'm Heike,

136
0:07:04.106,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and I think it just kills the intrinsic motivation,

137
0:07:06.873,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so in the respect that children, if they would like to read,

138
0:07:12.021,000 --> 0:07:14,000
you just take this incentive away

139
0:07:14.138,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in just paying them, so it just changes behavior.

140
0:07:17.59,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Michael Sandel: Takes the intrinsic incentive away.

141
0:07:21.008,000 --> 0:07:25,000
What is, or should be, the intrinsic motivation?

142
0:07:25.243,000 --> 0:07:26,000
HM: Well, the intrinsic motivation

143
0:07:26.933,000 --> 0:07:27,000
should be to learn.

144
0:07:28.61,000 --> 0:07:31,000
MS: To learn. HM: To get to know the world.

145
0:07:31.753,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And then, if you stop paying them, what happens then?

146
0:07:34.647,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Then they stop reading?

147
0:07:36.394,000 --> 0:07:39,000
MS: Now, let's see if there's someone who favors,

148
0:07:39.394,000 --> 0:07:41,000
who thinks it's worth trying this.

149
0:07:41.742,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Elizabeth Loftus: I'm Elizabeth Loftus,

150
0:07:43.714,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and you said worth a try, so why not try it

151
0:07:47.844,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and do the experiment and measure things?

152
0:07:51.967,000 --> 0:07:53,000
MS: And measure. And what would you measure?

153
0:07:54.14,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You'd measure how many --

154
0:07:55.861,000 --> 0:07:56,000
EL: How many books they read

155
0:07:57.705,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and how many books they continued to read

156
0:08:00.395,000 --> 0:08:01,000
after you stopped paying them.

157
0:08:02.11,000 --> 0:08:04,000
MS: Oh, after you stopped paying.

158
0:08:04.467,000 --> 0:08:05,000
All right, what about that?

159
0:08:05.821,000 --> 0:08:06,000
HM: To be frank, I just think

160
0:08:07.798,000 --> 0:08:11,000
this is, not to offend anyone, a very American way.

161
0:08:12.431,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

162
0:08:18.903,000 --> 0:08:2,000
MS: All right. What's emerged from this discussion

163
0:08:21.106,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is the following question:

164
0:08:23.226,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Will the cash incentive drive out or corrupt

165
0:08:27.477,000 --> 0:08:3,000
or crowd out the higher motivation,

166
0:08:30.666,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the intrinsic lesson that we hope to convey,

167
0:08:35.46,000 --> 0:08:39,000
which is to learn to love to learn and to read

168
0:08:39.547,000 --> 0:08:41,000
for their own sakes?

169
0:08:41.55,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And people disagree about what the effect will be,

170
0:08:45.647,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but that seems to be the question,

171
0:08:48.304,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that somehow a market mechanism

172
0:08:50.34,000 --> 0:08:54,000
or a cash incentive teaches the wrong lesson,

173
0:08:55.201,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and if it does, what will become of these children later?

174
0:08:58.808,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I should tell you what's happened with these experiments.

175
0:09:02.181,000 --> 0:09:06,000
The cash for good grades has had very mixed results,

176
0:09:06.699,000 --> 0:09:09,000
for the most part has not resulted in higher grades.

177
0:09:09.846,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The two dollars for each book

178
0:09:12.217,000 --> 0:09:15,000
did lead those kids to read more books.

179
0:09:15.518,000 --> 0:09:17,000
It also led them to read shorter books.

180
0:09:18.162,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

181
0:09:22.34,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But the real question is,

182
0:09:23.99,000 --> 0:09:25,000
what will become of these kids later?

183
0:09:26.562,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Will they have learned that reading is a chore,

184
0:09:28.676,000 --> 0:09:3,000
a form of piecework to be done for pay, that's the worry,

185
0:09:31.648,000 --> 0:09:35,000
or may it lead them to read maybe for the wrong reason initially

186
0:09:36.265,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but then lead them to fall in love with reading for its own sake?

187
0:09:41.011,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now, what this, even this brief debate, brings out

188
0:09:45.832,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is something that many economists overlook.

189
0:09:49.65,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Economists often assume

190
0:09:51.746,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that markets are inert,

191
0:09:54.37,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that they do not touch or taint the goods they exchange.

192
0:09:58.736,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Market exchange, they assume,

193
0:10:01.84,000 --> 0:10:03,000
doesn't change the meaning or value

194
0:10:04.3,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of the goods being exchanged.

195
0:10:05.583,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This may be true enough

196
0:10:07.159,000 --> 0:10:09,000
if we're talking about material goods.

197
0:10:09.576,000 --> 0:10:11,000
If you sell me a flat screen television

198
0:10:12.082,000 --> 0:10:14,000
or give me one as a gift,

199
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
it will be the same good.

200
0:10:15.62,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It will work the same either way.

201
0:10:18.106,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But the same may not be true

202
0:10:20.882,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if we're talking about nonmaterial goods

203
0:10:23.214,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and social practices such as teaching and learning

204
0:10:27.164,000 --> 0:10:3,000
or engaging together in civic life.

205
0:10:30.896,000 --> 0:10:33,000
In those domains, bringing market mechanisms

206
0:10:34.317,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and cash incentives may undermine

207
0:10:38.235,000 --> 0:10:42,000
or crowd out nonmarket values and attitudes

208
0:10:42.555,000 --> 0:10:44,000
worth caring about.

209
0:10:44.914,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Once we see

210
0:10:47.138,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that markets and commerce,

211
0:10:50.849,000 --> 0:10:53,000
when extended beyond the material domain,

212
0:10:54.51,000 --> 0:10:59,000
can change the character of the goods themselves,

213
0:10:59.96,000 --> 0:11:01,000
can change the meaning of the social practices,

214
0:11:02.521,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as in the example of teaching and learning,

215
0:11:05.985,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we have to ask where markets belong

216
0:11:10.631,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and where they don't,

217
0:11:12.562,000 --> 0:11:14,000
where they may actually undermine

218
0:11:14.935,000 --> 0:11:17,000
values and attitudes worth caring about.

219
0:11:17.938,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But to have this debate,

220
0:11:21.2,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we have to do something we're not very good at,

221
0:11:24.698,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and that is to reason together in public

222
0:11:28.18,000 --> 0:11:31,000
about the value and the meaning

223
0:11:31.42,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of the social practices we prize,

224
0:11:35.424,000 --> 0:11:37,000
from our bodies to family life

225
0:11:37.929,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to personal relations to health

226
0:11:39.882,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to teaching and learning to civic life.

227
0:11:43.595,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now these are controversial questions,

228
0:11:46.579,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and so we tend to shrink from them.

229
0:11:49.339,000 --> 0:11:51,000
In fact, during the past three decades,

230
0:11:52.259,000 --> 0:11:54,000
when market reasoning and market thinking

231
0:11:54.756,000 --> 0:11:57,000
have gathered force and gained prestige,

232
0:11:58.244,000 --> 0:12:01,000
our public discourse during this time

233
0:12:01.726,000 --> 0:12:03,000
has become hollowed out,

234
0:12:03.961,000 --> 0:12:06,000
empty of larger moral meaning.

235
0:12:07.667,000 --> 0:12:1,000
For fear of disagreement, we shrink from these questions.

236
0:12:10.879,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But once we see that markets

237
0:12:14.406,000 --> 0:12:16,000
change the character of goods,

238
0:12:16.579,000 --> 0:12:2,000
we have to debate among ourselves

239
0:12:21.146,000 --> 0:12:23,000
these bigger questions

240
0:12:23.483,000 --> 0:12:24,000
about how to value goods.

241
0:12:25.443,000 --> 0:12:27,000
One of the most corrosive effects

242
0:12:28.438,000 --> 0:12:3,000
of putting a price on everything

243
0:12:31.225,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is on commonality,

244
0:12:33.594,000 --> 0:12:36,000
the sense that we are all in it together.

245
0:12:36.772,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Against the background of rising inequality,

246
0:12:41.495,000 --> 0:12:44,000
marketizing every aspect of life

247
0:12:45.362,000 --> 0:12:5,000
leads to a condition where those who are affluent

248
0:12:50.913,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and those who are of modest means

249
0:12:52.763,000 --> 0:12:56,000
increasingly live separate lives.

250
0:12:57.145,000 --> 0:13:,000
We live and work and shop and play

251
0:13:00.364,000 --> 0:13:01,000
in different places.

252
0:13:02.095,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Our children go to different schools.

253
0:13:05.211,000 --> 0:13:07,000
This isn't good for democracy,

254
0:13:07.76,000 --> 0:13:09,000
nor is it a satisfying way to live,

255
0:13:10.683,000 --> 0:13:13,000
even for those of us who can afford

256
0:13:13.963,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to buy our way to the head of the line.

257
0:13:16.718,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Here's why.

258
0:13:18.491,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Democracy does not require perfect equality,

259
0:13:23.42,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but what it does require

260
0:13:25.183,000 --> 0:13:28,000
is that citizens share in a common life.

261
0:13:28.811,000 --> 0:13:3,000
What matters is that people

262
0:13:31.44,000 --> 0:13:32,000
of different social backgrounds

263
0:13:33.209,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and different walks of life

264
0:13:34.933,000 --> 0:13:36,000
encounter one another,

265
0:13:37.217,000 --> 0:13:39,000
bump up against one another

266
0:13:39.24,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in the ordinary course of life,

267
0:13:42.73,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because this is what teaches us

268
0:13:45.454,000 --> 0:13:48,000
to negotiate and to abide our differences.

269
0:13:49.126,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And this is how we come to care for the common good.

270
0:13:53.34,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And so, in the end, the question of markets

271
0:13:56.69,000 --> 0:14:,000
is not mainly an economic question.

272
0:14:00.83,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It's really a question of how we want to live together.

273
0:14:04.918,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Do we want a society where everything is up for sale,

274
0:14:09.458,000 --> 0:14:12,000
or are there certain moral and civic goods

275
0:14:12.97,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that markets do not honor

276
0:14:14.899,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and money cannot buy?

277
0:14:17.693,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Thank you very much.

278
0:14:19.155,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

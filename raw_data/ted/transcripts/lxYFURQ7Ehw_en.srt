1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Well, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
especially at the end of these balloon flights

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
around the world I did with Brian Jones.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
When I took this picture,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And on the other side there was a rising sun.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So, you see that on the other side of ice

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you have the unknown,

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
you have the non-obvious,

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
you have the non-seen,

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for the people who don't dare

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to go through the ice.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
There are so many people

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
who prefer to suffer in the ice they know

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
instead of taking the risk of going through the ice

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to see what there is on the other side.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I think that's one of the main problems of our society.

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but so many other people learn,

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that the unknown, the doubts,

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the question marks are dangerous.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we have to resist to the changes.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We have to keep everything under control.

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Well, the unknown is part of life.

25
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Because in the balloon, like in life,

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we go very well in unforeseen directions.

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We want to go in a direction,

29
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but the winds push us in another direction, like in life.

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And as long as we fight horizontally,

31
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
against life, against the winds,

32
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
against what's happening to us,

33
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
life is a nightmare.

34
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
How do we steer a balloon?

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
By understanding that the atmosphere

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is made out of several different layers of wind

37
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which all have different direction.

38
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,

39
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in life, or in the balloon,

40
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we have to change altitude.

41
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Changing altitude, in life,

42
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that means raising to another psychological, philosophical,

43
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
spiritual level.

44
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But how do we do that?

45
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In ballooning, or in life,

46
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
how do we change altitude?

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
How do we go from the metaphor

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to something more practical that we can really

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
use every day?

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Well, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Sand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.

53
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I think in life it should be exactly like this.

54
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You know, when people speak about pioneering spirit,

55
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
very often they believe that pioneers

56
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
are the ones who have new ideas.

57
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's not true.

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because new ideas are so easy to have.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
with a lot of new ideas.

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
No, the pioneer is the one who

63
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Habits, certainties,

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
convictions, exclamation marks,

66
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
paradigms, dogmas.

67
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And when we are able to do that,

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
what happens?

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Life is not anymore

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
just one line going in one direction

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in one dimension. No.

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines

73
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that go in all the possible directions

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in three dimensions.

75
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to explore this vertical axis.

77
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but in life itself.

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Explore this vertical axis, that means

80
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
explore all the different ways to do,

81
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
all the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,

82
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.

83
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
This is very practical.

84
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This can be in politics.

85
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This can be in spirituality.

86
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This can be in environment,

87
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in finance, in education of children.

88
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I deeply believe

89
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that life is a much greater adventure

90
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
if we manage to do politics

91
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
without the trench between the left and the right wing.

92
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Because we will throw away these political dogmas.

93
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment

94
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
if we get rid -- if we throw overboard

95
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.

96
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And that we can aim for much higher spirituality

97
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
if we get rid of the religious dogmas.

98
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Throwing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.

99
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Well, these basically are things I believed in such a long time.

100
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon

101
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to be invited to talk about it.

102
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Applause)

104
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop

105
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and which altitude to take. Sometime we need

106
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
friends, family members or a psychiatrist.

107
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Well, in balloons we need weather men,

108
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,

109
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
at which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.

110
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But sometimes it's very paradoxical.

111
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world,

112
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the weather man asked us, one day, to fly

113
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
quite low, and very slow.

114
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it

115
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
around the world at that speed.

116
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.

117
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I was so proud to have found that jetstream

118
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that I called the weather man,

119
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and I told him, "Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?

120
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We fly twice the speed you predicted."

121
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately

122
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in order to slow down."

123
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And I started to argue. I said, "I'm not going to do that.

124
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We don't have enough gas to fly so slow."

125
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left

126
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours

127
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you will turn left and end up at the North Pole.

128
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And then he asked me --

130
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and this is something I will never forget in my life --

131
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
he just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there.

132
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What do you really want? You want to go very fast

133
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?

134
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Applause)

136
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And this is why you need weathermen.

137
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This is why you need people with long-term vision.

138
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And this is precisely what fails

139
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in the political visions we have now,

140
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in the political governments.

141
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We are burning, as you heard,

142
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
so much energy,

143
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
not understanding that such an unsustainable

144
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
way of life cannot last for long.

145
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So, we went down actually.

146
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears

147
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
because we had no idea how the little amount of gas

148
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we had in the balloon

149
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.

150
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.

151
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And actually this is where the adventure really started.

152
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
When we were flying over the Sahara and India

153
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it was nice holidays.

154
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.

155
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In the middle of the Pacific,

156
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,

157
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you cannot go back.

158
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
That's a crisis.

159
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
That's the moment when you have to wake up

160
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
from the automatic way of thinking.

161
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
That's the moment when you have to motivate

162
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
your inner potential,

163
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
your creativity.

164
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That's when you throw out all the ballast,

165
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
all the certainties,

166
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in order to adapt to the new situation.

167
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And actually, we changed completely our flight plan.

168
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We changed completely our strategy.

169
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.

170
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But if I show you this picture

171
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it's not to tell you how happy we were.

172
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's to show you how much gas was left

173
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
in the last bottles.

174
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.

175
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We landed with 40 kilos.

176
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
When I saw that, I made a promise to myself.

177
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,

178
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it would be with no fuel,

179
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
independent from fossil energies,

180
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in order to be safe,

181
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
not to be threatened by the fuel gauge.

182
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I had no idea how it was possible.

183
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.

184
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced

185
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,

186
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,

187
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,

188
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
with Chuck Yeager's 61,

189
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I had really a thought then.

190
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.

191
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It allowed to do all those things there.

192
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But it will not be possible in the future any more.

193
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It takes too much energy. It will cost too much.

194
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
It will be prohibited

195
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because we'll have to save our natural resources

196
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in a few decades from now.

197
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So how can we perpetuate

198
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
this pioneering spirit

199
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
with something that will be independent from fossil energy?

200
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And this is when the project Solar Impulse

201
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
really started to

202
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
turn in my head.

203
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And I think it's a nice metaphor also

204
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
for the 21st century.

205
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Pioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.

206
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Not to conquer the planet or space,

207
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
not anymore, it has been done,

208
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but rather to improve the quality of life.

209
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
How can we go through the ice of certainty

210
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in order to make the most incredible a possible thing?

211
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
What is today completely impossible --

212
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
get rid of our dependency on fossil energy.

213
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
If you tell to people, we want to be independent

214
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from fossil energy in our world,

215
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
people will laugh at you, except here,

216
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
where crazy people are invited to speak.

217
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

218
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So, the idea is that if we fly around the world

219
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in a solar powered airplane,

220
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
using absolutely no fuel,

221
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
nobody ever could say in the future

222
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that it's impossible to do it

223
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
for cars, for heating systems,

224
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
for computers, and so on and so on.

225
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Well, solar power airplanes are not new.

226
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They have flown in the past, but without

227
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
saving capabilities, without batteries.

228
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Which means that they have more proven

229
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the limits of renewable energies

230
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
than the potential of it.

231
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
If we want to show the potential,

232
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
we have to fly day and night.

233
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
That means to load the batteries during the flight,

234
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in order to spend the night on the batteries,

235
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and fly the next day again.

236
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It has been made, already, on remote controlled

237
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
little airplane models, without pilots.

238
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But it stays an anecdote

239
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
because the public couldn't identify to it.

240
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
I think you need a pilot in the plane

241
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that can talk to the universities,

242
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that can talk to students,

243
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
talk to politicians during the flight,

244
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and really make it a human adventure.

245
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
For that, unfortunately,

246
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
four meters wingspan is not enough.

247
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
You need 64 meter wingspan.

248
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,

249
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.

250
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Why that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.

251
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
That's for sure.

252
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,

253
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we can produce the same energy

254
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
than 200 little lightbulbs.

255
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.

256
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world

257
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
with an airplane that uses

258
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?

259
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
People will tell you it's impossible,

260
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and that's exactly why we try to do it.

261
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg

262
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
six years ago.

263
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We have now 70 people in the team working on it.

264
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We have gone through the stages of simulation, design,

265
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
computing, preparing the construction

266
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
of the first prototype.

267
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
That has been achieved after two years of work.

268
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Cockpit, propeller, engine.

269
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Just the fuselage here, it's so light.

270
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's not designed by an artist, but it could be.

271
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
50 kilos for the entire fuselage.

272
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Couple of kilos more for the wing spars.

273
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
This is the complete structure of the airplane.

274
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And one month ago we have unveiled it.

275
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You cannot imagine how it is for a team

276
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
who has been working six years on it

277
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to show that it's not only a dream and a vision,

278
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
it's a real airplane.

279
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
A real airplane that we could finally present.

280
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And what's the goal now?

281
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The goal is to take off,

282
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
end of this year for the first test,

283
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but mainly next year, spring or summer,

284
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
take off, on our own power,

285
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
without additional help, without being towed,

286
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
climb to 9,000 meters altitude.

287
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
The same time we load the batteries,

288
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,

289
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we arrive at the beginning of the night.

290
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And there, there will be just one goal, just one:

291
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.

292
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
(Laughter)

293
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And this is exactly the symbol of our world.

294
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
If our airplane is too heavy,

295
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
if the pilot wastes energy,

296
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
we'll never make it through the night.

297
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And in our world, if we keep on spoiling,

298
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
wasting our energy resources,

299
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
if we keep on building things that consume so much energy

300
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that most of the companies now go bankrupt,

301
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation

302
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
without a major problem.

303
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.

304
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
I don't think it will transport 200 people

305
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in the next years.

306
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,

307
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the payload was also just sufficient

308
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
for one person and some fuel.

309
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And 20 years later there were 200 people

310
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in every airplane crossing the Atlantic.

311
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So, we have to start,

312
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and show the example.

313
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
A little bit like on this picture here.

314
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
This is a painting from Magritte,

315
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in the museum in Holland that I love so much.

316
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's a pipe, and it's written, "This is not a pipe."

317
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This is not an airplane.

318
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
This is a symbol of what we can achieve

319
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
when we believe in the impossible,

320
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
when we have a team,

321
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
when we have pioneering spirit,

322
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and especially when we understand

323
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that all the certainties we have

324
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
should be thrown overboard.

325
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
What pleases me very much

326
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly

327
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
around the world with no fuel

328
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
in order to have our message been understood.

329
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre

330
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
to talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it,

331
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
invited by politicians, invited in energy forums,

332
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in order to show that it's not anymore

333
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
completely stupid

334
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to think about getting rid of the dependency

335
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
on fossil energies.

336
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So, through speeches like this one today,

337
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
through interviews, through meetings,

338
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
our goal is to get as many people possible on the team.

339
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The success will not come

340
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
if we "just," quote, unquote,

341
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.

342
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
No, the success will come

343
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
if enough people are motivated

344
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
to do exactly the same in their daily life,

345
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
save energy, go to renewables.

346
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today,

347
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
we can save between 30 and 50 percent

348
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
of the energy of a country in Europe,

349
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and we can solve half of the rest with renewables.

350
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
It leaves 25 or 30 percent for

351
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
oil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever.

352
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
This is acceptable.

353
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
This is why all the people who believe

354
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
in this type of spirit

355
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
are welcome to be on that team.

356
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
You can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe

357
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to just be informed of what we're doing.

358
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But much more, to get advices,

359
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
to give your comments, to spread the word

360
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that if it's possible in the air,

361
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
of course it's possible in the ground.

362
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And each time we have some ice in the future,

363
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
we have to know that life will be great,

364
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and the success will be brilliant

365
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice,

366
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to go through the obstacle,

367
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.

368
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
So, you see, this is what we're doing on our side.

369
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Everyone has his goal, has his dreams,

370
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
has his visions.

371
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
The question I leave you with now

372
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
is which is the ballast

373
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
you would like to throw overboard?

374
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Which will be the altitude at which

375
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
you would like to fly in your life,

376
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
to get to the success that you wish to have,

377
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
to get to the point that really belongs to you,

378
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
with the potential you have,

379
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and the one you can really fulfill?

380
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Because the most renewable energy we have

381
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
is our own potential, and our own passion.

382
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure

383
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
in the wings of the future. Thank you.

384
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.597,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When you're a child,

2
0:00:14.478,000 --> 0:00:17,000
anything and everything is possible.

3
0:00:18.147,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The challenge, so often, is hanging on to that as we grow up.

4
0:00:22.596,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And as a four-year-old,

5
0:00:24.181,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I had the opportunity to sail for the first time.

6
0:00:27.671,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I will never forget the excitement as we closed the coast.

7
0:00:31.878,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I will never forget

8
0:00:33.643,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the feeling of adventure as I climbed on board the boat

9
0:00:36.638,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and stared into her tiny cabin for the first time.

10
0:00:40.28,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But the most amazing feeling was the feeling of freedom,

11
0:00:43.488,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the feeling that I felt when we hoisted her sails.

12
0:00:47.226,000 --> 0:00:49,000
As a four-year-old child,

13
0:00:49.6,000 --> 0:00:52,000
it was the greatest sense of freedom that I could ever imagine.

14
0:00:53.449,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I made my mind up there and then that one day, somehow,

15
0:00:56.792,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I was going to sail around the world.

16
0:01:00.53,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So I did what I could in my life to get closer to that dream.

17
0:01:04.36,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Age 10, it was saving my school dinner money change.

18
0:01:07.426,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Every single day for eight years, I had mashed potato and baked beans,

19
0:01:11.344,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which cost 4p each, and gravy was free.

20
0:01:13.997,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Every day I would pile up the change on the top of my money box,

21
0:01:17.014,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and when that pile reached a pound, I would drop it in

22
0:01:19.604,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and cross off one of the 100 squares I'd drawn on a piece of paper.

23
0:01:24.167,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Finally, I bought a tiny dinghy.

24
0:01:27.418,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal.

25
0:01:31.381,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I read every book I could on sailing,

26
0:01:34.5,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and then eventually, having been told by my school

27
0:01:37.495,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I wasn't clever enough to be a vet,

28
0:01:39.771,000 --> 0:01:43,000
left school age 17 to begin my apprenticeship in sailing.

29
0:01:44.739,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So imagine how it felt just four years later

30
0:01:48.83,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to be sitting in a boardroom

31
0:01:50.506,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in front of someone who I knew could make that dream come true.

32
0:01:54.895,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I felt like my life depended on that moment,

33
0:01:58.003,000 --> 0:02:,000
and incredibly, he said yes.

34
0:02:00.644,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I could barely contain my excitement as I sat in that first design meeting

35
0:02:04.754,000 --> 0:02:06,000
designing a boat on which I was going to sail

36
0:02:07.564,000 --> 0:02:09,000
solo nonstop around the world.

37
0:02:10.443,000 --> 0:02:12,000
From that first meeting to the finish line of the race,

38
0:02:13.299,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it was everything I'd ever imagined.

39
0:02:15.597,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Just like in my dreams, there were amazing parts and tough parts.

40
0:02:19.498,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We missed an iceberg by 20 feet.

41
0:02:21.658,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Nine times, I climbed to the top of her 90-foot mast.

42
0:02:24.931,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We were blown on our side in the Southern Ocean.

43
0:02:27.3,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But the sunsets, the wildlife, and the remoteness

44
0:02:30.272,000 --> 0:02:33,000
were absolutely breathtaking.

45
0:02:33.857,000 --> 0:02:35,000
After three months at sea, age just 24,

46
0:02:36.504,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I finished in second position.

47
0:02:39.359,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I'd loved it, so much so that within six months

48
0:02:42.75,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I decided to go around the world again, but this time not in a race:

49
0:02:47.326,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to try to be the fastest person ever to sail solo nonstop around the world.

50
0:02:52.789,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now for this, I needed a different craft:

51
0:02:55.65,000 --> 0:02:58,000
bigger, wider, faster, more powerful.

52
0:02:59.244,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Just to give that boat some scale, I could climb inside her mast

53
0:03:02.959,000 --> 0:03:03,000
all the way to the top.

54
0:03:04.863,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Seventy-five foot long, 60 foot wide.

55
0:03:08.253,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I affectionately called her Moby.

56
0:03:10.552,000 --> 0:03:11,000
She was a multihull.

57
0:03:12.311,000 --> 0:03:15,000
When we built her, no one had ever made it solo nonstop

58
0:03:15.892,000 --> 0:03:17,000
around the world in one, though many had tried,

59
0:03:18.191,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but whilst we built her, a Frenchman took a boat 25 percent bigger than her

60
0:03:23.063,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and not only did he make it, but he took the record from 93 days

61
0:03:26.852,000 --> 0:03:28,000
right down to 72.

62
0:03:29.568,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The bar was now much, much higher.

63
0:03:32.155,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And these boats were exciting to sail.

64
0:03:34.105,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This was a training sail off the French coast.

65
0:03:37.472,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This I know well because I was one of the five crew members on board.

66
0:03:41.187,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Five seconds is all it took from everything being fine

67
0:03:45.538,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater,

68
0:03:48.617,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and that five seconds goes quickly.

69
0:03:50.776,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Just see how far below those guys the sea is.

70
0:03:53.679,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Imagine that alone in the Southern Ocean

71
0:03:57.792,000 --> 0:04:01,000
plunged into icy water, thousands of miles away from land.

72
0:04:03.27,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It was Christmas Day.

73
0:04:05.56,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I was forging into the Southern Ocean underneath Australia.

74
0:04:08.933,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The conditions were horrendous.

75
0:04:11.55,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I was approaching a part in the ocean

76
0:04:13.531,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which was 2,000 miles away from the nearest town.

77
0:04:17.432,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The nearest land was Antarctica, and the nearest people

78
0:04:20.311,000 --> 0:04:22,000
would be those manning the European Space Station above me.

79
0:04:23.18,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:24.56,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You really are in the middle of nowhere.

81
0:04:27.369,000 --> 0:04:28,000
If you need help,

82
0:04:29.18,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and you're still alive,

83
0:04:30.736,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it takes four days for a ship to get to you

84
0:04:33.731,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and then four days for that ship to get you back to port.

85
0:04:37.145,000 --> 0:04:39,000
No helicopter can reach you out there,

86
0:04:39.466,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and no plane can land.

87
0:04:41.31,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We are forging ahead of a huge storm.

88
0:04:44.944,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Within it, there was 80 knots of wind,

89
0:04:47.37,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which was far too much wind for the boat and I to cope with.

90
0:04:50.296,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The waves were already 40 to 50 feet high,

91
0:04:53.337,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the spray from the breaking crests

92
0:04:55.427,000 --> 0:04:58,000
was blown horizontally like snow in a blizzard.

93
0:04:58.492,000 --> 0:05:01,000
If we didn't sail fast enough, we'd be engulfed by that storm,

94
0:05:02.37,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and either capsized or smashed to pieces.

95
0:05:05.527,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We were quite literally hanging on for our lives

96
0:05:08.314,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and doing so on a knife edge.

97
0:05:11.518,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The speed I so desperately needed brought with it danger.

98
0:05:15.351,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We all know what it's like driving a car 20 miles an hour, 30, 40.

99
0:05:19.575,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's not too stressful. We can concentrate.

100
0:05:22.454,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We can turn on the radio.

101
0:05:24.242,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Take that 50, 60, 70, accelerate through to 80, 90, 100 miles an hour.

102
0:05:28.7,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now you have white knuckles and you're gripping the steering wheel.

103
0:05:31.974,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now take that car off road at night

104
0:05:34.537,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and remove the windscreen wipers, the windscreen,

105
0:05:36.873,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the headlights and the brakes.

106
0:05:38.498,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That's what it's like in the Southern Ocean.

107
0:05:40.704,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

108
0:05:45.172,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You could imagine

109
0:05:46.041,000 --> 0:05:48,000
it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation,

110
0:05:48.831,000 --> 0:05:49,000
even as a passenger.

111
0:05:50.781,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But you're not a passenger.

112
0:05:52.306,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You're alone on a boat you can barely stand up in,

113
0:05:54.705,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and you have to make every single decision on board.

114
0:05:57.213,000 --> 0:06:,000
I was absolutely exhausted, physically and mentally.

115
0:06:00.487,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Eight sail changes in 12 hours.

116
0:06:02.6,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The mainsail weighed three times my body weight,

117
0:06:05.13,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and after each change,

118
0:06:06.827,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I would collapse on the floor soaked with sweat

119
0:06:09.124,000 --> 0:06:13,000
with this freezing Southern Ocean air burning the back of my throat.

120
0:06:13.721,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But out there, those lowest of the lows

121
0:06:16.276,000 --> 0:06:19,000
are so often contrasted with the highest of the highs.

122
0:06:19.596,000 --> 0:06:23,000
A few days later, we came out of the back of the low.

123
0:06:23.659,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Against all odds, we'd been able to drive ahead of the record

124
0:06:27.397,000 --> 0:06:29,000
within that depression.

125
0:06:29.464,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The sky cleared, the rain stopped,

126
0:06:32.25,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and our heartbeat, the monstrous seas around us were transformed

127
0:06:36.569,000 --> 0:06:39,000
into the most beautiful moonlit mountains.

128
0:06:40.168,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's hard to explain, but you enter a different mode when you head out there.

129
0:06:44.765,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Your boat is your entire world,

130
0:06:46.75,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and what you take with you when you leave is all you have.

131
0:06:49.595,000 --> 0:06:52,000
If I said to you all now, "Go off into Vancouver

132
0:06:52.612,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and find everything you will need for your survival for the next three months,"

133
0:06:56.348,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that's quite a task.

134
0:06:58.116,000 --> 0:07:,000
That's food, fuel, clothes,

135
0:07:00.554,000 --> 0:07:02,000
even toilet roll and toothpaste.

136
0:07:02.969,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's what we do,

137
0:07:04.432,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and when we leave we manage it

138
0:07:06.336,000 --> 0:07:09,000
down to the last drop of diesel and the last packet of food.

139
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:11,000
No experience in my life

140
0:07:11.833,000 --> 0:07:14,000
could have given me a better understanding of the definition of the word "finite."

141
0:07:15.74,000 --> 0:07:17,000
What we have out there is all we have.

142
0:07:17.852,000 --> 0:07:18,000
There is no more.

143
0:07:19.571,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And never in my life had I ever translated that definition of finite

144
0:07:22.891,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that I'd felt on board to anything outside of sailing

145
0:07:26.211,000 --> 0:07:3,000
until I stepped off the boat at the finish line having broken that record.

146
0:07:30.809,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

147
0:07:36.265,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Suddenly I connected the dots.

148
0:07:38.935,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Our global economy is no different.

149
0:07:41.774,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It's entirely dependent on finite materials

150
0:07:44.276,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we only have once in the history of humanity.

151
0:07:46.864,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And it was a bit like seeing something you weren't expecting under a stone

152
0:07:50.638,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and having two choices:

153
0:07:52.147,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I either put that stone to one side

154
0:07:54.701,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and learn more about it, or I put that stone back

155
0:07:58.114,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and I carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world.

156
0:08:02.526,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I chose the first.

157
0:08:04.128,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I put it to one side and I began a new journey of learning,

158
0:08:07.611,000 --> 0:08:1,000
speaking to chief executives, experts, scientists, economists

159
0:08:11.117,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to try to understand just how our global economy works.

160
0:08:14.739,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And my curiosity took me to some extraordinary places.

161
0:08:18.431,000 --> 0:08:21,000
This photo was taken in the burner of a coal-fired power station.

162
0:08:23.183,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I was fascinated by coal, fundamental to our global energy needs,

163
0:08:26.317,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but also very close to my family.

164
0:08:29.274,000 --> 0:08:31,000
My great-grandfather was a coal miner,

165
0:08:31.28,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and he spent 50 years of his life underground.

166
0:08:35.52,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This is a photo of him, and when you see that photo,

167
0:08:38.315,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you see someone from another era.

168
0:08:40.8,000 --> 0:08:43,000
No one wears trousers with a waistband quite that high

169
0:08:43.818,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in this day and age. (Laughter)

170
0:08:46.303,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But yet, that's me with my great-grandfather,

171
0:08:48.973,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and by the way, they are not his real ears. (Laughter)

172
0:08:53.106,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We were close. I remember sitting on his knee listening to his mining stories.

173
0:08:57.564,000 --> 0:08:59,000
He talked of the camaraderie underground,

174
0:08:59.816,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and the fact that the miners used to save the crusts of their sandwiches

175
0:09:03.253,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to give to the ponies they worked with underground.

176
0:09:06.341,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It was like it was yesterday.

177
0:09:08.732,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And on my journey of learning,

178
0:09:10.52,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I went to the World Coal Association website,

179
0:09:12.842,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and there in the middle of the homepage, it said,

180
0:09:15.164,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"We have about 118 years of coal left."

181
0:09:18.322,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And I thought to myself, well, that's well outside my lifetime,

182
0:09:21.456,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and a much greater figure than the predictions for oil.

183
0:09:24.335,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But I did the math, and I realized that my great-grandfather

184
0:09:27.4,000 --> 0:09:31,000
had been born exactly 118 years before that year,

185
0:09:31.974,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and I sat on his knee until I was 11 years old,

186
0:09:34.737,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and I realized it's nothing

187
0:09:36.641,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in time, nor in history.

188
0:09:38.963,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And it made me make a decision I never thought I would make:

189
0:09:42.121,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to leave the sport of solo sailing behind me

190
0:09:44.466,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and focus on the greatest challenge I'd ever come across:

191
0:09:47.531,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the future of our global economy.

192
0:09:49.861,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I quickly realized it wasn't just about energy.

193
0:09:52.57,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It was also materials.

194
0:09:54.613,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In 2008, I picked up a scientific study

195
0:09:56.772,000 --> 0:09:58,000
looking at how many years we have

196
0:09:58.816,000 --> 0:10:,000
of valuable materials to extract from the ground:

197
0:10:01.532,000 --> 0:10:05,000
copper, 61; tin, zinc, 40; silver, 29.

198
0:10:05.921,000 --> 0:10:09,000
These figures couldn't be exact, but we knew those materials were finite.

199
0:10:09.937,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We only have them once.

200
0:10:11.674,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And yet, our speed that we've used these materials has increased rapidly,

201
0:10:15.208,000 --> 0:10:16,000
exponentially.

202
0:10:16.95,000 --> 0:10:18,000
With more people in the world with more stuff,

203
0:10:19.806,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we've effectively seen 100 years of price declines

204
0:10:22.58,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years.

205
0:10:25.425,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And this affects all of us.

206
0:10:27.212,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's brought huge volatility in prices,

207
0:10:29.232,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so much so that in 2011,

208
0:10:32.081,000 --> 0:10:34,000
your average European car manufacturer

209
0:10:34.619,000 --> 0:10:36,000
saw a raw material price increase

210
0:10:37.173,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of 500 million Euros,

211
0:10:39.379,000 --> 0:10:41,000
wiping away half their operating profits

212
0:10:41.701,000 --> 0:10:44,000
through something they have absolutely no control over.

213
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And the more I learned, the more I started to change my own life.

214
0:10:48.56,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I started traveling less, doing less, using less.

215
0:10:50.849,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It felt like actually doing less was what we had to do.

216
0:10:54.39,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But it sat uneasy with me.

217
0:10:56.74,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It didn't feel right.

218
0:10:57.862,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It felt like we were buying ourselves time.

219
0:11:00.358,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We were eking things out a bit longer.

220
0:11:02.25,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Even if everybody changed, it wouldn't solve the problem.

221
0:11:05.477,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It wouldn't fix the system.

222
0:11:07.521,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It was vital in the transition, but what fascinated me was,

223
0:11:10.562,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in the transition to what? What could actually work?

224
0:11:14.951,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It struck me that the system itself, the framework within which we live,

225
0:11:19.246,000 --> 0:11:21,000
is fundamentally flawed,

226
0:11:21.545,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and I realized ultimately

227
0:11:24.804,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that our operating system, the way our economy functions,

228
0:11:27.837,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the way our economy's been built, is a system in itself.

229
0:11:31.32,000 --> 0:11:33,000
At sea, I had to understand complex systems.

230
0:11:34.222,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I had to take multiple inputs,

231
0:11:36.1,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I had to process them,

232
0:11:37.612,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and I had to understand the system to win.

233
0:11:40.5,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I had to make sense of it.

234
0:11:42.233,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And as I looked at our global economy, I realized it too is that system,

235
0:11:46.296,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but it's a system that effectively can't run in the long term.

236
0:11:50.708,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And I realized we've been perfecting what's effectively a linear economy

237
0:11:54.469,000 --> 0:11:55,000
for 150 years,

238
0:11:56.339,000 --> 0:11:58,000
where we take a material out of the ground,

239
0:11:58.37,000 --> 0:12:,000
we make something out of it, and then ultimately

240
0:12:00.878,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that product gets thrown away, and yes, we do recycle some of it,

241
0:12:04.152,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but more an attempt to get out what we can at the end,

242
0:12:07.147,000 --> 0:12:09,000
not by design.

243
0:12:09.353,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's an economy that fundamentally can't run in the long term,

244
0:12:12.557,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and if we know that we have finite materials,

245
0:12:15.59,000 --> 0:12:18,000
why would we build an economy that would effectively use things up,

246
0:12:18.919,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that would create waste?

247
0:12:20.777,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Life itself has existed for billions of years

248
0:12:23.702,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and has continually adapted to use materials effectively.

249
0:12:27.324,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's a complex system, but within it, there is no waste.

250
0:12:30.645,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Everything is metabolized.

251
0:12:33.244,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's not a linear economy at all, but circular.

252
0:12:37.934,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And I felt like the child in the garden.

253
0:12:40.931,000 --> 0:12:44,000
For the first time on this new journey, I could see exactly where we were headed.

254
0:12:45.598,000 --> 0:12:48,000
If we could build an economy that would use things rather than use them up,

255
0:12:49.382,000 --> 0:12:52,000
we could build a future that really could work in the long term.

256
0:12:52.61,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I was excited.

257
0:12:54.514,000 --> 0:12:56,000
This was something to work towards.

258
0:12:56.673,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We knew exactly where we were headed. We just had to work out how to get there,

259
0:13:00.45,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and it was exactly with this in mind

260
0:13:02.38,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that we created the Ellen MacArthur Foundation in September 2010.

261
0:13:07.485,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Many schools of thought fed our thinking and pointed to this model:

262
0:13:11.348,000 --> 0:13:15,000
industrial symbiosis, performance economy, sharing economy, biomimicry,

263
0:13:15.968,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and of course, cradle-to-cradle design.

264
0:13:18.894,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Materials would be defined as either technical or biological,

265
0:13:22.579,000 --> 0:13:25,000
waste would be designed out entirely,

266
0:13:25.6,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and we would have a system that could function

267
0:13:28.112,000 --> 0:13:3,000
absolutely in the long term.

268
0:13:30.294,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So what could this economy look like?

269
0:13:33.151,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Maybe we wouldn't buy light fittings, but we'd pay for the service of light,

270
0:13:37.089,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and the manufacturers would recover the materials

271
0:13:39.532,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and change the light fittings when we had more efficient products.

272
0:13:42.693,000 --> 0:13:45,000
What if packaging was so nontoxic it could dissolve in water

273
0:13:45.99,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and we could ultimately drink it? It would never become waste.

274
0:13:49.102,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What if engines were re-manufacturable,

275
0:13:51.215,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and we could recover the component materials

276
0:13:53.49,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and significantly reduce energy demand.

277
0:13:55.72,000 --> 0:13:58,000
What if we could recover components from circuit boards, reutilize them,

278
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and then fundamentally recover the materials within them

279
0:14:01.823,000 --> 0:14:02,000
through a second stage?

280
0:14:03.225,000 --> 0:14:05,000
What if we could collect food waste, human waste?

281
0:14:05.517,000 --> 0:14:08,000
What if we could turn that into fertilizer, heat, energy,

282
0:14:08.698,000 --> 0:14:1,000
ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems

283
0:14:11.694,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and rebuilding natural capital?

284
0:14:14.805,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And cars -- what we want is to move around.

285
0:14:17.707,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We don't need to own the materials within them.

286
0:14:20.35,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Could cars become a service

287
0:14:21.989,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and provide us with mobility in the future?

288
0:14:25.033,000 --> 0:14:29,000
All of this sounds amazing, but these aren't just ideas, they're real today,

289
0:14:29.23,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and these lie at the forefront of the circular economy.

290
0:14:31.95,000 --> 0:14:35,000
What lies before us is to expand them and scale them up.

291
0:14:36.454,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So how would you shift from linear to circular?

292
0:14:39.899,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Well, the team and I at the foundation thought you might want to work

293
0:14:43.195,000 --> 0:14:44,000
with the top universities in the world,

294
0:14:45.069,000 --> 0:14:47,000
with leading businesses within the world,

295
0:14:47.089,000 --> 0:14:49,000
with the biggest convening platforms in the world,

296
0:14:49.437,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and with governments.

297
0:14:50.439,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We thought you might want to work with the best analysts

298
0:14:53.059,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and ask them the question,

299
0:14:54.313,000 --> 0:14:57,000
"Can the circular economy decouple growth from resource constraints?

300
0:14:57.514,000 --> 0:15:,000
Is the circular economy able to rebuild natural capital?

301
0:15:01.136,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Could the circular economy replace current chemical fertilizer use?"

302
0:15:04.781,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Yes was the answer to the decoupling,

303
0:15:07.127,000 --> 0:15:1,000
but also yes, we could replace current fertilizer use

304
0:15:10.145,000 --> 0:15:13,000
by a staggering 2.7 times.

305
0:15:14.69,000 --> 0:15:16,000
But what inspired me most about the circular economy

306
0:15:17.25,000 --> 0:15:19,000
was its ability to inspire young people.

307
0:15:20.779,000 --> 0:15:23,000
When young people see the economy through a circular lens,

308
0:15:23.914,000 --> 0:15:27,000
they see brand new opportunities on exactly the same horizon.

309
0:15:28.488,000 --> 0:15:3,000
They can use their creativity and knowledge

310
0:15:31.093,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to rebuild the entire system,

311
0:15:33.48,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and it's there for the taking right now,

312
0:15:35.593,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and the faster we do this, the better.

313
0:15:38.049,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So could we achieve this in their lifetimes?

314
0:15:41.119,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Is it actually possible?

315
0:15:43.255,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I believe yes.

316
0:15:45.105,000 --> 0:15:48,000
When you look at the lifetime of my great-grandfather, anything's possible.

317
0:15:49.574,000 --> 0:15:52,000
When he was born, there were only 25 cars in the world;

318
0:15:53.31,000 --> 0:15:55,000
they had only just been invented.

319
0:15:55.74,000 --> 0:15:58,000
When he was 14, we flew for the first time in history.

320
0:15:59.671,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Now there are 100,000 charter flights

321
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
every single day.

322
0:16:04.106,000 --> 0:16:07,000
When he was 45, we built the first computer.

323
0:16:08.1,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Many said it wouldn't catch on, but it did, and just 20 years later

324
0:16:11.257,000 --> 0:16:13,000
we turned it into a microchip

325
0:16:13.278,000 --> 0:16:17,000
of which there will be thousands in this room here today.

326
0:16:17.48,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Ten years before he died, we built the first mobile phone.

327
0:16:20.359,000 --> 0:16:21,000
It wasn't that mobile, to be fair,

328
0:16:22.333,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but now it really is,

329
0:16:24.307,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and as my great-grandfather left this Earth, the Internet arrived.

330
0:16:28.277,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Now we can do anything,

331
0:16:30.39,000 --> 0:16:31,000
but more importantly,

332
0:16:31.67,000 --> 0:16:33,000
now we have a plan.

333
0:16:33.985,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Thank you.

334
0:16:36.64,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Applause)

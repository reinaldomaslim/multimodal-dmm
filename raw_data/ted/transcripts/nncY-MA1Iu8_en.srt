1
0:00:15.767,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My big idea is a very, very small idea

2
0:00:19.682,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that can unlock billions of big ideas

3
0:00:24.459,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that are at the moment dormant inside us.

4
0:00:27.849,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And my little idea that will do that is sleep.

5
0:00:31.697,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:37.497,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is a room of type A women.

8
0:00:42.029,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is a room of sleep-deprived women.

9
0:00:46.991,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I learned the hard way the value of sleep.

10
0:00:51.204,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion.

11
0:00:54.338,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I hit my head on my desk.

12
0:00:56.148,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye.

13
0:01:00.363,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep.

14
0:01:06.221,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And in the course of that, I studied,

15
0:01:09.151,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I met with medical doctors, scientists,

16
0:01:11.753,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I'm here to tell you

17
0:01:13.656,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that the way to a more productive, more inspired, more joyful life

18
0:01:19.216,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is getting enough sleep.

19
0:01:21.656,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:26.872,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And we women are going to lead the way

21
0:01:29.462,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in this new revolution, this new feminist issue.

22
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top -- literally --

23
0:01:37.168,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:38.653,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Applause)

25
0:01:44.028,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because unfortunately, for men,

26
0:01:47.363,000 --> 0:01:5,000
sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.

27
0:01:51.471,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I was recently having dinner with a guy

28
0:01:53.685,000 --> 0:01:57,000
who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before.

29
0:01:58.182,000 --> 0:02:,000
And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn't say --

30
0:02:00.779,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I felt like saying, "You know what? if you had gotten five,

31
0:02:03.93,000 --> 0:02:05,000
this dinner would have been a lot more interesting."

32
0:02:06.503,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:10.487,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship.

34
0:02:14.561,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date,

35
0:02:17.733,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"

36
0:02:19.63,000 --> 0:02:21,000
they're likely to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me,

37
0:02:22.617,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but that's OK, I can get a game of tennis in

38
0:02:24.706,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight."

39
0:02:27.241,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And they think that means they are so incredibly busy and productive,

40
0:02:32.088,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but the truth is, they're not,

41
0:02:34.634,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because we, at the moment,

42
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics,

43
0:02:42.145,000 --> 0:02:43,000
making terrible decisions.

44
0:02:45.125,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So a high IQ does not mean that you're a good leader,

45
0:02:49.511,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg

46
0:02:53.759,000 --> 0:02:54,000
before it hits the Titanic.

47
0:02:55.639,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:57.406,000 --> 0:03:,000
And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics.

49
0:03:01.701,000 --> 0:03:03,000
In fact, I have a feeling

50
0:03:03.927,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters,

51
0:03:07.412,000 --> 0:03:08,000
they might still be around.

52
0:03:08.897,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:10.349,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

54
0:03:12.45,000 --> 0:03:17,000
While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7,

55
0:03:18.035,000 --> 0:03:2,000
maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg,

56
0:03:20.396,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because she would have woken up

57
0:03:21.959,000 --> 0:03:23,000
from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep,

58
0:03:24.959,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and have been able to see the big picture.

59
0:03:28.897,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So as we are facing all the multiple crises

60
0:03:33.099,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in our world at the moment,

61
0:03:35.528,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what is good for us on a personal level,

62
0:03:38.369,000 --> 0:03:43,000
what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives

63
0:03:43.93,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and be the best for our own careers,

64
0:03:46.434,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is also what is best for the world.

65
0:03:49.744,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So I urge you to shut your eyes,

66
0:03:54.57,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and discover the great ideas that lie inside us;

67
0:03:58.54,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep.

68
0:04:01.974,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Thank you.

69
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.607,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I had brain surgery 18 years ago,

2
0:00:15.115,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and since that time, brain science has become

3
0:00:17.682,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a personal passion of mine.

4
0:00:19.681,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm actually an engineer.

5
0:00:21.916,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And first let me say, I recently joined

6
0:00:24.432,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Google's Moonshot group,

7
0:00:25.981,000 --> 0:00:26,000
where I had a division,

8
0:00:27.193,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the display division in Google X,

9
0:00:29.374,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and the brain science work I'm speaking about today

10
0:00:31.996,000 --> 0:00:33,000
is work I did before I joined Google

11
0:00:34.917,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and on the side outside of Google.

12
0:00:37.249,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So that said, there's a stigma

13
0:00:40.432,000 --> 0:00:42,000
when you have brain surgery.

14
0:00:42.717,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Are you still smart or not?

15
0:00:45.54,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And if not, can you make yourself smart again?

16
0:00:49.388,000 --> 0:00:5,000
After my neurosurgery,

17
0:00:51.154,000 --> 0:00:52,000
part of my brain was missing,

18
0:00:53.151,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I had to deal with that.

19
0:00:55.924,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It wasn't the grey matter, but it was the gooey part dead center

20
0:00:58.868,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.

21
0:01:02.27,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Immediately after my surgery,

22
0:01:04.501,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I had to decide what amounts of each of over

23
0:01:06.644,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,

24
0:01:10.346,000 --> 0:01:11,000
because if I just took nothing,

25
0:01:12.155,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I would die within hours.

26
0:01:14.887,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --

27
0:01:18.807,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I've had to try to decide the combinations

28
0:01:21.517,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and mixtures of chemicals,

29
0:01:22.845,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and try to get them, to stay alive.

30
0:01:26.692,000 --> 0:01:28,000
There have been several close calls.

31
0:01:29.413,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,

32
0:01:33.112,000 --> 0:01:36,000
so I decided I would experiment

33
0:01:36.339,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to try to find more optimal dosages

34
0:01:38.779,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because there really isn't a clear road map

35
0:01:40.416,000 --> 0:01:41,000
on this that's detailed.

36
0:01:42.319,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I began to try different mixtures,

37
0:01:44.47,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I was blown away by how

38
0:01:47.342,000 --> 0:01:49,000
tiny changes in dosages

39
0:01:49.753,000 --> 0:01:52,000
dramatically changed my sense of self,

40
0:01:52.902,000 --> 0:01:53,000
my sense of who I was, my thinking,

41
0:01:54.713,000 --> 0:01:56,000
my behavior towards people.

42
0:01:56.972,000 --> 0:01:58,000
One particularly dramatic case:

43
0:01:59.021,000 --> 0:02:,000
for a couple months I actually tried dosages

44
0:02:00.889,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,

45
0:02:04.797,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.

46
0:02:07.808,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:10.928,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I was angry all the time,

48
0:02:13.986,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I thought about sex constantly,

49
0:02:15.832,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I thought I was the smartest person

50
0:02:18.781,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in the entire world, and

51
0:02:20.832,000 --> 0:02:22,000
—(Laughter)—

52
0:02:23.095,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that,

53
0:02:26.02,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.

54
0:02:28.287,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I was kind of extreme.

55
0:02:30.471,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But to me, the surprise was,

56
0:02:33.04,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I wasn't trying to be arrogant.

57
0:02:35.206,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I was actually trying,

58
0:02:38.415,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with a little bit of insecurity,

59
0:02:40.775,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to actually fix a problem in front of me,

60
0:02:43.775,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it just didn't come out that way.

61
0:02:45.631,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So I couldn't handle it.

62
0:02:47.114,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I changed my dosages.

63
0:02:48.639,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But that experience, I think, gave me

64
0:02:51.094,000 --> 0:02:52,000
a new appreciation for men

65
0:02:52.845,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and what they might walk through,

66
0:02:54.661,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and I've gotten along with men

67
0:02:56.351,000 --> 0:02:57,000
a lot better since then.

68
0:02:58.19,000 --> 0:02:59,000
What I was trying to do

69
0:02:59.735,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with tuning these hormones

70
0:03:01.763,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and neurotransmitters and so forth

71
0:03:04.086,000 --> 0:03:07,000
was to try to get my intelligence back

72
0:03:07.691,000 --> 0:03:09,000
after my illness and surgery,

73
0:03:10.325,000 --> 0:03:12,000
my creative thought, my idea flow.

74
0:03:12.96,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I think mostly in images,

75
0:03:15.601,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and so for me that became a key metric --

76
0:03:18.453,000 --> 0:03:2,000
how to get these mental images

77
0:03:20.783,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,

78
0:03:23.287,000 --> 0:03:24,000
if you will, my ideas,

79
0:03:25.03,000 --> 0:03:27,000
trying on different new ideas for size,

80
0:03:27.402,000 --> 0:03:28,000
playing out scenarios.

81
0:03:29.097,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This kind of thinking isn't new.

82
0:03:31.01,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes

83
0:03:34.265,000 --> 0:03:35,000
saw things similarly.

84
0:03:35.793,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They thought that mental images and ideas

85
0:03:38.53,000 --> 0:03:4,000
were actually the same thing.

86
0:03:40.861,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There are those today that dispute that,

87
0:03:43.278,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and lots of debates about how the mind works,

88
0:03:46.473,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but for me it's simple:

89
0:03:48.209,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Mental images, for most of us,

90
0:03:50.741,000 --> 0:03:53,000
are central in inventive and creative thinking.

91
0:03:54.675,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So after several years,

92
0:03:56.45,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,

93
0:03:59.683,000 --> 0:04:02,000
really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication

94
0:04:02.731,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the analytical backbone behind them.

95
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so now I'm working on,

96
0:04:06.921,000 --> 0:04:1,000
how can I get these mental images in my mind

97
0:04:11.083,000 --> 0:04:13,000
out to my computer screen faster?

98
0:04:13.933,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Can you imagine, if you will,

99
0:04:16.022,000 --> 0:04:18,000
a movie director being able to use

100
0:04:18.142,000 --> 0:04:21,000
her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?

101
0:04:21.904,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?

102
0:04:25.492,000 --> 0:04:27,000
There are incredible possibilities with this

103
0:04:27.784,000 --> 0:04:28,000
as a way for creative people

104
0:04:29.777,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to share at light speed.

105
0:04:32.01,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck

106
0:04:34.008,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in being able to do this

107
0:04:35.181,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.

108
0:04:39.161,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there

109
0:04:42.029,000 --> 0:04:44,000
by sharing with you two recent experiments

110
0:04:44.416,000 --> 0:04:46,000
from two top neuroscience groups.

111
0:04:47.003,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Both used fMRI technology --

112
0:04:49.491,000 --> 0:04:51,000
functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --

113
0:04:51.77,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to image the brain,

114
0:04:53.181,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis

115
0:04:56.438,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and his colleagues at Harvard.

116
0:04:58.388,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan

117
0:05:01.542,000 --> 0:05:04,000
of a person looking at an image.

118
0:05:04.809,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The middle column shows the brainscan

119
0:05:06.738,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of that same individual

120
0:05:08.359,000 --> 0:05:11,000
imagining, seeing that same image.

121
0:05:11.425,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And the right column was created

122
0:05:13.473,000 --> 0:05:16,000
by subtracting the middle column from the left column,

123
0:05:17.083,000 --> 0:05:19,000
showing the difference to be nearly zero.

124
0:05:20.026,000 --> 0:05:22,000
This was repeated on lots of different individuals

125
0:05:22.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with lots of different images,

126
0:05:25.75,000 --> 0:05:26,000
always with a similar result.

127
0:05:27.354,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The difference between seeing an image

128
0:05:29.443,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and imagining seeing that same image

129
0:05:31.898,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is next to nothing.

130
0:05:34.053,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Next let me share with you one other experiment,

131
0:05:36.814,000 --> 0:05:4,000
this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.

132
0:05:41.355,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They've been able to decode brainwaves

133
0:05:43.418,000 --> 0:05:45,000
into recognizable visual fields.

134
0:05:45.859,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So let me set this up for you.

135
0:05:47.164,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In this experiment, individuals were shown

136
0:05:49.497,000 --> 0:05:5,000
hundreds of hours of YouTube videos

137
0:05:51.492,000 --> 0:05:53,000
while scans were made of their brains

138
0:05:53.531,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to create a large library of their brain reacting

139
0:05:56.747,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to video sequences.

140
0:05:59.396,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Then a new movie was shown with new images,

141
0:06:02.246,000 --> 0:06:03,000
new people, new animals in it,

142
0:06:04.198,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and a new scan set was recorded.

143
0:06:06.909,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The computer, using brain scan data alone,

144
0:06:09.697,000 --> 0:06:11,000
decoded that new brain scan

145
0:06:11.721,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing.

146
0:06:16.097,000 --> 0:06:19,000
On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess,

147
0:06:19.478,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.

148
0:06:23.485,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is the jaw-dropper.

149
0:06:25.804,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We are so close to being able to do this.

150
0:06:28.491,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We just need to up the resolution.

151
0:06:31.276,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And now remember that when you see an image

152
0:06:34.528,000 --> 0:06:36,000
versus when you imagine that same image,

153
0:06:36.686,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it creates the same brain scan.

154
0:06:40.161,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So this was done with the highest-resolution

155
0:06:42.883,000 --> 0:06:44,000
brain scan systems available today,

156
0:06:45.068,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and their resolution has increased really

157
0:06:46.852,000 --> 0:06:49,000
about a thousandfold in the last several years.

158
0:06:50.349,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Next we need to increase the resolution

159
0:06:52.671,000 --> 0:06:53,000
another thousandfold

160
0:06:54.648,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to get a deeper glimpse.

161
0:06:56.437,000 --> 0:06:57,000
How do we do that?

162
0:06:57.948,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.

163
0:07:00.562,000 --> 0:07:03,000
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.

164
0:07:03.68,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I'm not for that.

165
0:07:05.083,000 --> 0:07:07,000
There's a lot of new imaging techniques

166
0:07:08.038,000 --> 0:07:1,000
being proposed, some even by me,

167
0:07:10.041,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but given the recent success of MRI,

168
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
first we need to ask the question,

169
0:07:15.068,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is it the end of the road with this technology?

170
0:07:17.909,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Conventional wisdom says the only way

171
0:07:20.364,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,

172
0:07:22.953,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but at this point bigger magnets

173
0:07:24.795,000 --> 0:07:27,000
only offer incremental resolution improvements,

174
0:07:28.545,000 --> 0:07:3,000
not the thousandfold we need.

175
0:07:30.705,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I'm putting forward an idea:

176
0:07:32.528,000 --> 0:07:33,000
instead of bigger magnets,

177
0:07:34.491,000 --> 0:07:36,000
let's make better magnets.

178
0:07:36.941,000 --> 0:07:38,000
There's some new technology breakthroughs

179
0:07:38.944,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in nanoscience

180
0:07:40.401,000 --> 0:07:41,000
when applied to magnetic structures

181
0:07:42.128,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that have created a whole new class of magnets,

182
0:07:45.141,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and with these magnets, we can lay down

183
0:07:47.672,000 --> 0:07:49,000
very fine detailed magnetic field patterns

184
0:07:49.839,000 --> 0:07:5,000
throughout the brain,

185
0:07:51.194,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and using those, we can actually create

186
0:07:54.376,000 --> 0:07:56,000
holographic-like interference structures

187
0:07:57.214,000 --> 0:08:,000
to get precision control over many patterns,

188
0:08:00.683,000 --> 0:08:02,000
as is shown here by shifting things.

189
0:08:03.128,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We can create much more complicated structures

190
0:08:06.278,000 --> 0:08:08,000
with slightly different arrangements,

191
0:08:08.349,000 --> 0:08:11,000
kind of like making Spirograph.

192
0:08:11.382,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So why does that matter?

193
0:08:13.61,000 --> 0:08:15,000
A lot of effort in MRI over the years

194
0:08:16.187,000 --> 0:08:18,000
has gone into making really big,

195
0:08:19.024,000 --> 0:08:21,000
really huge magnets, right?

196
0:08:21.634,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But yet most of the recent advances

197
0:08:24.143,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in resolution have actually come from

198
0:08:26.34,000 --> 0:08:3,000
ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions

199
0:08:30.348,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers

200
0:08:33.635,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in the MRI systems.

201
0:08:36.326,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,

202
0:08:39.648,000 --> 0:08:41,000
put down structured magnetic patterns

203
0:08:42.32,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.

204
0:08:45.419,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So by combining the magnetics patterns

205
0:08:47.726,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies

206
0:08:50.436,000 --> 0:08:52,000
processing which can massively increase

207
0:08:52.607,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the information that we can extract

208
0:08:54.576,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in a single scan.

209
0:08:57.022,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And on top of that, we can then layer

210
0:08:59.354,000 --> 0:09:03,000
our ever-growing knowledge of brain structure and memory

211
0:09:03.826,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to create a thousandfold increase that we need.

212
0:09:07.521,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And using fMRI, we should be able to measure

213
0:09:10.464,000 --> 0:09:12,000
not just oxygenated blood flow,

214
0:09:12.546,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but the hormones and neurotransmitters I've talked about

215
0:09:15.447,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and maybe even the direct neural activity,

216
0:09:17.792,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which is the dream.

217
0:09:19.295,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We're going to be able to dump our ideas

218
0:09:21.529,000 --> 0:09:23,000
directly to digital media.

219
0:09:24.223,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language

220
0:09:26.934,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and communicate directly with human thought?

221
0:09:31.143,000 --> 0:09:34,000
What would we be capable of then?

222
0:09:34.336,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And how will we learn to deal

223
0:09:36.973,000 --> 0:09:4,000
with the truths of unfiltered human thought?

224
0:09:41.192,000 --> 0:09:43,000
You think the Internet was big.

225
0:09:43.759,000 --> 0:09:45,000
These are huge questions.

226
0:09:46.361,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It might be irresistible as a tool

227
0:09:48.509,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to amplify our thinking and communication skills.

228
0:09:52.385,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And indeed, this very same tool

229
0:09:54.408,000 --> 0:09:56,000
may prove to lead to the cure

230
0:09:56.534,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.

231
0:09:59.608,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We have little option but to open this door.

232
0:10:03.12,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Regardless, pick a year --

233
0:10:04.705,000 --> 0:10:06,000
will it happen in five years or 15 years?

234
0:10:06.971,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.

235
0:10:11.587,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We need to learn how to take this step together.

236
0:10:15.282,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Thank you.

237
0:10:17.456,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Applause)

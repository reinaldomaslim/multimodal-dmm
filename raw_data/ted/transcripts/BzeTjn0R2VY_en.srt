1
0:00:12.951,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So people tell me I'm a nice person ...

2
0:00:18.02,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to the point where it's part of my personal and professional identity

3
0:00:22.087,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that I'm so nice and able to get along with anyone,

4
0:00:26.45,000 --> 0:00:29,000
even my most fierce opponents.

5
0:00:30.837,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's like my "thing," it's what I'm known for.

6
0:00:33.071,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:36.061,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But what no one knows ...

8
0:00:41.063,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is that I was a bully.

9
0:00:44.709,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Honestly, I didn't think about it much myself.

10
0:00:47.145,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I buried the memories for years,

11
0:00:50.647,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and even still, a lot of it's really hazy.

12
0:00:54.203,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Denial, by the way, apparently is also one of my things.

13
0:00:56.87,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:58.123,000 --> 0:01:,000
But the more people started to praise me

15
0:01:00.703,000 --> 0:01:02,000
for being a liberal who could get along with conservatives,

16
0:01:03.49,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the more I wrote articles about being nice

17
0:01:05.665,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and gave talks about being nice,

18
0:01:08.713,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the more I felt this hypocrisy creeping up inside me.

19
0:01:14.865,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What if I was actually really mean?

20
0:01:19.877,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When I was 10 years old,

21
0:01:24.155,000 --> 0:01:27,000
there was a girl in my class at school named Vicky.

22
0:01:27.199,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Sigh)

23
0:01:28.672,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I tormented her ...

24
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
mercilessly.

25
0:01:35.359,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I mean, everyone did.

26
0:01:36.774,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Even the teachers picked on her.

27
0:01:39.769,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It doesn't make it any better, does it?

28
0:01:42.975,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Vicky was clearly a troubled kid.

29
0:01:46.342,000 --> 0:01:48,000
She would hit herself and give herself bloody noses

30
0:01:48.908,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and she had hygiene problems --

31
0:01:50.449,000 --> 0:01:51,000
she had big hygiene problems.

32
0:01:53.193,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But instead of helping this girl,

33
0:01:55.362,000 --> 0:01:58,000
who was plainly suffering from hardships in her life ...

34
0:01:59.889,000 --> 0:02:,000
we called her "Sticky Vicky."

35
0:02:03.821,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I called her "Sticky Vicky."

36
0:02:08.634,000 --> 0:02:12,000
My clearest memory is standing in the empty hallway

37
0:02:13.017,000 --> 0:02:14,000
outside the fifth grade classrooms

38
0:02:14.971,000 --> 0:02:16,000
waiting for Vicky to come out of the bathroom,

39
0:02:17.795,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I have a clipboard and a pen and a survey I've made up,

40
0:02:21.01,000 --> 0:02:22,000
asking about shampoo preferences,

41
0:02:22.8,000 --> 0:02:25,000
like I'm doing a study for science class or something.

42
0:02:25.939,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And when Vicky comes out of the bathroom,

43
0:02:28.364,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I pounce on her and I ask her what shampoo she uses.

44
0:02:31.198,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, to put this in perspective,

45
0:02:33.428,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I can't remember the names of my teachers,

46
0:02:35.495,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I can't remember the names of any of the books I read that year,

47
0:02:38.536,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I pretty much can't remember anything from fifth grade,

48
0:02:41.132,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but I remember that Vicky told me she used White Rain shampoo.

49
0:02:45.285,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Clear as yesterday,

50
0:02:46.49,000 --> 0:02:47,000
like it just happened.

51
0:02:48.775,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And as classes let out,

52
0:02:49.949,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I ran down the hall shouting at all the other kids,

53
0:02:52.752,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"Sticky Vicky uses White Rain shampoo.

54
0:02:55.133,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Don't use White Rain shampoo

55
0:02:57.028,000 --> 0:03:,000
or you'll smell like Sticky Vicky."

56
0:03:02.641,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I forgot about this memory for a long time.

57
0:03:04.666,000 --> 0:03:05,000
When I finally started remembering it,

58
0:03:06.53,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I immediately needed to know more.

59
0:03:08.175,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I reached out to friends and eventually social media,

60
0:03:10.691,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I did everything I could to try to find Vicky.

61
0:03:13.05,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I needed to know that she was OK,

62
0:03:15.876,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and that I hadn't ruined her life.

63
0:03:19.471,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Sigh)

64
0:03:20.534,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But what I quickly realized

65
0:03:22.078,000 --> 0:03:24,000
was I wasn't just trying to figure out what happened to Vicky.

66
0:03:25.369,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I was trying to figure out what happened to me.

67
0:03:29.802,000 --> 0:03:3,000
When I was 10 years old,

68
0:03:31.12,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I treated another human being like some worthless other ...

69
0:03:36.82,000 --> 0:03:37,000
like I was better than her,

70
0:03:39.349,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and she was garbage.

71
0:03:42.076,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What kind of a nice person does that?

72
0:03:44.578,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I mean, I know I was only a kid,

73
0:03:46.213,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but not all kids do that.

74
0:03:47.719,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Most kids don't do that, right?

75
0:03:51.168,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So, what if I wasn't nice after all?

76
0:03:53.561,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was really just a hateful monster.

77
0:03:57.914,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Then I started to notice myself having these mean impulses,

78
0:04:02.83,000 --> 0:04:03,000
thinking mean thoughts

79
0:04:04.7,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and wanting to say them.

80
0:04:08.026,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Admittedly, most of my mean thoughts were about conservatives.

81
0:04:11.219,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:16.033,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But not just conservatives.

83
0:04:17.385,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I also caught myself thinking mean things about mushy, centrist liberals

84
0:04:21.51,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and greedy Wall Street bankers

85
0:04:23.412,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and Islamophobes

86
0:04:24.894,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and slow drivers,

87
0:04:26.392,000 --> 0:04:28,000
because I really hate slow drivers.

88
0:04:28.701,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:31.244,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And as I'd catch myself in these moments of hypocrisy,

90
0:04:34.268,000 --> 0:04:37,000
either I was just noticing them or they were getting worse,

91
0:04:37.991,000 --> 0:04:38,000
especially in the last few years.

92
0:04:40.149,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And as I felt more hateful --

93
0:04:42.298,000 --> 0:04:44,000
rageful, really --

94
0:04:44.61,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I noticed the world around me seemed to be getting more hateful, too.

95
0:04:47.874,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Like there was this steady undercurrent of hate

96
0:04:50.452,000 --> 0:04:52,000
bubbling up all around us

97
0:04:52.581,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and increasingly overflowing.

98
0:04:55.973,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So the plus side, I guess,

99
0:04:58.485,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is that I realized that hate was not just my problem,

100
0:05:03.727,000 --> 0:05:06,000
which is like, the most selfish plus side ever --

101
0:05:06.846,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:08.813,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because now instead of just my own hate and cruelty to try to figure out,

103
0:05:14.353,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I had a whole world of hate I wanted to unravel

104
0:05:18.358,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and understand and fix.

105
0:05:22.506,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So I did what all overly intellectual people do when they have a problem

106
0:05:27.507,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that they want to understand,

107
0:05:29.078,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I wrote a book.

108
0:05:30.253,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:33.026,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I wrote a book about hate.

110
0:05:35.407,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Spoiler alert:

111
0:05:37.443,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I'm against it.

112
0:05:38.618,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:41.419,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now at this point, you might be thinking to yourself,

114
0:05:44.025,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"Why are y'all worried about hate?

115
0:05:45.849,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You didn't hate Vicky.

116
0:05:47.024,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Bullying isn't hate."

117
0:05:50.474,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Isn't it?

118
0:05:53.267,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Gordon Allport,

119
0:05:54.6,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the psychologist who pioneered the study of hate in the early 1900s,

120
0:05:58.846,000 --> 0:06:,000
developed what he called a "scale of prejudice."

121
0:06:01.363,000 --> 0:06:06,000
At one end are things like genocide and other bias-motivated violence.

122
0:06:07.109,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But at the other end

123
0:06:08.665,000 --> 0:06:11,000
are things like believing that your in-group

124
0:06:11.854,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is inherently superior to some out-group,

125
0:06:15.474,000 --> 0:06:19,000
or avoiding social interaction with those others.

126
0:06:21.583,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Isn't that all hate?

127
0:06:24.186,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I mean, it wasn't an accident

128
0:06:26.021,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that I was a rich kid picking on a poor kid,

129
0:06:30.982,000 --> 0:06:34,000
or that Vicky, it turns out, would eventually end up being gay.

130
0:06:36.861,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Poor kids and gay kids are more likely to be bullied,

131
0:06:40.978,000 --> 0:06:43,000
even by kids who also end up being gay.

132
0:06:45.988,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I know there was a lot going on in my little 10-year-old mind.

133
0:06:48.918,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I'm not saying hate was the only reason I picked on Vicky

134
0:06:51.61,000 --> 0:06:53,000
or even that I was consciously hateful or anything,

135
0:06:54.608,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but the fact is,

136
0:06:56.46,000 --> 0:07:,000
the people we discriminate against in our public policies and in our culture

137
0:07:01.429,000 --> 0:07:05,000
are also the groups of people most likely to be bullied in school.

138
0:07:07.984,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That is not just a coincidence.

139
0:07:11.799,000 --> 0:07:12,000
That's hate.

140
0:07:15.554,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I am defining hate in a broad way

141
0:07:19.451,000 --> 0:07:21,000
because I think we have a big problem.

142
0:07:23.214,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And we need to solve all of it, not just the most extremes.

143
0:07:26.897,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So for instance,

144
0:07:28.172,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we probably all agree that marching down the street,

145
0:07:30.76,000 --> 0:07:33,000
chanting about you should take away rights from some group of people

146
0:07:34.062,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because of their skin color or their gender,

147
0:07:36.136,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we'd all agree that's hate, right? OK.

148
0:07:39.594,000 --> 0:07:42,000
What if you believe that group of people is inferior,

149
0:07:44.771,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but you don't say it?

150
0:07:47.546,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Is that hate?

151
0:07:49.78,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Or what if you believe that group of people is inferior

152
0:07:53.424,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but you aren't aware that you believe it --

153
0:07:55.718,000 --> 0:07:56,000
what's known as implicit bias.

154
0:07:57.99,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Is that hate?

155
0:07:59.918,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I mean they all have the same roots, don't they?

156
0:08:02.181,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In the historic patterns of racism and sexism

157
0:08:05.219,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that have shaped our history and still infect our society today.

158
0:08:08.327,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Isn't it all hate?

159
0:08:10.573,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I'm not saying they're the same thing,

160
0:08:13.09,000 --> 0:08:15,000
just like I am not saying

161
0:08:15.44,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that being a bully is as bad as being a Nazi,

162
0:08:18.218,000 --> 0:08:21,000
just like I'm not saying that being a Nazi is the same thing as punching a Nazi ...

163
0:08:22.636,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:28.359,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But hating a Nazi is still hate, right?

165
0:08:33.294,000 --> 0:08:35,000
What about hating someone who isn't as enlightened as you?

166
0:08:37.231,000 --> 0:08:39,000
See, what I learned

167
0:08:40.533,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is that we all are against hate

168
0:08:43.097,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and we all think hate is a problem.

169
0:08:45.929,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We think it's their problem,

170
0:08:48.55,000 --> 0:08:49,000
not our problem.

171
0:08:50.824,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They're hateful.

172
0:08:52.69,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I mean, if I think the people who didn't vote like me

173
0:08:55.243,000 --> 0:08:58,000
are stupid racist monsters who don't deserve to call themselves Americans,

174
0:08:58.744,000 --> 0:08:59,000
alright, fine, I'm not being nice,

175
0:09:00.447,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I get it.

176
0:09:01.718,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

177
0:09:03.139,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm not hateful, I'm just right, right?

178
0:09:06.433,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

179
0:09:08.14,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Wrong.

180
0:09:11.346,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We all hate.

181
0:09:14.568,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And I do not mean that in some abstract, generic sense.

182
0:09:18.842,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I mean all of us ...

183
0:09:22.571,000 --> 0:09:23,000
me and you.

184
0:09:25.684,000 --> 0:09:3,000
That sanctimonious pedestal of superiority on which we all place ourselves,

185
0:09:30.953,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that they are hateful and we are not,

186
0:09:34.304,000 --> 0:09:37,000
is a manifestation of the essential root of hate:

187
0:09:38.202,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that we are fundamentally good and they are not,

188
0:09:43.106,000 --> 0:09:44,000
which is what needs to change.

189
0:09:45.968,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So in trying to understand and solve hate,

190
0:09:49.749,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I read every book and every research study I could find,

191
0:09:52.691,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but I also went and talked to some former Nazis

192
0:09:56.881,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and some former terrorists

193
0:09:58.414,000 --> 0:10:,000
and some former genocidal killers,

194
0:10:01.05,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because I figured if they could figure out how to escape hate,

195
0:10:05.258,000 --> 0:10:06,000
surely the rest of us could.

196
0:10:07.617,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Let me give you just one example of the former terrorist I spent time with

197
0:10:11.828,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in the West Bank.

198
0:10:13.719,000 --> 0:10:15,000
When Bassam Aramin was 16 years old,

199
0:10:17.692,000 --> 0:10:21,000
he tried to blow up an Israeli military convoy with a grenade.

200
0:10:23.828,000 --> 0:10:25,000
He failed, fortunately,

201
0:10:26.226,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but he was still sentenced to seven years in prison.

202
0:10:28.68,000 --> 0:10:3,000
When he was in prison, they showed a film about the Holocaust.

203
0:10:31.641,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Up until that point,

204
0:10:32.816,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Bassam had thought the Holocaust was mostly a myth.

205
0:10:35.709,000 --> 0:10:36,000
He went to go watch the film

206
0:10:37.533,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because he thought he would enjoy seeing Jews get killed.

207
0:10:42.424,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But when he saw what really happened, he broke down crying.

208
0:10:47.691,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And eventually, after prison,

209
0:10:49.141,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Bassam went on to get a master's degree in Holocaust studies

210
0:10:52.526,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and he founded an organization where former Palestinian combatants

211
0:10:56.581,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and Israeli combatants come together,

212
0:10:59.963,000 --> 0:11:01,000
work together, try to find common ground.

213
0:11:04.287,000 --> 0:11:07,000
By his own account, Bassam used to hate Israelis,

214
0:11:09.304,000 --> 0:11:12,000
but through knowing Israelis and learning their stories

215
0:11:12.48,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and working together for peace,

216
0:11:14.289,000 --> 0:11:15,000
he overcame his hate.

217
0:11:17.654,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Bassam says he still doesn't hate Israelis,

218
0:11:22.183,000 --> 0:11:23,000
even after the Israeli military --

219
0:11:25.232,000 --> 0:11:27,000
shot and killed his [10]-year-old daughter, Abir,

220
0:11:27.642,000 --> 0:11:28,000
while she was walking to school.

221
0:11:32.021,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Sigh)

222
0:11:34.339,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Bassam even forgave the soldier who killed his daughter.

223
0:11:38.339,000 --> 0:11:39,000
That soldier, he taught me,

224
0:11:41.998,000 --> 0:11:45,000
was just a product of the same hateful system as he was.

225
0:11:51.515,000 --> 0:11:53,000
If a former terrorist ...

226
0:11:56.169,000 --> 0:12:,000
if a terrorist can learn to stop hating

227
0:12:00.447,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and still not hate when their child is killed,

228
0:12:02.615,000 --> 0:12:06,000
surely the rest of us can stop our habits

229
0:12:06.645,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of demeaning and dehumanizing each other.

230
0:12:09.279,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And I will tell you there are stories like Bassam's all over the world,

231
0:12:12.637,000 --> 0:12:13,000
plus study after study after study

232
0:12:14.622,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that says, no, we are neither designed nor destined as human beings to hate,

233
0:12:19.765,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but rather taught to hate by the world around us.

234
0:12:23.409,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I promise you,

235
0:12:24.608,000 --> 0:12:27,000
none of us pops out of the womb hating black people or Republicans.

236
0:12:28.126,000 --> 0:12:32,000
There is nothing in our DNA that makes us hate Muslims or Mexicans.

237
0:12:33.513,000 --> 0:12:34,000
For better or for worse,

238
0:12:34.739,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we are all a product of the culture around us.

239
0:12:39.87,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And the good news is,

240
0:12:41.943,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we're also the ones who shape that culture,

241
0:12:46.139,000 --> 0:12:47,000
which means we can change it.

242
0:12:48.661,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The first step is starting to recognize the hate inside ourselves.

243
0:12:54.085,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We need to catch ourselves

244
0:12:55.718,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and our hateful thoughts in all their forms

245
0:12:58.224,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in all of us ...

246
0:13:01.556,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and work to challenge our ideas and assumptions.

247
0:13:03.948,000 --> 0:13:04,000
That doesn't happen overnight,

248
0:13:05.418,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I am telling you right here,

249
0:13:06.797,000 --> 0:13:08,000
it is a lifelong journey, but it's one we all need to take.

250
0:13:10.367,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And then second:

251
0:13:11.566,000 --> 0:13:14,000
if we want to challenge the hate in our societies,

252
0:13:14.971,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we need to promote policies and institutions and practices

253
0:13:18.94,000 --> 0:13:2,000
that connect us as communities.

254
0:13:22.295,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Literally, like integrated neighborhoods and schools.

255
0:13:25.389,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That by the way is the reason to support integration.

256
0:13:27.891,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Not just because it's the right thing to do,

257
0:13:30.168,000 --> 0:13:33,000
but because integration systematically combats hate.

258
0:13:33.617,000 --> 0:13:35,000
There are studies that teenagers who participate

259
0:13:35.975,000 --> 0:13:39,000
in racially integrated classes and activities reduce their racial bias.

260
0:13:40.186,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And when little kids go to racially integrated kindergartens

261
0:13:43.58,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and elementary schools --

262
0:13:45.724,000 --> 0:13:46,000
they develop less bias to begin with.

263
0:13:48.672,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But the fact is in so many ways and in so many places around our world,

264
0:13:52.617,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we are separated from each other.

265
0:13:56.74,000 --> 0:13:58,000
In the United States, for instance,

266
0:13:58.996,000 --> 0:14:02,000
three-quarters of white people don't have any non-white friends.

267
0:14:04.683,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So in addition to promoting those proactive solutions,

268
0:14:08.777,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the other thing we need to do is upend the hate in our institutions

269
0:14:12.627,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and our policies

270
0:14:14.087,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that perpetuate dehumanization and difference

271
0:14:18.85,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and otherizing and hate,

272
0:14:20.802,000 --> 0:14:25,000
like systems of sexual harassment and sexual assault in the workplace,

273
0:14:26.565,000 --> 0:14:3,000
or our deeply racially imbalanced

274
0:14:30.754,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and deeply racially biased criminal "justice" system.

275
0:14:34.814,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We need to change that.

276
0:14:36.494,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Again, it will not happen overnight.

277
0:14:38.384,000 --> 0:14:39,000
It needs to happen.

278
0:14:41.763,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And then ...

279
0:14:44.123,000 --> 0:14:45,000
when we connect together

280
0:14:46.885,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in these connection spaces,

281
0:14:50.518,000 --> 0:14:52,000
facilitated by connection systems,

282
0:14:54.591,000 --> 0:14:56,000
we need to change the way we talk to each other

283
0:14:58.992,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and connect with one another

284
0:15:00.494,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and relate with generosity and open-mindedness

285
0:15:05.867,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and kindness and compassion

286
0:15:07.296,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and not hate.

287
0:15:09.837,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And that's it.

288
0:15:11.276,000 --> 0:15:12,000
That's it.

289
0:15:12.451,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

290
0:15:16.737,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I have solved it all, right?

291
0:15:18.856,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That's it.

292
0:15:20.031,000 --> 0:15:21,000
That is pretty much --

293
0:15:21.214,000 --> 0:15:22,000
there's a few details --

294
0:15:22.405,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but that's pretty much all we have to do.

295
0:15:24.383,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It's not that complicated, right?

296
0:15:27.556,000 --> 0:15:28,000
But it's hard.

297
0:15:30.279,000 --> 0:15:34,000
The hate that we feel towards certain groups of people

298
0:15:35.814,000 --> 0:15:37,000
because of who they are or what they believe

299
0:15:38.686,000 --> 0:15:41,000
is so ingrained in our minds and in our society

300
0:15:42.122,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that it can feel inevitable

301
0:15:45.031,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and impossible to change.

302
0:15:49.393,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Change is possible.

303
0:15:53.148,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Just look at the terrorist who became a peace activist.

304
0:15:59.483,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Or look at the bully who learned to apologize to her victim.

305
0:16:07.338,000 --> 0:16:12,000
The entire time I was traveling around the Middle East and Rwanda

306
0:16:12.514,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and across the United States,

307
0:16:13.921,000 --> 0:16:17,000
hearing these unbelievable stories of people in communities

308
0:16:18.03,000 --> 0:16:2,000
who had left entire histories of hate behind,

309
0:16:20.737,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I was still looking for Vicky.

310
0:16:23.024,000 --> 0:16:25,000
It was so hard find her that I hired a private investigator

311
0:16:25.834,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and he found her.

312
0:16:27.296,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I mean, he sort of found her.

313
0:16:29.218,000 --> 0:16:33,000
The truth is, it became clear that the person I'm calling Vicky

314
0:16:33.547,000 --> 0:16:37,000
had gone to extraordinary lengths to hide her identity.

315
0:16:40.564,000 --> 0:16:43,000
But anyway, a year after I began my journey,

316
0:16:46.556,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I wrote Vicky an apology.

317
0:16:50.199,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And a few months later,

318
0:16:52.6,000 --> 0:16:53,000
she wrote back.

319
0:16:54.667,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Sigh)

320
0:16:57.09,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I'm not going to lie,

321
0:16:58.982,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I wanted to be forgiven.

322
0:17:05.018,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I wasn't.

323
0:17:06.192,000 --> 0:17:07,000
(Sigh)

324
0:17:07.815,000 --> 0:17:09,000
She offered me sort of conditional forgiveness.

325
0:17:10.768,000 --> 0:17:11,000
What she wrote was ...

326
0:17:13.158,000 --> 0:17:17,000
"Messages such as yours cannot absolve you of your past actions.

327
0:17:18.914,000 --> 0:17:21,000
The only way to do that is to improve the world,

328
0:17:22.281,000 --> 0:17:24,000
prevent others from behaving in similar ways

329
0:17:26.093,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and foster compassion."

330
0:17:29.88,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And Vicky's right.

331
0:17:33.529,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Which is why I'm here.

332
0:17:35.601,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Thank you.

333
0:17:36.776,000 --> 0:17:43,000
(Applause)

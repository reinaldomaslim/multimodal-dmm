1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word,

2
0:00:17.52,000 --> 0:00:19,000
one that people will do almost anything

3
0:00:20.08,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to avoid becoming.

4
0:00:22.28,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Billion-dollar industries thrive

5
0:00:24.56,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because of the fear of it,

6
0:00:26.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and those of us who undeniably are it

7
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
are left to navigate a relentless storm

8
0:00:31.92,000 --> 0:00:32,000
surrounding it.

9
0:00:34.12,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm not sure if any of you have noticed,

10
0:00:36.88,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but I'm fat.

11
0:00:39.6,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Not the lowercase, muttered-behind-my-back kind,

12
0:00:42.6,000 --> 0:00:45,000
or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly.

13
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm not even the more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind.

14
0:00:51.72,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Let's not sugarcoat it.

15
0:00:53.72,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I am the capital F-A-T kind of fat.

16
0:00:57.6,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I am the elephant in the room.

17
0:01:02.04,000 --> 0:01:03,000
When I walked out on stage,

18
0:01:03.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
some of you may have been thinking,

19
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Aww, this is going to be hilarious,

20
0:01:07.76,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because everybody knows that fat people are funny."

21
0:01:10.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:12.44,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Or you may have been thinking, "Where does she get her confidence from?"

23
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Because a confident fat woman is almost unthinkable.

24
0:01:20.8,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The fashion-conscious members of the audience

25
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:25,000
may have been thinking how fabulous I look

26
0:01:25.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in this Beth Ditto dress --

27
0:01:27.32,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Cheers)

28
0:01:28.56,000 --> 0:01:29,000
thank you very much.

29
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Whereas some of you might have thought,

30
0:01:32.4,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"Hmm, black would have been so much more slimming."

31
0:01:35.08,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:36.36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You may have wondered, consciously or not,

33
0:01:38.88,000 --> 0:01:4,000
if I have diabetes, or a partner,

34
0:01:41.84,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or if I eat carbs after 7pm.

35
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:45.36,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night,

37
0:01:49.32,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and that you really should renew your gym membership.

38
0:01:53.32,000 --> 0:01:55,000
These judgments are insidious.

39
0:01:55.6,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They can be directed at individuals and groups,

40
0:01:58.2,000 --> 0:02:,000
and they can also be directed at ourselves.

41
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And this way of thinking is known as fatphobia.

42
0:02:05.8,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Like any form of systematic oppression,

43
0:02:08.24,000 --> 0:02:11,000
fatphobia is deeply rooted in complex structures

44
0:02:11.92,000 --> 0:02:15,000
like capitalism, patriarchy and racism,

45
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and that can make it really difficult to see,

46
0:02:18.8,000 --> 0:02:19,000
let alone challenge.

47
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We live in a culture

48
0:02:22.28,000 --> 0:02:26,000
where being fat is seen as being a bad person --

49
0:02:27.28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible

50
0:02:31.12,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and morally suspect.

51
0:02:33.44,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And we tend to see thinness

52
0:02:35.04,000 --> 0:02:37,000
as being universally good --

53
0:02:38.04,000 --> 0:02:4,000
responsible, successful,

54
0:02:40.08,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and in control of our appetites, bodies and lives.

55
0:02:44.24,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We see these ideas again and again

56
0:02:46.6,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in the media, in public health policy,

57
0:02:49.56,000 --> 0:02:5,000
doctors' offices,

58
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in everyday conversations

59
0:02:53.4,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and in our own attitudes.

60
0:02:55.88,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We may even blame fat people themselves

61
0:02:58.88,000 --> 0:02:59,000
for the discrimination they face

62
0:03:00.48,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because, after all, if we don't like it, we should just lose weight.

63
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Easy.

64
0:03:07.36,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This antifat bias has become so integral, so ingrained

65
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to how we value ourselves and each other

66
0:03:14.44,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size

67
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and where that disdain comes from.

68
0:03:22.96,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But we must question it,

69
0:03:24.92,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because the enormous value we place on how we look

70
0:03:28.12,000 --> 0:03:3,000
affects every one of us.

71
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And do we really want to live in a society

72
0:03:33.56,000 --> 0:03:35,000
where people are denied their basic humanity

73
0:03:36.52,000 --> 0:03:39,000
if they don't subscribe to some arbitrary form of acceptable?

74
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So when I was six years old,

75
0:03:43.96,000 --> 0:03:47,000
my sister used to teach ballet to a bunch of little girls in our garage.

76
0:03:48.52,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was about a foot taller and a foot wider than most of the group.

77
0:03:52.4,000 --> 0:03:54,000
When it came to doing our first performance,

78
0:03:54.56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I was so excited about wearing a pretty pink tutu.

79
0:03:59.2,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I was going to sparkle.

80
0:04:02.8,000 --> 0:04:06,000
As the other girls slipped easily into their Lycra and tulle creations,

81
0:04:06.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me.

82
0:04:10.72,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I was determined not to be excluded from the performance,

83
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:16,000
so I turned to my mother

84
0:04:17.72,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and loud enough for everyone to hear

85
0:04:20.68,000 --> 0:04:23,000
said, "Mom, I don't need a tutu.

86
0:04:24.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I need a fourfour."

87
0:04:26.52,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:29.76,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Thanks, Mom.

89
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Applause)

90
0:04:34.56,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And although I didn't recognize it at the time,

91
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
claiming space for myself in that glorious fourfour

92
0:04:40.28,000 --> 0:04:44,000
was the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist.

93
0:04:46.08,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Now, I'm not saying that this whole body-love thing

94
0:04:48.72,000 --> 0:04:52,000
has been an easy skip along a glittering path of self-acceptance

95
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:54,000
since that day in class.

96
0:04:54.92,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Far from it.

97
0:04:56.76,000 --> 0:05:,000
I soon learned that living outside what the mainstream considers normal

98
0:05:00.96,000 --> 0:05:02,000
can be a frustrating and isolating place.

99
0:05:04.64,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I've spent the last 20 years unpacking and deprogramming these messages,

100
0:05:09.36,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and it's been quite the roller coaster.

101
0:05:12.88,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I've been openly laughed at, abused from passing cars

102
0:05:16.92,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and been told that I'm delusional.

103
0:05:19.4,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I also receive smiles from strangers

104
0:05:21.88,000 --> 0:05:23,000
who recognize what it takes to walk down the street

105
0:05:24.72,000 --> 0:05:26,000
with a spring in your step and your head held high.

106
0:05:27.32,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Cheer)

107
0:05:28.68,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Thanks.

108
0:05:30.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And through it all, that fierce little six-year-old has stayed with me,

109
0:05:34.12,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and she has helped me stand before you today

110
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as an unapologetic fat person,

111
0:05:40.04,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a person that simply refuses to subscribe

112
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to the dominant narrative

113
0:05:44.6,000 --> 0:05:47,000
about how I should move through the world in this body of mine.

114
0:05:48.32,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:56.24,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I'm not alone.

116
0:05:58.44,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I am part of an international community of people

117
0:06:01.6,000 --> 0:06:03,000
who choose to, rather than passively accepting

118
0:06:04.24,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that our bodies are and probably always will be big,

119
0:06:08.2,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we actively choose to flourish in these bodies as they are today.

120
0:06:13.28,000 --> 0:06:16,000
People who honor our strength and work with, not against,

121
0:06:17.08,000 --> 0:06:19,000
our perceived limitations,

122
0:06:19.48,000 --> 0:06:2,000
people who value health

123
0:06:21.32,000 --> 0:06:23,000
as something much more holistic

124
0:06:23.8,000 --> 0:06:26,000
than a number on an outdated BMI chart.

125
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Instead, we value mental health, self-worth and how we feel in our bodies

126
0:06:33.12,000 --> 0:06:36,000
as vital aspects to our overall well-being.

127
0:06:37.56,000 --> 0:06:4,000
People who refuse to believe that living in these fat bodies

128
0:06:40.8,000 --> 0:06:43,000
is a barrier to anything, really.

129
0:06:45.4,000 --> 0:06:48,000
There are doctors, academics and bloggers

130
0:06:48.68,000 --> 0:06:5,000
who have written countless volumes

131
0:06:50.88,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on the many facets of this complex subject.

132
0:06:54.72,000 --> 0:06:58,000
There are fatshionistas who reclaim their bodies and their beauty

133
0:06:59.64,000 --> 0:07:01,000
by wearing fatkinis and crop tops,

134
0:07:02.6,000 --> 0:07:04,000
exposing the flesh that we're all taught to hide.

135
0:07:06.2,000 --> 0:07:07,000
There are fat athletes

136
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:1,000
who run marathons, teach yoga or do kickboxing,

137
0:07:11.8,000 --> 0:07:15,000
all done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status quo.

138
0:07:17.56,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And these people have taught me that radical body politics

139
0:07:21.08,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is the antidote to our body-shaming culture.

140
0:07:25.76,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But to be clear, I'm not saying that people shouldn't change their bodies

141
0:07:30.48,000 --> 0:07:31,000
if that's what they want to do.

142
0:07:32.6,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous acts of self-love

143
0:07:36.6,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and can look like a million different things,

144
0:07:39.92,000 --> 0:07:42,000
from hairstyles to tattoos to body contouring

145
0:07:43.72,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to hormones to surgery and yes, even weight loss.

146
0:07:47.32,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's simple: it's your body,

147
0:07:49.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and you decide what's best to do with it.

148
0:07:52.92,000 --> 0:07:54,000
My way of engaging in activism

149
0:07:55.84,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is by doing all the things that we fatties aren't supposed to do,

150
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and there's a lot of them,

151
0:08:00.52,000 --> 0:08:04,000
inviting other people to join me and then making art about it.

152
0:08:05.72,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The common thread through most of this work

153
0:08:07.8,000 --> 0:08:11,000
has been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies,

154
0:08:12.48,000 --> 0:08:14,000
from the catwalk to club shows,

155
0:08:15.44,000 --> 0:08:18,000
from public swimming pools to prominent dance stages.

156
0:08:20.28,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement

157
0:08:25.44,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but a radical community-building approach.

158
0:08:29.12,000 --> 0:08:31,000
This was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" --

159
0:08:31.96,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Laughter)

160
0:08:33.92,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the fat fem synchronized swim team

161
0:08:36.56,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I started with a group of friends in Sydney.

162
0:08:40.4,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The impact of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women

163
0:08:43.8,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in flowery swimming caps and bathers

164
0:08:46.039,000 --> 0:08:48,000
throwing their legs in the air without a care

165
0:08:48.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
should not be underestimated.

166
0:08:53.4,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:56.44,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Throughout my career, I have learned that fat bodies are inherently political,

168
0:09:02.04,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and unapologetic fat bodies

169
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
can blow people's minds.

170
0:09:08.36,000 --> 0:09:1,000
When director Kate Champion,

171
0:09:10.76,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of acclaimed dance theater company Force Majeure,

172
0:09:13.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
asked me to be the artistic associate

173
0:09:16.24,000 --> 0:09:19,000
on a work featuring all fat dancers,

174
0:09:19.56,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I literally jumped at the opportunity.

175
0:09:23.64,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And I mean literally.

176
0:09:26.72,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"Nothing to Lose" is a work made in collaboration with performers of size

177
0:09:30.92,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who drew from their lived experiences

178
0:09:33.52,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to create a work as varied and authentic as we all are.

179
0:09:38.08,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And it was as far from ballet as you could imagine.

180
0:09:42.12,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The very idea of a fat dance work by such a prestigious company

181
0:09:46.96,000 --> 0:09:5,000
was, to put it mildly, controversial,

182
0:09:51.08,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because nothing like it had ever been done on mainstream dance stages before

183
0:09:56.12,000 --> 0:09:57,000
anywhere in the world.

184
0:09:59.2,000 --> 0:10:,000
People were skeptical.

185
0:10:01.8,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"What do you mean, 'fat dancers?'

186
0:10:05.4,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat?

187
0:10:10.84,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Where did they do their dance training?

188
0:10:13.92,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Are they going to have the stamina for a full-length production?"

189
0:10:18.76,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But despite the skepticism,

190
0:10:20.72,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"Nothing to Lose" became a sellout hit of Sydney Festival.

191
0:10:24.84,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We received rave reviews, toured,

192
0:10:27.2,000 --> 0:10:31,000
won awards and were written about in over 27 languages.

193
0:10:31.76,000 --> 0:10:35,000
These incredible images of our cast were seen worldwide.

194
0:10:37.44,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I've lost count of how many times people of all sizes

195
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:45,000
have told me that the show has changed their lives,

196
0:10:45.12,000 --> 0:10:47,000
how it helped them shift their relationship

197
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to their own and other people's bodies,

198
0:10:49.52,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and how it made them confront their own bias.

199
0:10:53.44,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But of course, work that pushes people's buttons

200
0:10:56.8,000 --> 0:10:58,000
is not without its detractors.

201
0:10:59.96,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I have been told that I'm glorifying obesity.

202
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I have received violent death threats

203
0:11:05.84,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and abuse for daring to make work that centers fat people's bodies and lives

204
0:11:11.32,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and treats us as worthwhile human beings with valuable stories to tell.

205
0:11:18.04,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I've even been called

206
0:11:19.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
"the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" --

207
0:11:22.6,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Laughter)

208
0:11:24.32,000 --> 0:11:26,000
a comment so absurd that it is funny.

209
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But it also speaks to the panic,

210
0:11:30.8,000 --> 0:11:31,000
the literal terror,

211
0:11:32.8,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that the fear of fat can evoke.

212
0:11:35.6,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It is this fear that's feeding the diet industry,

213
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
which is keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies,

214
0:11:43.8,000 --> 0:11:45,000
for waiting to be the after-photo

215
0:11:46.12,000 --> 0:11:49,000
before we truly start to live our lives.

216
0:11:49.4,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Because the real elephant in the room here is fatphobia.

217
0:11:54.48,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear.

218
0:11:58.56,000 --> 0:12:02,000
By advocating for self-determination and respect for all of us,

219
0:12:02.88,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we can shift society's reluctance to embrace diversity

220
0:12:06.84,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body.

221
0:12:12.48,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Thank you.

222
0:12:13.76,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.531,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I will always remember

2
0:00:15.776,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the first time I met the girl in the blue uniform.

3
0:00:21.577,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was eight at the time,

4
0:00:24.189,000 --> 0:00:27,000
living in the village with my grandmother,

5
0:00:27.546,000 --> 0:00:29,000
who was raising me and other children.

6
0:00:31.538,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Famine had hit my country of Zimbabwe,

7
0:00:36.236,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and we just didn't have enough to eat.

8
0:00:40.403,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We were hungry.

9
0:00:43.586,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And that's when the girl in the blue uniform

10
0:00:47.101,000 --> 0:00:5,000
came to my village with the United Nations

11
0:00:50.681,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to feed the children.

12
0:00:53.784,000 --> 0:00:55,000
As she handed me my porridge,

13
0:00:56.387,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I asked her why she was there,

14
0:00:59.672,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and without hesitation, she said,

15
0:01:03.386,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"As Africans, we must uplift all the people of Africa."

16
0:01:11.705,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I had absolutely no idea what she meant.

17
0:01:14.761,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:16.856,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But her words stuck with me.

19
0:01:20.419,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Two years later,

20
0:01:21.999,000 --> 0:01:24,000
famine hit my country for the second time.

21
0:01:26.514,000 --> 0:01:3,000
My grandmother had no choice but to send me to the city

22
0:01:30.999,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to live with an aunt I had never met before.

23
0:01:35.149,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So at the age of 10,

24
0:01:37.031,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I found myself in school for the very first time.

25
0:01:42.816,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And there, at the city school,

26
0:01:45.483,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I would experience what it was to be unequal.

27
0:01:50.999,000 --> 0:01:51,000
You see, in the village,

28
0:01:52.801,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we were all equal.

29
0:01:55.094,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But in the eyes and the minds of the other kids,

30
0:01:58.285,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I was not their equal.

31
0:02:01.165,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I couldn't speak English,

32
0:02:03.522,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I was way behind in terms of reading and writing.

33
0:02:09.197,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But this feeling of inequality would get even more complex.

34
0:02:14.999,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Every school holiday

35
0:02:16.785,000 --> 0:02:19,000
spent back in the village with my grandmother

36
0:02:19.944,000 --> 0:02:21,000
made me consciously aware

37
0:02:22.436,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of the inequalities this incredible opportunity

38
0:02:25.999,000 --> 0:02:27,000
had created within my own family.

39
0:02:30.086,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Suddenly, I had much more than the rest of my village.

40
0:02:35.737,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And in their eyes, I was no longer their equal.

41
0:02:41.213,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I felt guilty.

42
0:02:44.53,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But I thought about the girl in the blue uniform,

43
0:02:48.061,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I remember thinking,

44
0:02:50.348,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"That's who I want to be --

45
0:02:53.181,000 --> 0:02:55,000
someone like her,

46
0:02:55.274,000 --> 0:02:58,000
someone who uplifts other people."

47
0:02:59.903,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This childhood experience led me to the United Nations,

48
0:03:04.999,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and to my current role with UN Women,

49
0:03:07.65,000 --> 0:03:11,000
where we are addressing one of the greatest inequalities

50
0:03:11.817,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that affects more than half of the world's population --

51
0:03:15.786,000 --> 0:03:16,000
women and girls.

52
0:03:18.641,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Today, I want to share with you

53
0:03:20.506,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a simple idea that seeks to uplift all of us together.

54
0:03:29.157,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Eight months ago,

55
0:03:30.895,000 --> 0:03:34,000
under the visionary leadership of Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka,

56
0:03:35.164,000 --> 0:03:37,000
head of UN Women,

57
0:03:37.244,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we launched a groundbreaking initiative

58
0:03:40.269,000 --> 0:03:41,000
called HeForShe,

59
0:03:42.117,000 --> 0:03:45,000
inviting men and boys from around the world

60
0:03:45.53,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to stand in solidarity with each other and with women,

61
0:03:49.872,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to create a shared vision for gender equality.

62
0:03:54.054,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is an invitation for those who believe in equality

63
0:03:58.999,000 --> 0:04:,000
for women and men,

64
0:04:01.284,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and those who don't yet know that they believe.

65
0:04:05.935,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The initiative is based on a simple idea:

66
0:04:09.999,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that what we share is much more powerful

67
0:04:14.404,000 --> 0:04:15,000
than what divides us.

68
0:04:16.705,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We all feel the same things.

69
0:04:19.325,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We all want the same things,

70
0:04:22.34,000 --> 0:04:26,000
even when those things sometimes remain unspoken.

71
0:04:28.356,000 --> 0:04:3,000
HeForShe is about uplifting all of us,

72
0:04:31.102,000 --> 0:04:32,000
women and men together.

73
0:04:33.403,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's moving us towards an inflection point for gender equality.

74
0:04:38.999,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Imagine a blank page

75
0:04:41.174,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with one horizontal line splitting it in half.

76
0:04:45.229,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now imagine that women are represented here,

77
0:04:49.427,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and men are represented here.

78
0:04:53.165,000 --> 0:04:55,000
In our current population,

79
0:04:55.299,000 --> 0:05:,000
HeForShe is about moving the 3.2 billion men,

80
0:05:00.711,000 --> 0:05:02,000
one man at a time,

81
0:05:02.824,000 --> 0:05:03,000
across that line,

82
0:05:04.649,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so that ultimately, men can stand alongside women

83
0:05:09.999,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and be on the right side of history,

84
0:05:12.864,000 --> 0:05:17,000
making gender equality a reality in the 21st century.

85
0:05:19.348,000 --> 0:05:23,000
However, engaging men in the movement would prove quite controversial.

86
0:05:24.999,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Why invite men? They are the problem.

87
0:05:27.872,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:29.054,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In fact, men don't care, we were told.

89
0:05:33.387,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But something incredible happened when we launched HeForShe.

90
0:05:38.34,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In just three days, more than 100,000 men

91
0:05:43.491,000 --> 0:05:48,000
had signed up and committed to be agents of change for equality.

92
0:05:49.999,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Within that first week, at least one man in every single country in the world

93
0:05:56.451,000 --> 0:05:58,000
stood up to be counted,

94
0:05:59.268,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and within that same week,

95
0:06:01.641,000 --> 0:06:07,000
HeForShe created more than 1.2 billion conversations on social media.

96
0:06:09.308,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And that's when the emails started pouring in,

97
0:06:13.633,000 --> 0:06:17,000
sometimes as many as a thousand a day.

98
0:06:19.435,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We heard from a man out of Zimbabwe,

99
0:06:22.514,000 --> 0:06:24,000
who, after hearing about HeForShe,

100
0:06:25.205,000 --> 0:06:26,000
created a "husband school."

101
0:06:27.443,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

102
0:06:29.76,000 --> 0:06:31,000
He literally went around his village,

103
0:06:32.736,000 --> 0:06:36,000
hand-picking all of the men that were abusive to their partners,

104
0:06:37.022,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and committed to turn them into better husbands and fathers.

105
0:06:42.625,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In Pune, India, a youth advocate organized an innovative bicycle rally,

106
0:06:48.713,000 --> 0:06:51,000
mobilizing 700 cyclists

107
0:06:52.372,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to share the HeForShe messages within their own community.

108
0:06:57.705,000 --> 0:06:59,000
In another impact story,

109
0:07:00.514,000 --> 0:07:02,000
a man sent a very personal note

110
0:07:02.943,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of something that had happened in his own community.

111
0:07:06.752,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He wrote,

112
0:07:09.419,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"Dear Madam,

113
0:07:11.331,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I have lived all of my life

114
0:07:13.991,000 --> 0:07:17,000
next door to a man who continuously beats up his wife.

115
0:07:19.506,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Two weeks ago,

116
0:07:21.069,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I was listening to my radio,

117
0:07:23.8,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and your voice came on,

118
0:07:26.236,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and you spoke about something called the HeForShe,

119
0:07:30.78,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and the need for men to play their role.

120
0:07:35.023,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Within a few hours, I heard the woman cry again next door,

121
0:07:40.729,000 --> 0:07:42,000
but for the first time,

122
0:07:43.173,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I didn't just sit there.

123
0:07:45.19,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I felt compelled to do something,

124
0:07:48.999,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so I went over and I confronted the husband.

125
0:07:53.694,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Madam, it has been two weeks,

126
0:07:57.084,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and the woman has not cried since.

127
0:07:59.909,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Thank you for giving me a voice."

128
0:08:02.959,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Applause)

129
0:08:08.166,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Personal impact stories such as these

130
0:08:11.999,000 --> 0:08:15,000
show that we are tapping into something within men,

131
0:08:16.364,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but getting to a world where women and men are equal

132
0:08:19.999,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is not just a matter of bringing men to the cause.

133
0:08:24.332,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We want concrete, systematic, structural change that can equalize

134
0:08:31.34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the political, economic and social realities for women and men.

135
0:08:37.514,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We are asking men to make concrete actions,

136
0:08:40.593,000 --> 0:08:43,000
calling them to intervene at a personal level,

137
0:08:43.737,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to change their behavior.

138
0:08:46.165,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We are calling upon governments, businesses, universities,

139
0:08:51.189,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to change their policies.

140
0:08:54.237,000 --> 0:08:58,000
We want male leaders to become role models

141
0:08:58.443,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and change agents within their own institutions.

142
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Already, a number of prominent men and leaders have stepped up

143
0:09:07.721,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and made some concrete HeForShe commitments.

144
0:09:11.292,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In a few early success stories,

145
0:09:14.799,000 --> 0:09:17,000
a leading French hospitality company, Accor,

146
0:09:18.363,000 --> 0:09:21,000
has committed to eliminate the pay gap

147
0:09:22.063,000 --> 0:09:26,000
for all of its 180,000 employees by 2020.

148
0:09:27.459,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Applause)

149
0:09:31.031,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The government of Sweden,

150
0:09:33.491,000 --> 0:09:35,000
under its current feminist government,

151
0:09:36.174,000 --> 0:09:41,000
has committed to close both the employment and the pay gap

152
0:09:41.357,000 --> 0:09:45,000
for all of its citizens within the current electoral term.

153
0:09:46.999,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In Japan, the University of Nagoya

154
0:09:50.125,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is building, as part of their HeForShe commitments,

155
0:09:53.404,000 --> 0:09:58,000
what will become one of Japan's leading gender-research centers.

156
0:10:00.665,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now, eight months later,

157
0:10:03.196,000 --> 0:10:04,000
a movement is building.

158
0:10:06.03,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We are seeing men sign up from every single walk of life,

159
0:10:10.999,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and from every single corner in the world,

160
0:10:14.373,000 --> 0:10:18,000
from the United Nations' own Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon

161
0:10:18.579,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to the Secretary-Generals of NATO and the EU Council,

162
0:10:24.221,000 --> 0:10:26,000
from the prime minister of Bhutan

163
0:10:26.822,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to the president of Sierra Leone.

164
0:10:30.068,000 --> 0:10:34,000
In Europe alone, all the male EU Commissioners

165
0:10:34.21,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and the members of Parliament of the Swedish and Iceland governments

166
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
have signed up to be HeForShe.

167
0:10:41.464,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In fact, one in 20 men in Iceland has joined the movement.

168
0:10:48.681,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The rallying call of our passionate goodwill ambassador, Emma Watson,

169
0:10:53.237,000 --> 0:10:56,000
has garnered more than five billion media impressions,

170
0:10:57.19,000 --> 0:11:02,000
mobilizing hundreds and thousands of students around the world

171
0:11:02.215,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to create more than a hundred HeForShe student associations.

172
0:11:08.118,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now this is the beginning of the vision that HeForShe has

173
0:11:13.341,000 --> 0:11:14,000
for the world that we want to see.

174
0:11:17.079,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Einstein once said,

175
0:11:19.865,000 --> 0:11:23,000
"A human being is part of the whole ...

176
0:11:24.523,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but he experiences himself,

177
0:11:27.262,000 --> 0:11:29,000
his thoughts and feelings,

178
0:11:29.357,000 --> 0:11:31,000
as something separate from the rest ...

179
0:11:32.725,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This delusion is a kind of prison for us ...

180
0:11:36.856,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison

181
0:11:41.84,000 --> 0:11:44,000
by widening our circle of compassion."

182
0:11:46.982,000 --> 0:11:49,000
If women and men are part of a greater whole,

183
0:11:50.475,000 --> 0:11:52,000
as Einstein suggests,

184
0:11:52.999,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it is my hope that HeForShe can help free us to realize

185
0:11:58.276,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that it is not our gender that defines us,

186
0:12:02.951,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but ultimately, our shared humanity.

187
0:12:07.015,000 --> 0:12:11,000
HeForShe is tapping into women's and men's dreams,

188
0:12:11.532,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the dreams that we have for ourselves,

189
0:12:14.57,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and the dreams that we have for our families, our children,

190
0:12:19.499,000 --> 0:12:21,000
friends, communities.

191
0:12:23.078,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So that's what it is about.

192
0:12:26.776,000 --> 0:12:32,000
HeForShe is about uplifting all of us together.

193
0:12:34.086,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Thank you.

194
0:12:35.269,000 --> 0:12:37,000

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Today I want to talk to you about

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
swimming across the North Pole,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
across the most northern place in the whole world.

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He was a great storyteller.

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He could tell a story about an event,

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
was of the first British atomic bomb test.

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
He had been there and watched it go off.

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And he said that the explosion was so loud

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and the light was so intense,

13
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.

14
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
And he said that he could actually see an x-ray

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
of his fingers,

16
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because the light was so bright.

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off

18
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
had a very, very big impact on my late father.

19
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Every holiday I had as a young boy

20
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
was in a national park.

21
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me

22
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to protect the world,

23
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and show me just how fragile the world is.

24
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
He also told me about the great explorers.

25
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott

26
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
walking all the way to the South Pole

27
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.

28
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And so ever since I think I was just six years old,

29
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I dreamed of going to the polar regions.

30
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.

31
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
There was something about that place

32
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which drew me to it.

33
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And, well, sometimes it takes a long time

34
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
for a dream to come true.

35
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic

36
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
for the first time.

37
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And it was so beautiful that I've been back there

38
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
ever since, for the last seven years.

39
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I love the place.

40
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But I have seen that place change

41
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
beyond all description,

42
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
just in that short period of time.

43
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice

44
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in search of food.

45
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I have swum in front of glaciers

46
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which have retreated so much.

47
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I have also, every year,

48
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
seen less and less sea ice.

49
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.

50
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In the two years before my swim,

51
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover

52
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
just melted away.

53
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders

54
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to get them to understand what is happening.

55
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I decided to do this symbolic swim

56
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,

57
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but which now is rapidly unfreezing.

58
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And the message was very clear:

59
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Climate change is for real,

60
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we need to do something about it.

61
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And we need to do something about it right now.

62
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Well, swimming across the North Pole,

63
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it's not an ordinary thing to do.

64
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I mean, just to put it in perspective,

65
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.

66
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.

67
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The passengers who fell off the Titanic

68
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.

69
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Fresh water freezes at zero.

70
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.

71
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's fucking freezing.

72
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.

75
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me

77
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to help me with this task.

78
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.

79
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport,

80
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:06,000
you just dive into the sea and off you go.

81
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It couldn't be further from the truth for me.

82
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I then went and did a huge amount of training,

83
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.

84
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But the most important thing was to train my mind

85
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to prepare myself for what was going to happen.

86
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I had to visualize the swim.

87
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.

88
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth.

89
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I had to see my coach screaming for me,

90
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!"

91
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And so I literally swam across the North Pole

92
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.

93
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And then, after a year of training, I felt ready.

94
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I felt confident that I could actually

95
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
do this swim.

96
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So myself and the five members of the team,

97
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we hitched a ride on an icebreaker

98
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
which was going to the North Pole.

99
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And on day four, we decided to just do a quick

100
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
five minute test swim.

101
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,

102
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because it's just impossible to train

103
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
in those types of conditions.

104
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So we stopped the ship, as you do.

105
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We all got down onto the ice,

106
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and I then got into my swimming costume

107
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and I dived into the sea.

108
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I have never in my life felt anything

109
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
like that moment.

110
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.

111
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I was hyperventilating so much,

112
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and within seconds my hands were numb.

113
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And it was -- the paradox is

114
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that you're in freezing cold water,

115
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but actually you're on fire.

116
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.

117
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I remember just trying to get out of the water.

118
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I climbed out of the ice.

119
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I remember taking the goggles off my face

120
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and looking down at my hands in sheer shock,

121
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because my fingers

122
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
had swollen so much that they were like sausages.

123
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.

124
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
What had happened is that we are made partially of water,

125
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and when water freezes it expands.

126
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And so what had actually happened is

127
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.

128
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And they had burst. And I was in so much agony.

129
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.

130
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And I remember standing underneath the hot shower

131
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and trying to defrost my fingers.

132
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.

133
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,

134
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for one kilometer across the North Pole.

135
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy

136
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
with my father, was just going out the window.

137
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
There is no possibility that this was going to happen.

138
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And I remember then getting out of the shower

139
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.

140
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands

141
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because you need to be able to grab the water

142
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and pull it through with you.

143
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The next morning, I woke up

144
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and I was in such a state of depression,

145
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.

146
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.

147
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
A number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.

148
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.

149
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And after just three minutes in that water,

150
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
he was able

151
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to get himself out.

152
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And his hands were so badly frostbitten

153
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that he had to return to England.

154
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
He went to a local hospital and there they said,

155
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"Ran, there is no possibility

156
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of us being able to save these fingers.

157
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
We are going to actually have to take them off."

158
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed

159
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and take out a saw

160
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and do it himself.

161
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And all I could think of was, if that happened to Ran after three minutes,

162
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and I can't feel my hands after five minutes,

163
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?

164
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
At the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.

165
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.

166
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.

167
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking,

168
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,

169
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I've known you since you were 18 years old.

170
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I've known you, and I know, Lewis,

171
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
deep down, right deep down here,

172
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that you are going to make this swim.

173
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.

174
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I realize the reason why you're going to do this.

175
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is such an important swim.

176
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We stand at a very, very important moment in this history,

177
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and you're going to make a symbolic swim here

178
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to try to shake the lapels of world leaders.

179
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Lewis, have the courage to go in there,

180
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because we are going to look after you every moment of it."

181
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that,

182
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because he knew me so well.

183
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.

184
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And we stopped the ship,

185
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and it was just as the scientists had predicted.

186
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
There were open patches of sea everywhere.

187
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I went down into my cabin

188
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I put on my swimming costume.

189
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,

190
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which measures my core body temperature

191
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and my heart rate.

192
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And then we walked out onto the ice.

193
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And I remember looking into the ice,

194
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and there were big chunks of white ice in there,

195
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and the water was completely black.

196
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I had never seen black water before.

197
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And it is 4,200 meters deep.

198
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.

199
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Just scuttle forward and go for it."

200
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And so I now want to show you a short video

201
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
of what happened there on the ice.

202
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Narrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage

203
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.

204
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Everything just looks so gray around here,

205
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and looks so cold.

206
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We've just seen our first polar bears.

207
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
It was absolutely magical.

208
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
A mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.

209
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And to think that in 30, 40 years

210
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they could become extinct.

211
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.

212
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
We're finally at the North Pole. This is

213
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
months and months and months of dreaming to get here,

214
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
years of training and planning and preparation.

215
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.

216
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
It's all a little bit frightening,

217
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and emotional.

218
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Amundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.

219
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Lewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.

220
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off!

221
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Man: Take the shoes. Take the shoes.

222
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Well done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!

223
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
You did it! You did it man!

224
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
LP: How on earth did we do that?

225
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Man: Against the current! You did it against the current!

226
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Applause)

227
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
LP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

228
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
(Applause)

229
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Thank you so much.

230
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Audience: Encore!

231
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Laughter)

232
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
LP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this:

233
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
It took me four months again to feel my hands.

234
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.

235
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
There are very, very few people who don't know now

236
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
about what is happening in the Arctic.

237
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?"

238
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And I say to them,

239
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
I think we need to do three things.

240
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down

241
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
into manageable chunks.

242
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
You saw during that video all those flags.

243
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Those flags represented the countries

244
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
from which my team came from.

245
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And equally, when it comes to climate change,

246
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
every single country is going to have to make cuts.

247
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Britain, America, Japan,

248
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
South Africa, the Congo.

249
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
All of us together, we're all on the same ship together.

250
0:17:24.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
The second thing we need to do is

251
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
we need to just look back

252
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
at how far we have come

253
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
in such a short period of time.

254
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
I remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,

255
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and people heckling me in the back

256
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and saying it doesn't even exist.

257
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
I've just come back from giving a series of speeches

258
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
in some of the poorest townships in South Africa

259
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
to young children as young as 10 years old.

260
0:17:49.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Four or five children sitting behind a desk,

261
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and even in those poorest conditions,

262
0:17:55.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
they all have a very, very good grasp

263
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:,000
of climate change.

264
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
We need to believe in ourselves.

265
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Now is the time to believe.

266
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
We've come a long way. We're doing good.

267
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
But the most important thing we must do

268
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
is, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives

269
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.

270
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
And that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,

271
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and what decision are we going to make today

272
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
to ensure that we all live

273
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
in a sustainable world?"

274
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.

275
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:18,000
One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.

2
0:00:18,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.

3
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So when I thought about compassion,

4
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:31,000
my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,

5
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:35,000
where he's lying there and he says,

6
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"I really understand, and I really appreciate

7
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:43,000
how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.

8
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."

9
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This, in a way, is one of the challenges

10
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of how to interpret a really good idea.

11
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
We all, I think, believe in compassion.

12
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:04,000
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,

13
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,

15
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,

17
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:26,000
who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.

18
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And all the main religions have similar teachings.

19
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And again, within Judaism,

20
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we have a teaching about God,

21
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.

22
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:44,000
After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?

23
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,

24
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:53,000
so we too have to be compassionate.

25
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?

26
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Sometimes, of course, being compassionate

27
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:08,000
can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.

28
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,

29
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,

30
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,

31
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.

32
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.

33
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,

34
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I wouldn't be doing my job --

35
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because I have to actually be there for them

36
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.

37
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,

38
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:06,000
then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe

39
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and give up being a rabbi.

40
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.

41
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Who cannot be touched by compassion

42
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:25,000
when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,

43
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?

44
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I know some people who say

45
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,

46
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm not going to even begin to try."

47
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.

48
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:53,000
There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,

49
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and so they turn off the television and don't watch.

50
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:05,000
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.

51
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,

52
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life

53
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and be of help to people.

54
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.

55
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.

56
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,

57
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which says that when God created the world,

58
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:49,000
God thought that it would be best to create the world

59
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:53,000
only with the divine attribute of justice.

60
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Because, after all, God is just.

61
0:04:55,000 --> 0:05:,000
Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.

62
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And then God looked to the future and realized,

63
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:07,000
if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.

64
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion."

65
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And then God looked to the future and realized that,

66
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,

67
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:25,000
there would be anarchy and chaos.

68
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
There had to be limits to all things.

69
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The rabbis describe this as being like a king

70
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.

71
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.

72
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.

73
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.

74
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.

75
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
There is something more though that has to be there.

76
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And that is the translation of the feelings

77
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that we may have about compassion

78
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:14,000
into the wider world, into action.

79
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there

80
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and think great thoughts about our neighbors.

81
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We actually have to do something about it.

82
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness

83
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that becomes very important: "chesed."

84
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
All these three things, then, have to be melded together.

85
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives

86
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,

87
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:55,000
what should we be doing, social justice.

88
0:06:55,000 --> 0:07:,000
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds,

89
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.

90
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone

91
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
if you overdo things.

92
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,

93
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.

94
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This idea of compassion comes to us

95
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because we're made in the image of God,

96
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
who is ultimately the compassionate one.

97
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
What does this compassion entail?

98
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It entails understanding the pain of the other.

99
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But even more than that,

100
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:

101
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:54,000
understanding that one is part of that creation,

102
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that there is a unity that underlies all that we see,

103
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
all that we hear, all that we feel.

104
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I call that unity God.

105
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And that unity is something that connects all of creation.

106
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,

107
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,

108
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that something I do here actually does matter in Africa,

109
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that if I use too much of my carbon allowance,

110
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
it seems to be that we are causing

111
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.

112
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So there is a connectivity,

113
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation,

114
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
as part of me being made in the image of God.

115
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I have to understand that my needs

116
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:57,000
sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.

117
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.

118
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,

119
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
stands for life -- the word "life."

120
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:15,000
So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,

121
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."

122
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But, something else as well:

123
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
actually, 18 minutes is important.

124
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,

125
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,

126
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?

127
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And they say "It's 18 minutes."

128
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.

129
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?

130
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It means it gets filled with hot air.

131
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.

132
0:09:55,000 --> 0:10:,000
Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,

133
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:06,000
what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride,

134
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:1,000
our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,

135
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and that everything should revolve round us.

136
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So we try and get rid of those,

137
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas

138
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision

139
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
so we don't see the needs of others --

140
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.

141
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And that too is a basis for having compassion,

142
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:48,000
for understanding our place in the world.

143
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story

144
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:59,000
of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.

145
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.

146
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.

147
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,

148
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the priests used to have bread,

149
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:27,000
which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.

150
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.

151
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:39,000
He said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."

152
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,

153
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,

154
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
opened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."

155
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.

156
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Then he went home.

157
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The cleaner came into the synagogue.

158
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:08,000
"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.

159
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"

160
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:16,000
He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?

161
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Ah, what a wonderful smell."

162
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.

163
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."

164
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Takes the bread and goes home.

165
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,

166
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:34,000
"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?

167
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:39,000
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"

168
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."

169
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:45,000
He goes in there, and it's not there.

170
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.

171
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Next week, with raisins."

172
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
This went on for years.

173
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,

174
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.

175
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."

176
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Take the bread. Take it home.

177
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.

178
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:15,000
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.

179
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And he called the two of them to his office.

180
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And he said, you know, "This is what's happening."

181
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen.

182
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
"You mean God didn't want my bread?"

183
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?"

184
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.

185
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:44,000
You've misunderstood totally," he said.

186
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man,

187
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.

188
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea

189
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that people should be compassionate and give."

190
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:08,000
He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,

191
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:14,000
"Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God."

192
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So that is the way I feel:

193
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,

194
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:38,000
of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;

195
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that I want to try and serve that unity,

196
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,

197
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:52,000
trying to understand something of the pain of others;

198
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility

199
0:14:55,000 --> 0:15:,000
for some of the problems that come upon them;

200
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,

201
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to the giving I can give.

202
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I have to reevaluate them,

203
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:14,000
try and separate out the material things

204
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and my emotions that may be enslaving me,

205
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
so that I can see the world clearly.

206
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And then I have to try to see in what ways

207
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I can make these the hands of God.

208
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.

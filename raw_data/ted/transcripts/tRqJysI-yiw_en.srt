1
0:00:14.151,000 --> 0:00:15,000
By raising your hand,

2
0:00:15.592,000 --> 0:00:18,000
how many of you know at least one person on the screen?

3
0:00:20.367,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Wow, it's almost a full house.

4
0:00:22.258,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's true, they are very famous in their fields.

5
0:00:24.839,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And do you know what all of them have in common?

6
0:00:27.858,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They all died of pancreatic cancer.

7
0:00:30.802,000 --> 0:00:32,000
However, although it's very, very sad this news,

8
0:00:33.334,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it's also thanks to their personal stories

9
0:00:36.122,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that we have raised awareness of how lethal this disease can be.

10
0:00:40.267,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's become the third cause of cancer deaths,

11
0:00:43.667,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and only eight percent of the patients will survive beyond five years.

12
0:00:49.217,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That's a very tiny number,

13
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
especially if you compare it with breast cancer,

14
0:00:53.94,000 --> 0:00:56,000
where the survival rate is almost 90 percent.

15
0:00:57.946,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So it doesn't really come as a surprise

16
0:01:00.337,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer

17
0:01:02.826,000 --> 0:01:05,000
means facing an almost certain death sentence.

18
0:01:06.101,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What's shocking, though, is that in the last 40 years,

19
0:01:09.771,000 --> 0:01:11,000
this number hasn't changed a bit,

20
0:01:12.173,000 --> 0:01:14,000
while much more progress has been made

21
0:01:14.301,000 --> 0:01:15,000
with other types of tumors.

22
0:01:16.552,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So how can we make pancreatic cancer treatment more effective?

23
0:01:20.659,000 --> 0:01:21,000
As a biomedical entrepreneur,

24
0:01:22.589,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I like to work on problems that seem impossible,

25
0:01:25.632,000 --> 0:01:27,000
understanding their limitations

26
0:01:27.717,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and trying to find new, innovative solutions

27
0:01:30.813,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that can change their outcome.

28
0:01:33.035,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The first piece of bad news with pancreatic cancer

29
0:01:35.636,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is that your pancreas is in the middle of your belly, literally.

30
0:01:39.131,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It's depicted in orange on the screen.

31
0:01:41.99,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But you can barely see it

32
0:01:43.661,000 --> 0:01:45,000
until I remove all the other organs in front.

33
0:01:47.093,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's also surrounded by many other vital organs,

34
0:01:50.113,000 --> 0:01:53,000
like the liver, the stomach, the bile duct.

35
0:01:53.249,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And the ability of the tumor to grow into those organs

36
0:01:56.686,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is the reason why pancreatic cancer

37
0:01:58.732,000 --> 0:02:,000
is one of the most painful tumor types.

38
0:02:02.295,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The hard-to-reach location also prevents the doctor

39
0:02:05.481,000 --> 0:02:06,000
from surgically removing it,

40
0:02:07.224,000 --> 0:02:1,000
as is routinely done for breast cancer, for example.

41
0:02:10.716,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So all of these reasons leave chemotherapy as the only option

42
0:02:14.124,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for the pancreatic cancer patient.

43
0:02:16.745,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This brings us to the second piece of bad news.

44
0:02:19.579,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Pancreatic cancer tumors have very few blood vessels.

45
0:02:23.624,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Why should we care about the blood vessel of a tumor?

46
0:02:27.434,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Let's think for a second how chemotherapy works.

47
0:02:30.924,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The drug is injected in the vein

48
0:02:32.837,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and it navigates throughout the body until it reaches the tumor site.

49
0:02:37.505,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It's like driving on a highway, trying to reach a destination.

50
0:02:42.08,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But what if your destination doesn't have an exit on the highway?

51
0:02:45.989,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You will never get there.

52
0:02:47.642,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And that's exactly the same problem

53
0:02:49.788,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for chemotherapy and pancreatic cancer.

54
0:02:53.119,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The drugs navigate throughout all of your body.

55
0:02:55.988,000 --> 0:02:57,000
They will reach healthy organs,

56
0:02:58.425,000 --> 0:03:01,000
resulting in high toxic effect for the patients overall,

57
0:03:02.256,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but very little will go to the tumor.

58
0:03:04.795,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Therefore, the efficacy is very limited.

59
0:03:08.519,000 --> 0:03:12,000
To me, it seems very counterintuitive to have a whole-body treatment

60
0:03:13.357,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to target a specific organ.

61
0:03:15.645,000 --> 0:03:17,000
However, in the last 40 years,

62
0:03:18.121,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a lot of money, research and effort have gone towards

63
0:03:22.469,000 --> 0:03:26,000
finding new, powerful drugs to treat pancreatic cancer,

64
0:03:26.576,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but nothing has been done in changing the way

65
0:03:29.011,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we deliver them to the patient.

66
0:03:32.397,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So after two pieces of bad news,

67
0:03:34.047,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I'm going to give you good news, hopefully.

68
0:03:37.806,000 --> 0:03:38,000
With a collaborator at MIT

69
0:03:39.3,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston,

70
0:03:42.22,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we have revolutionized the way we treat cancer

71
0:03:45.157,000 --> 0:03:48,000
by making localized drug delivery a reality.

72
0:03:48.974,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We are basically parachuting you on top of your destination,

73
0:03:52.984,000 --> 0:03:54,000
avoiding your having to drive all around the highway.

74
0:03:55.91,000 --> 0:04:,000
We have embedded the drug into devices that look like this one.

75
0:04:01.224,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They are flexible enough that they can be folded

76
0:04:06.437,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to fit into the catheter,

77
0:04:08.383,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so the doctor can implant it directly on top of the tumor

78
0:04:12.203,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with minimally invasive surgery.

79
0:04:14.603,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But they are solid enough that once they are positioned

80
0:04:18.397,000 --> 0:04:19,000
on top of the tumor,

81
0:04:20.112,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they will act as a cage.

82
0:04:21.905,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They will actually physically prevent the tumor

83
0:04:25.08,000 --> 0:04:26,000
from entering other organs,

84
0:04:26.779,000 --> 0:04:28,000
controlling the metastasis.

85
0:04:30.459,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The devices are also biodegradable.

86
0:04:32.767,000 --> 0:04:33,000
That means that once in the body,

87
0:04:34.541,000 --> 0:04:35,000
they start dissolving,

88
0:04:36.45,000 --> 0:04:41,000
delivering the drug only locally, slowly and more effectively

89
0:04:41.837,000 --> 0:04:44,000
than what is done with the current whole-body treatment.

90
0:04:45.344,000 --> 0:04:47,000
In pre-clinical study, we have demonstrated

91
0:04:48.173,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that this localized approach

92
0:04:50.196,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is able to improve by 12 times the response to treatment.

93
0:04:54.758,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So we took a drug that is already known

94
0:04:57.559,000 --> 0:05:,000
and by just delivering it locally where it's needed the most,

95
0:05:01.414,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we allow a response that is 12 times more powerful,

96
0:05:05.087,000 --> 0:05:07,000
reducing the systemic toxic effect.

97
0:05:09.039,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We are working relentlessly to bring this technology to the next level.

98
0:05:13.257,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We are finalizing the pre-clinical testing

99
0:05:16.128,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and the animal model required prior to asking the FDA for approval

100
0:05:20.231,000 --> 0:05:21,000
for clinical trials.

101
0:05:22.969,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Currently, the majority of patients will die from pancreatic cancer.

102
0:05:28.124,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We are hoping that one day,

103
0:05:29.983,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we can reduce their pain, extend their life

104
0:05:33.278,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and potentially make pancreatic cancer

105
0:05:36.335,000 --> 0:05:37,000
a curable disease.

106
0:05:38.257,000 --> 0:05:4,000
By rethinking the way we deliver the drug,

107
0:05:41.001,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we don't only make it more powerful and less toxic,

108
0:05:44.782,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we are also opening the door to finding new innovative solutions

109
0:05:49.591,000 --> 0:05:51,000
for almost all other impossible problems

110
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in pancreatic cancer patients and beyond.

111
0:05:55.628,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Thank you very much.

112
0:05:56.813,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

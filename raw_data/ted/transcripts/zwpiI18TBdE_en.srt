1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today I stand before you as a man who lives life to the full

2
0:00:16.8,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in the here and now.

3
0:00:19.28,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But for a long time,

4
0:00:20.96,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I lived for death.

5
0:00:23.92,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was a young man who believed

6
0:00:25.56,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that jihad is to be understood in the language of force and violence.

7
0:00:32.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I tried to right wrongs through power and aggression.

8
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I had deep concerns for the suffering of others

9
0:00:42.76,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and a strong desire to help and bring relief to them.

10
0:00:49.12,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I thought violent jihad was noble,

11
0:00:52.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
chivalrous

12
0:00:53.84,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the best way to help.

13
0:00:57.64,000 --> 0:00:58,000
At a time when so many of our people --

14
0:00:59.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
young people especially --

15
0:01:00.84,000 --> 0:01:01,000
are at risk of radicalization

16
0:01:03.4,000 --> 0:01:04,000
through groups like al-Qaeda,

17
0:01:05.12,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Islamic State and others,

18
0:01:07.88,000 --> 0:01:08,000
when these groups are claiming

19
0:01:09.36,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that their horrific brutality and violence are true jihad,

20
0:01:14.44,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I want to say that their idea of jihad is wrong --

21
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:19,000
completely wrong --

22
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:21,000
as was mine, then.

23
0:01:23.2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Jihad means to strive to one's utmost.

24
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It includes exertion and spirituality,

25
0:01:29.48,000 --> 0:01:3,000
self-purification

26
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and devotion.

27
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It refers to positive transformation

28
0:01:37.28,000 --> 0:01:41,000
through learning, wisdom and remembrance of God.

29
0:01:41.4,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The word jihad stands for all those meanings as a whole.

30
0:01:46.92,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Jihad may at times take the form of fighting,

31
0:01:51.36,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but only sometimes,

32
0:01:53.2,000 --> 0:01:54,000
under strict conditions,

33
0:01:56.2,000 --> 0:01:57,000
within rules and limits.

34
0:01:59.84,000 --> 0:02:,000
In Islam,

35
0:02:01.08,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the benefit of an act must outweigh the harm or hardship it entails.

36
0:02:07.24,000 --> 0:02:08,000
More importantly,

37
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the verses in the Koran that are connected to jihad or fighting

38
0:02:13.76,000 --> 0:02:18,000
do not cancel out the verses that talk about forgiveness,

39
0:02:19.36,000 --> 0:02:2,000
benevolence

40
0:02:20.68,000 --> 0:02:21,000
or patience.

41
0:02:25.32,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But now I believe that there are no circumstances on earth

42
0:02:29.92,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where violent jihad is permissible,

43
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:34,000
because it will lead to greater harm.

44
0:02:37.8,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But now the idea of jihad has been hijacked.

45
0:02:40.32,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It has been perverted to mean violent struggle

46
0:02:43.68,000 --> 0:02:45,000
wherever Muslims are undergoing difficulties,

47
0:02:46.68,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and turned into terrorism

48
0:02:48.6,000 --> 0:02:51,000
by fascistic Islamists like al-Qaeda,

49
0:02:51.68,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Islamic State and others.

50
0:02:54.28,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But I have come to understand

51
0:02:56.28,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that true jihad means striving to the utmost

52
0:03:00.24,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to strengthen and live those qualities which God loves:

53
0:03:04.44,000 --> 0:03:06,000
honesty, trustworthiness,

54
0:03:06.8,000 --> 0:03:08,000
compassion, benevolence,

55
0:03:08.92,000 --> 0:03:09,000
reliability, respect,

56
0:03:10.84,000 --> 0:03:11,000
truthfulness --

57
0:03:12.24,000 --> 0:03:15,000
human values that so many of us share.

58
0:03:18.36,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I was born in Bangladesh,

59
0:03:20.24,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but grew up mostly in England.

60
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And I went to school here.

61
0:03:24.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
My father was an academic,

62
0:03:26.8,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and we were in the UK through his work.

63
0:03:30.36,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In 1971 we were in Bangladesh when everything changed.

64
0:03:36.24,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The War of Independence impacted upon us terribly,

65
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:4,000
pitting family against family,

66
0:03:41.68,000 --> 0:03:42,000
neighbor against neighbor.

67
0:03:43.4,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And at the age of 12 I experienced war,

68
0:03:46.28,000 --> 0:03:47,000
destitution in my family,

69
0:03:48.72,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the deaths of 22 of my relatives in horrible ways,

70
0:03:52.96,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as well as the murder of my elder brother.

71
0:03:59.04,000 --> 0:04:,000
I witnessed killing ...

72
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
animals feeding on corpses in the streets,

73
0:04:05.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
starvation all around me,

74
0:04:07.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
wanton, horrific violence --

75
0:04:09.76,000 --> 0:04:1,000
senseless violence.

76
0:04:14.28,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I was a young man,

77
0:04:16.04,000 --> 0:04:18,000
teenager, fascinated by ideas.

78
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I wanted to learn,

79
0:04:20.84,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but I could not go to school for four years.

80
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:25,000
After the War of Independence,

81
0:04:26.24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
my father was put in prison for two and a half years,

82
0:04:29.839,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I used to visit him every week in prison,

83
0:04:33.12,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and homeschooled myself.

84
0:04:36.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
My father was released in 1973

85
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and he fled to England as a refugee,

86
0:04:42.12,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and we soon followed him.

87
0:04:44.72,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I was 17.

88
0:04:46.4,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So these experiences gave me

89
0:04:48.88,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a sharp awareness of the atrocities and injustices in the world.

90
0:04:54.32,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I had a strong desire --

91
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
a very keen, deep desire --

92
0:04:58.2,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to right wrongs

93
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
and help the victims of oppression.

94
0:05:02.6,000 --> 0:05:03,000
While studying at college in the UK,

95
0:05:04.56,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I met others who showed me how I could channel that desire

96
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and help through my religion.

97
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I was radicalized --

98
0:05:15.04,000 --> 0:05:18,000
enough to consider violence correct,

99
0:05:19.64,000 --> 0:05:21,000
even a virtue under certain circumstances.

100
0:05:24.32,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So I became involved in the jihad in Afghanistan.

101
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I wanted to protect the Muslim Afghan population against the Soviet army.

102
0:05:32.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And I thought that was jihad:

103
0:05:35.36,000 --> 0:05:36,000
my sacred duty,

104
0:05:36.88,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which would be rewarded by God.

105
0:05:43.88,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I became a preacher.

106
0:05:47.96,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I was one of the pioneers of violent jihad in the UK.

107
0:05:53.08,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I recruited,

108
0:05:54.6,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I raised funds, I trained.

109
0:05:57.36,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I confused true jihad

110
0:05:59.92,000 --> 0:06:03,000
with this perversion as presented by the fascist Islamists --

111
0:06:05.68,000 --> 0:06:08,000
these people who use the idea of jihad

112
0:06:08.76,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to justify their lust for power, authority and control on earth:

113
0:06:13.745,000 --> 0:06:17,000
a perversion perpetuated today by fascist Islamist groups

114
0:06:18.08,000 --> 0:06:2,000
like al-Qaeda, Islamic State and others.

115
0:06:22.44,000 --> 0:06:23,000
For a period of around 15 years,

116
0:06:25.48,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I fought for short periods of time

117
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in Kashmir and Burma,

118
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:33,000
besides Afghanistan.

119
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Our aim was to remove the invaders,

120
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to bring relief to the oppressed victims

121
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and of course to establish an Islamic state,

122
0:06:48.04,000 --> 0:06:49,000
a caliphate for God's rule.

123
0:06:50.72,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And I did this openly.

124
0:06:53.48,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I didn't break any laws.

125
0:06:56.44,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I was proud and grateful to be British --

126
0:06:59.56,000 --> 0:07:,000
I still am.

127
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And I bore no hostility against this, my country,

128
0:07:05.96,000 --> 0:07:08,000
nor enmity towards the non-Muslim citizens,

129
0:07:09.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and I still don't.

130
0:07:13.84,000 --> 0:07:15,000
During one battle in Afghanistan,

131
0:07:16.24,000 --> 0:07:18,000
some British men and I formed a special bond

132
0:07:19.96,000 --> 0:07:21,000
with a 15-year-old Afghani boy,

133
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Abdullah,

134
0:07:24.84,000 --> 0:07:26,000
an innocent, loving and lovable kid

135
0:07:27.2,000 --> 0:07:29,000
who was always eager to please.

136
0:07:30.96,000 --> 0:07:31,000
He was poor.

137
0:07:32.76,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And boys like him did menial tasks in the camp.

138
0:07:36.48,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And he seemed happy enough,

139
0:07:38.48,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but I couldn't help wonder --

140
0:07:39.92,000 --> 0:07:4,000
his parents must have missed him dearly.

141
0:07:43.56,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And they must have dreamt about a better future for him.

142
0:07:49.56,000 --> 0:07:51,000
A victim of circumstance caught up in a war,

143
0:07:52.4,000 --> 0:07:53,000
cruelly thrust upon him

144
0:07:54.72,000 --> 0:07:56,000
by the cruel circumstances of the time.

145
0:08:00.68,000 --> 0:08:04,000
One day I picked up this unexploded mortar shell in a trench,

146
0:08:06.32,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and I had it deposited in a makeshift mud hut lab.

147
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And I went out on a short, pointless skirmish --

148
0:08:14.24,000 --> 0:08:15,000
always pointless,

149
0:08:16.44,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And I came back a few hours later to discover he was dead.

150
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He had tried to recover explosives from that shell.

151
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It exploded, and he died a violent death,

152
0:08:27.44,000 --> 0:08:31,000
blown to bits by the very same device that had proved harmless to me.

153
0:08:33.08,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So I started to question.

154
0:08:36.6,000 --> 0:08:39,000
How did his death serve any purpose?

155
0:08:42.28,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Why did he die and I lived?

156
0:08:45.559,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I carried on.

157
0:08:47.08,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I fought in Kashmir.

158
0:08:48.72,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I also recruited for the Philippines,

159
0:08:51.44,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Bosnia and Chechnya.

160
0:08:54.559,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And the questions grew.

161
0:08:57.88,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Later in Burma,

162
0:08:59.8,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I came across Rohingya fighters,

163
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who were barely teenagers,

164
0:09:04.44,000 --> 0:09:05,000
born and brought up in the jungle,

165
0:09:06.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
carrying machine guns and grenade launchers.

166
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I met two 13-year-olds with soft manners and gentle voices.

167
0:09:18.92,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Looking at me,

168
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
they begged me to take them away to England.

169
0:09:28.72,000 --> 0:09:29,000
They simply wanted to go to school --

170
0:09:31.68,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that was their dream.

171
0:09:36.36,000 --> 0:09:37,000
My family --

172
0:09:37.6,000 --> 0:09:38,000
my children of the same age --

173
0:09:39.08,000 --> 0:09:4,000
were living at home in the UK,

174
0:09:42.04,000 --> 0:09:43,000
going to school,

175
0:09:43.36,000 --> 0:09:44,000
living a safe life.

176
0:09:45.88,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And I couldn't help wonder

177
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
how much these young boys must have spoken to one another

178
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:52,000
about their dreams for such a life.

179
0:09:54.92,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Victims of circumstances:

180
0:09:58.36,000 --> 0:09:59,000
these two young boys,

181
0:10:00.32,000 --> 0:10:03,000
sleeping rough on the ground, looking up at the stars,

182
0:10:03.4,000 --> 0:10:05,000
cynically exploited by their leaders

183
0:10:05.92,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for their personal lust for glory and power.

184
0:10:09.92,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I soon witnessed boys like them killing one another

185
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in conflicts between rival groups.

186
0:10:17.4,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And it was the same everywhere ...

187
0:10:21.28,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Afghanistan, Kashmir, Burma,

188
0:10:23.8,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Philippines, Chechnya;

189
0:10:26.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
petty warlords got the young and vulnerable to kill one another

190
0:10:30.88,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in the name of jihad.

191
0:10:34.24,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Muslims against Muslims.

192
0:10:37.64,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Not protecting anyone against invaders or occupiers;

193
0:10:42.04,000 --> 0:10:44,000
not bringing relief to the oppressed.

194
0:10:46.24,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Children being used,

195
0:10:47.64,000 --> 0:10:48,000
cynically exploited;

196
0:10:49.28,000 --> 0:10:5,000
people dying in conflicts

197
0:10:51.24,000 --> 0:10:54,000
which I was supporting in the name of jihad.

198
0:10:56.92,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And it still carries on today.

199
0:11:03.8,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Realizing that the violent jihad

200
0:11:07.44,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I had engaged in abroad

201
0:11:13.44,000 --> 0:11:15,000
was so different --

202
0:11:17.28,000 --> 0:11:21,000
such a chasm between what I had experienced

203
0:11:22.04,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and what I thought was sacred duty --

204
0:11:24.64,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I had to reflect on my activities here in the UK.

205
0:11:30.24,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I had to consider my preaching,

206
0:11:32.32,000 --> 0:11:33,000
recruiting, fund-raising,

207
0:11:33.88,000 --> 0:11:34,000
training,

208
0:11:35.48,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but most importantly, radicalizing --

209
0:11:38.64,000 --> 0:11:4,000
sending young people to fight and die

210
0:11:40.88,000 --> 0:11:41,000
as I was doing --

211
0:11:42.12,000 --> 0:11:43,000
all totally wrong.

212
0:11:47.68,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So I got involved in violent jihad in the mid '80s,

213
0:11:51.96,000 --> 0:11:52,000
starting with Afghanistan.

214
0:11:54.6,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And by the time I finished it was in the year 2000.

215
0:11:59.04,000 --> 0:12:,000
I was completely immersed in it.

216
0:12:00.64,000 --> 0:12:01,000
All around me people supported,

217
0:12:02.6,000 --> 0:12:03,000
applauded,

218
0:12:03.84,000 --> 0:12:05,000
even celebrated what we were doing in their name.

219
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But by the time I learned to get out,

220
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
completely disillusioned in the year 2000,

221
0:12:12.64,000 --> 0:12:13,000
15 years had passed.

222
0:12:17.2,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So what goes wrong?

223
0:12:20.72,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We were so busy talking about virtue,

224
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and we were blinded by a cause.

225
0:12:32.24,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And we did not give ourselves a chance to develop a virtuous character.

226
0:12:37.68,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We told ourselves we were fighting for the oppressed,

227
0:12:41.84,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but these were unwinnable wars.

228
0:12:45.72,000 --> 0:12:48,000
We became the very instrument through which more deaths occurred,

229
0:12:49.36,000 --> 0:12:52,000
complicit in causing further misery

230
0:12:53.12,000 --> 0:12:55,000
for the selfish benefit of the cruel few.

231
0:13:04.28,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So over time,

232
0:13:05.52,000 --> 0:13:06,000
a very long time,

233
0:13:08.6,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I opened my eyes.

234
0:13:11.96,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I began to dare

235
0:13:15.04,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to face the truth,

236
0:13:16.72,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to think,

237
0:13:19.36,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to face the hard questions.

238
0:13:21.52,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I got in touch with my soul.

239
0:13:34.08,000 --> 0:13:35,000
What have I learned?

240
0:13:36.64,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That people who engage in violent jihadism,

241
0:13:42.96,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that people who are drawn to these types of extremisms,

242
0:13:46.6,000 --> 0:13:48,000
are not that different to everyone else.

243
0:13:49.88,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But I believe such people can change.

244
0:13:54.12,000 --> 0:13:56,000
They can regain their hearts and restore them

245
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
by filling them with human values that heal.

246
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
When we ignore the realities,

247
0:14:09.24,000 --> 0:14:14,000
we discover that we accept what we are told without critical reflection.

248
0:14:17.64,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And we ignore the gifts and advantages that many of us would cherish

249
0:14:21.44,000 --> 0:14:23,000
even for a single moment in their lives.

250
0:14:28.4,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I engaged in actions I thought were correct.

251
0:14:33.76,000 --> 0:14:37,000
But now I began to question how I knew what I knew.

252
0:14:39.84,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I endlessly told others to accept the truth,

253
0:14:43.56,000 --> 0:14:46,000
but I failed to give doubt its rightful place.

254
0:14:52.92,000 --> 0:14:56,000
This conviction that people can change is rooted in my experience,

255
0:14:57.8,000 --> 0:14:58,000
my own journey.

256
0:15:00.52,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Through wide reading,

257
0:15:02.44,000 --> 0:15:03,000
reflecting,

258
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
contemplation, self-knowledge,

259
0:15:06.08,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I discovered,

260
0:15:07.32,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I realized that Islamists' world of us and them is false and unjust.

261
0:15:16.8,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Through considering the uncertainties in all that we had asserted,

262
0:15:21.4,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to the inviolable truths,

263
0:15:23.04,000 --> 0:15:24,000
incontestable truths,

264
0:15:26.96,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I developed a more nuanced understanding.

265
0:15:36.48,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I realized that in a world crowded with variation and contradiction,

266
0:15:41.92,000 --> 0:15:42,000
foolish preachers,

267
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
only foolish preachers like I used to be,

268
0:15:46.2,000 --> 0:15:51,000
see no paradox in the myths and fictions they use to assert authenticity.

269
0:15:53.12,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So I understood the vital importance of self-knowledge,

270
0:15:57.68,000 --> 0:15:58,000
political awareness

271
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and the necessity for a deep and wide understanding

272
0:16:04.68,000 --> 0:16:06,000
of our commitments and our actions,

273
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
how they affect others.

274
0:16:10.52,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So my plea today to everyone,

275
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:16,000
especially those who sincerely believe in Islamist jihadism ...

276
0:16:18.48,000 --> 0:16:2,000
refuse dogmatic authority;

277
0:16:22.36,000 --> 0:16:25,000
let go of anger, hatred and violence;

278
0:16:27.12,000 --> 0:16:28,000
learn to right wrongs

279
0:16:28.8,000 --> 0:16:33,000
without even attempting to justify cruel, unjust and futile behavior.

280
0:16:36.84,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Instead create a few beautiful and useful things

281
0:16:40.2,000 --> 0:16:41,000
that outlive us.

282
0:16:45.2,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Approach the world, life,

283
0:16:47.08,000 --> 0:16:48,000
with love.

284
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Learn to develop

285
0:16:51.24,000 --> 0:16:52,000
or cultivate your hearts

286
0:16:52.52,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to see goodness, beauty and truth in others and in the world.

287
0:16:57,000 --> 0:16:59,000
That way we do matter more to ourselves ...

288
0:17:01.24,000 --> 0:17:02,000
to each other,

289
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
to our communities

290
0:17:04.4,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and, for me, to God.

291
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:08,000
This is jihad --

292
0:17:08.64,000 --> 0:17:09,000
my true jihad.

293
0:17:10.92,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Thank you.

294
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.037,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Alec Soth: So about 10 years ago, I got a call from a woman in Texas,

2
0:00:16.682,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Stacey Baker,

3
0:00:18.354,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition

4
0:00:22.116,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and was wondering if she could commission me to take a portrait of her parents.

5
0:00:27.892,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey, and I thought this was some sort of

6
0:00:31.335,000 --> 0:00:35,000
wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich,

7
0:00:35.367,000 --> 0:00:36,000
but it was only later that I found out

8
0:00:37.242,000 --> 0:00:4,000
she'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen.

9
0:00:41.409,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I took the picture of her parents,

10
0:00:43.076,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey.

11
0:00:47.074,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The picture I made that day

12
0:00:48.832,000 --> 0:00:51,000
ended up becoming one of my best-known portraits.

13
0:00:53.566,000 --> 0:00:56,000
At the time I made this picture, Stacey was working as an attorney

14
0:00:57.031,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the State of Texas.

15
0:00:58.686,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Not long after, she left her job to study photography in Maine,

16
0:01:03.386,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and while she was there, she ended up meeting

17
0:01:05.651,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the director of photography at the New York Times Magazine

18
0:01:08.786,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and was actually offered a job.

19
0:01:12.153,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Stacey Baker: In the years since, Alec and I have done

20
0:01:14.982,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a number of magazine projects together,

21
0:01:17.214,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and we've become friends.

22
0:01:19.165,000 --> 0:01:23,000
A few months ago, I started talking to Alec about a fascination of mine.

23
0:01:23.948,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I've always been obsessed with how couples meet.

24
0:01:27.338,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel met,

25
0:01:30.31,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and he told me the story of a high school football game

26
0:01:33.166,000 --> 0:01:35,000
where she was 16 and he was 15,

27
0:01:36.091,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and he asked her out.

28
0:01:38.181,000 --> 0:01:39,000
He liked her purple hair.

29
0:01:40.015,000 --> 0:01:43,000
She said yes, and that was it.

30
0:01:43.173,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I then asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project

31
0:01:47.469,000 --> 0:01:48,000
exploring this question.

32
0:01:49.28,000 --> 0:01:53,000
AS: And I was interested in the question, but I was actually much more interested

33
0:01:53.32,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in Stacey's motivation for asking it,

34
0:01:56.796,000 --> 0:01:59,000
particularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a boyfriend.

35
0:02:00.727,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So as part of this project, I thought it'd be interesting

36
0:02:03.513,000 --> 0:02:05,000
if she tried to meet someone.

37
0:02:05.626,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating

38
0:02:10.471,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day.

39
0:02:14.542,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter) (Applause) (Music)

40
0:02:20.463,000 --> 0:02:25,000
SB: We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event.

41
0:02:25.664,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I had 19 dates

42
0:02:27.684,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and each date lasted three minutes.

43
0:02:30.679,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Participants were given a list of ice- breaker questions to get the ball rolling,

44
0:02:34.616,000 --> 0:02:37,000
things like, "If you could be any kind of animal, what would you be?"

45
0:02:38.563,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That sort of thing.

46
0:02:40.444,000 --> 0:02:42,000
My first date was Colin.

47
0:02:42.858,000 --> 0:02:43,000
He's from England,

48
0:02:44.669,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and he once married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn.

49
0:02:49.824,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Alec and I saw him at the end of the evening,

50
0:02:52.169,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession stands.

51
0:02:57.092,000 --> 0:03:,000
Zack and Chris came to the date-a-thon together.

52
0:03:02.838,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This is Carl.

53
0:03:05.239,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I asked Carl, "What's the first thing you notice about a woman?"

54
0:03:10.663,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He said, "Tits."

55
0:03:12.753,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:17.35,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves.

57
0:03:20.554,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We talked about running. He does triathlons, I run half-marathons.

58
0:03:24.385,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was attracted to him, but I wasn't,

59
0:03:29.238,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I don't think he was attracted to me either.

60
0:03:33.349,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Austin and Mike came together.

61
0:03:36.715,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Mike asked me a hypothetical question.

62
0:03:39.338,000 --> 0:03:43,000
He said, "You're in an elevator running late for a meeting.

63
0:03:43.959,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Someone makes a dash for the elevator.

64
0:03:46.397,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Do you hold it open for them?"

65
0:03:49.346,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And I said I would not.

66
0:03:51.343,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:55.766,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth,

68
0:03:59.818,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and we complimented each other's teeth.

69
0:04:02.813,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Because he's an open mouth sleeper,

70
0:04:05.181,000 --> 0:04:09,000
he says he has to floss more to help prevent gum disease,

71
0:04:09.384,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and so I asked him how often he flosses,

72
0:04:11.799,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and he said, "Every other day."

73
0:04:14.399,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:17.534,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now, as someone who flosses twice a day,

75
0:04:19.972,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I wasn't really sure that that was flossing more

76
0:04:22.372,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but I don't think I said that out loud.

77
0:04:24.894,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Bill is an auditor,

78
0:04:27.936,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and we talked the entire three minutes about auditing. (Laughter)

79
0:04:34.669,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion.

80
0:04:38.64,000 --> 0:04:4,000
He feels a lot of women wear too much makeup,

81
0:04:41.333,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features that they have.

82
0:04:45.164,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all

83
0:04:47.231,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and he seemed to think that that was a good thing.

84
0:04:51.317,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Craig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable.

85
0:04:55.404,000 --> 0:05:,000
He was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment.

86
0:05:00.466,000 --> 0:05:02,000
He thought I was lying, but I wasn't.

87
0:05:02.768,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I didn't think he liked me at all, but at the end of the night,

88
0:05:05.852,000 --> 0:05:08,000
he came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates.

89
0:05:09.846,000 --> 0:05:11,000
William was really difficult to talk to.

90
0:05:12.54,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I think he was drunk.

91
0:05:14.676,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:17.601,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Actor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event.

93
0:05:20.875,000 --> 0:05:22,000
He used to be on "The Young and the Restless."

94
0:05:23.336,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I didn't actually go on a date with him.

95
0:05:26.076,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Alec said he saw several women give their phone numbers to him.

96
0:05:30.791,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Needless to say, I didn't fall in love.

97
0:05:35.62,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I didn't feel a particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with,

98
0:05:39.614,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and I didn't feel like they felt a particular connection with me either.

99
0:05:45.302,000 --> 0:05:47,000
AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to me --

100
0:05:48.043,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter) -- as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability.

101
0:05:53.626,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The physical exterior reveals a crack in which you can get a glimpse

102
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
at a more fragile interior.

103
0:06:00.511,000 --> 0:06:03,000
At this date-a-thon event, I saw so many examples of that,

104
0:06:03.878,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about them,

105
0:06:08.499,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I realized how different photographic love is from real love.

106
0:06:14.512,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What is real love? How does it work?

107
0:06:18.162,000 --> 0:06:22,000
In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes

108
0:06:22.504,000 --> 0:06:26,000
from meeting on a date to having a life together,

109
0:06:27.078,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,

110
0:06:29.632,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas.

111
0:06:35.019,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Our contact there was George, who runs the community's photography club.

112
0:06:39.639,000 --> 0:06:43,000
He arranged for us to meet other couples in their makeshift photo studio.

113
0:06:44.447,000 --> 0:06:49,000
SB: After 45 years of marriage, Anastasia's husband died two years ago,

114
0:06:49.515,000 --> 0:06:52,000
so we asked if she had an old wedding picture.

115
0:06:52.667,000 --> 0:06:55,000
She met her husband when she was a 15-year-old waitress

116
0:06:56.08,000 --> 0:06:58,000
at a small barbecue place in Michigan.

117
0:06:58.565,000 --> 0:06:59,000
He was 30.

118
0:07:00.237,000 --> 0:07:02,000
She'd lied about her age.

119
0:07:02.512,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He was the first person she'd dated.

120
0:07:05.321,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Dean had been named photographer of the year in Las Vegas two years in a row,

121
0:07:09.78,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and this caught Alec's attention,

122
0:07:11.66,000 --> 0:07:13,000
as did the fact that he met his wife, Judy,

123
0:07:14.238,000 --> 0:07:17,000
at the same age when Alec met Rachel.

124
0:07:17.767,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Dean admitted that he likes to look at beautiful women,

125
0:07:20.739,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy.

126
0:07:24.686,000 --> 0:07:26,000
AS: George met Josephine at a parish dance.

127
0:07:27.054,000 --> 0:07:29,000
He was 18, she was 15.

128
0:07:29.562,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Like a lot of the couples we met, they weren't especially philosophical

129
0:07:33.115,000 --> 0:07:35,000
about their early choices.

130
0:07:35.46,000 --> 0:07:37,000
George said something that really stuck with me.

131
0:07:38.041,000 --> 0:07:43,000
He said, "When you get that feeling, you just go with it."

132
0:07:46.142,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Bob and Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school.

133
0:07:49.675,000 --> 0:07:51,000
They said they weren't particularly attracted to each other

134
0:07:52.445,000 --> 0:07:53,000
when the first met.

135
0:07:53.865,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Nevertheless, they were married soon after.

136
0:07:57.113,000 --> 0:07:59,000
SB: The story that stayed with me the most

137
0:07:59.528,000 --> 0:08:03,000
was that of George, the photography club president, and his wife, Mary.

138
0:08:04.265,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This was George and Mary's second marriage.

139
0:08:07.655,000 --> 0:08:11,000
They met at a country-western club in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara.

140
0:08:12.345,000 --> 0:08:15,000
He was there alone drinking and she was with friends.

141
0:08:16.083,000 --> 0:08:21,000
When they started dating, he owed the IRS 9,000 dollars in taxes,

142
0:08:21.795,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and she offered to help him get out of debt,

143
0:08:24.326,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so for the next year, he turned his paychecks over to Mary,

144
0:08:28.296,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and she got him out of debt.

145
0:08:30.804,000 --> 0:08:34,000
George was actually an alcoholic when they married, and Mary knew it.

146
0:08:35.239,000 --> 0:08:37,000
At some point in their marriage, he says he consumed

147
0:08:38.072,000 --> 0:08:41,000
54 beers in one day.

148
0:08:41.601,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Another time, when he was drunk, he threatened to kill Mary

149
0:08:44.434,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and her two kids,

150
0:08:45.966,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house.

151
0:08:50.412,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Amazingly, Mary took him back,

152
0:08:52.583,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and eventually things got better.

153
0:08:54.905,000 --> 0:08:56,000
George has been involved in Alcoholics Anonymous

154
0:08:57.761,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and hasn't had a drink in 36 years.

155
0:09:00.664,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Music)

156
0:09:01.778,000 --> 0:09:03,000
At the end of the day, after we left Sun City,

157
0:09:04.125,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I told Alec that I didn't actually think

158
0:09:06.539,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting.

159
0:09:10.672,000 --> 0:09:12,000
What was more interesting

160
0:09:12.878,000 --> 0:09:15,000
was how they managed to stay together.

161
0:09:16.593,000 --> 0:09:2,000
AS: They all had this beautiful quality of endurance,

162
0:09:20.773,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but that was true of the singles, too.

163
0:09:23.048,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The world is hard, and the singles were out there

164
0:09:26.856,000 --> 0:09:28,000
trying to connect with other people,

165
0:09:29.201,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and the couples were holding onto each other

166
0:09:31.825,000 --> 0:09:32,000
after all these decades.

167
0:09:35.842,000 --> 0:09:38,000
My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne.

168
0:09:39.151,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne,

169
0:09:41.395,000 --> 0:09:46,000
we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if they had an old wedding photograph.

170
0:09:46.906,000 --> 0:09:5,000
In their case, they simultaneously pulled out of their wallets

171
0:09:51.712,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the exact same photograph.

172
0:09:56.008,000 --> 0:09:59,000
What's more beautiful, I thought to myself,

173
0:09:59.142,000 --> 0:10:03,000
this image of a young couple who has just fallen in love

174
0:10:03.438,000 --> 0:10:08,000
or the idea of these two people holding onto this image for decades?

175
0:10:10.264,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Thank you.

176
0:10:12.122,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Applause)

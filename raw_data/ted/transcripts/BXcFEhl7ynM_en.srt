1
0:00:13.014,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.

2
0:00:18.206,000 --> 0:00:2,000
AI researchers have always said

3
0:00:20.373,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that we humans do not need to worry,

4
0:00:22.991,000 --> 0:00:25,000
because only menial jobs will be taken over by machines.

5
0:00:27.274,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Is that really true?

6
0:00:30.365,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They have also said that AI will create new jobs,

7
0:00:34.216,000 --> 0:00:37,000
so those who lose their jobs will find a new one.

8
0:00:38.264,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Of course.

9
0:00:39.643,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But the real question is:

10
0:00:41.839,000 --> 0:00:45,000
How many of those who may lose their jobs to AI

11
0:00:45.968,000 --> 0:00:47,000
will be able to land a new one,

12
0:00:48.481,000 --> 0:00:53,000
especially when AI is smart enough to learn better than most of us?

13
0:00:55.397,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Let me ask you a question:

14
0:00:58.666,000 --> 0:00:59,000
How many of you think

15
0:01:00.488,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that AI will pass the entrance examination of a top university by 2020?

16
0:01:07.836,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Oh, so many. OK.

17
0:01:10.317,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So some of you may say, "Of course, yes!"

18
0:01:15.369,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now singularity is the issue.

19
0:01:18.59,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And some others may say, "Maybe,

20
0:01:21.709,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because AI already won against a top Go player."

21
0:01:27.213,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh."

22
0:01:32.195,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That means we do not know the answer yet, right?

23
0:01:36.268,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So that was the reason why I started Todai Robot Project,

24
0:01:41.252,000 --> 0:01:44,000
making an AI which passes the entrance examination

25
0:01:45.148,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of the University of Tokyo,

26
0:01:47.761,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the top university in Japan.

27
0:01:51.464,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is our Todai Robot.

28
0:01:56.131,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And, of course, the brain of the robot is working in the remote server.

29
0:02:02.747,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It is now writing a 600-word essay

30
0:02:06.993,000 --> 0:02:1,000
on maritime trade in the 17th century.

31
0:02:11.136,000 --> 0:02:12,000
How does that sound?

32
0:02:14.113,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Why did I take the entrance exam as its benchmark?

33
0:02:19.098,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because I thought we had to study the performance of AI

34
0:02:23.863,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in comparison to humans,

35
0:02:26.001,000 --> 0:02:28,000
especially on the skills and expertise

36
0:02:28.885,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which are believed to be acquired only by humans

37
0:02:32.997,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and only through education.

38
0:02:35.782,000 --> 0:02:39,000
To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo,

39
0:02:39.849,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you have to pass two different types of exams.

40
0:02:44.294,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The first one is a national standardized test

41
0:02:48.078,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in multiple-choice style.

42
0:02:50.505,000 --> 0:02:52,000
You have to take seven subjects

43
0:02:52.984,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and achieve a high score --

44
0:02:54.963,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I would say like an 85 percent or more accuracy rate --

45
0:02:59.759,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to be allowed to take the second stage written test

46
0:03:03.87,000 --> 0:03:05,000
prepared by Todai.

47
0:03:06.994,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So let me first explain how modern AI works,

48
0:03:12.335,000 --> 0:03:15,000
taking the "Jeopardy!" challenge as an example.

49
0:03:17.539,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" question:

50
0:03:20.642,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"Mozart's last symphony shares its name with this planet."

51
0:03:26.195,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!" question always asks,

52
0:03:30.232,000 --> 0:03:33,000
always ends with "this" something:

53
0:03:33.584,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"this" planet, "this" country,

54
0:03:36.435,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"this" rock musician, and so on.

55
0:03:39.067,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't ask many different types of questions,

56
0:03:43.39,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but a single type,

57
0:03:45.251,000 --> 0:03:47,000
which we call "factoid questions."

58
0:03:48.975,000 --> 0:03:5,000
By the way, do you know the answer?

59
0:03:53.98,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If you do not know the answer and if you want to know the answer,

60
0:03:58.059,000 --> 0:03:59,000
what would you do?

61
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You Google, right? Of course.

62
0:04:03.316,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Why not?

63
0:04:04.82,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But you have to pick appropriate keywords

64
0:04:08.436,000 --> 0:04:12,000
like "Mozart," "last" and "symphony" to search.

65
0:04:13.462,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The machine basically does the same.

66
0:04:16.457,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Then this Wikipedia page will be ranked top.

67
0:04:21.84,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Then the machine reads the page.

68
0:04:23.772,000 --> 0:04:24,000
No, uh-uh.

69
0:04:25.47,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs,

70
0:04:28.956,000 --> 0:04:31,000
including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot,

71
0:04:32.948,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is able to read.

72
0:04:35.437,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But they are very good at searching and optimizing.

73
0:04:40.158,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It will recognize

74
0:04:42.866,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that the keywords "Mozart," "last" and "symphony"

75
0:04:45.825,000 --> 0:04:47,000
are appearing heavily around here.

76
0:04:49.79,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So if it can find a word which is a planet

77
0:04:54.189,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and which is co-occurring with these keywords,

78
0:04:57.861,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that must be the answer.

79
0:05:00.762,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This is how Watson finds the answer "Jupiter," in this case.

80
0:05:08.433,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Our Todai Robot works similarly, but a bit smarter

81
0:05:12.506,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in answering history yes-no questions,

82
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:21,000
like, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.' Is this sentence true or false?"

83
0:05:23.181,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Our robot starts producing a factoid question,

84
0:05:27.278,000 --> 0:05:31,000
like: "Charlemagne repelled [this person type]" by itself.

85
0:05:32.995,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Then, "Avars" but not "Magyars" is ranked top.

86
0:05:38.357,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This sentence is likely to be false.

87
0:05:42.772,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Our robot does not read, does not understand,

88
0:05:48.335,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but it is statistically correct in many cases.

89
0:05:54.147,000 --> 0:05:56,000
For the second stage written test,

90
0:05:56.679,000 --> 0:06:01,000
it is required to write a 600-word essay like this one:

91
0:06:01.809,000 --> 0:06:03,000
[Discuss the rise and fall of the maritime trade

92
0:06:04.111,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in East and Southeast Asia in the 17th century ...]

93
0:06:06.557,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and as I have shown earlier,

94
0:06:07.968,000 --> 0:06:11,000
our robot took the sentences from the textbooks and Wikipedia,

95
0:06:12.186,000 --> 0:06:13,000
combined them together,

96
0:06:14.171,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and optimized it to produce an essay

97
0:06:17.814,000 --> 0:06:19,000
without understanding a thing.

98
0:06:20.045,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

99
0:06:21.806,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay

100
0:06:26.725,000 --> 0:06:27,000
than most of the students.

101
0:06:28.31,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

102
0:06:30.725,000 --> 0:06:31,000
How about mathematics?

103
0:06:33.354,000 --> 0:06:36,000
A fully automatic math-solving machine

104
0:06:36.536,000 --> 0:06:37,000
has been a dream

105
0:06:38.191,000 --> 0:06:42,000
since the birth of the word "artificial intelligence,"

106
0:06:43.785,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but it has stayed at the level of arithmetic for a long, long time.

107
0:06:51.53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Last year, we finally succeeded in developing a system

108
0:06:56.904,000 --> 0:07:01,000
which solved pre-university-level problems from end to end,

109
0:07:02.101,000 --> 0:07:03,000
like this one.

110
0:07:05.648,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This is the original problem written in Japanese,

111
0:07:09.674,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and we had to teach it 2,000 mathematical axioms

112
0:07:14.095,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and 8,000 Japanese words

113
0:07:16.893,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to make it accept the problems written in natural language.

114
0:07:22.234,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And it is now translating the original problems

115
0:07:25.8,000 --> 0:07:28,000
into machine-readable formulas.

116
0:07:30.578,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Weird, but it is now ready to solve it, I think.

117
0:07:36.701,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Go and solve it.

118
0:07:38.818,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Yes! It is now executing symbolic computation.

119
0:07:44.03,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Even more weird,

120
0:07:45.634,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but probably this is the most fun part for the machine.

121
0:07:50.483,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:52.858,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now it outputs a perfect answer,

123
0:07:55.697,000 --> 0:07:59,000
though its proof is impossible to read, even for mathematicians.

124
0:08:02.773,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Anyway, last year our robot was among the top one percent

125
0:08:10.199,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in the second stage written exam in mathematics.

126
0:08:14.652,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

127
0:08:18.412,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Thank you.

128
0:08:19.747,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So, did it enter Todai?

129
0:08:22.981,000 --> 0:08:25,000
No, not as I expected.

130
0:08:26.783,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Why?

131
0:08:28.206,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Because it doesn't understand any meaning.

132
0:08:32.308,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Let me show you a typical error it made in the English test.

133
0:08:36.411,000 --> 0:08:38,000
[Nate: We're almost at the bookstore. Just a few more minutes.

134
0:08:39.412,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Sunil: Wait. ______ . Nate: Thank you! That always happens ...]

135
0:08:42.475,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Two people are talking.

136
0:08:43.65,000 --> 0:08:45,000
For us, who can understand the situation --

137
0:08:45.704,000 --> 0:08:47,000
[1. "We walked for a long time." 2. "We're almost there."

138
0:08:48.501,000 --> 0:08:51,000
3. "Your shoes look expensive." 4. "Your shoelace is untied."]

139
0:08:51.557,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it is obvious number four is the correct answer, right?

140
0:08:54.454,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But Todai Robot chose number two,

141
0:08:56.716,000 --> 0:09:01,000
even after learning 15 billion English sentences

142
0:09:02.1,000 --> 0:09:04,000
using deep learning technologies.

143
0:09:07.6,000 --> 0:09:11,000
OK, so now you might understand what I said:

144
0:09:12.399,000 --> 0:09:14,000
modern AIs do not read,

145
0:09:15.071,000 --> 0:09:16,000
do not understand.

146
0:09:17.516,000 --> 0:09:2,000
They only disguise as if they do.

147
0:09:24.867,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This is the distribution graph

148
0:09:27.872,000 --> 0:09:32,000
of half a million students who took the same exam as Todai Robot.

149
0:09:34.558,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now our Todai Robot is among the top 20 percent,

150
0:09:40.986,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and it was capable to pass

151
0:09:43.425,000 --> 0:09:46,000
more than 60 percent of the universities in Japan --

152
0:09:47.39,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but not Todai.

153
0:09:50.116,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But see how it is beyond the volume zone

154
0:09:54.165,000 --> 0:09:56,000
of to-be white-collar workers.

155
0:10:00.06,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You might think I was delighted.

156
0:10:03.939,000 --> 0:10:06,000
After all, my robot was surpassing students everywhere.

157
0:10:09.022,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Instead, I was alarmed.

158
0:10:13.086,000 --> 0:10:18,000
How on earth could this unintelligent machine outperform students --

159
0:10:18.717,000 --> 0:10:19,000
our children?

160
0:10:20.033,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Right?

161
0:10:22.101,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I decided to investigate what was going on in the human world.

162
0:10:28.542,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I took hundreds of sentences from high school textbooks

163
0:10:33.859,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and made easy multiple-choice quizzes,

164
0:10:37.196,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and asked thousands of high school students to answer.

165
0:10:42.69,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Here is an example:

166
0:10:43.89,000 --> 0:10:45,000
[Buddhism spread to ... , Christianity to ... and Oceania,

167
0:10:46.732,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and Islam to ...]

168
0:10:47.907,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Of course, the original problems are written in Japanese,

169
0:10:50.671,000 --> 0:10:51,000
their mother tongue.

170
0:10:51.85,000 --> 0:10:52,000
[ ______ has spread to Oceania.

171
0:10:53.389,000 --> 0:10:55,000
1. Hinduism 2. Christianity 3. Islam 4. Buddhism ]

172
0:10:55.83,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Obviously, Christianity is the answer, isn't it?

173
0:10:58.153,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's written!

174
0:11:01.482,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And Todai Robot chose the correct answer, too.

175
0:11:06.758,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But one-third of junior high school students

176
0:11:11.661,000 --> 0:11:13,000
failed to answer this question.

177
0:11:16.456,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Do you think it is only the case in Japan?

178
0:11:19.639,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I do not think so,

179
0:11:21.639,000 --> 0:11:27,000
because Japan is always ranked among the top in OECD PISA tests,

180
0:11:28.034,000 --> 0:11:31,000
measuring 15-year-old students' performance in mathematics,

181
0:11:31.985,000 --> 0:11:32,000
science and reading

182
0:11:33.973,000 --> 0:11:34,000
every three years.

183
0:11:39.39,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We have been believing

184
0:11:41.467,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that everybody can learn

185
0:11:43.534,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and learn well,

186
0:11:45.463,000 --> 0:11:48,000
as long as we provide good learning materials

187
0:11:49.184,000 --> 0:11:5,000
free on the web

188
0:11:50.663,000 --> 0:11:53,000
so that they can access through the internet.

189
0:11:53.756,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But such wonderful materials may benefit only those who can read well,

190
0:12:00.534,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and the percentage of those who can read well

191
0:12:04.493,000 --> 0:12:07,000
may be much less than we expected.

192
0:12:10.04,000 --> 0:12:14,000
How we humans will coexist with AI

193
0:12:14.305,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is something we have to think about carefully,

194
0:12:17.851,000 --> 0:12:19,000
based on solid evidence.

195
0:12:21.063,000 --> 0:12:24,000
At the same time, we have to think in a hurry

196
0:12:25.064,000 --> 0:12:27,000
because time is running out.

197
0:12:28.106,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Thank you.

198
0:12:29.626,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause)

199
0:12:34.211,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you.

200
0:12:36.315,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Noriko Arai: Thank you.

201
0:12:38.104,000 --> 0:12:43,000
CA: In your talk, you so beautifully give us a sense of how AIs think,

202
0:12:43.432,000 --> 0:12:44,000
what they can do amazingly

203
0:12:45.02,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and what they can't do.

204
0:12:46.739,000 --> 0:12:47,000
But -- do I read you right,

205
0:12:48.257,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that you think we really need quite an urgent revolution in education

206
0:12:53.551,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to help kids do the things that humans can do better than AIs?

207
0:12:57.73,000 --> 0:12:58,000
NA: Yes, yes, yes.

208
0:12:59.082,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Because we humans can understand the meaning.

209
0:13:03.141,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That is something which is very, very lacking in AI.

210
0:13:08.071,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But most of the students just pack the knowledge

211
0:13:12.463,000 --> 0:13:15,000
without understanding the meaning of the knowledge,

212
0:13:16.39,000 --> 0:13:18,000
so that is not knowledge, that is just memorizing,

213
0:13:19.223,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and AI can do the same thing.

214
0:13:21.697,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So we have to think about a new type of education.

215
0:13:25.352,000 --> 0:13:28,000
CA: A shift from knowledge, rote knowledge, to meaning.

216
0:13:28.665,000 --> 0:13:29,000
NA: Mm-hmm.

217
0:13:29.84,000 --> 0:13:32,000
CA: Well, there's a challenge for the educators. Thank you so much.

218
0:13:33.104,000 --> 0:13:34,000
NA: Thank you very much. Thank you.

219
0:13:34.826,000 --> 0:13:35,000

1
0:00:12.913,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Anne Milgram: Congressman, I was about to introduce you

2
0:00:15.525,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and say a little more --

3
0:00:16.849,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Will Hurd: Hey, Anne. How are you?

4
0:00:18.494,000 --> 0:00:21,000
AM: Hi, how are you doing? Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

5
0:00:21.722,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We're so lucky to have you here with us.

6
0:00:24.092,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've already explained that you're actually in Washington

7
0:00:26.834,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because you're working.

8
0:00:28.065,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I was about to tell folks

9
0:00:29.525,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that you represent the 23rd district of Texas.

10
0:00:33.339,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But maybe you could tell us a little bit about your district

11
0:00:36.833,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and describe it for us.

12
0:00:39.903,000 --> 0:00:44,000
WH: Sure, my district in Southwest Texas is 29 counties, two time zones,

13
0:00:45.506,000 --> 0:00:48,000
820 miles of border from Eagle Pass, Texas

14
0:00:49.466,000 --> 0:00:5,000
all the way to El Paso.

15
0:00:51.292,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It takes 10 and a half hours to drive across my district at 80 miles an hour,

16
0:00:55.832,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which is the speed limit in most of the district.

17
0:00:58.15,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I found out a couple of weekends ago,

18
0:01:00.158,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it's not the speed limit in all the district.

19
0:01:02.324,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:03.839,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's a 71-percent Latino district,

21
0:01:07.843,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and it's the district that I've been representing

22
0:01:10.307,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for now my third term in Congress.

23
0:01:13.111,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And when you think about the issue of the border,

24
0:01:16.318,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I have more border than any other member of Congress.

25
0:01:19.58,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I spent nine and a half years as an undercover officer in the CIA,

26
0:01:23.506,000 --> 0:01:25,000
chasing bad people all across the country.

27
0:01:26.522,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So when it comes to securing our border,

28
0:01:28.466,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it's something I know a little bit about.

29
0:01:31.141,000 --> 0:01:34,000
AM: One of the things I learned recently which I hadn't known before

30
0:01:34.474,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is that your district is actually the size, I think,

31
0:01:37.395,000 --> 0:01:38,000
of the state of Georgia?

32
0:01:40.741,000 --> 0:01:41,000
WH: That's right.

33
0:01:41.931,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's larger than 26 states, roughly the size of the state of Georgia.

34
0:01:45.997,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So it's pretty big.

35
0:01:48.093,000 --> 0:01:5,000
AM: So as an expert in national security

36
0:01:50.601,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and as a member of Congress,

37
0:01:52.014,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you've been called upon to think about issues

38
0:01:54.807,000 --> 0:01:55,000
related to immigration,

39
0:01:56.466,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and in recent years, particularly about the border wall.

40
0:02:00.434,000 --> 0:02:02,000
What is your reaction to President Trump's statement

41
0:02:03.245,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that we need a big, beautiful wall that would stretch across our border,

42
0:02:07.522,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and at 18 to 30 feet high?

43
0:02:11.812,000 --> 0:02:14,000
WH: I've been saying this since I first ran for Congress back in 2009,

44
0:02:15.217,000 --> 0:02:16,000
this is not a new topic,

45
0:02:16.431,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that building a 30-foot-high concrete structure

46
0:02:19.043,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from sea to shining sea

47
0:02:20.711,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is the most expensive and least effective way

48
0:02:23.569,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to do border security.

49
0:02:25.467,000 --> 0:02:27,000
There are parts of the border

50
0:02:27.894,000 --> 0:02:3,000
where Border Patrol's response time to a threat

51
0:02:31.204,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is measured in hours to days.

52
0:02:33.855,000 --> 0:02:36,000
If your response time is measured in hours to days,

53
0:02:37.679,000 --> 0:02:39,000
then a wall is not a physical barrier.

54
0:02:40.671,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We should be having technology along the border,

55
0:02:42.956,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we should have operation control of our border,

56
0:02:46.608,000 --> 0:02:49,000
which means we know everything that's going back and forth across it.

57
0:02:50.037,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We can do a lot of that with technology.

58
0:02:52.022,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We also need more folks within our border patrol.

59
0:02:55.427,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But in addition to doing all this,

60
0:02:57.633,000 --> 0:03:01,000
one of the things we should be able to do is streamline legal immigration.

61
0:03:02.649,000 --> 0:03:04,000
If you're going to be a productive member of our society,

62
0:03:05.347,000 --> 0:03:07,000
let's get you here as quickly as possible,

63
0:03:07.395,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but let's do it legally.

64
0:03:08.585,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And if we're able to streamline that, then you're going to see

65
0:03:11.559,000 --> 0:03:13,000
some of the pressures relieved along our border

66
0:03:14.038,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and allow men and women in Border Patrol to focus on human trafficking

67
0:03:19.336,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and drug-trafficking organizations as well.

68
0:03:22.479,000 --> 0:03:24,000
AM: Congressman,

69
0:03:25.328,000 --> 0:03:29,000
there's also been a conversation nationally about using emergency funds

70
0:03:30.329,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to build the border wall

71
0:03:31.647,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and taking those funds from the United States military.

72
0:03:35.226,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What has your position been on that issue?

73
0:03:38.321,000 --> 0:03:42,000
WH: I'm one of the few Republicans up here that has opposed that effort.

74
0:03:43.182,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We are just now rebuilding our military,

75
0:03:46.599,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and taking funds away from making sure

76
0:03:48.951,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that our brothers and sisters, our wives and our husbands

77
0:03:52.99,000 --> 0:03:54,000
have the training and equipment they need

78
0:03:55.022,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in order to take care of us in far-flung places --

79
0:03:59.196,000 --> 0:04:03,000
taking money away from them is not an efficient use of our resources,

80
0:04:03.654,000 --> 0:04:06,000
especially if it's going to build a ...

81
0:04:07.065,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you know, I always say it's a fourth-century solution

82
0:04:10.809,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to a 21st-century problem.

83
0:04:14.134,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And the reality is, what we should be focusing on

84
0:04:17.651,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is some of the other root causes of this problem,

85
0:04:20.815,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and many of your speakers today have talked about that.

86
0:04:23.696,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Some of those key root problems are violence, lack of economic opportunity

87
0:04:29.577,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and extreme poverty,

88
0:04:31.101,000 --> 0:04:35,000
specifically, in the Northern Triangle: El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

89
0:04:35.633,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We should be working --

90
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:4,000
AM: I was going to ask what you would recommend

91
0:04:40.998,000 --> 0:04:43,000
United States government does to address the underlying,

92
0:04:44.053,000 --> 0:04:46,000
what we call push factors, or root causes

93
0:04:46.486,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in those three countries in Central America?

94
0:04:49.914,000 --> 0:04:52,000
WH: One of the things I learned as an undercover officer in the CIA

95
0:04:53.096,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is be nice with nice guys and tough with tough guys.

96
0:04:55.834,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And one of the principles of being nice with nice guys

97
0:04:58.439,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is to strengthen our alliances.

98
0:05:01.97,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We have a number of programs currently in these three countries

99
0:05:05.371,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that USAID and the State Department is doing to address this violence issue.

100
0:05:11.014,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And we know, in El Salvador,

101
0:05:12.712,000 --> 0:05:14,000
one of the problems was that the police were corrupt.

102
0:05:15.679,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And so we've worked with the Salvadorians to purge the police,

103
0:05:20.083,000 --> 0:05:22,000
rehire new folks,

104
0:05:22.483,000 --> 0:05:26,000
use community policing tactics.

105
0:05:26.514,000 --> 0:05:3,000
These are tactics the men and women in the United States of America

106
0:05:31.363,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and police forces

107
0:05:32.569,000 --> 0:05:33,000
use every single day.

108
0:05:34.228,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And when we did this in certain communities,

109
0:05:36.392,000 --> 0:05:37,000
guess what happened?

110
0:05:37.576,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We saw a decrease in the violence that was happening in those communities.

111
0:05:41.101,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And then we also saw

112
0:05:42.289,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a decrease in the number of people that were leaving those areas

113
0:05:45.409,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to try to come to the United States illegally.

114
0:05:48.083,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So it's a fraction of the cost to solve a problem there,

115
0:05:52.798,000 --> 0:05:54,000
before it ultimately reaches our border.

116
0:05:55.577,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And one of the reasons that you have violence and crime

117
0:05:59.752,000 --> 0:06:,000
is political corruption

118
0:06:01.331,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the lack of central governments to protect its citizens.

119
0:06:05.99,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And so this is something we should be continuing to work on.

120
0:06:08.831,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We shouldn't be decreasing the amount of money that we have

121
0:06:12.033,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that we're sending to these countries.

122
0:06:13.887,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I actually think we should be increasing it.

123
0:06:15.998,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I believe the first thing -- we should have done this months ago --

124
0:06:19.197,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is select a special representative for the Northern Triangle.

125
0:06:22.667,000 --> 0:06:23,000
That's a senior diplomat

126
0:06:24.483,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that's going to work to make sure we're using all of our levers of power

127
0:06:29.895,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to help these three countries,

128
0:06:32.428,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and then that we're doing it in a coordinated effort.

129
0:06:34.936,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is not just a problem for the United States and Mexico,

130
0:06:37.873,000 --> 0:06:39,000
this is a problem for the entire western hemisphere.

131
0:06:40.371,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So, where is the Organization of American States?

132
0:06:42.689,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Where is the International Development Bank?

133
0:06:44.831,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We should be having a collective plan to address these root causes.

134
0:06:49.49,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And when you talk about violence,

135
0:06:51.22,000 --> 0:06:55,000
a lot of times, we talk about these terrible gangs like MS-13.

136
0:06:56.101,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But it's also violence like women being beaten by their husbands.

137
0:07:01.204,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And they have nobody else to go to,

138
0:07:04.538,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and they are unable to deal with this current problem.

139
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So these are the types of issues

140
0:07:10.149,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that we should be increasing our diplomacy,

141
0:07:13.458,000 --> 0:07:15,000
increasing our economic development aid.

142
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
AM: Please, I want to take you now

143
0:07:18.561,000 --> 0:07:21,000
from thinking about the root causes in Central America

144
0:07:21.863,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to thinking about the separation of children and families

145
0:07:24.96,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the United States.

146
0:07:26.807,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Starting in April 2018,

147
0:07:28.776,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the Trump administration began a no-tolerance policy

148
0:07:32.585,000 --> 0:07:35,000
for immigrants, people seeking refugee status, asylum

149
0:07:36.366,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in the United States.

150
0:07:37.821,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And that led to the separation of 2,700 children

151
0:07:41.805,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in the first year that that program was run.

152
0:07:44.68,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Now, I want to address this with you,

153
0:07:46.474,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and I want to separate it up front into two different conversations.

154
0:07:51.839,000 --> 0:07:53,000
One of the things that the administration did

155
0:07:53.966,000 --> 0:07:54,000
was file legal court papers,

156
0:07:55.369,000 --> 0:07:59,000
saying that one of the primary purposes of the separations

157
0:07:59.808,000 --> 0:08:01,000
was to act as a deterrent

158
0:08:01.965,000 --> 0:08:03,000
against people coming to the United States.

159
0:08:05.252,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And I want to talk for a moment about that from a moral perspective

160
0:08:09.784,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and to get your views.

161
0:08:13.378,000 --> 0:08:16,000
WH: We shouldn't be doing it, period. It's real simple.

162
0:08:17.109,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And guess what, it wasn't a deterrent.

163
0:08:19.515,000 --> 0:08:22,000
You only saw an increase in the amount of illegal immigration.

164
0:08:23.188,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And when you're sitting, debating a strategy,

165
0:08:26.942,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if somebody comes up with the idea

166
0:08:30.053,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of snatching a child out of their mother's arms,

167
0:08:33.633,000 --> 0:08:35,000
you need to go back to the drawing board.

168
0:08:36.141,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This is not what the United States of America stands for,

169
0:08:40.014,000 --> 0:08:43,000
this is not a Republican or a Democrat or independent thing.

170
0:08:43.966,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This is a human decency thing.

171
0:08:46.577,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And so, using that strategy,

172
0:08:49.14,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it didn't achieve the ultimate purpose.

173
0:08:51.568,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And ultimately, the amount of research that is done

174
0:08:56.403,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and the impact that the detention of children has --

175
0:08:59.323,000 --> 0:09:01,000
especially if it's over 21 days --

176
0:09:01.625,000 --> 0:09:03,000
has on their development and their future

177
0:09:04.632,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is disastrous.

178
0:09:05.809,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So we shouldn't be trying to detain children for any more than 21 days,

179
0:09:09.216,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and we should be getting children, if they're in our custody,

180
0:09:12.497,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we should be taking care of them humanely,

181
0:09:14.687,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and making sure they're with people

182
0:09:16.625,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that can provide them a safe and loving environment.

183
0:09:20.727,000 --> 0:09:22,000
AM: I would challenge you even on the 21-day number,

184
0:09:23.657,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but for the purposes of this conversation,

185
0:09:26.307,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I want to follow up on something you just said,

186
0:09:28.553,000 --> 0:09:3,000
which is both that it's wrong to detain children,

187
0:09:31.458,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and that it's not effective.

188
0:09:33.625,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So the question, then, is why does the administration continue to do it,

189
0:09:37.571,000 --> 0:09:4,000
when we've seen 900 additional children separated from their parents

190
0:09:41.387,000 --> 0:09:43,000
since the summer of 2018?

191
0:09:43.696,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Why is this happening?

192
0:09:46.163,000 --> 0:09:49,000
WH: Well, that's something that you'd have to ultimately

193
0:09:49.284,000 --> 0:09:5,000
ask the administration.

194
0:09:50.475,000 --> 0:09:52,000
These are questions that I've been asking.

195
0:09:52.506,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The Tornillo facility is in my district.

196
0:09:55.538,000 --> 0:10:01,000
These are buildings that are not designed to hold anybody

197
0:10:02.469,000 --> 0:10:03,000
for multiple days,

198
0:10:03.918,000 --> 0:10:04,000
let alone children.

199
0:10:05.679,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We should be making sure that if they are in our custody --

200
0:10:09.225,000 --> 0:10:12,000
a lot of times for the uncompanied children,

201
0:10:12.283,000 --> 0:10:14,000
we don't have a ...

202
0:10:14.427,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we don't know of a patron or a family member in the United States,

203
0:10:19.728,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we should make sure that they're in facilities

204
0:10:22.412,000 --> 0:10:23,000
where they're able to go to school

205
0:10:24.077,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and have proper food and health care.

206
0:10:26.966,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And if we're able to find a sponsor or family member,

207
0:10:30.162,000 --> 0:10:32,000
let's get them into that custody,

208
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
while they're waiting for their immigration court case.

209
0:10:36.282,000 --> 0:10:37,000
That's the other issue here.

210
0:10:37.906,000 --> 0:10:38,000
When you have a backlog of cases --

211
0:10:39.729,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I think it's now 900,000 cases that are backlogged --

212
0:10:44.024,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we should be able to do an immigration hearing

213
0:10:46.633,000 --> 0:10:47,000
within nine months.

214
0:10:47.914,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I think most of the legal community thinks that is enough time

215
0:10:51.368,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to do something like this,

216
0:10:52.807,000 --> 0:10:57,000
so that we can facilitate whether someone, an individual,

217
0:10:58.701,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is able to stay in the United States

218
0:11:00.465,000 --> 0:11:03,000
or they're going to have to be returned back to their home country,

219
0:11:03.64,000 --> 0:11:05,000
rather than being in this limbo for five years.

220
0:11:05.982,000 --> 0:11:07,000
AM: If we think about the asylum system today,

221
0:11:08.546,000 --> 0:11:11,000
where people are coming and saying that they have a credible threat,

222
0:11:12.093,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that they will be persecuted back home,

223
0:11:14.133,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and we think about the fact that on average,

224
0:11:16.307,000 --> 0:11:19,000
it's about two years for someone to get an asylum hearing,

225
0:11:19.434,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that many people are not represented as they go through that process,

226
0:11:23.813,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it makes me think about something

227
0:11:25.424,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that they say in the health care space all the time,

228
0:11:27.88,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which is that every system is perfectly designed

229
0:11:30.551,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to get the results it gets.

230
0:11:32.752,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And so as you think about this

231
0:11:34.212,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and think about how we would redesign this system

232
0:11:38.411,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to not do what we're doing,

233
0:11:39.877,000 --> 0:11:44,000
which is years and years of detention and separations and hardship

234
0:11:45.074,000 --> 0:11:46,000
for people seeking --

235
0:11:46.299,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and again, asylum being a lawful United States government process --

236
0:11:50.785,000 --> 0:11:53,000
for people seeking to enter our country lawfully.

237
0:11:54.309,000 --> 0:11:55,000
What should we do?

238
0:11:56.5,000 --> 0:11:58,000
WH: I tried to increase by four billion dollars

239
0:11:59.254,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the amount of resources that HHS has

240
0:12:02.481,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in order to specifically deal, ultimately, with children.

241
0:12:06.299,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I think we need more immigration judges in order to process these cases,

242
0:12:11.498,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and I think we need to ensure that folks can get representation.

243
0:12:17.009,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I've been able to work with a number of lawyers up and down the border

244
0:12:21.551,000 --> 0:12:25,000
to make sure they are being able to get access to the folks

245
0:12:26.004,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that are having these problems.

246
0:12:28.735,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And so this is something that we should be able to design.

247
0:12:32.488,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And ultimately, when it comes to children,

248
0:12:35.075,000 --> 0:12:38,000
we should be doing everything we can when they're in our custody,

249
0:12:38.279,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in order to take care of them.

250
0:12:41.03,000 --> 0:12:42,000
AM: So I have two more questions for you

251
0:12:42.982,000 --> 0:12:44,000
before I'm going to let you go back to work.

252
0:12:45.061,000 --> 0:12:49,000
The first is about our focus in the United States

253
0:12:49.339,000 --> 0:12:5,000
on the questions of immigration.

254
0:12:51.212,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Because if you look at some of the statistics,

255
0:12:53.419,000 --> 0:12:55,000
you see that of people who are undocumented

256
0:12:56.427,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in the United States,

257
0:12:57.76,000 --> 0:13:,000
the majority of people have overstayed on visas,

258
0:13:01.292,000 --> 0:13:02,000
they haven't come through the border.

259
0:13:03.12,000 --> 0:13:05,000
If you look at the people who try to enter the country

260
0:13:05.903,000 --> 0:13:06,000
who are on the terrorist watch list,

261
0:13:07.733,000 --> 0:13:09,000
they enter overwhelmingly through the airports

262
0:13:10.728,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and not through the border.

263
0:13:12.069,000 --> 0:13:14,000
If we look at drugs coming into the United States,

264
0:13:14.434,000 --> 0:13:16,000
which has been a huge part of this conversation,

265
0:13:16.736,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the vast majority of those drugs come through our ports

266
0:13:20.038,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and through other points of entry,

267
0:13:22.244,000 --> 0:13:25,000
not through backpacks on people crossing the border.

268
0:13:25.83,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So the thing I always ask

269
0:13:27.116,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and I always worry about with government,

270
0:13:29.266,000 --> 0:13:32,000
is that we focus so much on one thing,

271
0:13:32.647,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and my question for you is whether we are focused

272
0:13:35.855,000 --> 0:13:37,000
in this conversation nationally about the border,

273
0:13:38.182,000 --> 0:13:4,000
every day and every minute of every day,

274
0:13:40.815,000 --> 0:13:43,000
whether we're looking completely in the wrong direction.

275
0:13:46.021,000 --> 0:13:48,000
WH: I would agree with your premise.

276
0:13:48.537,000 --> 0:13:49,000
When you have --

277
0:13:49.711,000 --> 0:13:5,000
let's start with the economic benefits.

278
0:13:51.609,000 --> 0:13:53,000
When you have 3.6 percent unemployment,

279
0:13:53.741,000 --> 0:13:54,000
what does that mean?

280
0:13:54.932,000 --> 0:13:56,000
That means you need folks in every industry,

281
0:13:57.091,000 --> 0:13:59,000
whether it's agriculture or artificial intelligence.

282
0:13:59.624,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So why aren't we streamlining legal immigration?

283
0:14:02.617,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We should be able to make this market based

284
0:14:05.22,000 --> 0:14:07,000
in order to have folks come in

285
0:14:07.55,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and be productive members of our society.

286
0:14:10.336,000 --> 0:14:12,000
When it comes to the drug issue you're talking about,

287
0:14:13.315,000 --> 0:14:14,000
yes, it's in our ports of entry,

288
0:14:14.99,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but it's also coming in to our shores.

289
0:14:16.895,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Coast Guard is only able to action

290
0:14:19.056,000 --> 0:14:22,000
25 percent of the known intelligence they have

291
0:14:22.72,000 --> 0:14:24,000
on drugs coming into our country.

292
0:14:25.109,000 --> 0:14:28,000
The metric that we should be measuring [is]

293
0:14:28.596,000 --> 0:14:33,000
are we seeing a decrease of deaths from overdose from drugs overseas,

294
0:14:33.654,000 --> 0:14:36,000
are we seeing a decrease in illegal immigration?

295
0:14:37.307,000 --> 0:14:42,000
It's not how many miles of fencing that we have ultimately built.

296
0:14:42.863,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And so we have benefited

297
0:14:44.951,000 --> 0:14:46,000
from the brain drain of every other country

298
0:14:46.99,000 --> 0:14:47,000
for the last couple of decades.

299
0:14:48.521,000 --> 0:14:49,000
I want to see that continue,

300
0:14:49.934,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and I want to see that continue with the hardworking drain.

301
0:14:52.783,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And I can sell you this:

302
0:14:53.981,000 --> 0:14:57,000
at last Congress, Pete Aguilar, a Democrat from California, and I

303
0:14:58.696,000 --> 0:15:,000
had a piece of legislation called the USA Act:

304
0:15:01.156,000 --> 0:15:04,000
strong border security, streamline legal immigration,

305
0:15:04.53,000 --> 0:15:08,000
fix DACA -- 1.2 million kids who have only known the United States of America

306
0:15:09.284,000 --> 0:15:1,000
as their home --

307
0:15:10.482,000 --> 0:15:12,000
these kids, or I should say young men and women,

308
0:15:12.751,000 --> 0:15:13,000
they are already Americans,

309
0:15:14.076,000 --> 0:15:17,000
let's not have them go through any more uncertainty

310
0:15:18.006,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and make that ultimately happen.

311
0:15:20.141,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We had 245 people that were willing to sign this bill into law,

312
0:15:24.185,000 --> 0:15:27,000
it wasn't allowed to come forward under a Republican speaker,

313
0:15:28.034,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and also the current Democratic speaker hasn't brought this bill

314
0:15:31.86,000 --> 0:15:33,000
through in something that we would be able to pass.

315
0:15:34.558,000 --> 0:15:35,000
AM: So I want to close,

316
0:15:36.207,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and you are, perhaps, most famous -- I don't know if that's fair --

317
0:15:41.091,000 --> 0:15:43,000
but you took a road trip with Beto O'Rourke

318
0:15:43.414,000 --> 0:15:45,000
from your district to Washington, DC,

319
0:15:46.092,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and you've become known for reaching across the aisle

320
0:15:48.6,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and engaging in these bipartisan conversations.

321
0:15:51.846,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And one of the things I've seen you say repeatedly

322
0:15:54.784,000 --> 0:15:57,000
is to talk about how we are all united.

323
0:15:58.18,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And I think, when we think about the language of immigration

324
0:16:01.205,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and we start hearing words about enemies and militarization,

325
0:16:05.479,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I think the real question is: How do we convince all Americans

326
0:16:10.299,000 --> 0:16:14,000
to understand what you say that more unites us than divides us?

327
0:16:16.274,000 --> 0:16:18,000
WH: Crisscrossing a district like mine that's truly 50-50 --

328
0:16:19.252,000 --> 0:16:21,000
50 percent Democrat, 50 percent Republican,

329
0:16:21.285,000 --> 0:16:24,000
it's been very clear to me that way more unites us than divides us.

330
0:16:25.211,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And if we focus on those things that we agree on,

331
0:16:27.553,000 --> 0:16:28,000
we'll all be better off.

332
0:16:28.918,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And I'm not going to get a perfect attendance award

333
0:16:31.847,000 --> 0:16:32,000
for going to church,

334
0:16:33.062,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but I do remember when Jesus was in the Second Temple

335
0:16:36.296,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and the Pharisees asked him what's the most important commandment,

336
0:16:39.45,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and he said to "Love thy Lord God with all your heart, mind and soul."

337
0:16:42.839,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But people forget he also said, "Equally as important,

338
0:16:45.824,000 --> 0:16:47,000
is to love thy neighbor like thyself."

339
0:16:47.95,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And if we remember that and realize what it would mean,

340
0:16:52.143,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and what you would have to be going through

341
0:16:54.183,000 --> 0:16:56,000
to be living in a situation

342
0:16:56.532,000 --> 0:17:,000
that you may send your child on a 3,000-mile perilous journey,

343
0:17:01.522,000 --> 0:17:04,000
because that's what you think the only thing for their future,

344
0:17:05.038,000 --> 0:17:08,000
the only thing that you can do to make sure their future is bright,

345
0:17:08.212,000 --> 0:17:1,000
if we all remember that situation,

346
0:17:10.323,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and think what we would do in that situation,

347
0:17:13.516,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I think we'd also be better off.

348
0:17:15.905,000 --> 0:17:18,000
AM: Thank you, Congressman. Thank you so much for joining us tonight.

349
0:17:19.396,000 --> 0:17:21,000
(Applause)

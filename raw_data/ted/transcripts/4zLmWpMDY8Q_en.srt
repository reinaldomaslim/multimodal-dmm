0:00:13.208,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Unless you've spent quality time on the International Space Station,

3
0:00:17.375,000 --> 0:00:2,000
this is probably not a view you are super familiar with.

4
0:00:20.833,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This is the east coast of the United States.

5
0:00:23.875,000 --> 0:00:25,000
That's New York down there in the lower right,

6
0:00:26.125,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and it's a band of light all the way up through Washington DC.

7
0:00:30.333,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Those cities are shining like jewels,

8
0:00:32.708,000 --> 0:00:35,000
highways are traced by webs of light.

9
0:00:36.333,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And all of that light is super photogenic.

10
0:00:39.583,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But there's a problem.

11
0:00:41.875,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That light is meant to be illuminating our sidewalks,

12
0:00:45.875,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and our streets and our houses.

13
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Instead, it's actually going up into the sky

14
0:00:50.667,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and out into the universe,

15
0:00:52.292,000 --> 0:00:54,000
where it's not doing any of us any good.

16
0:00:55.625,000 --> 0:00:58,000
When I see photos of this, of the Earth,

17
0:00:59.125,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I see environmental catastrophe.

18
0:01:02.625,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Those aren't jewels,

19
0:01:04.542,000 --> 0:01:05,000
those are tumors.

20
0:01:07.958,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I'm an astronomer,

21
0:01:09.25,000 --> 0:01:11,000
so it's really no surprise probably to anyone

22
0:01:11.875,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that I've always loved the night sky.

23
0:01:14.25,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm kind of a walking cliché.

24
0:01:18.792,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But when I was growing up in Minnesota,

25
0:01:21.333,000 --> 0:01:24,000
one of my favorite things to do on a summer evening

26
0:01:24.458,000 --> 0:01:26,000
was grab my old Raggedy Ann sleeping bag

27
0:01:27.125,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and take it out into a field behind my house,

28
0:01:29.458,000 --> 0:01:32,000
where I would spend hours looking at the night sky.

29
0:01:32.958,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And to do this, I had to brave not only the darkness,

30
0:01:36.125,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but also swarms of mosquitoes,

31
0:01:38.583,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and my sleeping bag really didn't smell very good.

32
0:01:41.875,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:44.708,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But there was one particular star

34
0:01:47.375,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that I would look for, night after night.

35
0:01:49.542,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And then I would play this game

36
0:01:51.292,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where I would try to focus on that star so intensely,

37
0:01:55.583,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that everything else would fade from my view

38
0:01:57.958,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and that single star would be all that I could see.

39
0:02:00.917,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I could only ever hold on to that focus

40
0:02:03.042,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for a few fleeting moments.

41
0:02:05.583,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But when I did,

42
0:02:06.958,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I felt this deep sense of connection to the universe.

43
0:02:10.833,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And almost a sense of vertigo,

44
0:02:14.208,000 --> 0:02:16,000
like I was going to fall into space.

45
0:02:18.292,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And when this happened --

46
0:02:20.167,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I know this sounds kind of ridiculous,

47
0:02:22.042,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but I would simultaneously feel unfathomably insignificant

48
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and also kind of weirdly important.

49
0:02:31.458,000 --> 0:02:35,000
That star I looked to night after night was called Vega.

50
0:02:35.708,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Vega is the brightest star in the constellation Lyra,

51
0:02:39.458,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which is not coincidentally the name of one of my dogs.

52
0:02:42.25,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:44.75,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But this experience is being lost.

54
0:02:47.583,000 --> 0:02:49,000
My favorite constellation, Lyra,

55
0:02:49.875,000 --> 0:02:51,000
this is what it would look like from Manhattan.

56
0:02:52.09,000 --> 0:02:54,000
For people who live in urban and suburban environments,

57
0:02:54.708,000 --> 0:02:56,000
if they go outside at night and look up,

58
0:02:57.375,000 --> 0:03:01,000
instead of being awestruck by the majesty of the universe,

59
0:03:02.125,000 --> 0:03:04,000
they see pretty much nothing.

60
0:03:05.5,000 --> 0:03:09,000
These unremarkable, completely blank night skies,

61
0:03:10.167,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of course are due to all of the light we produce at night.

62
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Those very same lights we see all the way from space

63
0:03:16.583,000 --> 0:03:17,000
are shining up into the atmosphere,

64
0:03:18.583,000 --> 0:03:23,000
where they bounce around and create this featureless smog of light.

65
0:03:23.792,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And that featureless smog of light has a name.

66
0:03:26.25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's called light pollution.

67
0:03:28.5,000 --> 0:03:29,000
As an astronomer,

68
0:03:29.792,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I can actually tell how bad light pollution is

69
0:03:32.5,000 --> 0:03:34,000
by the brightness of stars I can see in the sky.

70
0:03:35.083,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it turns out

71
0:03:36.375,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that when you're trying to unlock the secrets of the cosmos,

72
0:03:39.625,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it's really helpful to be able to see the cosmos.

73
0:03:43.458,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And --

74
0:03:44.833,000 --> 0:03:45,000
[Laughs]

75
0:03:45.958,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Truth.

76
0:03:48.625,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And this light that we're trying to detect

77
0:03:50.667,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is coming from millions or billions of light-years away,

78
0:03:54.833,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and so it's generally pretty faint.

79
0:03:58.083,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And as an astronomer,

80
0:03:59.875,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I fight with this every day to do my job,

81
0:04:02.375,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and I have to tell you, it is a really big problem.

82
0:04:08.917,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But the problem is far worse

83
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
than just losing some whimsical ability to gaze at the stars.

84
0:04:17.25,000 --> 0:04:18,000
For example,

85
0:04:18.542,000 --> 0:04:2,000
countless plant and animal species are affected.

86
0:04:21.5,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So we could talk about sea turtles

87
0:04:24.667,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or pollinators

88
0:04:27.125,000 --> 0:04:29,000
or any of these super important species

89
0:04:30.125,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that are also cute.

90
0:04:32.458,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Instead, I want to talk

91
0:04:33.75,000 --> 0:04:36,000
about these quietly unassuming dog whelks.

92
0:04:37.208,000 --> 0:04:38,000
You may have seen them around

93
0:04:38.625,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and not given them really a whole lot of thought.

94
0:04:41.375,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But they're pretty cool.

95
0:04:42.667,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So in an entire year

96
0:04:44.625,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a dog whelk will rarely move more than about 10 meters.

97
0:04:48.917,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That means that when they are attacking their prey

98
0:04:52.833,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they can hit this brisk pace of about a millimeter an hour.

99
0:04:56.708,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And --

100
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:01.333,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This works out OK,

102
0:05:02.792,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because they attack things like barnacles.

103
0:05:05.417,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:10.75,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So these dog whelks live in the intertidal area of coasts,

105
0:05:14.958,000 --> 0:05:15,000
where, it turns out,

106
0:05:16.25,000 --> 0:05:18,000
they're a pretty key part of the ecosystem.

107
0:05:18.333,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Not only are they one of the most dominant invertebrate predators,

108
0:05:23.167,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but other animals, like crabs and birds, think they're pretty tasty.

109
0:05:28.25,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So that leaves these poor snails in a kind of precarious situation,

110
0:05:31.667,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because if they go too low in the water,

111
0:05:34.083,000 --> 0:05:35,000
then crabs are a threat,

112
0:05:35.917,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but if they come out of the water too far,

113
0:05:38.042,000 --> 0:05:39,000
birds are going to have a feast.

114
0:05:41.083,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Why is an astronomer telling you about dog whelks?

115
0:05:45.083,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I ask that myself.

116
0:05:47.833,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Because their behavior is impacted by light pollution.

117
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:52,000
For example,

118
0:05:52.292,000 --> 0:05:55,000
if dog whelks are subjected to artificial light at night

119
0:05:55.542,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they're about twice as likely to stay under the water with a predator.

120
0:05:59.792,000 --> 0:06:,000
And that puts them at increased risk.

121
0:06:01.708,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And it's not like they can make a speedy escape.

122
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And so these --

123
0:06:05.292,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

124
0:06:07.292,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the other issue is because they literally move

125
0:06:09.75,000 --> 0:06:1,000
at a snail's pace.

126
0:06:11.583,000 --> 0:06:13,000
If a population is wiped out,

127
0:06:14.292,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it can take decades to replenish.

128
0:06:17.25,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And that, in turn, affects the rest of their ecosystem

129
0:06:19.833,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and the other species, like the birds and the barnacles and the crabs.

130
0:06:23.875,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So this is just one small and slimy example

131
0:06:27.125,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of how light pollution can unleash a cascade effect

132
0:06:30.542,000 --> 0:06:32,000
on an entire ecosystem.

133
0:06:32.917,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Virtually every species that has been studied to date

134
0:06:37.375,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is impacted by light pollution.

135
0:06:39.208,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that includes humans.

136
0:06:40.583,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So let's talk about us.

137
0:06:42.625,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You are probably not surprised to hear

138
0:06:45.042,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that light pollution can affect your ability to sleep well at night.

139
0:06:48.958,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But you might be surprised to hear that light pollution is linked to obesity.

140
0:06:54.167,000 --> 0:06:55,000
In fact, in a recent study

141
0:06:55.542,000 --> 0:06:58,000
they found that light pollution contributed to over 70 percent

142
0:06:58.917,000 --> 0:07:,000
of the obesity rates in 80 countries.

143
0:07:02.375,000 --> 0:07:03,000
More than that,

144
0:07:03.708,000 --> 0:07:07,000
light pollution actually contributed about the same amount to excess weight

145
0:07:07.875,000 --> 0:07:08,000
as eating junk food.

146
0:07:10.458,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And it gets worse.

147
0:07:12.042,000 --> 0:07:13,000
For people who are subjected

148
0:07:14.042,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to significant amounts of artificial light at night

149
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:21,000
they're about 50 percent more likely to get breast cancer.

150
0:07:21.125,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And in fact, light pollution is correlated with types of cancer

151
0:07:24.375,000 --> 0:07:25,000
across the board.

152
0:07:25.75,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And in controlled lab experiments

153
0:07:27.417,000 --> 0:07:31,000
there's a direct link between increased artificial light at night

154
0:07:31.917,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and a rate of tumor growth.

155
0:07:34.792,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You might be wondering how normal light

156
0:07:37.667,000 --> 0:07:4,000
could possibly impact cancer rates.

157
0:07:40.958,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It likely all comes down to the super important hormone

158
0:07:43.792,000 --> 0:07:44,000
called melatonin,

159
0:07:45.583,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which we have evolved over millions of years

160
0:07:47.875,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to produce on a day-night cycle, or a circadian rhythm.

161
0:07:51.792,000 --> 0:07:53,000
What happens is that when light impacts

162
0:07:54.333,000 --> 0:07:56,000
the retina at the back of our eye at night

163
0:07:56.542,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it can disrupt melatonin production,

164
0:07:59.083,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and when melatonin production is disrupted,

165
0:08:01.375,000 --> 0:08:03,000
a whole chain of other chemical processes are affected,

166
0:08:04.25,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and that includes estrogen production.

167
0:08:06.417,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And when we throw this chemical balance out of whack,

168
0:08:09.167,000 --> 0:08:1,000
really bad things can happen.

169
0:08:11.042,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In fact, things are so bad,

170
0:08:12.708,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that the International Agency for Cancer Research

171
0:08:15.542,000 --> 0:08:18,000
has said that disrupting the human circadian rhythm

172
0:08:18.875,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is a probable carcinogen.

173
0:08:22.292,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Also, for fun, I want to let you know

174
0:08:24.125,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that light pollution has been linked to,

175
0:08:26.083,000 --> 0:08:29,000
let's see -- headaches, anxiety, depression, diabetes,

176
0:08:29.167,000 --> 0:08:31,000
cardiovascular disease and the list goes on.

177
0:08:31.458,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But maybe you don't care about your health.

178
0:08:33.792,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We're all going to die anyway,

179
0:08:35.25,000 --> 0:08:37,000
you might as well die in a brightly lit room.

180
0:08:37.542,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:40.208,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The fact that you're laughing about death is kind of amazing.

182
0:08:43.167,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:45.208,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You might still care about money.

184
0:08:48.083,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The money that's spent on that wasted light,

185
0:08:50.292,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and I mean just the light that's going out into the universe,

186
0:08:53.25,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and not doing us any good,

187
0:08:54.542,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is three billion dollars a year.

188
0:08:56.417,000 --> 0:08:58,000
That's enough money to build, like,

189
0:08:58.458,000 --> 0:09:,000
1,000 utility-grade windmills,

190
0:09:01.042,000 --> 0:09:05,000
or fund the entire DC public-school system for over two years,

191
0:09:05.333,000 --> 0:09:07,000
or -- this is my favorite, because I really want one

192
0:09:07.833,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but I can't afford one --

193
0:09:09.5,000 --> 0:09:11,000
buy 30,000 Tesla Model X SUVs.

194
0:09:12.375,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:14.417,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And that includes the electric car tax credit.

196
0:09:18.708,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And then there are the existential costs.

197
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I don't have any data

198
0:09:24.292,000 --> 0:09:27,000
on how losing touch with our place in the cosmos

199
0:09:27.917,000 --> 0:09:28,000
impacts us.

200
0:09:29.792,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But I believe

201
0:09:32.375,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that this probably impacts our humanity

202
0:09:34.458,000 --> 0:09:37,000
more than any of the other scary statistics I can share with you.

203
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And it's getting worse with time.

204
0:09:39.625,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The amount of light pollution is doubling roughly every 35 years.

205
0:09:45.25,000 --> 0:09:48,000
That means that within the next decade

206
0:09:48.542,000 --> 0:09:51,000
virtually the entire eastern half of the United States

207
0:09:52.125,000 --> 0:09:54,000
will be perpetually brighter than twilight.

208
0:09:56.25,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And there's another issue with light pollution.

209
0:09:59.042,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The problem is way worse than we can see with our own eyes.

210
0:10:02.167,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Our eyes have evolved to just detect this tiny range

211
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of the full spectrum of light.

212
0:10:07.125,000 --> 0:10:09,000
All of this other light that we can't see,

213
0:10:09.5,000 --> 0:10:11,000
this invisible light,

214
0:10:11.583,000 --> 0:10:12,000
also has a pollution problem.

215
0:10:13.25,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Mostly it's from modern technology,

216
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:17,000
things like cell phones or car-to-car radar,

217
0:10:17.375,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or now apparently we need appliances that can talk to each other.

218
0:10:21.792,000 --> 0:10:24,000
All of this modern technology is putting out strong signals

219
0:10:24.833,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that can completely swamp

220
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
this exceedingly faint light we're trying to detect

221
0:10:30.792,000 --> 0:10:32,000
from the rest of the universe outside Earth,

222
0:10:32.958,000 --> 0:10:34,000
which just for the record, is most of the universe.

223
0:10:36.708,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

224
0:10:42.083,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And then, there are satellites.

225
0:10:44.375,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Satellites are a problem at both visible and invisible wavelengths.

226
0:10:48.542,000 --> 0:10:52,000
A host of private companies have plans to deploy tens of thousands of satellites

227
0:10:52.75,000 --> 0:10:53,000
into Earth orbit,

228
0:10:54.542,000 --> 0:10:56,000
where they will not only outnumber,

229
0:10:56.625,000 --> 0:10:59,000
literally outnumber the visible stars in the sky,

230
0:11:00.042,000 --> 0:11:04,000
while also beaming invisible light back to Earth.

231
0:11:04.417,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So for astronomers like me,

232
0:11:06.375,000 --> 0:11:08,000
who use invisible light to study the universe,

233
0:11:08.875,000 --> 0:11:11,000
it's going to be like staring at the Sun

234
0:11:11.958,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and trying to see a birthday candle behind it.

235
0:11:15.75,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Alright, I want to be clear

236
0:11:17.958,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that there's nothing inherently wrong with any of this modern technology.

237
0:11:22.125,000 --> 0:11:25,000
With cell phones or satellites or car radar.

238
0:11:25.417,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I'm not sure about kitchen appliances.

239
0:11:27.625,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I haven't broken down

241
0:11:30.292,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and gotten an oven that talks to my cell phone yet.

242
0:11:32.958,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I use lights at night like everybody else.

243
0:11:37.583,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But here's the thing.

244
0:11:39.333,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Some problems in the world,

245
0:11:41.333,000 --> 0:11:43,000
like we've heard about today and you'll hear more about,

246
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
are overwhelming and they seem intractable.

247
0:11:47.833,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Visible light pollution is not one of these problems.

248
0:11:51.583,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is actually stupidly simple, OK?

249
0:11:54.917,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So here are five super simple things you can do.

250
0:11:58.667,000 --> 0:12:,000
Don't use lights brighter than you need to.

251
0:12:01.583,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Don't use lights when you don't need them.

252
0:12:04.042,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Those lights you're using,

253
0:12:05.333,000 --> 0:12:06,000
make sure they're shielded down,

254
0:12:06.958,000 --> 0:12:08,000
so they're not shining up into the sky.

255
0:12:09.125,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And let's talk about LED lights.

256
0:12:11.25,000 --> 0:12:15,000
If you have a choice, don't buy the blue ones.

257
0:12:15.583,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Look for words like "warm white."

258
0:12:18.333,000 --> 0:12:22,000
If you buy LEDs with words like "natural light" or "daylight,"

259
0:12:22.5,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that's like saying you hate space.

260
0:12:24.542,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

261
0:12:30.833,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And finally,

262
0:12:33.375,000 --> 0:12:34,000
you could advocate for this.

263
0:12:35.333,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Even in your local community,

264
0:12:36.792,000 --> 0:12:37,000
find out if there's a lighting code

265
0:12:38.5,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and whether it could be made more night-sky friendly.

266
0:12:41.375,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Or dare I say, you could even advocate at the federal level,

267
0:12:44.958,000 --> 0:12:46,000
by politely asking our federal officials,

268
0:12:47.5,000 --> 0:12:48,000
some of whom may be here,

269
0:12:48.792,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to please not auction off our view of the invisible universe

270
0:12:53.042,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to the highest bidder to pollute at will,

271
0:12:55.042,000 --> 0:12:57,000
which is actually what happens.

272
0:12:57.5,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Now, like a good professor,

273
0:13:00.292,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I have homework for you.

274
0:13:02.917,000 --> 0:13:06,000
If you have never seen a truly dark night sky,

275
0:13:07.292,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I want you to go out and experience one for yourself.

276
0:13:11.292,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Because if you don't,

277
0:13:13.292,000 --> 0:13:16,000
you don't know what you're missing,

278
0:13:16.333,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and you don't know what humanity is losing.

279
0:13:19.833,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Thank you.

280
0:13:21.125,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Applause)

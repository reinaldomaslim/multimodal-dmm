0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A month ago today

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I stood there:

3
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
90 degrees south, the top of

4
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.

5
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,

6
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.

7
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Together we had just broken the world speed record

8
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
for a trek to the South Pole.

9
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It took us 33 days,

10
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.

11
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We shaved five days off the previous best time.

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And in the process, I became the first person in history

13
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to make the entire 650-mile journey,

14
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
from Hercules Inlet to South Pole,

15
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
solely on feet, without skis.

16
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec,

17
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is this tough to do?"

18
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Imagine, if you will,

20
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,

21
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
with 170 pounds of gear,

22
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.

23
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's going to be 40 below, every single day.

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You'll be in a massive headwind.

25
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,

26
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
these crevasses.

27
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them

28
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that could give way at a moment's notice,

29
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.

30
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.

31
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Yes, it's uphill the entire way,

32
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,

33
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and you're starting at sea level.

34
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet,

35
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.

36
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It began a little less than two years ago.

37
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
A couple of buddies of mine and I

38
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.

39
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And while we were there we learned

40
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.

41
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa

42
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
affected young people the most.

43
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,

44
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,

45
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."

46
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be

47
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a reason for me to do them

48
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
beyond just getting there.

49
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Around that time I met an extraordinary human being,

50
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.

51
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.

52
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:

53
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
a run to the South Pole

54
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
where, with an interactive website,

55
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world

56
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
on board the expedition with me,

57
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
as active members.

58
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,

59
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we would be blogging, telling stories of,

60
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,

61
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
or we will burn.

62
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi --

63
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.

64
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,

65
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,

66
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because that's what it felt like.

67
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We were blogging to this live website daily

68
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to these students that were tracking us as well,

69
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
about 10-hour trekking days,

70
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
15-hour trekking days,

71
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.

72
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.

73
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
In turn, students,

74
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
people from around the world, would ask us questions.

75
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Young people would ask the most amazing questions.

76
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
One of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom,

77
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
where are you going to go and how are you going to do it?

78
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions.

79
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Where do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground,

80
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.

81
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition:

82
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
butter and bacon. It's about a million calories.

83
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We were burning about 8,500 a day,

84
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so we needed it.

85
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have?

86
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Virtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,

87
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
was charged by the sun.

88
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And do you get along? I certainly hope so,

89
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because at some point or another on this expedition,

90
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,

91
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.

92
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But seriously, seriously, we did get along,

93
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.

94
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They were our teammates! They were inspiring us.

95
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.

96
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.

97
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,

98
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
dragging sleds across the school-yard,

99
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.

100
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent,

101
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
45 below that day, I'll never forget it.

102
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We looked at each other with these looks

103
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of disbelief at what we had just completed.

104
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I remember looking at the guys thinking,

105
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.

106
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
That I'm this uber-endurance guy?

107
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
As I stand here today talking to you guys,

108
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I've been running for the grand sum of five years.

109
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,

110
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
living a very sedentary lifestyle.

111
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
What I take from this journey, from my journeys,

112
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is that, in fact,

113
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
within every fiber of my belief standing here,

114
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I know that we can make the impossible possible.

115
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'm learning this at 40.

116
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Can you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?

117
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'm learning this at 40 years of age.

118
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Imagine being 13 years old,

119
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
hearing those words, and believing it.

120
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

121
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Applause)

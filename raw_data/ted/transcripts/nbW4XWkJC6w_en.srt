0:00:13.542,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Plastics: you know about them, you may not love them,

3
0:00:17.375,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but chances are you use them every single day.

4
0:00:22.167,000 --> 0:00:24,000
By 2050, researchers estimate

5
0:00:24.917,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

6
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Despite our best efforts,

7
0:00:30.917,000 --> 0:00:35,000
only nine percent of all plastic we use winds up being recycled.

8
0:00:37.417,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And even worse,

9
0:00:38.958,000 --> 0:00:4,000
plastic is incredibly tough and durable

10
0:00:41.875,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and researchers estimate

11
0:00:43.417,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that it can take anywhere from 500 to 5,000 years

12
0:00:47.542,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to fully break down.

13
0:00:49.75,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It leaches harmful chemical contaminants into our oceans, our soil,

14
0:00:55.292,000 --> 0:00:59,000
our food, our water, and into us.

15
0:01:00.958,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So how did we wind up with so much plastic waste?

16
0:01:04.625,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Well, it's simple.

17
0:01:06.667,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Plastic is cheap, durable, adaptable, and it's everywhere.

18
0:01:12.833,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But the good news is

19
0:01:14.208,000 --> 0:01:18,000
there's something else that's cheap, durable, adaptable and everywhere.

20
0:01:18.833,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And my research shows it may even be able to help us

21
0:01:22.208,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with our plastic pollution problem.

22
0:01:25.417,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I'm talking about bacteria.

23
0:01:28.75,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Bacteria are microscopic living beings invisible to the naked eye

24
0:01:33.667,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that live everywhere,

25
0:01:35.375,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in all sorts of diverse and extreme environments,

26
0:01:38.625,000 --> 0:01:41,000
from the human gut, to soil, to skin,

27
0:01:42.25,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to vents in the ocean floor, reaching temperatures of 700 degrees Fahrenheit.

28
0:01:46.792,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Bacteria live everywhere,

29
0:01:49.083,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in all sorts of diverse and extreme environments.

30
0:01:52.292,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And as such, they have to get pretty creative with their food sources.

31
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
There's also a lot of them.

32
0:02:00.125,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Researchers estimate that there are roughly five million trillion trillion --

33
0:02:05.208,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that's a five with 30 zeros after it -- bacteria on the planet.

34
0:02:11.625,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now, considering that we humans produce

35
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
300 million tons of new plastic each year,

36
0:02:19.417,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I'd say that our plastic numbers

37
0:02:21.958,000 --> 0:02:23,000
are looking pretty comparable to bacteria's.

38
0:02:25.833,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So, after noticing this

39
0:02:28.333,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and after learning about all of the creative ways

40
0:02:30.667,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that bacteria find food,

41
0:02:32.708,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I started to think:

42
0:02:34.917,000 --> 0:02:36,000
could bacteria in plastic-polluted environments

43
0:02:37.833,000 --> 0:02:4,000
have figured out how to use plastic for food?

44
0:02:42.375,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Well, this is the question that I decided to pursue a couple of years ago.

45
0:02:47.333,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now, fortunately for me,

46
0:02:49.375,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I'm from one of the most polluted cities in America,

47
0:02:52.542,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Houston, Texas.

48
0:02:54.417,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughs)

49
0:02:55.625,000 --> 0:02:56,000
In my hometown alone,

50
0:02:56.917,000 --> 0:02:59,000
there are seven EPA-designated Superfund sites.

51
0:03:02.208,000 --> 0:03:04,000
These are sites that are so polluted,

52
0:03:04.792,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that the government has deemed their cleanup a national priority.

53
0:03:10.25,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So I decided to trek around to these sites

54
0:03:13.333,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and collect soil samples teeming with bacteria.

55
0:03:16.708,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I started toying with a protocol,

56
0:03:19.042,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is fancy science talk for a recipe.

57
0:03:22.125,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And what I was trying to cook up was a carbon-free media,

58
0:03:26.333,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or a food-free environment.

59
0:03:29.125,000 --> 0:03:31,000
An environment without the usual carbons, or food,

60
0:03:31.958,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that bacteria, like us humans, need to live.

61
0:03:36.083,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, in this environment,

62
0:03:37.375,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I would provide my bacteria with a sole carbon, or food, source.

63
0:03:42.042,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I would feed my bacteria polyethylene terephthalate,

64
0:03:46.417,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or PET plastic.

65
0:03:49.917,000 --> 0:03:54,000
PET plastic is the most widely produced plastic in the world.

66
0:03:54.958,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's used in all sorts of food and drink containers,

67
0:03:58.042,000 --> 0:04:01,000
with the most notorious example being plastic water bottles,

68
0:04:02.042,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of which we humans currently go through at a rate of one million per minute.

69
0:04:10.042,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So, what I would be doing,

70
0:04:12.292,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is essentially putting my bacteria on a forced diet of PET plastic

71
0:04:17.208,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and seeing which, if any, might survive or, hopefully, thrive.

72
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
See, this type of experiment would act as a screen

73
0:04:25.542,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for bacteria that had adapted to their plastic-polluted environment

74
0:04:29.541,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and evolved the incredibly cool ability to eat PET plastic.

75
0:04:35.167,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And using this screen,

76
0:04:36.833,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I was able to find some bacteria that had done just that.

77
0:04:41.375,000 --> 0:04:45,000
These bacteria had figured out how to eat PET plastic.

78
0:04:48.583,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So how do these bacteria do this?

79
0:04:51.583,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Well, it's actually pretty simple.

80
0:04:54.375,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Just as we humans digest carbon or food into chunks of sugar

81
0:04:58.458,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that we then use for energy,

82
0:05:00.333,000 --> 0:05:01,000
so too do my bacteria.

83
0:05:03.375,000 --> 0:05:07,000
My bacteria, however, have figured out how to do this digestion process

84
0:05:07.75,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to big, tough, durable PET plastic.

85
0:05:12.292,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, to do this, my bacteria use a special version

86
0:05:15.083,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of what's called an enzyme.

87
0:05:17.167,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Now, enzymes are simply compounds that exist in all living things.

88
0:05:21.5,000 --> 0:05:23,000
There are many different types of enzymes,

89
0:05:23.542,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but basically, they make processes go forward,

90
0:05:26.708,000 --> 0:05:28,000
such as the digestion of food into energy.

91
0:05:30.417,000 --> 0:05:33,000
For instance, we humans have an enzyme called an amylase

92
0:05:33.875,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that helps us digest complex starches, such as bread,

93
0:05:37.542,000 --> 0:05:4,000
into small chunks of sugar that we can then use for energy.

94
0:05:42.042,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now, my bacteria have a special enzyme called a lipase

95
0:05:45.958,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that binds to big, tough, durable PET plastic

96
0:05:49.667,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and helps break it into small chunks of sugar

97
0:05:52.375,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that my bacteria can then use for energy.

98
0:05:56.25,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So basically,

99
0:05:57.542,000 --> 0:06:01,000
PET plastic goes from being a big, tough, long-lasting pollutant

100
0:06:02.208,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to a tasty meal for my bacteria.

101
0:06:06.958,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Sounds pretty cool, right?

102
0:06:10.458,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And I think, given the current scope of our plastic pollution problem,

103
0:06:15.083,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I think it sounds pretty useful.

104
0:06:18.25,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The statistics I shared with you

105
0:06:20.042,000 --> 0:06:24,000
on just how much plastic waste has accumulated on our planet

106
0:06:24.417,000 --> 0:06:25,000
are daunting.

107
0:06:25.958,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They're scary.

108
0:06:27.667,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I think they highlight

109
0:06:29.167,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that while reducing, reusing and recycling are important,

110
0:06:33.5,000 --> 0:06:36,000
they alone are not going to be enough to solve this problem.

111
0:06:38.417,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And this is where I think bacteria might be able to help us out.

112
0:06:43.75,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But I do understand why the concept of bacterial help

113
0:06:47.542,000 --> 0:06:49,000
might make some people a little nervous.

114
0:06:50.5,000 --> 0:06:55,000
After all, if plastic is everywhere and these bacteria eat plastic,

115
0:06:56.083,000 --> 0:06:59,000
isn't there a risk of these bacteria getting out in the environment

116
0:06:59.292,000 --> 0:07:,000
and wreaking havoc?

117
0:07:02.292,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Well, the short answer is no, and I'll tell you why.

118
0:07:06.167,000 --> 0:07:09,000
These bacteria are already in the environment.

119
0:07:10.375,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The bacteria in my research are not genetically modified frankenbugs.

120
0:07:16.25,000 --> 0:07:18,000
These are naturally occurring bacteria

121
0:07:18.583,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that have simply adapted to their plastic-polluted environment

122
0:07:22.375,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and evolved the incredibly gnarly ability to eat PET plastic.

123
0:07:28.167,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So the process of bacteria eating plastic is actually a natural one.

124
0:07:33.625,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But it's an incredibly slow process.

125
0:07:36.458,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And there remains a lot of work to be done

126
0:07:38.958,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to figure out how to speed up this process to a useful pace.

127
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
My research is currently looking at ways of doing this

128
0:07:46.75,000 --> 0:07:5,000
through a series of UV, or ultraviolet, pretreatments,

129
0:07:50.875,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which basically means we blast PET plastic with sunlight.

130
0:07:56.292,000 --> 0:08:,000
We do this because sunlight acts a bit like tenderizer on a steak,

131
0:08:00.917,000 --> 0:08:03,000
turning the big, tough, durable bonds in PET plastic

132
0:08:04.917,000 --> 0:08:07,000
a bit softer and a bit easier for my bacteria to chew on.

133
0:08:10.208,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Ultimately, what my research hopes to do

134
0:08:12.708,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is create an industrial-scale contained carbon-free system,

135
0:08:17.333,000 --> 0:08:19,000
similar to a compost heap,

136
0:08:19.583,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where these bacteria can thrive in a contained system,

137
0:08:23.208,000 --> 0:08:27,000
where their sole food source is PET plastic waste.

138
0:08:28.458,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Imagine one day being able to dispose of all of your plastic waste

139
0:08:33.167,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in a bin at the curb

140
0:08:34.625,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that you knew was bound for a dedicated bacteria-powered plastic waste facility.

141
0:08:41.542,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I think with some hard work this is an achievable reality.

142
0:08:47.25,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Plastic-eating bacteria is not a cure-all.

143
0:08:50.667,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But given the current statistics, it's clear that we humans,

144
0:08:54.957,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we could use a little help with this problem.

145
0:08:58.292,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Because people,

146
0:08:59.583,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we possess a pressing problem of plastic pollution.

147
0:09:03.292,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And bacteria might be a really important part of the solution.

148
0:09:07.75,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Thank you.

149
0:09:09.042,000 --> 0:09:11,000

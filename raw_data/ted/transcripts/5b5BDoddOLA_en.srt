1
0:00:12.657,000 --> 0:00:14,000
(Video) Nicholas Negroponte: Can we switch to the video disc,

2
0:00:15.111,000 --> 0:00:17,000
which is in play mode?

3
0:00:17.234,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm really interested in how you put people and computers together.

4
0:00:22.464,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We will be using the TV screens or their equivalents

5
0:00:25.834,000 --> 0:00:29,000
for electronic books of the future.

6
0:00:30.208,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Music, crosstalk)

7
0:00:50.117,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Very interested in touch-sensitive displays,

8
0:00:52.369,000 --> 0:00:56,000
high-tech, high-touch, not having to pick up your fingers to use them.

9
0:00:56.696,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There is another way where computers

10
0:00:58.496,000 --> 0:01:,000
touch people: wearing, physically wearing.

11
0:01:08.646,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Suddenly on September 11th,

12
0:01:10.667,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the world got bigger.

13
0:01:13.304,000 --> 0:01:15,000
NN: Thank you. (Applause)

14
0:01:16.289,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Thank you.

15
0:01:18.348,000 --> 0:01:2,000
When I was asked to do this,

16
0:01:20.456,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was also asked to look at all 14 TED Talks

17
0:01:24.652,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that I had given,

18
0:01:26.362,000 --> 0:01:27,000
chronologically.

19
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The first one was actually two hours.

20
0:01:30.434,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The second one was an hour,

21
0:01:31.89,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and then they became half hours,

22
0:01:33.439,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and all I noticed was my bald spot getting bigger.

23
0:01:37.375,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:38.995,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Imagine seeing your life, 30 years of it, go by,

25
0:01:43.163,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and it was, to say the least,

26
0:01:46.57,000 --> 0:01:5,000
for me, quite a shocking experience.

27
0:01:50.943,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So what I'm going to do in my time

28
0:01:52.536,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is try and share with you what happened

29
0:01:54.08,000 --> 0:01:55,000
during the 30 years,

30
0:01:55.882,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and then also make a prediction,

31
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:02:,000
and then tell you a little bit

32
0:02:00.461,000 --> 0:02:02,000
about what I'm doing next.

33
0:02:03.115,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I put on a slide

34
0:02:06.066,000 --> 0:02:1,000
where TED 1 happened in my life.

35
0:02:10.126,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it's rather important

36
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because I had done 15 years of research before it,

37
0:02:16.1,000 --> 0:02:18,000
so I had a backlog, so it was easy.

38
0:02:18.528,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It's not that I was Fidel Castro

39
0:02:20.288,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I could talk for two hours,

40
0:02:22.121,000 --> 0:02:23,000
or Bucky Fuller.

41
0:02:23.443,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I had 15 years of stuff,

42
0:02:25.358,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the Media Lab was about to start.

43
0:02:27.83,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So that was easy.

44
0:02:29.63,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But there are a couple of things

45
0:02:32.294,000 --> 0:02:33,000
about that period

46
0:02:33.982,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and about what happened that are

47
0:02:36.035,000 --> 0:02:37,000
really quite important.

48
0:02:37.89,000 --> 0:02:39,000
One is that

49
0:02:40.446,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it was a period when computers

50
0:02:43.342,000 --> 0:02:45,000
weren't yet for people.

51
0:02:45.979,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And the other thing that sort of happened

52
0:02:49.124,000 --> 0:02:52,000
during that time is that

53
0:02:52.195,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we were considered sissy computer scientists.

54
0:02:55.577,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We weren't considered the real thing.

55
0:02:57.14,000 --> 0:03:,000
So what I'm going to show you is, in retrospect,

56
0:03:01.139,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a lot more interesting and a lot more accepted

57
0:03:03.647,000 --> 0:03:05,000
than it was at the time.

58
0:03:05.713,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So I'm going to characterize the years

59
0:03:08.267,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and I'm even going to go back

60
0:03:10.1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to some very early work of mine,

61
0:03:12.204,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and this was the kind of stuff I was doing in the '60s:

62
0:03:15.09,000 --> 0:03:17,000
very direct manipulation,

63
0:03:17.277,000 --> 0:03:19,000
very influenced as I studied architecture

64
0:03:19.932,000 --> 0:03:21,000
by the architect Moshe Safdie,

65
0:03:22.019,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and you can see that we even built robotic things

66
0:03:24.781,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that could build habitat-like structures.

67
0:03:27.537,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And this for me was

68
0:03:29.224,000 --> 0:03:3,000
not yet the Media Lab,

69
0:03:31.14,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but was the beginning of what I'll call

70
0:03:33.957,000 --> 0:03:34,000
sensory computing,

71
0:03:35.476,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and I pick fingers

72
0:03:37.348,000 --> 0:03:41,000
partly because everybody thought it was ridiculous.

73
0:03:41.55,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Papers were published

74
0:03:43.705,000 --> 0:03:47,000
about how stupid it was to use fingers.

75
0:03:47.957,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Three reasons: One was they were low-resolution.

76
0:03:50.775,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The other is your hand would occlude

77
0:03:52.704,000 --> 0:03:53,000
what you wanted to see,

78
0:03:54.145,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the third, which was the winner,

79
0:03:55.903,000 --> 0:03:58,000
was that your fingers would get the screen dirty,

80
0:03:59.559,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and hence, fingers would never be

81
0:04:01.885,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a device that you'd use.

82
0:04:03.673,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And this was a device we built in the '70s,

83
0:04:06.722,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which has never even been picked up.

84
0:04:08.593,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It's not just touch sensitive,

85
0:04:10.034,000 --> 0:04:12,000
it's pressure sensitive.

86
0:04:12.212,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Video) Voice: Put a yellow circle there.

87
0:04:14.189,000 --> 0:04:17,000
NN: Later work, and again this was before TED 1 —

88
0:04:17.633,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Video) Voice: Move that west of the diamond.

89
0:04:20.436,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Create a large green circle there.

90
0:04:23.648,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Man: Aw, shit.

91
0:04:25.977,000 --> 0:04:28,000
NN: — was to sort of do interface concurrently,

92
0:04:29.407,000 --> 0:04:3,000
so when you talked and you pointed

93
0:04:31.215,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and you had, if you will,

94
0:04:34.402,000 --> 0:04:35,000
multiple channels.

95
0:04:35.961,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Entebbe happened.

96
0:04:37.968,000 --> 0:04:4,000
1976, Air France was hijacked,

97
0:04:41.515,000 --> 0:04:42,000
taken to Entebbe,

98
0:04:43.013,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the Israelis not only did an extraordinary rescue,

99
0:04:48.07,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they did it partly because they had practiced

100
0:04:50.033,000 --> 0:04:52,000
on a physical model of the airport,

101
0:04:52.528,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because they had built the airport,

102
0:04:53.684,000 --> 0:04:54,000
so they built a model in the desert,

103
0:04:55.417,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and when they arrived at Entebbe,

104
0:04:57.133,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they knew where to go because they had actually been there.

105
0:05:00.053,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The U.S. government asked some of us, '76,

106
0:05:03.305,000 --> 0:05:05,000
if we could replicate that computationally,

107
0:05:06.08,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and of course somebody like myself says yes.

108
0:05:08.269,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Immediately, you get a contract,

109
0:05:10.295,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Department of Defense,

110
0:05:11.78,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and we built this truck and this rig.

111
0:05:14.468,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We did sort of a simulation,

112
0:05:16.988,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because you had video discs,

113
0:05:18.814,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and again, this is '76.

114
0:05:21.142,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And then many years later,

115
0:05:23.839,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you get this truck,

116
0:05:25.308,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and so you have Google Maps.

117
0:05:28.266,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Still people thought,

118
0:05:29.786,000 --> 0:05:33,000
no, that was not serious computer science,

119
0:05:33.806,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and it was a man named Jerry Wiesner,

120
0:05:35.865,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who happened to be the president of MIT,

121
0:05:38.272,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who did think it was computer science.

122
0:05:40.62,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And one of the keys for anybody

123
0:05:43.257,000 --> 0:05:46,000
who wants to start something in life:

124
0:05:46.641,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Make sure your president is part of it.

125
0:05:49.91,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So when I was doing the Media Lab,

126
0:05:52.93,000 --> 0:05:55,000
it was like having a gorilla in the front seat.

127
0:05:56.087,000 --> 0:05:58,000
If you were stopped for speeding

128
0:05:58.272,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the officer looked in the window

129
0:06:00.512,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and saw who was in the passenger seat,

130
0:06:02.521,000 --> 0:06:03,000
then, "Oh, continue on, sir."

131
0:06:04.483,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And so we were able,

132
0:06:06.168,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and this is a cute, actually, device, parenthetically.

133
0:06:09.961,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This was a lenticular photograph of Jerry Wiesner

134
0:06:13.01,000 --> 0:06:15,000
where the only thing that changed in the photograph

135
0:06:15.373,000 --> 0:06:16,000
were the lips.

136
0:06:16.716,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So when you oscillated that little piece

137
0:06:19.692,000 --> 0:06:22,000
of lenticular sheet with his photograph,

138
0:06:22.922,000 --> 0:06:24,000
it would be in lip sync

139
0:06:24.935,000 --> 0:06:26,000
with zero bandwidth.

140
0:06:27.174,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It was a zero-bandwidth teleconferencing system

141
0:06:29.885,000 --> 0:06:3,000
at the time.

142
0:06:31.727,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So this was the Media Lab's —

143
0:06:35.708,000 --> 0:06:36,000
this is what we said we'd do,

144
0:06:37.401,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that the world of computers, publishing,

145
0:06:39.976,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and so on would come together.

146
0:06:42.664,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Again, not generally accepted,

147
0:06:44.768,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but very much part of TED in the early days.

148
0:06:49.74,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And this is really where we were headed.

149
0:06:52.946,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And that created the Media Lab.

150
0:06:54.633,000 --> 0:06:58,000
One of the things about age

151
0:06:58.884,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is that I can tell you with great confidence,

152
0:07:03.151,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I've been to the future.

153
0:07:05.615,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I've been there, actually, many times.

154
0:07:08.899,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And the reason I say that is,

155
0:07:10.407,000 --> 0:07:12,000
how many times in my life have I said,

156
0:07:12.848,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"Oh, in 10 years, this will happen,"

157
0:07:14.625,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and then 10 years comes.

158
0:07:16.673,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And then you say, "Oh, in five years, this will happen."

159
0:07:18.431,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And then five years comes.

160
0:07:20.115,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So I say this a little bit with having felt

161
0:07:23.873,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that I'd been there a number of times,

162
0:07:26.21,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and one of the things that is most quoted

163
0:07:29.85,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that I've ever said

164
0:07:30.999,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is that computing is not about computers,

165
0:07:33.382,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and that didn't quite get enough traction,

166
0:07:36.938,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and then it started to.

167
0:07:38.457,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It started to because people caught on

168
0:07:42.152,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that the medium wasn't the message.

169
0:07:45.29,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And the reason I show this car

170
0:07:47.935,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in actually a rather ugly slide

171
0:07:50.263,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is just again to tell you the kind of story

172
0:07:52.767,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that characterized a little bit of my life.

173
0:07:55.595,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This is a student of mine

174
0:07:57.609,000 --> 0:08:,000
who had done a Ph.D. called "Backseat Driver."

175
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It was in the early days of GPS,

176
0:08:03.242,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the car knew where it was,

177
0:08:04.808,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and it would give audio instructions

178
0:08:06.723,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to the driver, when to turn right, when to turn left and so on.

179
0:08:10.15,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Turns out, there are a lot of things

180
0:08:11.761,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in those instructions that back in that period

181
0:08:14.796,000 --> 0:08:15,000
were pretty challenging,

182
0:08:16.046,000 --> 0:08:19,000
like what does it mean, take the next right?

183
0:08:19.274,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Well, if you're coming up on a street,

184
0:08:21.174,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the next right's probably the one after,

185
0:08:23.357,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and there are lots of issues,

186
0:08:24.588,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and the student did a wonderful thesis,

187
0:08:26.833,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the MIT patent office said "Don't patent it.

188
0:08:31.68,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It'll never be accepted.

189
0:08:33.62,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The liabilities are too large.

190
0:08:35.93,000 --> 0:08:36,000
There will be insurance issues.

191
0:08:37.321,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Don't patent it."

192
0:08:38.965,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So we didn't,

193
0:08:40.058,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but it shows you how people, again, at times,

194
0:08:43.696,000 --> 0:08:47,000
don't really look at what's happening.

195
0:08:47.895,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Some work, and I'll just go through these very quickly,

196
0:08:50.79,000 --> 0:08:51,000
a lot of sensory stuff.

197
0:08:52.395,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You might recognize a young Yo-Yo Ma

198
0:08:54.87,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and tracking his body for playing

199
0:08:58.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
the cello or the hypercello.

200
0:09:01.188,000 --> 0:09:04,000
These fellows literally walked around like that at the time.

201
0:09:05.165,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It's now a little bit more discreet

202
0:09:07.8,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and more commonplace.

203
0:09:09.841,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And then there are at least three heroes

204
0:09:12.11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I want to quickly mention.

205
0:09:13.239,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Marvin Minsky, who taught me a lot

206
0:09:15.717,000 --> 0:09:16,000
about common sense,

207
0:09:17.104,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and I will talk briefly about Muriel Cooper,

208
0:09:20.545,000 --> 0:09:22,000
who was very important to Ricky Wurman

209
0:09:23.163,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and to TED, and in fact, when she got onstage,

210
0:09:26.898,000 --> 0:09:27,000
she said, the first thing she said was,

211
0:09:28.845,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"I introduced Ricky to Nicky."

212
0:09:30.999,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And nobody calls me Nicky

213
0:09:32.699,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and nobody calls Richard Ricky,

214
0:09:34.458,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so nobody knew who she was talking about.

215
0:09:37.86,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And then, of course, Seymour Papert,

216
0:09:40.257,000 --> 0:09:41,000
who is the person who said,

217
0:09:41.762,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"You can't think about thinking

218
0:09:43.177,000 --> 0:09:45,000
unless you think about thinking about something."

219
0:09:45.592,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And that's actually — you can unpack that later.

220
0:09:51.255,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It's a pretty profound statement.

221
0:09:55.361,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I'm showing some slides

222
0:09:57.101,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that were from TED 2,

223
0:09:59.187,000 --> 0:10:02,000
a little silly as slides, perhaps.

224
0:10:02.929,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Then I felt television really was about displays.

225
0:10:08.273,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Again, now we're past TED 1,

226
0:10:11.336,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but just around the time of TED 2,

227
0:10:14.362,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and what I'd like to mention here is,

228
0:10:16.511,000 --> 0:10:18,000
even though you could imagine

229
0:10:18.626,000 --> 0:10:2,000
intelligence in the device,

230
0:10:20.68,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I look today at some of the work

231
0:10:22.112,000 --> 0:10:24,000
being done about the Internet of Things,

232
0:10:24.55,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and I think it's kind of tragically pathetic,

233
0:10:27.49,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because what has happened is people take

234
0:10:29.92,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the oven panel and put it on your cell phone,

235
0:10:33.418,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or the door key onto your cell phone,

236
0:10:35.207,000 --> 0:10:37,000
just taking it and bringing it to you,

237
0:10:37.38,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and in fact that's actually what you don't want.

238
0:10:40.101,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You want to put a chicken in the oven,

239
0:10:42.159,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and the oven says, "Aha, it's a chicken,"

240
0:10:44.487,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and it cooks the chicken.

241
0:10:45.636,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Oh, it's cooking the chicken for Nicholas,

242
0:10:47.402,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and he likes it this way and that way."

243
0:10:49.236,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So the intelligence, instead of being in the device,

244
0:10:52.289,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we have started today

245
0:10:53.998,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to move it back onto the cell phone

246
0:10:56.11,000 --> 0:10:58,000
or closer to the user,

247
0:10:58.48,000 --> 0:11:,000
not a particularly enlightened view

248
0:11:00.668,000 --> 0:11:02,000
of the Internet of Things.

249
0:11:03.409,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Television, again, television what I said today,

250
0:11:06.873,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that was back in 1990,

251
0:11:09.495,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and the television of tomorrow

252
0:11:10.965,000 --> 0:11:12,000
would look something like that.

253
0:11:13.288,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Again, people, but they laughed cynically,

254
0:11:16.832,000 --> 0:11:21,000
they didn't laugh with much appreciation.

255
0:11:22.083,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Telecommunications in the 1990s,

256
0:11:24.733,000 --> 0:11:29,000
George Gilder decided that he would call this diagram

257
0:11:30.433,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the Negroponte switch.

258
0:11:32.862,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I'm probably much less famous than George,

259
0:11:34.868,000 --> 0:11:37,000
so when he called it the Negroponte switch, it stuck,

260
0:11:38.475,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but the idea of things that came in the ground

261
0:11:41.14,000 --> 0:11:42,000
would go in the air and stuff in the air

262
0:11:42.855,000 --> 0:11:43,000
would go into the ground

263
0:11:44.314,000 --> 0:11:45,000
has played itself out.

264
0:11:46.199,000 --> 0:11:5,000
That is the original slide from that year,

265
0:11:50.944,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and it has worked in lockstep obedience.

266
0:11:54.319,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We started Wired magazine.

267
0:11:56.486,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Some people, I remember we shared

268
0:12:00.222,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the reception desk periodically,

269
0:12:02.944,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and some parent called up irate that his son

270
0:12:07.002,000 --> 0:12:09,000
had given up Sports Illustrated

271
0:12:09.231,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to subscribe for Wired,

272
0:12:11.11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and he said, "Are you some porno magazine or something?"

273
0:12:14.307,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and couldn't understand why his son

274
0:12:16.891,000 --> 0:12:19,000
would be interested in Wired, at any rate.

275
0:12:20.79,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I will go through this a little quicker.

276
0:12:23.394,000 --> 0:12:26,000
This is my favorite, 1995,

277
0:12:26.893,000 --> 0:12:29,000
back page of Newsweek magazine.

278
0:12:29.93,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Okay. Read it. (Laughter)

279
0:12:31.899,000 --> 0:12:32,000
["Nicholas Negroponte, director of the MIT Media Lab, predicts that we'll soon buy books and newspapers straight over the Internet. Uh, sure." —Clifford Stoll, Newsweek, 1995]

280
0:12:33.8,000 --> 0:12:34,000
You must admit that gives you,

281
0:12:35.445,000 --> 0:12:37,000
at least it gives me pleasure

282
0:12:37.672,000 --> 0:12:4,000
when somebody says how dead wrong you are.

283
0:12:41.43,000 --> 0:12:43,000
"Being Digital" came out.

284
0:12:43.576,000 --> 0:12:45,000
For me, it gave me an opportunity

285
0:12:46.217,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to be more in the trade press

286
0:12:48.419,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and get this out to the public,

287
0:12:51.69,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and it also allowed us to build the new Media Lab,

288
0:12:54.705,000 --> 0:12:55,000
which if you haven't been to, visit,

289
0:12:56.638,000 --> 0:12:59,000
because it's a beautiful piece of architecture

290
0:12:59.657,000 --> 0:13:01,000
aside from being a wonderful place to work.

291
0:13:02.482,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So these are the things we were saying in those TEDs.

292
0:13:05.177,000 --> 0:13:06,000
[Today, multimedia is a desktop or living room experience, because the apparatus is so clunky. This will change dramatically with small, bright, thin, high-resolution displays. — 1995]

293
0:13:06.744,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We came to them.

294
0:13:08.236,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I looked forward to it every year.

295
0:13:10.228,000 --> 0:13:13,000
It was the party that Ricky Wurman never had

296
0:13:13.28,000 --> 0:13:15,000
in the sense that he invited many of his old friends,

297
0:13:16.189,000 --> 0:13:17,000
including myself.

298
0:13:17.848,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And then something for me changed

299
0:13:20.24,000 --> 0:13:21,000
pretty profoundly.

300
0:13:21.709,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I became more involved with computers and learning

301
0:13:25.662,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and influenced by Seymour,

302
0:13:28.124,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but particularly looking at learning

303
0:13:30.739,000 --> 0:13:33,000
as something that is best approximated

304
0:13:34.649,000 --> 0:13:35,000
by computer programming.

305
0:13:36.403,000 --> 0:13:38,000
When you write a computer program,

306
0:13:38.417,000 --> 0:13:4,000
you've got to not just list things out

307
0:13:41.212,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and sort of take an algorithm

308
0:13:42.94,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and translate it into a set of instructions,

309
0:13:45.816,000 --> 0:13:47,000
but when there's a bug, and all programs have bugs,

310
0:13:48.499,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you've got to de-bug it.

311
0:13:50.208,000 --> 0:13:51,000
You've got to go in, change it,

312
0:13:52.198,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and then re-execute,

313
0:13:53.82,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and you iterate,

314
0:13:55.624,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and that iteration is really

315
0:13:58.531,000 --> 0:14:,000
a very, very good approximation of learning.

316
0:14:01.434,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So that led to my own work with Seymour

317
0:14:05.101,000 --> 0:14:07,000
in places like Cambodia

318
0:14:07.459,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and the starting of One Laptop per Child.

319
0:14:10.363,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Enough TED Talks on One Laptop per Child,

320
0:14:13.177,000 --> 0:14:14,000
so I'll go through it very fast,

321
0:14:14.938,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but it did give us the chance

322
0:14:18.863,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to do something at a relatively large scale

323
0:14:22.369,000 --> 0:14:25,000
in the area of learning, development and computing.

324
0:14:26.362,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Very few people know that One Laptop per Child

325
0:14:29.179,000 --> 0:14:31,000
was a $1 billion project,

326
0:14:31.814,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and it was, at least over the seven years I ran it,

327
0:14:34.461,000 --> 0:14:36,000
but even more important, the World Bank

328
0:14:36.607,000 --> 0:14:39,000
contributed zero, USAID zero.

329
0:14:39.722,000 --> 0:14:43,000
It was mostly the countries using their own treasuries,

330
0:14:43.877,000 --> 0:14:44,000
which is very interesting,

331
0:14:45.48,000 --> 0:14:46,000
at least to me it was very interesting

332
0:14:46.836,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in terms of what I plan to do next.

333
0:14:49.98,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So these are the various places it happened.

334
0:14:53.005,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I then tried an experiment,

335
0:14:55.907,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and the experiment happened in Ethiopia.

336
0:15:00.188,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And here's the experiment.

337
0:15:02.83,000 --> 0:15:03,000
The experiment is,

338
0:15:04.461,000 --> 0:15:07,000
can learning happen where there are no schools.

339
0:15:08.241,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And we dropped off tablets

340
0:15:10.771,000 --> 0:15:12,000
with no instructions

341
0:15:13.014,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and let the children figure it out.

342
0:15:16.287,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And in a short period of time,

343
0:15:19.934,000 --> 0:15:21,000
they not only

344
0:15:22.032,000 --> 0:15:25,000
turned them on and were using 50 apps per child

345
0:15:25.104,000 --> 0:15:27,000
within five days,

346
0:15:27.206,000 --> 0:15:29,000
they were singing "ABC" songs within two weeks,

347
0:15:30.14,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but they hacked Android within six months.

348
0:15:34.033,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And so that seemed sufficiently interesting.

349
0:15:37.551,000 --> 0:15:39,000
This is perhaps the best picture I have.

350
0:15:40.11,000 --> 0:15:44,000
The kid on your right

351
0:15:44.261,000 --> 0:15:46,000
has sort of nominated himself as teacher.

352
0:15:46.736,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Look at the kid on the left, and so on.

353
0:15:49.256,000 --> 0:15:52,000
There are no adults involved in this at all.

354
0:15:52.406,000 --> 0:15:53,000
So I said, well can we do this

355
0:15:53.83,000 --> 0:15:54,000
at a larger scale?

356
0:15:55.427,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And what is it that's missing?

357
0:15:57.908,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The kids are giving a press conference at this point,

358
0:16:00.177,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and sort of writing in the dirt.

359
0:16:02.862,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And the answer is, what is missing?

360
0:16:06.307,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And I'm going to skip over my prediction, actually,

361
0:16:08.843,000 --> 0:16:09,000
because I'm running out of time,

362
0:16:10.371,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and here's the question, is what's going to happen?

363
0:16:14.339,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I think the challenge

364
0:16:15.826,000 --> 0:16:17,000
is to connect the last billion people,

365
0:16:18.454,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and connecting the last billion

366
0:16:21.105,000 --> 0:16:24,000
is very different than connecting the next billion,

367
0:16:24.502,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and the reason it's different

368
0:16:25.896,000 --> 0:16:26,000
is that the next billion

369
0:16:27.76,000 --> 0:16:28,000
are sort of low-hanging fruit,

370
0:16:29.71,000 --> 0:16:32,000
but the last billion are rural.

371
0:16:33.077,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Being rural and being poor

372
0:16:36.829,000 --> 0:16:37,000
are very different.

373
0:16:37.961,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Poverty tends to be created by our society,

374
0:16:41.594,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and the people in that community are not poor

375
0:16:47.044,000 --> 0:16:48,000
in the same way at all.

376
0:16:48.953,000 --> 0:16:49,000
They may be primitive,

377
0:16:50.358,000 --> 0:16:54,000
but the way to approach it and to connect them,

378
0:16:54.402,000 --> 0:16:56,000
the history of One Laptop per Child,

379
0:16:56.933,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and the experiment in Ethiopia,

380
0:17:00.589,000 --> 0:17:03,000
lead me to believe that we can in fact

381
0:17:03.864,000 --> 0:17:05,000
do this in a very short period of time.

382
0:17:06.665,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And so my plan,

383
0:17:08.506,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and unfortunately I haven't been able

384
0:17:10.74,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to get my partners at this point

385
0:17:13.608,000 --> 0:17:14,000
to let me announce them,

386
0:17:14.899,000 --> 0:17:18,000
but is to do this with a stationary satellite.

387
0:17:19.806,000 --> 0:17:21,000
There are many reasons

388
0:17:22.265,000 --> 0:17:26,000
that stationary satellites aren't the best things,

389
0:17:26.78,000 --> 0:17:28,000
but there are a lot of reasons why they are,

390
0:17:29.717,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and for two billion dollars,

391
0:17:32.812,000 --> 0:17:35,000
you can connect a lot more than 100 million people,

392
0:17:36.496,000 --> 0:17:38,000
but the reason I picked two,

393
0:17:39.157,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and I will leave this as my last slide,

394
0:17:42.54,000 --> 0:17:43,000
is two billion dollars

395
0:17:44.324,000 --> 0:17:46,000
is what we were spending

396
0:17:47.243,000 --> 0:17:49,000
in Afghanistan

397
0:17:49.336,000 --> 0:17:5,000
every week.

398
0:17:51.248,000 --> 0:17:54,000
So surely if we can connect

399
0:17:54.555,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Africa and the last billion people

400
0:17:57.255,000 --> 0:17:58,000
for numbers like that,

401
0:17:58.809,000 --> 0:17:59,000
we should be doing it.

402
0:18:00.122,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Thank you very much.

403
0:18:02.419,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Applause)

404
0:18:05.948,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Chris Anderson: Stay up there. Stay up there.

405
0:18:10.278,000 --> 0:18:12,000
NN: You're going to give me extra time?

406
0:18:12.308,000 --> 0:18:14,000
CA: No. That was wickedly clever, wickedly clever.

407
0:18:14.67,000 --> 0:18:15,000
You gamed it beautifully.

408
0:18:16.535,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Nicholas, what is your prediction?

409
0:18:19.165,000 --> 0:18:21,000
(Laughter)

410
0:18:21.191,000 --> 0:18:23,000
NN: Thank you for asking.

411
0:18:23.627,000 --> 0:18:25,000
I'll tell you what my prediction is,

412
0:18:26.4,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and my prediction, and this is a prediction,

413
0:18:29.1,000 --> 0:18:31,000
because it'll be 30 years. I won't be here.

414
0:18:31.762,000 --> 0:18:35,000
But one of the things about learning how to read,

415
0:18:36.49,000 --> 0:18:38,000
we have been doing a lot of consuming

416
0:18:39.339,000 --> 0:18:41,000
of information going through our eyes,

417
0:18:41.624,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and so that may be a very inefficient channel.

418
0:18:44.7,000 --> 0:18:49,000
So my prediction is that we are going to ingest information

419
0:18:49.785,000 --> 0:18:52,000
You're going to swallow a pill and know English.

420
0:18:52.982,000 --> 0:18:54,000
You're going to swallow a pill and know Shakespeare.

421
0:18:55.674,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And the way to do it is through the bloodstream.

422
0:18:58.283,000 --> 0:18:59,000
So once it's in your bloodstream,

423
0:19:00.14,000 --> 0:19:02,000
it basically goes through it and gets into the brain,

424
0:19:02.358,000 --> 0:19:04,000
and when it knows that it's in the brain

425
0:19:04.54,000 --> 0:19:05,000
in the different pieces,

426
0:19:05.862,000 --> 0:19:07,000
it deposits it in the right places.

427
0:19:08.487,000 --> 0:19:09,000
So it's ingesting.

428
0:19:09.819,000 --> 0:19:11,000
CA: Have you been hanging out with Ray Kurzweil by any chance?

429
0:19:12.339,000 --> 0:19:15,000
NN: No, but I've been hanging around with Ed Boyden

430
0:19:15.552,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and hanging around with one of the speakers

431
0:19:17.397,000 --> 0:19:18,000
who is here, Hugh Herr,

432
0:19:19.21,000 --> 0:19:2,000
and there are a number of people.

433
0:19:21.107,000 --> 0:19:22,000
This isn't quite as far-fetched,

434
0:19:22.504,000 --> 0:19:24,000
so 30 years from now.

435
0:19:25.449,000 --> 0:19:26,000
CA: We will check it out.

436
0:19:27.191,000 --> 0:19:29,000
We're going to be back and we're going to play this clip 30 years from now,

437
0:19:29.493,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and then all eat the red pill.

438
0:19:32.524,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Well thank you for that.

439
0:19:34.709,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Nicholas Negroponte.

440
0:19:36.153,000 --> 0:19:37,000
NN: Thank you.

441
0:19:37.501,000 --> 0:19:37,000
(Applause)

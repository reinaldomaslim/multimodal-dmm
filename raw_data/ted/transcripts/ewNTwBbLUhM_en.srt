1
0:00:17.331,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Do you hear that?

2
0:00:21.777,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Do you know what that is?

3
0:00:25.05,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Silence.

4
0:00:26.78,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The sound of silence.

5
0:00:29.448,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Simon and Garfunkel wrote a song about it.

6
0:00:32.166,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But silence is a pretty rare commodity these days,

7
0:00:35.335,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we're all paying a price for it in terms of our health --

8
0:00:39.142,000 --> 0:00:41,000
a surprisingly big price, as it turns out.

9
0:00:42.836,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Luckily, there are things we can do right now,

10
0:00:46.633,000 --> 0:00:48,000
both individually and as a society,

11
0:00:49.539,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to better protect our health

12
0:00:51.444,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and give us more of the benefits of the sounds of silence.

13
0:00:56.727,000 --> 0:01:,000
I assume that most of you know that too much noise is bad for your hearing.

14
0:01:00.759,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Whenever you leave a concert or a bar and you have that ringing in your ears,

15
0:01:04.651,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you can be certain that you have done some damage to your hearing,

16
0:01:07.916,000 --> 0:01:08,000
likely permanent.

17
0:01:09.632,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And that's very important.

18
0:01:11.801,000 --> 0:01:15,000
However, noise affects our health in many different ways beyond hearing.

19
0:01:17.096,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They're less well-known,

20
0:01:18.662,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but they're just as dangerous as the auditory effects.

21
0:01:23.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So what do we mean when we talk about noise?

22
0:01:26.287,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Well, noise is defined as unwanted sound,

23
0:01:29.404,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and as such, both has a physical component, the sound,

24
0:01:33.025,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and a psychological component,

25
0:01:35.038,000 --> 0:01:38,000
the circumstances that make the sound unwanted.

26
0:01:38.264,000 --> 0:01:4,000
A very good example is a rock concert.

27
0:01:40.955,000 --> 0:01:44,000
A person attending the rock concert, being exposed to 100 decibels,

28
0:01:45.334,000 --> 0:01:47,000
does not think of the music as noise.

29
0:01:48.043,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This person likes the band, and even paid a hundred dollars for the ticket,

30
0:01:52.009,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so no matter how loud the music, this person doesn't think of it as noise.

31
0:01:56.752,000 --> 0:02:,000
In contrast, think of a person living three blocks away from the concert hall.

32
0:02:01.902,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That person is trying to read a book,

33
0:02:04.129,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but cannot concentrate because of the music.

34
0:02:07.095,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And although the sound pressure levels are much lower in this situation,

35
0:02:10.833,000 --> 0:02:12,000
this person still thinks of the music as noise,

36
0:02:13.673,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and it may trigger reactions that can, in the long run, have health consequences.

37
0:02:21.405,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So why are quiet spaces so important?

38
0:02:24.656,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Because noise affects our health in so many ways beyond hearing.

39
0:02:29.051,000 --> 0:02:35,000
However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find quiet spaces

40
0:02:35.187,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in times of constantly increasing traffic,

41
0:02:38.848,000 --> 0:02:39,000
growing urbanization,

42
0:02:40.618,000 --> 0:02:42,000
construction sites, air-conditioning units,

43
0:02:43.187,000 --> 0:02:44,000
leaf blowers, lawnmowers,

44
0:02:45.179,000 --> 0:02:47,000
outdoor concerts and bars, personal music players,

45
0:02:48.202,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and your neighbors partying until 3am.

46
0:02:50.952,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Whew!

47
0:02:52.622,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated

48
0:02:56.463,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that 1.6 million healthy life years are lost every year

49
0:03:02.371,000 --> 0:03:04,000
due to exposure to environmental noise

50
0:03:04.944,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in the Western European member states alone.

51
0:03:09.086,000 --> 0:03:12,000
One important effect of noise is that it disturbs communication.

52
0:03:13.053,000 --> 0:03:15,000
You may have to raise your voice to be understood.

53
0:03:15.874,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In extreme cases, you may even have to pause the conversation.

54
0:03:19.756,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's also more likely to be misunderstood in a noisy environment.

55
0:03:23.657,000 --> 0:03:26,000
These are all likely reasons why studies have found

56
0:03:27.018,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that children who attend schools in noisy areas

57
0:03:30.52,000 --> 0:03:33,000
are more likely to lag behind their peers in academic performance.

58
0:03:35.821,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Another very important health effect of noise

59
0:03:38.336,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is the increased risk for cardiovascular disease

60
0:03:41.349,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in those who are exposed to relevant noise levels

61
0:03:44.672,000 --> 0:03:46,000
for prolonged periods of time.

62
0:03:47.429,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Noise is stress,

63
0:03:48.885,000 --> 0:03:51,000
especially if we have little or no control over it.

64
0:03:51.98,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Our body excretes stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol

65
0:03:55.943,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that lead to changes in the composition of our blood

66
0:03:58.855,000 --> 0:04:,000
and in the structure of our blood vessels,

67
0:04:01.175,000 --> 0:04:05,000
which have been shown to be stiffer after a single night of noise exposure.

68
0:04:06.103,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Epidemiological studies show associations between the noise exposure

69
0:04:10.354,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and an increased risk for high blood pressure,

70
0:04:13.823,000 --> 0:04:15,000
heart attacks and stroke,

71
0:04:15.868,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and although the overall risk increases are relatively small,

72
0:04:19.499,000 --> 0:04:22,000
this still constitutes a major public health problem

73
0:04:22.913,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because noise is so ubiquitous,

74
0:04:25.201,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and so many people are exposed to relevant noise levels.

75
0:04:29.376,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A recent study found that US society

76
0:04:32.406,000 --> 0:04:36,000
could save 3.9 billion dollars each year

77
0:04:36.946,000 --> 0:04:39,000
by lowering environmental noise exposure by five decibels,

78
0:04:40.915,000 --> 0:04:43,000
just by saving costs for treating cardiovascular disease.

79
0:04:45.184,000 --> 0:04:48,000
There are other diseases like cancer, diabetes and obesity

80
0:04:48.761,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that have been linked to noise exposure,

81
0:04:51.116,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but we do not have enough evidence yet

82
0:04:53.307,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to, in fact, conclude that these diseases are caused by the noise.

83
0:04:59.062,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Yet another important effect of noise is sleep disturbance.

84
0:05:02.577,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Sleep is a very active mechanism that recuperates us

85
0:05:05.639,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and prepares us for the next wake period.

86
0:05:08.555,000 --> 0:05:12,000
A quiet bedroom is a cornerstone of what sleep researchers call

87
0:05:12.722,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"a good sleep hygiene."

88
0:05:14.968,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And our auditory system has a watchman function.

89
0:05:17.932,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's constantly monitoring our environment for threats,

90
0:05:21.146,000 --> 0:05:22,000
even while we're sleeping.

91
0:05:23.394,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So noise in the bedroom can cause a delay in the time it takes us to fall asleep,

92
0:05:28.732,000 --> 0:05:3,000
it can wake us up during the night,

93
0:05:31.178,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and it can prevent our blood pressure from going down during the night.

94
0:05:35.266,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We have the hypothesis that if these noise-induced sleep disturbances

95
0:05:38.679,000 --> 0:05:4,000
continue for months and years,

96
0:05:40.713,000 --> 0:05:44,000
then an increased risk for cardiovascular disease is likely the consequence.

97
0:05:46.107,000 --> 0:05:5,000
However, we are often not aware of these noise-induced sleep disturbances,

98
0:05:50.17,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because we are unconscious while we're sleeping.

99
0:05:53.137,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In the past, we've done studies on the effects of traffic noise on sleep,

100
0:05:57.04,000 --> 0:06:,000
and research subjects would often wake up in the morning and say,

101
0:06:00.163,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"Ah, I had a wonderful night, I fell asleep right away,

102
0:06:02.784,000 --> 0:06:03,000
never really woke up."

103
0:06:04.541,000 --> 0:06:06,000
When we would go back to the physiological signals

104
0:06:07.368,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we had recorded during the night,

105
0:06:09.314,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we would often see numerous awakenings

106
0:06:11.647,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and a severely fragmented sleep structure.

107
0:06:14.717,000 --> 0:06:19,000
These awakenings were too brief for the subjects to regain consciousness

108
0:06:20.254,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and to remember them during the next morning,

109
0:06:23.169,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but they may nevertheless have a profound impact

110
0:06:26.277,000 --> 0:06:28,000
on how restful our sleep is.

111
0:06:30.273,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So when is loud too loud?

112
0:06:32.9,000 --> 0:06:35,000
A good sign of too loud is once you start changing your behavior.

113
0:06:37.752,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You may have to raise your voice to be understood,

114
0:06:40.177,000 --> 0:06:42,000
or you increase the volume of your TV.

115
0:06:42.849,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You're avoiding outside areas, or you're closing your window.

116
0:06:46.356,000 --> 0:06:48,000
You're moving your bedroom to the basement of the house,

117
0:06:49.036,000 --> 0:06:51,000
or you even have sound insulation installed.

118
0:06:51.592,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Many people will move away to less noisy areas,

119
0:06:55.038,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but obviously not everybody can afford that.

120
0:06:59.508,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So what can we do right now to improve our sound environment

121
0:07:03.577,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and to better protect our health?

122
0:07:06.473,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Well, first of all, if something's too loud, speak up.

123
0:07:10.643,000 --> 0:07:12,000
For example, many owners of movie theaters

124
0:07:13.336,000 --> 0:07:17,000
seem to think that only people hard of hearing are still going to the movies.

125
0:07:18.296,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you complain about the noise and nothing happens,

126
0:07:21.028,000 --> 0:07:23,000
demand a refund and leave.

127
0:07:23.138,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That's the language that managers typically do understand.

128
0:07:27.329,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Also, talk to your children about the health effects of noise

129
0:07:30.384,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and that listening to loud music today will have consequences when they're older.

130
0:07:35.461,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You can also move your bedroom to the quiet side of the house,

131
0:07:38.478,000 --> 0:07:41,000
where your own building shields you from road traffic noise.

132
0:07:42.15,000 --> 0:07:44,000
If you're looking to rent or buy a new place,

133
0:07:44.676,000 --> 0:07:45,000
make low noise a priority.

134
0:07:46.97,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Visit the property during different times of the day

135
0:07:49.872,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and talk to the neighbors about noise.

136
0:07:53.048,000 --> 0:07:57,000
You can wear noise-canceling headphones when you're traveling

137
0:07:57.144,000 --> 0:08:,000
or if your office has high background noise levels.

138
0:08:01.157,000 --> 0:08:03,000
In general, seek out quiet spaces,

139
0:08:03.713,000 --> 0:08:06,000
especially on the weekend or when you're on vacation.

140
0:08:07.257,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Allow your system to wind down.

141
0:08:10.503,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I, very appropriately for this talk,

142
0:08:12.894,000 --> 0:08:15,000
attended a noise conference in Japan four years ago.

143
0:08:16.383,000 --> 0:08:19,000
When I returned to the United States and entered the airport,

144
0:08:20.088,000 --> 0:08:22,000
a wall of sound hit me.

145
0:08:22.547,000 --> 0:08:24,000
This tells you that we don't realize anymore

146
0:08:24.675,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the constant degree of noise pollution we're exposed to

147
0:08:27.481,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and how much we could profit from more quiet spaces.

148
0:08:32.6,000 --> 0:08:33,000
What else can we do about noise?

149
0:08:34.975,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Well, very much like a carbon footprint, we all have a noise footprint,

150
0:08:38.995,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and there are things we can do to make that noise footprint smaller.

151
0:08:42.84,000 --> 0:08:47,000
For example, don't start mowing your lawn at 7am on a Saturday morning.

152
0:08:48.247,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Your neighbors will thank you.

153
0:08:50.247,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Or use a rake instead of a leaf blower.

154
0:08:52.951,000 --> 0:08:56,000
In general, noise reduction at the source makes the most sense,

155
0:08:57.213,000 --> 0:08:59,000
so whenever you're looking to buy a new car,

156
0:08:59.856,000 --> 0:09:01,000
air-conditioning unit, blender, you name it,

157
0:09:02.618,000 --> 0:09:03,000
make low noise a priority.

158
0:09:04.889,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Many manufacturers will list the noise levels their devices generate,

159
0:09:08.649,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and some even advertise with them.

160
0:09:11.021,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Use that information.

161
0:09:14.014,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Many people think that stronger noise regulation and enforcement are good ideas,

162
0:09:18.009,000 --> 0:09:2,000
even obvious solutions, perhaps,

163
0:09:20.158,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but it's not as easy as you may think,

164
0:09:22.234,000 --> 0:09:24,000
because many of the activities that generate noise

165
0:09:25.097,000 --> 0:09:26,000
also generate revenue.

166
0:09:27.274,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Think about an airport and all the business that is associated with it.

167
0:09:32.801,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Our research tells politicians at what noise level

168
0:09:36.447,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they can expect a certain health effect,

169
0:09:38.636,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and that helps inform better noise policy.

170
0:09:42.568,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Robert Koch supposedly once said,

171
0:09:44.981,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"One day, mankind will fight noise as relentlessly as cholera and the pest."

172
0:09:51.01,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I think we're there,

173
0:09:52.606,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and I hope that we will win this fight,

174
0:09:54.981,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and when we do, we can all have a nice, quiet celebration.

175
0:09:59.231,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

176
0:10:00.342,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Thank you.

177
0:10:01.539,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Applause)

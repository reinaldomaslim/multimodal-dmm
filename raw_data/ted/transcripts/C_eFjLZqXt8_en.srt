2
0:00:12.818,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Once upon a time

3
0:00:14.328,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we lived in an economy of financial growth and prosperity.

4
0:00:20.979,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This was called the Great Moderation,

5
0:00:24.674,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the misguided belief by most economists,

6
0:00:28.08,000 --> 0:00:31,000
policymakers and central banks

7
0:00:31.383,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that we have transformed into a new world

8
0:00:34.714,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of never-ending growth and prosperity.

9
0:00:38.571,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This was seen by robust and steady GDP growth,

10
0:00:43.314,000 --> 0:00:46,000
by low and controlled inflation,

11
0:00:46.314,000 --> 0:00:48,000
by low unemployment,

12
0:00:48.553,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and controlled and low financial volatility.

13
0:00:52.459,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008,

14
0:00:59.091,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the great crash, broke this illusion.

15
0:01:02.57,000 --> 0:01:07,000
A few hundred billion dollars of losses in the financial sector

16
0:01:07.594,000 --> 0:01:11,000
cascaded into five trillion dollars

17
0:01:11.674,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of losses in world GDP

18
0:01:13.558,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and almost $30 trillion losses

19
0:01:17.361,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the global stock market.

20
0:01:21.306,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So the understanding of this Great Recession

21
0:01:26.501,000 --> 0:01:31,000
was that this was completely surprising,

22
0:01:31.862,000 --> 0:01:32,000
this came out of the blue,

23
0:01:33.208,000 --> 0:01:35,000
this was like the wrath of the gods.

24
0:01:36.125,000 --> 0:01:37,000
There was no responsibility.

25
0:01:37.916,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, as a reflection of this,

26
0:01:39.839,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we started the Financial Crisis Observatory.

27
0:01:43.448,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We had the goal to diagnose in real time

28
0:01:47.386,000 --> 0:01:49,000
financial bubbles

29
0:01:49.757,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and identify in advance their critical time.

30
0:01:55.614,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What is the underpinning, scientifically, of this financial observatory?

31
0:01:58.972,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We developed a theory called "dragon-kings."

32
0:02:03.598,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Dragon-kings represent extreme events

33
0:02:06.804,000 --> 0:02:09,000
which are of a class of their own.

34
0:02:10.076,000 --> 0:02:12,000
They are special. They are outliers.

35
0:02:12.919,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They are generated by specific mechanisms

36
0:02:16.359,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that may make them predictable,

37
0:02:19.245,000 --> 0:02:21,000
perhaps controllable.

38
0:02:22.143,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Consider the financial price time series,

39
0:02:25.97,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a given stock, your perfect stock,

40
0:02:28.143,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or a global index.

41
0:02:30.495,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You have these up-and-downs.

42
0:02:32.549,000 --> 0:02:35,000
A very good measure of the risk of this financial market

43
0:02:36.111,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is the peaks-to-valleys that represent

44
0:02:38.533,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a worst case scenario

45
0:02:40.829,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when you bought at the top and sold at the bottom.

46
0:02:44.502,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You can look at the statistics, the frequency of the occurrence

47
0:02:48.251,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of peak-to-valleys of different sizes,

48
0:02:50.606,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which is represented in this graph.

49
0:02:53.157,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now, interestingly, 99 percent

50
0:02:56.189,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of the peak-to-valleys of different amplitudes

51
0:02:59.982,000 --> 0:03:02,000
can be represented by a universal power law

52
0:03:03.442,000 --> 0:03:06,000
represented by this red line here.

53
0:03:06.893,000 --> 0:03:1,000
More interestingly, there are outliers, there are exceptions

54
0:03:11.039,000 --> 0:03:12,000
which are above this red line,

55
0:03:12.942,000 --> 0:03:15,000
occur 100 times more frequently, at least,

56
0:03:16.701,000 --> 0:03:2,000
than the extrapolation would predict them to occur

57
0:03:20.854,000 --> 0:03:23,000
based on the calibration of the 99 percent remaining

58
0:03:24.791,000 --> 0:03:26,000
peak-to-valleys.

59
0:03:27.04,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They are due to trenchant dependancies

60
0:03:31.64,000 --> 0:03:34,000
such that a loss is followed by a loss

61
0:03:35.152,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which is followed by a loss which is followed by a loss.

62
0:03:38.115,000 --> 0:03:41,000
These kinds of dependencies

63
0:03:41.226,000 --> 0:03:46,000
are largely missed by standard risk management tools,

64
0:03:46.838,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which ignore them and see lizards

65
0:03:49.767,000 --> 0:03:52,000
when they should see dragon-kings.

66
0:03:53.586,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The root mechanism of a dragon-king

67
0:03:57.503,000 --> 0:04:,000
is a slow maturation towards instability,

68
0:04:00.639,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which is the bubble,

69
0:04:02.261,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the climax of the bubble is often the crash.

70
0:04:04.891,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is similar to the slow heating of water

71
0:04:08.516,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in this test tube reaching the boiling point,

72
0:04:11.419,000 --> 0:04:13,000
where the instability of the water occurs

73
0:04:13.909,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and you have the phase transition to vapor.

74
0:04:17.246,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And this process, which is absolutely non-linear --

75
0:04:20.923,000 --> 0:04:22,000
cannot be predicted by standard techniques --

76
0:04:23.203,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior

77
0:04:27.379,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which is fundamentally endogenous.

78
0:04:29.758,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So the cause of the crash, the cause of the crisis

79
0:04:32.971,000 --> 0:04:35,000
has to be found in an inner instability of the system,

80
0:04:36.155,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and any tiny perturbation will make this instability occur.

81
0:04:42.191,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, some of you may have come to the mind

82
0:04:45.891,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that is this not related to the black swan concept

83
0:04:48.516,000 --> 0:04:5,000
you have heard about frequently?

84
0:04:51.451,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Remember, black swan is this rare bird

85
0:04:53.868,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that you see once and suddenly shattered your belief

86
0:04:57.277,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that all swans should be white,

87
0:04:59.751,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so it has captured the idea of unpredictability,

88
0:05:03.295,000 --> 0:05:04,000
unknowability, that the extreme events

89
0:05:04.804,000 --> 0:05:06,000
are fundamentally unknowable.

90
0:05:07.635,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Nothing can be further

91
0:05:09.36,000 --> 0:05:11,000
from the dragon-king concept I propose,

92
0:05:11.998,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which is exactly the opposite, that most extreme events

93
0:05:15.716,000 --> 0:05:18,000
are actually knowable and predictable.

94
0:05:18.939,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So we can be empowered and take responsibility

95
0:05:22.444,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and make predictions about them.

96
0:05:24.663,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So let's have my dragon-king burn this black swan concept.

97
0:05:27.863,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:29.489,000 --> 0:05:31,000
There are many early warning signals

99
0:05:32.429,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that are predicted by this theory.

100
0:05:34.308,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Let me just focus on one of them:

101
0:05:36.675,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the super-exponential growth with positive feedback.

102
0:05:39.827,000 --> 0:05:4,000
What does it mean?

103
0:05:40.987,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Imagine you have an investment

104
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that returns the first year five percent,

105
0:05:46.314,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the second year 10 percent, the third year 20 percent,

106
0:05:49.469,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the next year 40 percent. Is that not marvelous?

107
0:05:52.011,000 --> 0:05:55,000
This is a super-exponential growth.

108
0:05:55.409,000 --> 0:05:56,000
A standard exponential growth corresponds

109
0:05:57.346,000 --> 0:06:,000
to a constant growth rate, let's say, of 10 percent

110
0:06:01.09,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The point is that, many times during bubbles,

111
0:06:04.571,000 --> 0:06:07,000
there are positive feedbacks which can be of many times,

112
0:06:08.168,000 --> 0:06:11,000
such that previous growths enhance,

113
0:06:11.867,000 --> 0:06:14,000
push forward, increase the next growth

114
0:06:15.355,000 --> 0:06:17,000
through this kind of super-exponential growth,

115
0:06:17.857,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which is very trenchant, not sustainable.

116
0:06:20.971,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And the key idea is that the mathematical solution

117
0:06:24.028,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of this class of models exhibit finite-time singularities,

118
0:06:27.666,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which means that there is a critical time

119
0:06:31.019,000 --> 0:06:34,000
where the system will break, will change regime.

120
0:06:34.223,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It may be a crash. It may be just a plateau, something else.

121
0:06:37.499,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And the key idea is that the critical time,

122
0:06:39.766,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the information about the critical time is contained

123
0:06:42.295,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in the early development of this super-exponential growth.

124
0:06:47.779,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We have applied this theory early on, that was our first success,

125
0:06:52.139,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to the diagnostic of the rupture of key elements

126
0:06:55.698,000 --> 0:06:57,000
on the iron rocket.

127
0:06:58.227,000 --> 0:07:,000
Using acoustic emission, you know, this little noise

128
0:07:01.049,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that you hear a structure emit, sing to you

129
0:07:03.346,000 --> 0:07:06,000
when they are stressed, and reveal the damage going on,

130
0:07:07.037,000 --> 0:07:09,000
there's a collective phenomenon of positive feedback,

131
0:07:09.477,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the more damage gives the more damage,

132
0:07:11.174,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so you can actually predict,

133
0:07:13.649,000 --> 0:07:15,000
within, of course, a probability band,

134
0:07:15.789,000 --> 0:07:16,000
when the rupture will occur.

135
0:07:17.702,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So this is now so successful that it is used

136
0:07:20.137,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in the initial phase of [unclear] the flight.

137
0:07:24.502,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Perhaps more surprisingly, the same type of theory

138
0:07:27.309,000 --> 0:07:29,000
applies to biology and medicine,

139
0:07:30.037,000 --> 0:07:33,000
parturition, the act of giving birth, epileptic seizures.

140
0:07:33.733,000 --> 0:07:36,000
From seven months of pregnancy, a mother

141
0:07:37.357,000 --> 0:07:42,000
starts to feel episodic precursory contractions of the uterus

142
0:07:43.021,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that are the sign of these maturations

143
0:07:47.125,000 --> 0:07:5,000
toward the instability, giving birth to the baby,

144
0:07:50.549,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the dragon-king.

145
0:07:52.92,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So if you measure the precursor signal,

146
0:07:55.526,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you can actually identify pre- and post-maturity problems

147
0:08:01.751,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in advance.

148
0:08:03.222,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Epileptic seizures also come in a large variety of size,

149
0:08:06.982,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and when the brain goes to a super-critical state,

150
0:08:10.262,000 --> 0:08:13,000
you have dragon-kings which have a degree of predictability

151
0:08:13.835,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and this can help the patient to deal with this illness.

152
0:08:19.342,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We have applied this theory to many systems,

153
0:08:21.527,000 --> 0:08:23,000
landslides, glacier collapse,

154
0:08:24.382,000 --> 0:08:27,000
even to the dynamics of prediction of success:

155
0:08:27.949,000 --> 0:08:31,000
blockbusters, YouTube videos, movies, and so on.

156
0:08:32.335,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But perhaps the most important application

157
0:08:35.471,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is for finance, and this theory

158
0:08:37.837,000 --> 0:08:4,000
illuminates, I believe, the deep reason

159
0:08:41.276,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for the financial crisis that we have gone through.

160
0:08:43.972,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is rooted in 30 years of history of bubbles,

161
0:08:48.02,000 --> 0:08:51,000
starting in 1980, with the global bubble

162
0:08:51.732,000 --> 0:08:53,000
crashing in 1987,

163
0:08:53.819,000 --> 0:08:55,000
followed by many other bubbles.

164
0:08:56.188,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The biggest one was the "new economy" Internet bubble

165
0:08:58.9,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in 2000, crashing in 2000,

166
0:09:00.825,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the real estate bubbles in many countries,

167
0:09:02.873,000 --> 0:09:04,000
financial derivative bubbles everywhere,

168
0:09:05.653,000 --> 0:09:07,000
stock market bubbles also everywhere,

169
0:09:07.942,000 --> 0:09:1,000
commodity and all bubbles, debt and credit bubbles --

170
0:09:11.893,000 --> 0:09:13,000
bubbles, bubbles, bubbles.

171
0:09:14.606,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We had a global bubble.

172
0:09:17.245,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This is a measure of global overvaluation

173
0:09:21.486,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of all markets, expressing what I call

174
0:09:25.508,000 --> 0:09:28,000
an illusion of a perpetual money machine

175
0:09:28.677,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that suddenly broke in 2007.

176
0:09:32.629,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The problem is that we see the same process,

177
0:09:36.863,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in particular through quantitative easing,

178
0:09:39.594,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of a thinking of a perpetual money machine nowadays

179
0:09:42.778,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to tackle the crisis since 2008 in the U.S., in Europe,

180
0:09:47.181,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in Japan.

181
0:09:49.469,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This has very important implications

182
0:09:51.859,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to understand the failure of quantitative easing

183
0:09:55.937,000 --> 0:09:56,000
as well as austerity measures

184
0:09:57.813,000 --> 0:09:59,000
as long as we don't attack the core,

185
0:10:00.622,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the structural cause of this perpetual money machine thinking.

186
0:10:05.813,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Now, these are big claims.

187
0:10:08.429,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Why would you believe me?

188
0:10:11.311,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Well, perhaps because, in the last 15 years

189
0:10:14.191,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we have come out of our ivory tower,

190
0:10:17.383,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and started to publish ex ante --

191
0:10:20.119,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and I stress the term ex ante, it means "in advance" —

192
0:10:23.447,000 --> 0:10:25,000
before the crash confirmed

193
0:10:25.585,000 --> 0:10:27,000
the existence of the bubble or the financial excesses.

194
0:10:28.271,000 --> 0:10:31,000
These are a few of the major bubbles

195
0:10:31.993,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that we have lived through in recent history.

196
0:10:36.471,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Again, many interesting stories for each of them.

197
0:10:39.311,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Let me tell you just one or two stories

198
0:10:42.025,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that deal with massive bubbles.

199
0:10:44.071,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We all know the Chinese miracle.

200
0:10:46.407,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This is the expression of the stock market

201
0:10:49.477,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of a massive bubble, a factor of three,

202
0:10:52.357,000 --> 0:10:54,000
300 percent in just a few years.

203
0:10:54.527,000 --> 0:10:57,000
In September 2007,

204
0:10:57.729,000 --> 0:11:,000
I was invited as a keynote speaker of a macro hedge fund

205
0:11:01.376,000 --> 0:11:03,000
management conference,

206
0:11:03.825,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and I showed to the conference a prediction

207
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that by the end of 2007, this bubble

208
0:11:12.073,000 --> 0:11:13,000
would change regime.

209
0:11:14.042,000 --> 0:11:17,000
There might be a crash. Certainly not sustainable.

210
0:11:17.127,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Now, how do you believe the very smart,

211
0:11:22.369,000 --> 0:11:27,000
very motivated, very informed macro hedge fund managers

212
0:11:27.799,000 --> 0:11:28,000
reacted to this prediction?

213
0:11:29.755,000 --> 0:11:3,000
You know, they had made billions

214
0:11:31.711,000 --> 0:11:33,000
just surfing this bubble until now.

215
0:11:34.546,000 --> 0:11:35,000
They told me, "Didier,

216
0:11:36.13,000 --> 0:11:39,000
yeah, the market might be overvalued,

217
0:11:39.167,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but you forget something.

218
0:11:41.063,000 --> 0:11:43,000
There is the Beijing Olympic Games coming

219
0:11:43.415,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in August 2008, and it's very clear that

220
0:11:45.679,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the Chinese government is controlling the economy

221
0:11:48.871,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and doing what it takes

222
0:11:50.224,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to also avoid any wave and control the stock market."

223
0:11:54.671,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Three weeks after my presentation,

224
0:11:57.142,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the markets lost 20 percent

225
0:11:59.268,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and went through a phase of volatility,

226
0:12:01.529,000 --> 0:12:03,000
upheaval, and a total market loss of

227
0:12:04.255,000 --> 0:12:06,000
70 percent until the end of the year.

228
0:12:06.523,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So how can we be so collectively wrong

229
0:12:09.399,000 --> 0:12:13,000
by misreading or ignoring the science

230
0:12:13.541,000 --> 0:12:15,000
of the fact that when an instability has developed,

231
0:12:16.372,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and the system is ripe, any perturbation

232
0:12:18.823,000 --> 0:12:21,000
makes it essentially impossible to control?

233
0:12:22.504,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The Chinese market collapsed, but it rebounded.

234
0:12:27.209,000 --> 0:12:31,000
In 2009, we also identified that this new bubble,

235
0:12:31.965,000 --> 0:12:33,000
a smaller one, was unsustainable,

236
0:12:34.551,000 --> 0:12:37,000
so we published again a prediction, in advance,

237
0:12:38.183,000 --> 0:12:42,000
stating that by August 2009, the market will correct,

238
0:12:42.51,000 --> 0:12:44,000
will not continue on this track.

239
0:12:45.191,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Our critics, reading the prediction,

240
0:12:48.343,000 --> 0:12:51,000
said, "No, it's not possible.

241
0:12:52.256,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The Chinese government is there.

242
0:12:53.75,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They have learned their lesson. They will control.

243
0:12:56.432,000 --> 0:12:57,000
They want to benefit from the growth."

244
0:12:58.239,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Perhaps these critics have not learned their lesson previously.

245
0:13:01.895,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So the crisis did occur. The market corrected.

246
0:13:05.727,000 --> 0:13:07,000
The same critics then said, "Ah, yes,

247
0:13:08.063,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but you published your prediction.

248
0:13:09.912,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You influenced the market.

249
0:13:11.568,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It was not a prediction."

250
0:13:14.701,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Maybe I am very powerful then.

251
0:13:18.058,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Now, this is interesting.

252
0:13:20.102,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It shows that it's essentially impossible until now

253
0:13:23.039,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to develop a science of economics

254
0:13:25.167,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because we are sentient beings who anticipate

255
0:13:28.31,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and there is a problem of self-fulfilling prophesies.

256
0:13:32.373,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So we invented a new way of doing science.

257
0:13:36.106,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We created the Financial Bubble Experiment.

258
0:13:38.818,000 --> 0:13:4,000
The idea is the following. We monitor the markets.

259
0:13:41.49,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We identify excesses, bubbles.

260
0:13:45.658,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We do our work. We write a report

261
0:13:48.962,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in which we put our prediction of the critical time.

262
0:13:53.234,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We don't release the report. It's kept secret.

263
0:13:55.809,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But with modern encrypting techniques,

264
0:13:58.674,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we have a hash, we publish a public key,

265
0:14:02.696,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and six months later, we release the report,

266
0:14:06.651,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and there is authentication.

267
0:14:09.05,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And all this is done on an international archive

268
0:14:13.818,000 --> 0:14:17,000
so that we cannot be accused of just releasing the successes.

269
0:14:18.018,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Let me tease you with a very recent analysis.

270
0:14:21.41,000 --> 0:14:24,000
17th of May, 2013, just two weeks ago,

271
0:14:24.668,000 --> 0:14:25,000
we identified that the U.S. stock market

272
0:14:26.346,000 --> 0:14:28,000
was on an unsustainable path

273
0:14:28.738,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and we released this on our website on the 21st of May

274
0:14:32.54,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that there will be a change of regime.

275
0:14:34.585,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The next day, the market started to change regime, course.

276
0:14:39.369,000 --> 0:14:4,000
This is not a crash.

277
0:14:40.86,000 --> 0:14:42,000
This is just the third or fourth act

278
0:14:43.459,000 --> 0:14:45,000
of a massive bubble in the making.

279
0:14:46.322,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Scaling up the discussion at the size of the planet,

280
0:14:49.418,000 --> 0:14:5,000
we see the same thing.

281
0:14:50.443,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Wherever we look, it's observable:

282
0:14:53.364,000 --> 0:14:56,000
in the biosphere, in the atmosphere, in the ocean,

283
0:14:56.594,000 --> 0:14:59,000
showing these super-exponential trajectories

284
0:15:00.498,000 --> 0:15:02,000
characterizing an unsustainable path

285
0:15:03.129,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and announcing a phase transition.

286
0:15:05.746,000 --> 0:15:06,000
This diagram on the right

287
0:15:07.45,000 --> 0:15:1,000
shows a very beautiful compilation of studies

288
0:15:10.45,000 --> 0:15:13,000
suggesting indeed that there is a nonlinear -- possibility

289
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
for a nonlinear transition just in the next few decades.

290
0:15:18.309,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So there are bubbles everywhere.

291
0:15:21.931,000 --> 0:15:22,000
From one side, this is exciting

292
0:15:23.895,000 --> 0:15:25,000
for me, as a professor who chases bubbles

293
0:15:26.655,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and slays dragons, as the media has sometimes called me.

294
0:15:31.413,000 --> 0:15:34,000
But can we really slay the dragons?

295
0:15:34.464,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Very recently, with collaborators,

296
0:15:36.608,000 --> 0:15:38,000
we studied a dynamical system

297
0:15:39.311,000 --> 0:15:41,000
where you see the dragon-king as these big loops

298
0:15:42.215,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and we were able to apply tiny perturbations at the right times

299
0:15:46.136,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that removed, when control is on, these dragons.

300
0:15:51.071,000 --> 0:15:53,000
"Gouverner, c'est prévoir."

301
0:15:54.005,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Governing is the art of planning and predicting.

302
0:15:59.799,000 --> 0:16:01,000
But is it not the case that this is probably

303
0:16:02.552,000 --> 0:16:05,000
one of the biggest gaps of mankind,

304
0:16:06.452,000 --> 0:16:09,000
which has the responsibility to steer

305
0:16:09.712,000 --> 0:16:11,000
our societies and our planet toward sustainability

306
0:16:12.428,000 --> 0:16:16,000
in the face of growing challenges and crises?

307
0:16:17.272,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But the dragon-king theory gives hope.

308
0:16:21.767,000 --> 0:16:24,000
We learn that most systems have pockets of predictability.

309
0:16:25.335,000 --> 0:16:29,000
It is possible to develop advance diagnostics of crises

310
0:16:30.235,000 --> 0:16:33,000
so that we can be prepared, we can take measures,

311
0:16:33.794,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we can take responsibility,

312
0:16:36.549,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and so that never again will

313
0:16:39.296,000 --> 0:16:42,000
extremes and crises like the Great Recession

314
0:16:43.15,000 --> 0:16:47,000
or the European crisis take us by surprise.

315
0:16:47.56,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Thank you.

316
0:16:49.035,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Applause)

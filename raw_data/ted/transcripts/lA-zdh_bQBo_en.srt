1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In his inaugural address,

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But what did he appeal to?

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and tell us to just go shopping.

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Invest, invest, invest."

9
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And he appealed to virtue.

11
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Virtue is an old-fashioned word.

12
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.

13
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And besides, some of you might be wondering,

14
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
what the hell does it mean?

15
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Let me begin with an example.

16
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is the job description of a hospital janitor

17
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that is scrolling up on the screen.

18
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And all of the items on it are unremarkable.

19
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They're the things you would expect:

20
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.

21
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It may be a little surprising how many things there are,

22
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but it's not surprising what they are.

23
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:

24
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
even though this is a very long list,

25
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.

26
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Not one.

27
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.

28
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors

29
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,

30
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
they encountered Mike,

31
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor

32
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,

33
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.

34
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition

35
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge

36
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because there were some family members who were there all day, every day

37
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.

38
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And then there was Luke,

39
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice

40
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,

41
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
didn't see Luke do it the first time,

42
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and his father was angry.

43
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses

44
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,

45
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
doesn't just make people feel a little better,

46
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it actually improves the quality of patient care

47
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and enables hospitals to run well.

48
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.

49
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions

50
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
involving kindness, care and empathy

51
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
are an essential part of the job.

52
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.

53
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.

54
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.

55
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,

56
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."

57
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,

58
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.

59
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
A wise person knows how to improvise,

60
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.

61
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined

62
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and the context is always changing.

63
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
A wise person is like a jazz musician --

64
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,

65
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.

66
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills

67
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in the service of the right aims.

68
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.

69
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And finally, perhaps most important,

70
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
a wise person is made, not born.

71
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Wisdom depends on experience,

72
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and not just any experience.

73
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.

74
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You need permission to be allowed to improvise,

75
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.

76
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.

77
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described

78
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
how hard it is to learn to do their job,

79
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
they tell you that it takes lots of experience.

80
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.

81
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.

82
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
At TED, brilliance is rampant.

83
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's scary.

84
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.

85
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The bad news is that without wisdom,

86
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
brilliance isn't enough.

87
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.

88
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Applause)

89
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, I hope that we all know this.

90
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
There's a sense in which it's obvious,

91
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and yet, let me tell you a little story.

92
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's a story about lemonade.

93
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.

94
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
His son asked him for some lemonade

95
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.

96
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,

97
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
which was five percent alcohol.

98
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.

99
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So he brought it back.

100
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,

101
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and called the police, who called an ambulance

102
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.

103
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.

104
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And they were ready to let the kid go.

105
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But not so fast.

106
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.

107
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.

108
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
At that point, can the child go home?

109
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.

110
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
After two weeks, I'm happy to report,

111
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the family was reunited.

112
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people

113
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and the judge all said the same thing:

114
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."

115
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
How do things like this happen?

116
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,

117
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,

118
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but they spare you from thinking."

119
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And, to be fair, rules are often imposed

120
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
because previous officials have been lax

121
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they let a child go back to an abusive household.

122
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Fair enough.

123
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
When things go wrong, as of course they do,

124
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we reach for two tools to try to fix them.

125
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
One tool we reach for is rules.

126
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Better ones, more of them.

127
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The second tool we reach for is incentives.

128
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Better ones, more of them.

129
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
What else, after all, is there?

130
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.

131
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Regulate, regulate, regulate.

132
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...

133
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives

134
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
are enough to do the job.

135
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?

136
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?

137
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's preposterous on its face.

138
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,

139
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,

140
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but they create a downward spiral

141
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that makes them worse in the long run.

142
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules

143
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that deprives us of the opportunity

144
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
to improvise and learn from our improvisations.

145
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And moral will is undermined

146
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
by an incessant appeal to incentives

147
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that destroy our desire to do the right thing.

148
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And without intending it,

149
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
by appealing to rules and incentives,

150
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
we are engaging in a war on wisdom.

151
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Let me just give you a few examples,

152
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
first of rules and the war on moral skill.

153
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The lemonade story is one.

154
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Second, no doubt more familiar to you,

155
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is the nature of modern American education:

156
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
scripted, lock-step curricula.

157
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.

158
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Reading and enjoying literature

159
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and words that begin with 'B.'

160
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug

161
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.

162
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.

163
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,

164
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.

165
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
We know why these scripts are there.

166
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough

167
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to let them loose on their own.

168
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.

169
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And they prevent disaster.

170
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.

171
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Applause)

172
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Don't get me wrong. We need rules!

173
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Jazz musicians need some notes --

174
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
most of them need some notes on the page.

175
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.

176
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians

177
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
from improvising.

178
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And as a result, they lose their gifts,

179
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
or worse, they stop playing altogether.

180
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now, how about incentives?

181
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They seem cleverer.

182
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
If you have one reason for doing something

183
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,

184
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one

185
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and you're more likely to do it.

186
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Right?

187
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Well, not always.

188
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another

189
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
instead of complimenting,

190
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and they make people less likely to do it.

191
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I'll just give you one example because time is racing.

192
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,

193
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.

194
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
There was going to be a national referendum.

195
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.

196
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

197
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.

198
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
They knew it was dangerous.

199
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
They thought it would reduce their property values.

200
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But it had to go somewhere

201
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and they had responsibilities as citizens.

202
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.

203
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year

204
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"

205
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.

206
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Instead of 50 percent saying yes,

207
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
25 percent said yes.

208
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
What happens is that

209
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the second this introduction of incentive gets us

210
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"

211
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
all we ask is, "What serves my interests?"

212
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
When incentives don't work,

213
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies

214
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,

215
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
the response is always the same.

216
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Get smarter incentives.

217
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise

218
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that are ever going to be smart enough.

219
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.

220
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We need incentives. People have to make a living.

221
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But excessive reliance on incentives

222
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
demoralizes professional activity

223
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in two senses of that word.

224
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale

225
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and it causes the activity itself to lose morality.

226
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,

227
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"

228
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And when professions are demoralized,

229
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives

230
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and they stop asking "Is it right?"

231
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We see this in medicine.

232
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")

233
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And we certainly see it in the world of business.

234
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")

235
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")

236
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.

237
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So what can we do?

238
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
A few sources of hope:

239
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we ought to try to re-moralize work.

240
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.

241
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

242
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
There is no better way to show people that you're not serious

243
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics

244
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.

245
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
What to do instead?

246
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
One: Celebrate moral exemplars.

247
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Acknowledge, when you go to law school,

248
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that a little voice is whispering in your ear

249
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
about Atticus Finch.

250
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.

251
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
People are inspired by moral heroes.

252
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But we learn that with sophistication

253
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.

254
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Well, acknowledge them.

255
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Be proud that you have them.

256
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Celebrate them.

257
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.

258
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
That's one thing we can do.

259
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I don't know how many of you remember this:

260
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,

261
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --

262
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
they made Polartec --

263
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
The factory burned down.

264
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.

265
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them

266
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and for the community if he had let them go.

267
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,

268
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."

269
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.

270
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Two were particularly inspiring to me.

271
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
One was Ray Anderson, who turned --

272
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Applause)

273
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire

274
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.

275
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Why? Because it was the right thing to do.

276
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And a bonus he's discovering is

277
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
he's actually going to make even more money.

278
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
His employees are inspired by the effort.

279
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.

280
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.

281
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Applause)

282
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
In many ways this is the perfect example.

283
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Because it took the will to do the right thing.

284
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.

285
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know

286
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
in order to plot this out.

287
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
But most important to make it work --

288
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and he emphasized this --

289
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
is that it took knowing the people in the communities.

290
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Unless the people you're working with are behind you,

291
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
this will fail.

292
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,

293
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
because different people in different communities

294
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
organize their lives in different ways.

295
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.

296
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And you don't have to be a mega-hero.

297
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
There are ordinary heroes.

298
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.

299
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive

300
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.

301
0:17:13.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
As heads of organizations,

302
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
we should strive to create environments

303
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.

304
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people

305
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
will give up if they have to swim against the current

306
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
in the organizations in which they work.

307
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
If you run an organization, you should be sure

308
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --

309
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.

310
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Because the truth is that

311
0:17:43.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
any work that you do that involves interaction with other people

312
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
is moral work.

313
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.

314
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And, perhaps most important,

315
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,

316
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.

317
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.

318
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
One is that we are always teaching.

319
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Someone is always watching.

320
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
The camera is always on.

321
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education

322
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:

323
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
"Knowledge is power."

324
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things

325
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
that KIPP is doing

326
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.

327
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing

328
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that Bill didn't mention.

329
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
That is that they have come to the realization

330
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
that the single most important thing kids need to learn

331
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
is character.

332
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
They need to learn to respect themselves.

333
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.

334
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:54,000
They need to learn to respect their teachers.

335
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.

336
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
That's the principle objective.

337
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.

338
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids

339
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.

340
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Obama appealed to virtue.

341
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And I think he was right.

342
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,

343
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --

344
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.

345
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
He also appealed to hope.

346
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Right again.

347
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
I think there is reason for hope.

348
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.

349
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:46,000
In many ways, it's what TED is all about.

350
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
Wanting to do the right thing

351
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:51,000
in the right way

352
0:19:51.16,000 --> 0:19:53,000
for the right reasons.

353
0:19:53.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us

354
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
if only we start paying attention.

355
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
Paying attention to what we do,

356
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
to how we do it,

357
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and, perhaps most importantly,

358
0:20:06.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
to the structure of the organizations within which we work,

359
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom

360
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
rather than having it suppressed.

361
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
Thank you very much.

362
0:20:20.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Thank you.

363
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
(Applause)

364
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Chris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec.

365
0:20:31.16,000 --> 0:20:33,000
Barry Schwartz: Thank you very much.

366
0:20:33.16,000 --> 0:20:39,000
(Applause)

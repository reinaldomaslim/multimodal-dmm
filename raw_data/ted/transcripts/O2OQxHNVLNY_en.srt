1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Many believe driving is an activity

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
solely reserved for those who can see.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
was thought to be an impossible task, until now.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Hello, my name is Dennis Hong,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So before I talk about this car for the blind,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
called the DARPA Urban Challenge.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now this was about building a robotic car

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that can drive itself.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You press start, nobody touches anything,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
by placing third place in this competition.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So about that time,

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
challenged the research committee

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
about who can develop a car

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We decided to give it a try,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We have already an autonomous vehicle.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We couldn't have been more wrong.

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
What NFB wanted

29
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around,

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So we had to throw everything out the window

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and start from scratch.

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So to test this crazy idea,

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to test the feasibility.

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And in the summer of 2009,

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It was an absolutely amazing experience.

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But the problem with this car was

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment,

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in a flat, closed-off parking lot --

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So with this success,

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we decided to take the next big step,

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.

47
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So how does it work?

48
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Well, it's a rather complex system,

49
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So we have three steps.

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We have perception, computation

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and non-visual interfaces.

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Now obviously the driver cannot see,

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so the system needs to perceive the environment

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and gather information for the driver.

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
For that, we use an initial measurement unit.

57
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration --

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
like a human ear, inner ear.

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We fuse that information with a GPS unit

60
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to get an estimate of the location of the car.

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.

62
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And we also use three laser range finders.

63
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles --

64
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a car approaching from the front, the back

65
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and also any obstacles that run into the roads,

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
any obstacles around the vehicle.

67
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer,

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and the computer can do two things.

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
One is, first of all, process this information

70
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to have an understanding of the environment --

71
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles --

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and convey this information to the driver.

73
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The system is also smart enough

74
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to figure out the safest way to operate the car.

75
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So we can also generate instructions

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But the problem is this: How do we convey

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
this information and instructions

79
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to a person who cannot see

80
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?

81
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So for this, we developed many different types

82
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
of non-visual user interface technology.

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system,

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
a vibrating vest,

85
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip,

86
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.

87
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But today we're going to talk about

88
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
three of these non-visual user interfaces.

89
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.

90
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So these are a pair of gloves,

91
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part

92
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so you can convey instructions about how to steer --

93
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the direction and the intensity.

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Another device is called SpeedStrip.

95
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.

96
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns,

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and we actuate them to convey information about the speed,

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So over here, you can see

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
how the computer understands the environment,

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and because you cannot see the vibration,

102
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This is the sensory data,

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip,

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are very effective.

107
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But the problem is

108
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
these are instructional cue devices.

109
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So this is not really freedom, right?

110
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The computer tells you how to drive --

111
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.

112
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We call this the "backseat-driver problem."

113
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices,

114
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and we're now focusing more

115
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
on the informational devices.

116
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
A good example for this informational non-visual user interface

117
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is called AirPix.

118
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So think of it as a monitor for the blind.

119
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it,

120
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and compressed air comes out,

121
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
so it can actually draw images.

122
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it,

123
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.

124
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out

125
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and possibly the temperature.

126
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.

127
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle

128
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.

129
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
For this, we're showing a simulator,

130
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
a blind person driving using the AirPix.

131
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers

132
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and also quickly testing different types of ideas

133
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
for different types of non-visual user interfaces.

134
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So basically that's how it works.

135
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So just a month ago,

136
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
on January 29th,

137
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we unveiled this vehicle for the very first time to the public

138
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
at the world-famous Daytona International Speedway

139
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
during the Rolex 24 racing event.

140
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We also had some surprises. Let's take a look.

141
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Music)

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Video) Announcer: This is an historic day in January.

143
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
He's coming up to the grandstand, fellow Federationists.

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Cheering)

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Honking)

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
There's the grandstand now.

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And he's [unclear] following that van that's out in front of him.

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well there comes the first box.

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now let's see if Mark avoids it.

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He does. He passes it on the right.

151
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Third box is out. The fourth box is out.

152
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And he's perfectly making his way between the two.

153
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
He's closing in on the van

154
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to make the moving pass.

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Well this is what it's all about,

156
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
this kind of dynamic display of audacity and ingenuity.

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
He's approaching the end of the run,

158
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
makes his way between the barrels that are set up there.

159
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Honking)

160
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

161
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Dennis Hong: I'm so happy for you.

162
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Mark's going to give me a ride back to the hotel.

163
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Mark Riccobono: Yes.

164
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Applause)

165
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
DH: So since we started this project,

166
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
we've been getting hundreds of letters, emails, phone calls

167
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
from people from all around the world.

168
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Letters thanking us, but sometimes you also get funny letters like this one:

169
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
"Now I understand why there is Braille on a drive-up ATM machine."

170
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But sometimes --

172
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughter)

173
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But sometimes I also do get --

174
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I wouldn't call it hate mail --

175
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but letters of really strong concern:

176
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"Dr. Hong, are you insane,

177
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
trying to put blind people on the road?

178
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You must be out of your mind."

179
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle,

180
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and it's not going to be on the road

181
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.

182
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I truly believe that this can happen.

183
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But still, will the society,

184
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
would they accept such a radical idea?

185
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
How are we going to handle insurance?

186
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
How are we going to issue driver's licenses?

187
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges

188
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that we need to address before this becomes a reality.

189
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Of course, the main goal of this project

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is to develop a car for the blind.

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But potentially more important than this

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology

193
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that can come from this project.

194
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The sensors that are used can see through the dark,

195
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
the fog and rain.

196
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And together with this new type of interfaces,

197
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we can use these technologies

198
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.

199
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Or for the blind, everyday home appliances --

200
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in the educational setting, in the office setting.

201
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard

202
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and a blind student can see what's written and read

203
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
using these non-visual interfaces.

204
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is priceless.

205
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Thank you very much.

207
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

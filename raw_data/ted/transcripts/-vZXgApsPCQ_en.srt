1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was six years old,

2
0:00:14.4,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I received my gifts.

3
0:00:16.32,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My first grade teacher had this brilliant idea.

4
0:00:19.8,000 --> 0:00:22,000
She wanted us to experience receiving gifts

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but also learning the virtue of complimenting each other.

6
0:00:27.64,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So she had all of us come to the front of the classroom,

7
0:00:30.56,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and she bought all of us gifts and stacked them in the corner.

8
0:00:33.56,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And she said,

9
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Why don't we just stand here and compliment each other?

10
0:00:37.48,000 --> 0:00:38,000
If you hear your name called,

11
0:00:39.08,000 --> 0:00:41,000
go and pick up your gift and sit down."

12
0:00:42.52,000 --> 0:00:43,000
What a wonderful idea, right?

13
0:00:44.88,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What could go wrong?

14
0:00:46.12,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:48.4,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Well, there were 40 of us to start with,

16
0:00:50.48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and every time I heard someone's name called,

17
0:00:52.96,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I would give out the heartiest cheer.

18
0:00:55.28,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And then there were 20 people left,

19
0:00:57.8,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and 10 people left,

20
0:00:59.6,000 --> 0:01:,000
and five left ...

21
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and three left.

22
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I was one of them.

23
0:01:04.72,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And the compliments stopped.

24
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Well, at that moment, I was crying.

25
0:01:10.6,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And the teacher was freaking out.

26
0:01:12.64,000 --> 0:01:15,000
She was like, "Hey, would anyone say anything nice about these people?"

27
0:01:16.319,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:17.56,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"No one? OK, why don't you go get your gift and sit down.

29
0:01:20.56,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So behave next year --

30
0:01:21.84,000 --> 0:01:23,000
someone might say something nice about you."

31
0:01:23.96,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Well, as I'm describing this you,

33
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you probably know I remember this really well.

34
0:01:30.56,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:32.8,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But I don't know who felt worse that day.

36
0:01:34.92,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Was it me or the teacher?

37
0:01:37.12,000 --> 0:01:4,000
She must have realized that she turned a team-building event

38
0:01:40.28,000 --> 0:01:42,000
into a public roast for three six-year-olds.

39
0:01:43.8,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And without the humor.

40
0:01:45.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You know, when you see people get roasted on TV,

41
0:01:47.44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it was funny.

42
0:01:48.68,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There was nothing funny about that day.

43
0:01:51.32,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So that was one version of me,

44
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and I would die to avoid being in that situation again --

45
0:01:57.88,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to get rejected in public again.

46
0:02:00.44,000 --> 0:02:01,000
That's one version.

47
0:02:01.92,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Then fast-forward eight years.

48
0:02:04.4,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Bill Gates came to my hometown --

49
0:02:06.4,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Beijing, China --

50
0:02:07.64,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to speak,

51
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and I saw his message.

52
0:02:10.64,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I fell in love with that guy.

53
0:02:12.96,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I thought, wow, I know what I want to do now.

54
0:02:15.88,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That night I wrote a letter to my family

55
0:02:18.04,000 --> 0:02:2,000
telling them: "By age 25,

56
0:02:20.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I will build the biggest company in the world,

57
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that company will buy Microsoft."

58
0:02:24.96,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:26.88,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I totally embraced this idea of conquering the world --

60
0:02:29.52,000 --> 0:02:3,000
domination, right?

61
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I didn't make this up, I did write that letter.

62
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And here it is --

63
0:02:35.36,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:37.36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You don't have to read this through --

65
0:02:39.2,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

66
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is also bad handwriting, but I did highlight some key words.

67
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:46,000
You get the idea.

68
0:02:46.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

69
0:02:48.64,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So ...

70
0:02:51.28,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that was another version of me:

71
0:02:53.32,000 --> 0:02:54,000
one who will conquer the world.

72
0:02:55.88,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Well, then two years later,

73
0:02:57.36,000 --> 0:03:,000
I was presented with the opportunity to come to the United States.

74
0:03:01.32,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I jumped on it,

75
0:03:02.92,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because that was where Bill Gates lived, right?

76
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I thought that was the start of my entrepreneur journey.

78
0:03:09.68,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Then, fast-forward another 14 years.

79
0:03:11.88,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I was 30.

80
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Nope, I didn't build that company.

81
0:03:15.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I didn't even start.

82
0:03:17.28,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I was actually a marketing manager for a Fortune 500 company.

83
0:03:21.28,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And I felt I was stuck;

84
0:03:22.92,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I was stagnant.

85
0:03:25.08,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Why is that?

86
0:03:26.32,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Where is that 14-year-old who wrote that letter?

87
0:03:29.48,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's not because he didn't try.

88
0:03:31.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's because every time I had a new idea,

89
0:03:34.56,000 --> 0:03:35,000
every time I wanted to try something new,

90
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:37,000
even at work --

91
0:03:37.8,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I wanted to make a proposal,

92
0:03:39.56,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I wanted to speak up in front of people in a group --

93
0:03:43.12,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I felt there was this constant battle

94
0:03:44.96,000 --> 0:03:46,000
between the 14-year-old and the six-year-old.

95
0:03:47.76,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One wanted to conquer the world --

96
0:03:49.92,000 --> 0:03:5,000
make a difference --

97
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
another was afraid of rejection.

98
0:03:53.96,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And every time that six-year-old won.

99
0:03:57.76,000 --> 0:04:,000
And this fear even persisted after I started my own company.

100
0:04:01.76,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I mean, I started my own company when I was 30 --

101
0:04:04.92,000 --> 0:04:05,000
if you want to be Bill Gates,

102
0:04:06.36,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you've got to start sooner or later, right?

103
0:04:09.08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
When I was an entrepreneur,

104
0:04:11.64,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I was presented with an investment opportunity,

105
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and then I was turned down.

106
0:04:17.04,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And that rejection hurt me.

107
0:04:18.8,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It hurt me so bad that I wanted to quit right there.

108
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But then I thought,

109
0:04:24.52,000 --> 0:04:27,000
hey, would Bill Gates quit after a simple investment rejection?

110
0:04:28.92,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Would any successful entrepreneur quit like that?

111
0:04:31.8,000 --> 0:04:32,000
No way.

112
0:04:33.2,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And this is where it clicked for me.

113
0:04:35.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
OK, I can build a better company.

114
0:04:37.04,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I can build a better team or better product,

115
0:04:39.28,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but one thing for sure:

116
0:04:40.84,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I've got to be a better leader.

117
0:04:42.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I've got to be a better person.

118
0:04:44.72,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I cannot let that six-year-old keep dictating my life anymore.

119
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I have to put him back in his place.

120
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So this is where I went online and looked for help.

121
0:04:53.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Google was my friend.

122
0:04:54.72,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

123
0:04:55.88,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I searched, "How do I overcome the fear of rejection?"

124
0:04:58.96,000 --> 0:05:,000
I came up with a bunch of psychology articles

125
0:05:01.84,000 --> 0:05:03,000
about where the fear and pain are coming from.

126
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Then I came up with a bunch of "rah-rah" inspirational articles

127
0:05:08.04,000 --> 0:05:1,000
about "Don't take it personally, just overcome it."

128
0:05:11.2,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Who doesn't know that?

129
0:05:12.88,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:14.48,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But why was I still so scared?

131
0:05:16.64,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Then I found this website by luck.

132
0:05:18.68,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's called rejectiontherapy.com.

133
0:05:21.08,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

134
0:05:23.64,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"Rejection Therapy" was this game invented by this Canadian entrepreneur.

135
0:05:27.6,000 --> 0:05:28,000
His name is Jason Comely.

136
0:05:29.32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And basically the idea is for 30 days you go out and look for rejection,

137
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and every day get rejected at something,

138
0:05:36.72,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and then by the end, you desensitize yourself from the pain.

139
0:05:41.2,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I loved that idea.

140
0:05:42.92,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

141
0:05:44.48,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I said, "You know what? I'm going to do this.

142
0:05:46.64,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And I'll feel myself getting rejected 100 days."

143
0:05:49.68,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I came up with my own rejection ideas,

144
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I made a video blog out of it.

145
0:05:55.6,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And so here's what I did.

146
0:05:57.56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is what the blog looked like.

147
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Day One ...

148
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:03.32,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger.

150
0:06:07.72,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So this is where I went to where I was working.

151
0:06:10.48,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I came downstairs

152
0:06:12.24,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and I saw this big guy sitting behind a desk.

153
0:06:14.48,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He looked like a security guard.

154
0:06:16.24,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So I just approached him.

155
0:06:17.8,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And I was just walking

156
0:06:19.56,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and that was the longest walk of my life --

157
0:06:21.92,000 --> 0:06:23,000
hair on the back of my neck standing up,

158
0:06:24.08,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I was sweating and my heart was pounding.

159
0:06:26.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And I got there and said,

160
0:06:27.8,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"Hey, sir, can I borrow 100 dollars from you?"

161
0:06:30.48,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

162
0:06:31.84,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And he looked up, he's like, "No."

163
0:06:34.64,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"Why?"

164
0:06:36.2,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And I just said, "No? I'm sorry."

165
0:06:38.52,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Then I turned around, and I just ran.

166
0:06:40.259,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

167
0:06:42.96,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I felt so embarrassed.

168
0:06:44.72,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But because I filmed myself --

169
0:06:46.2,000 --> 0:06:49,000
so that night I was watching myself getting rejected,

170
0:06:49.36,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I just saw how scared I was.

171
0:06:51.48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I looked like this kid in "The Sixth Sense."

172
0:06:53.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I saw dead people.

173
0:06:55.4,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

174
0:06:57.04,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But then I saw this guy.

175
0:06:58.6,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You know, he wasn't that menacing.

176
0:07:00.52,000 --> 0:07:02,000
He was a chubby, loveable guy,

177
0:07:02.92,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and he even asked me, "Why?"

178
0:07:06.4,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In fact, he invited me to explain myself.

179
0:07:08.84,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And I could've said many things.

180
0:07:10.44,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I could've explained, I could've negotiated.

181
0:07:12.76,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I didn't do any of that.

182
0:07:14.68,000 --> 0:07:15,000
All I did was run.

183
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I felt, wow, this is like a microcosm of my life.

184
0:07:20.92,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Every time I felt the slightest rejection,

185
0:07:23.48,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I would just run as fast as I could.

186
0:07:25.64,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And you know what?

187
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The next day, no matter what happens,

188
0:07:28.76,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I'm not going to run.

189
0:07:30.28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I'll stay engaged.

190
0:07:32.08,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Day Two: Request a "burger refill."

191
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

192
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's when I went to a burger joint,

193
0:07:38.48,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I finished lunch, and I went to the cashier and said,

194
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"Hi, can I get a burger refill?"

195
0:07:42.6,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

196
0:07:44.8,000 --> 0:07:46,000
He was all confused, like, "What's a burger refill?"

197
0:07:47.28,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

198
0:07:48.56,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I said, "Well, it's just like a drink refill but with a burger."

199
0:07:52.24,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And he said, "Sorry, we don't do burger refill, man."

200
0:07:54.76,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

201
0:07:56.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
So this is where rejection happened and I could have run, but I stayed.

202
0:08:00.2,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I said, "Well, I love your burgers,

203
0:08:02.36,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I love your joint,

204
0:08:03.8,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and if you guys do a burger refill,

205
0:08:05.92,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I will love you guys more."

206
0:08:07.28,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

207
0:08:08.56,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And he said, "Well, OK, I'll tell my manager about it,

208
0:08:11.2,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and maybe we'll do it, but sorry, we can't do this today."

209
0:08:14.2,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Then I left.

210
0:08:15.64,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And by the way,

211
0:08:17.52,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I don't think they've ever done burger refill.

212
0:08:19.8,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

213
0:08:21.04,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I think they're still there.

214
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But the life and death feeling I was feeling the first time

215
0:08:26.48,000 --> 0:08:27,000
was no longer there,

216
0:08:27.84,000 --> 0:08:28,000
just because I stayed engaged --

217
0:08:29.6,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because I didn't run.

218
0:08:31.24,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I said, "Wow, great, I'm already learning things.

219
0:08:34.52,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Great."

220
0:08:35.76,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And then Day Three: Getting Olympic Doughnuts.

221
0:08:38.76,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is where my life was turned upside down.

222
0:08:42.12,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I went to a Krispy Kreme.

223
0:08:43.76,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's a doughnut shop

224
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
in mainly the Southeastern part of the United States.

225
0:08:47.64,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I'm sure they have some here, too.

226
0:08:49.52,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And I went in,

227
0:08:50.799,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I said, "Can you make me doughnuts that look like Olympic symbols?

228
0:08:53.96,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Basically, you interlink five doughnuts together ... "

229
0:08:56.88,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I mean there's no way they could say yes, right?

230
0:08:59.64,000 --> 0:09:01,000
The doughnut maker took me so seriously.

231
0:09:02.04,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

232
0:09:03.28,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So she put out paper,

233
0:09:04.52,000 --> 0:09:06,000
started jotting down the colors and the rings,

234
0:09:06.72,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and is like, "How can I make this?"

235
0:09:08.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And then 15 minutes later,

236
0:09:10.68,000 --> 0:09:13,000
she came out with a box that looked like Olympic rings.

237
0:09:14.12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And I was so touched.

238
0:09:15.8,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I just couldn't believe it.

239
0:09:17.96,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And that video got over five million views on Youtube.

240
0:09:22.44,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The world couldn't believe that either.

241
0:09:24.56,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

242
0:09:27.44,000 --> 0:09:3,000
You know, because of that I was in newspapers,

243
0:09:30.68,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in talk shows, in everything.

244
0:09:32.12,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And I became famous.

245
0:09:33.64,000 --> 0:09:35,000
A lot of people started writing emails to me

246
0:09:35.8,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and saying, "What you're doing is awesome."

247
0:09:38.36,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But you know, fame and notoriety did not do anything to me.

248
0:09:41.92,000 --> 0:09:42,000
What I really wanted to do was learn,

249
0:09:43.76,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and to change myself.

250
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So I turned the rest of my 100 days of rejection

251
0:09:47.64,000 --> 0:09:48,000
into this playground --

252
0:09:49.56,000 --> 0:09:51,000
into this research project.

253
0:09:51.72,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I wanted to see what I could learn.

254
0:09:54.24,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And then I learned a lot of things.

255
0:09:56.04,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I discovered so many secrets.

256
0:09:57.64,000 --> 0:09:59,000
For example, I found if I just don't run,

257
0:10:00.56,000 --> 0:10:01,000
if I got rejected,

258
0:10:01.84,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I could actually turn a "no" into a "yes,"

259
0:10:03.92,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the magic word is, "why."

260
0:10:05.56,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So one day I went to a stranger's house, I had this flower in my hand,

261
0:10:09.68,000 --> 0:10:1,000
knocked on the door and said,

262
0:10:11.12,000 --> 0:10:13,000
"Hey, can I plant this flower in your backyard?"

263
0:10:13.4,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

264
0:10:14.96,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And he said, "No."

265
0:10:17.64,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But before he could leave I said,

266
0:10:19.4,000 --> 0:10:2,000
"Hey, can I know why?"

267
0:10:21.36,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And he said, "Well, I have this dog

268
0:10:24.44,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that would dig up anything I put in the backyard.

269
0:10:26.8,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I don't want to waste your flower.

270
0:10:28.48,000 --> 0:10:31,000
If you want to do this, go across the street and talk to Connie.

271
0:10:31.68,000 --> 0:10:32,000
She loves flowers."

272
0:10:32.92,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So that's what I did.

273
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I went across and knocked on Connie's door.

274
0:10:36.24,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And she was so happy to see me.

275
0:10:38.12,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

276
0:10:39.84,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And then half an hour later,

277
0:10:41.24,000 --> 0:10:43,000
there was this flower in Connie's backyard.

278
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I'm sure it looks better now.

279
0:10:44.76,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

280
0:10:46.08,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But had I left after the initial rejection,

281
0:10:49.04,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I would've thought,

282
0:10:50.28,000 --> 0:10:52,000
well, it's because the guy didn't trust me,

283
0:10:52.36,000 --> 0:10:53,000
it's because I was crazy,

284
0:10:53.6,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because I didn't dress up well, I didn't look good.

285
0:10:56.04,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It was none of those.

286
0:10:57.28,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It was because what I offered did not fit what he wanted.

287
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And he trusted me enough to offer me a referral,

288
0:11:02.28,000 --> 0:11:03,000
using a sales term.

289
0:11:03.96,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I converted a referral.

290
0:11:06.56,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Then one day --

291
0:11:07.8,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and I also learned that I can actually say certain things

292
0:11:10.72,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and maximize my chance to get a yes.

293
0:11:12.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So for example, one day I went to a Starbucks,

294
0:11:14.92,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and asked the manager, "Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?"

295
0:11:18.52,000 --> 0:11:2,000
He was like, "What's a Starbucks greeter?"

296
0:11:20.92,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I said, "Do you know those Walmart greeters?

297
0:11:23.04,000 --> 0:11:26,000
You know, those people who say 'hi' to you before you walk in the store,

298
0:11:26.48,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and make sure you don't steal stuff, basically?

299
0:11:28.72,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I want to give a Walmart experience to Starbucks customers."

300
0:11:31.88,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Laughter)

301
0:11:33.36,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Well, I'm not sure that's a good thing, actually --

302
0:11:37.6,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Actually, I'm pretty sure it's a bad thing.

303
0:11:40.12,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And he was like, "Oh" --

304
0:11:42.2,000 --> 0:11:44,000
yeah, this is how he looked, his name is Eric --

305
0:11:44.48,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and he was like, "I'm not sure."

306
0:11:46.08,000 --> 0:11:48,000
This is how he was hearing me. "Not sure."

307
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Then I ask him, "Is that weird?"

308
0:11:49.84,000 --> 0:11:51,000
He's like, "Yeah, it's really weird, man."

309
0:11:52.8,000 --> 0:11:54,000
But as soon as he said that, his whole demeanor changed.

310
0:11:55.68,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's as if he's putting all the doubt on the floor.

311
0:11:58.64,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And he said, "Yeah, you can do this,

312
0:12:00.4,000 --> 0:12:01,000
just don't get too weird."

313
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Laughter)

314
0:12:03.12,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So for the next hour I was the Starbucks greeter.

315
0:12:05.52,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I said "hi" to every customer that walked in,

316
0:12:07.68,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and gave them holiday cheers.

317
0:12:10.08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
By the way, I don't know what your career trajectory is,

318
0:12:12.76,000 --> 0:12:13,000
don't be a greeter.

319
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Laughter)

320
0:12:15.24,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It was really boring.

321
0:12:17.2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But then I found I could do this because I mentioned, "Is that weird?"

322
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I mentioned the doubt that he was having.

323
0:12:24.32,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And because I mentioned, "Is that weird?", that means I wasn't weird.

324
0:12:27.88,000 --> 0:12:29,000
That means I was actually thinking just like him,

325
0:12:30.44,000 --> 0:12:32,000
seeing this as a weird thing.

326
0:12:32.84,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And again, and again,

327
0:12:34.12,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I learned that if I mention some doubt people might have

328
0:12:37.28,000 --> 0:12:38,000
before I ask the question,

329
0:12:39.12,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I gained their trust.

330
0:12:40.4,000 --> 0:12:41,000
People were more likely to say yes to me.

331
0:12:42.8,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And then I learned I could fulfill my life dream ...

332
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
by asking.

333
0:12:47.6,000 --> 0:12:5,000
You know, I came from four generations of teachers,

334
0:12:50.72,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and my grandma has always told me,

335
0:12:53.56,000 --> 0:12:55,000
"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want,

336
0:12:55.88,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but it'd be great if you became a teacher."

337
0:12:57.96,000 --> 0:12:58,000
(Laughter)

338
0:12:59.4,000 --> 0:13:01,000
But I wanted to be an entrepreneur, so I didn't.

339
0:13:01.68,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But it has always been my dream to actually teach something.

340
0:13:05.08,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So I said, "What if I just ask

341
0:13:06.92,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and teach a college class?"

342
0:13:09.56,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I lived in Austin at the time,

343
0:13:11.04,000 --> 0:13:13,000
so I went to University of Texas at Austin

344
0:13:13.12,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and knocked on professors' doors and said, "Can I teach your class?"

345
0:13:16.36,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I didn't get anywhere the first couple of times.

346
0:13:18.88,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But because I didn't run -- I kept doing it --

347
0:13:21.4,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and on the third try the professor was very impressed.

348
0:13:24.76,000 --> 0:13:26,000
He was like, "No one has done this before."

349
0:13:26.84,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And I came in prepared with powerpoints and my lesson.

350
0:13:30.88,000 --> 0:13:32,000
He said, "Wow, I can use this.

351
0:13:32.96,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Why don't you come back in two months? I'll fit you in my curriculum."

352
0:13:36.32,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And two months later I was teaching a class.

353
0:13:38.44,000 --> 0:13:41,000
This is me -- you probably can't see, this is a bad picture.

354
0:13:41.72,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You know, sometimes you get rejected by lighting, you know?

355
0:13:44.52,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Laughter)

356
0:13:46.68,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But wow --

357
0:13:47.92,000 --> 0:13:49,000
when I finished teaching that class, I walked out crying,

358
0:13:50.68,000 --> 0:13:51,000
because I thought

359
0:13:52.48,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I could fulfill my life dream just by simply asking.

360
0:13:55.8,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I used to think I have to accomplish all these things --

361
0:13:58.48,000 --> 0:14:01,000
have to be a great entrepreneur, or get a PhD to teach --

362
0:14:02.12,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but no, I just asked,

363
0:14:03.68,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and I could teach.

364
0:14:05.4,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And in that picture, which you can't see,

365
0:14:07.8,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr.

366
0:14:11.12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Why? Because in my research I found that people who really change the world,

367
0:14:15.68,000 --> 0:14:17,000
who change the way we live and the way we think,

368
0:14:18.64,000 --> 0:14:22,000
are the people who were met with initial and often violent rejections.

369
0:14:22.76,000 --> 0:14:24,000
People like Martin Luther King, Jr.,

370
0:14:24.84,000 --> 0:14:26,000
like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela,

371
0:14:26.92,000 --> 0:14:27,000
or even Jesus Christ.

372
0:14:28.48,000 --> 0:14:31,000
These people did not let rejection define them.

373
0:14:31.88,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They let their own reaction after rejection define themselves.

374
0:14:36.92,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And they embraced rejection.

375
0:14:39.36,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And we don't have to be those people to learn about rejection,

376
0:14:42.6,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and in my case,

377
0:14:43.88,000 --> 0:14:45,000
rejection was my curse,

378
0:14:45.92,000 --> 0:14:46,000
was my boogeyman.

379
0:14:47.2,000 --> 0:14:51,000
It has bothered me my whole life because I was running away from it.

380
0:14:51.4,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Then I started embracing it.

381
0:14:53.8,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I turned that into the biggest gift in my life.

382
0:14:57.32,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I started teaching people how to turn rejections into opportunities.

383
0:15:01.8,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I use my blog, I use my talk,

384
0:15:03.84,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I use the book I just published,

385
0:15:05.76,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and I'm even building technology to help people overcome their fear of rejection.

386
0:15:12.2,000 --> 0:15:13,000
When you get rejected in life,

387
0:15:13.96,000 --> 0:15:15,000
when you are facing the next obstacle

388
0:15:16.2,000 --> 0:15:18,000
or next failure,

389
0:15:18.24,000 --> 0:15:19,000
consider the possibilities.

390
0:15:20.08,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Don't run.

391
0:15:21.32,000 --> 0:15:22,000
If you just embrace them,

392
0:15:22.56,000 --> 0:15:24,000
they might become your gifts as well.

393
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Thank you.

394
0:15:26.4,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Applause)

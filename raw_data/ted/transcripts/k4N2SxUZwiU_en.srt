1
0:00:13.023,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As a boy in Lima,

2
0:00:14.69,000 --> 0:00:16,000
my grandfather told me a legend

3
0:00:16.825,000 --> 0:00:18,000
of the Spanish conquest of Peru.

4
0:00:20.007,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Atahualpa, emperor of the Inca, had been captured and killed.

5
0:00:23.57,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Pizarro and his conquistadors had grown rich,

6
0:00:26.577,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and tales of their conquest and glory had reached Spain

7
0:00:29.787,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and was bringing new waves of Spaniards, hungry for gold and glory.

8
0:00:36.055,000 --> 0:00:38,000
They would go into towns and ask the Inca,

9
0:00:38.977,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Where's another civilization we can conquer? Where's more gold?"

10
0:00:42.776,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And the Inca, out of vengeance, told them,

11
0:00:46.648,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Go to the Amazon.

12
0:00:48.767,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You'll find all the gold you want there.

13
0:00:51.437,000 --> 0:00:55,000
In fact, there is a city called Paititi -- El Dorado in Spanish --

14
0:00:56.175,000 --> 0:00:58,000
made entirely of gold."

15
0:00:59.303,000 --> 0:01:,000
The Spanish set off into the jungle,

16
0:01:01.223,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but the few that return come back with stories,

17
0:01:05.904,000 --> 0:01:08,000
stories of powerful shamans,

18
0:01:09.735,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of warriors with poisoned arrows,

19
0:01:12.663,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of trees so tall they blotted out the sun,

20
0:01:16.465,000 --> 0:01:2,000
spiders that ate birds, snakes that swallowed men whole

21
0:01:21.241,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and a river that boiled.

22
0:01:25.795,000 --> 0:01:26,000
All this became a childhood memory.

23
0:01:27.803,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And years passed.

24
0:01:28.986,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'm working on my PhD at SMU,

25
0:01:31.485,000 --> 0:01:34,000
trying to understand Peru's geothermal energy potential,

26
0:01:35.413,000 --> 0:01:37,000
when I remember this legend,

27
0:01:37.483,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and I began asking that question.

28
0:01:40.316,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Could the boiling river exist?

29
0:01:44.14,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I asked colleagues from universities,

30
0:01:46.363,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the government,

31
0:01:47.544,000 --> 0:01:48,000
oil, gas and mining companies,

32
0:01:49.061,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and the answer was a unanimous no.

33
0:01:52.459,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And this makes sense.

34
0:01:55.07,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You see, boiling rivers do exist in the world,

35
0:01:57.722,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but they're generally associated with volcanoes.

36
0:02:00.649,000 --> 0:02:02,000
You need a powerful heat source

37
0:02:02.82,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to produce such a large geothermal manifestation.

38
0:02:06.21,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And as you can see from the red dots here, which are volcanoes,

39
0:02:11.438,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we don't have volcanoes in the Amazon,

40
0:02:14.28,000 --> 0:02:15,000
nor in most of Peru.

41
0:02:16.122,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So it follows: We should not expect to see a boiling river.

42
0:02:21.66,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Telling this same story at a family dinner,

43
0:02:25.772,000 --> 0:02:27,000
my aunt tells me,

44
0:02:28.266,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"But no, Andrés, I've been there. I've swum in that river."

45
0:02:32.898,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:36.559,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Then my uncle jumps in.

47
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"No, Andrés, she's not kidding.

48
0:02:41.084,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You see, you can only swim in it after a very heavy rain,

49
0:02:45.091,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and it's protected by a powerful shaman.

50
0:02:48.361,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Your aunt, she's friends with his wife."

51
0:02:51.257,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:53.086,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"¿Cómo?" ["Huh?"]

53
0:02:54.261,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You know, despite all my scientific skepticism,

54
0:02:56.499,000 --> 0:03:,000
I found myself hiking into the jungle, guided by my aunt,

55
0:03:00.955,000 --> 0:03:03,000
over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center,

56
0:03:04.876,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and well, honestly, mentally preparing myself

57
0:03:08.518,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to behold the legendary "warm stream of the Amazon."

58
0:03:14.671,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But then ...

59
0:03:16.316,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I heard something,

60
0:03:19.255,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a low surge

61
0:03:22.347,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that got louder and louder

62
0:03:25.792,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as we came closer.

63
0:03:28.3,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It sounded like ocean waves constantly crashing,

64
0:03:32.252,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and as we got closer, I saw smoke, vapor, coming up through the trees.

65
0:03:36.961,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And then, I saw this.

66
0:03:41.791,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I immediately grabbed for my thermometer,

67
0:03:44.284,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the average temperatures in the river

68
0:03:47.585,000 --> 0:03:48,000
were 86 degrees C.

69
0:03:51.54,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is not quite the 100-degree C boiling

70
0:03:54.831,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but definitely close enough.

71
0:03:58.296,000 --> 0:04:01,000
The river flowed hot and fast.

72
0:04:02.181,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I followed it upriver and was led by, actually, the shaman's apprentice

73
0:04:05.853,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to the most sacred site on the river.

74
0:04:07.661,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And this is what's bizarre --

75
0:04:09.091,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It starts off as a cold stream.

76
0:04:11.502,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And here, at this site,

77
0:04:13.763,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is the home of the Yacumama,

78
0:04:15.954,000 --> 0:04:18,000
mother of the waters, a giant serpent spirit

79
0:04:19.321,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who births hot and cold water.

80
0:04:22.015,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And here we find a hot spring,

81
0:04:26.451,000 --> 0:04:31,000
mixing with cold stream water underneath her protective motherly jaws

82
0:04:31.833,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and thus bringing their legends to life.

83
0:04:36.283,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The next morning, I woke up and --

84
0:04:38.285,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:40.528,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I asked for tea.

86
0:04:42.583,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was handed a mug, a tea bag

87
0:04:44.847,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and, well, pointed towards the river.

88
0:04:48.075,000 --> 0:04:52,000
To my surprise, the water was clean and had a pleasant taste,

89
0:04:52.608,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which is a little weird for geothermal systems.

90
0:04:56.441,000 --> 0:04:57,000
What was amazing

91
0:04:58.013,000 --> 0:05:,000
is that the locals had always known about this place,

92
0:05:01.021,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and that I was by no means the first outsider to see it.

93
0:05:05.701,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It was just part of their everyday life.

94
0:05:09.115,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They drink its water.

95
0:05:11.833,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They take in its vapor.

96
0:05:14.412,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They cook with it,

97
0:05:16.127,000 --> 0:05:17,000
clean with it,

98
0:05:17.661,000 --> 0:05:18,000
even make their medicines with it.

99
0:05:21.094,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I met the shaman,

100
0:05:22.864,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and he seemed like an extension of the river and his jungle.

101
0:05:27.848,000 --> 0:05:28,000
He asked for my intentions

102
0:05:30.609,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and listened carefully.

103
0:05:33.262,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Then, to my tremendous relief --

104
0:05:36.397,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I was freaking out, to be honest with you --

105
0:05:39.968,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a smile began to snake across his face, and he just laughed.

106
0:05:44.271,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:47.796,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I had received the shaman's blessing to study the river,

108
0:05:52.415,000 --> 0:05:55,000
on the condition that after I take the water samples

109
0:05:55.843,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and analyze them in my lab,

110
0:05:57.383,000 --> 0:05:58,000
wherever I was in the world,

111
0:06:00.265,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that I pour the waters back into the ground

112
0:06:04.055,000 --> 0:06:06,000
so that, as the shaman said,

113
0:06:06.126,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the waters could find their way back home.

114
0:06:11.272,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I've been back every year since that first visit in 2011,

115
0:06:14.883,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and the fieldwork has been exhilarating,

116
0:06:18.332,000 --> 0:06:21,000
demanding and at times dangerous.

117
0:06:22.913,000 --> 0:06:25,000
One story was even featured in National Geographic Magazine.

118
0:06:26.152,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I was trapped on a small rock about the size of a sheet of paper

119
0:06:30.263,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in sandals and board shorts,

120
0:06:32.327,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in between an 80 degree C river

121
0:06:34.757,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and a hot spring that, well, looked like this, close to boiling.

122
0:06:39.07,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And on top of that, it was Amazon rain forest.

123
0:06:43.206,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Pshh, pouring rain, couldn't see a thing.

124
0:06:45.736,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The temperature differential made it all white. It was a whiteout.

125
0:06:50.956,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Intense.

126
0:06:54.158,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, after years of work,

127
0:06:56.62,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication.

128
0:07:03.047,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I'd like to share, today, with all of you here, on the TED stage,

129
0:07:07.046,000 --> 0:07:1,000
for the first time, some of these discoveries.

130
0:07:11.34,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Well, first off, it's not a legend.

131
0:07:14.468,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Surprise!

132
0:07:15.666,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:18.015,000 --> 0:07:2,000
When I first started the research,

134
0:07:20.553,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the satellite imagery was too low-resolution to be meaningful.

135
0:07:23.556,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There were just no good maps.

136
0:07:25.754,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Thanks to the support of the Google Earth team,

137
0:07:28.169,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I now have this.

138
0:07:31.251,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Not only that, the indigenous name of the river, Shanay-timpishka,

139
0:07:37.538,000 --> 0:07:39,000
"boiled with the heat of the sun,"

140
0:07:41.54,000 --> 0:07:46,000
indicating that I'm not the first to wonder why the river boils,

141
0:07:46.943,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and showing that humanity has always sought to explain

142
0:07:50.194,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the world around us.

143
0:07:53.526,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So why does the river boil?

144
0:07:55.948,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Bubbling sounds)

145
0:08:00.385,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It actually took me three years to get that footage.

146
0:08:04.879,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Fault-fed hot springs.

147
0:08:07.625,000 --> 0:08:1,000
As we have hot blood running through our veins and arteries,

148
0:08:11.282,000 --> 0:08:16,000
so, too, the earth has hot water running through its cracks and faults.

149
0:08:17.162,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Where these arteries come to the surface, these earth arteries,

150
0:08:20.781,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we'll get geothermal manifestations:

151
0:08:23.179,000 --> 0:08:27,000
fumaroles, hot springs and in our case, the boiling river.

152
0:08:28.459,000 --> 0:08:32,000
What's truly incredible, though, is the scale of this place.

153
0:08:33.221,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Next time you cross the road, think about this.

154
0:08:36.527,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The river flows wider than a two-lane road

155
0:08:39.223,000 --> 0:08:4,000
along most of its path.

156
0:08:41.674,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It flows hot for 6.24 kilometers.

157
0:08:48.223,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Truly impressive.

158
0:08:51.077,000 --> 0:08:54,000
There are thermal pools larger than this TED stage,

159
0:08:54.101,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and that waterfall that you see there

160
0:08:56.601,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is six meters tall --

161
0:08:59.384,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and all with near-boiling water.

162
0:09:04.243,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We mapped the temperatures along the river,

163
0:09:06.323,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and this was by far the most demanding part of the fieldwork.

164
0:09:09.866,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the results were just awesome.

165
0:09:13.577,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Sorry -- the geoscientist in me coming out.

166
0:09:16.754,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And it showed this amazing trend.

167
0:09:19.204,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You see, the river starts off cold.

168
0:09:21.444,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It then heats up, cools back down, heats up, cools back down,

169
0:09:24.463,000 --> 0:09:26,000
heats up again, and then has this beautiful decay curve

170
0:09:27.105,000 --> 0:09:29,000
until it smashes into this cold river.

171
0:09:30.539,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Now, I understand not all of you are geothermal scientists,

172
0:09:33.357,000 --> 0:09:35,000
so to put it in more everyday terms:

173
0:09:36.225,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Everyone loves coffee.

174
0:09:38.382,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Yes? Good.

175
0:09:40.517,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Your regular cup of coffee, 54 degrees C,

176
0:09:44.224,000 --> 0:09:46,000
an extra-hot one, well, 60.

177
0:09:46.896,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So, put in coffee shop terms,

178
0:09:49.091,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the boiling river plots like this.

179
0:09:52.401,000 --> 0:09:53,000
There you have your hot coffee.

180
0:09:54.906,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Here you have your extra-hot coffee,

181
0:09:56.654,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and you can see that there's a bit point there

182
0:09:58.852,000 --> 0:10:,000
where the river is still hotter than even the extra-hot coffee.

183
0:10:01.864,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And these are average water temperatures.

184
0:10:03.88,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We took these in the dry season to ensure the purest geothermal temperatures.

185
0:10:08.603,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But there's a magic number here that's not being shown,

186
0:10:11.247,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and that number is 47 degrees C,

187
0:10:14.856,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because that's where things start to hurt,

188
0:10:17.402,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and I know this from very personal experience.

189
0:10:22.186,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Above that temperature, you don't want to get in that water.

190
0:10:25.036,000 --> 0:10:26,000
You need to be careful.

191
0:10:26.722,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It can be deadly.

192
0:10:28.704,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I've seen all sorts of animals fall in,

193
0:10:31.019,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and what's shocking to me, is the process is pretty much the same.

194
0:10:35.898,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So they fall in and the first thing to go are the eyes.

195
0:10:38.603,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Eyes, apparently, cook very quickly. They turn this milky-white color.

196
0:10:41.994,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The stream is carrying them.

197
0:10:43.368,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They're trying to swim out, but their meat is cooking on the bone

198
0:10:46.455,000 --> 0:10:47,000
because it's so hot.

199
0:10:47.645,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So they're losing power, losing power,

200
0:10:49.514,000 --> 0:10:52,000
until finally they get to a point where hot water goes into their mouths

201
0:10:52.928,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and they cook from the inside out.

202
0:10:55.44,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

203
0:11:00.696,000 --> 0:11:02,000
A bit sadistic, aren't we?

204
0:11:02.839,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Jeez.

205
0:11:05.362,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Leave them marinating for a little longer.

206
0:11:09.468,000 --> 0:11:11,000
What's, again, amazing are these temperatures.

207
0:11:12.22,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They're similar to things that I've seen on volcanoes all over the world

208
0:11:15.722,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and even super-volcanoes like Yellowstone.

209
0:11:18.896,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But here's the thing:

210
0:11:22.173,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the data is showing that the boiling river exists

211
0:11:27.196,000 --> 0:11:29,000
independent of volcanism.

212
0:11:30.491,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It's neither magmatic or volcanic in origin,

213
0:11:35.722,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and again, over 700 kilometers away from the nearest volcanic center.

214
0:11:42.543,000 --> 0:11:46,000
How can a boiling river exist like this?

215
0:11:47.79,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I've asked geothermal experts and volcanologists for years,

216
0:11:50.97,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and I'm still unable to find another non-volcanic geothermal system

217
0:11:55.811,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of this magnitude.

218
0:11:59.121,000 --> 0:12:,000
It's unique.

219
0:12:01.489,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It's special on a global scale.

220
0:12:06.708,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So, still -- how does it work?

221
0:12:10.46,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Where do we get this heat?

222
0:12:13.186,000 --> 0:12:15,000
There's still more research to be done

223
0:12:15.303,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to better constrain the problem and better understand the system,

224
0:12:18.516,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but from what the data is telling us now,

225
0:12:20.866,000 --> 0:12:23,000
it looks to be the result of a large hydrothermal system.

226
0:12:25.151,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Basically, it works like this:

227
0:12:26.635,000 --> 0:12:29,000
So, the deeper you go into the earth, the hotter it gets.

228
0:12:29.967,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We refer to this as the geothermal gradient.

229
0:12:33.46,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The waters could be coming from as far away as glaciers in the Andes,

230
0:12:38.412,000 --> 0:12:39,000
then seeping down deep into the earth

231
0:12:40.435,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and coming out to form the boiling river

232
0:12:43.226,000 --> 0:12:46,000
after getting heated up from the geothermal gradient,

233
0:12:47.311,000 --> 0:12:49,000
all due to this unique geologic setting.

234
0:12:50.587,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now, we found that in and around the river --

235
0:12:53.458,000 --> 0:12:54,000
this is working with colleagues

236
0:12:54.975,000 --> 0:12:56,000
from National Geographic, Dr. Spencer Wells,

237
0:12:57.086,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and Dr. Jon Eisen from UC Davis --

238
0:12:59.82,000 --> 0:13:02,000
we genetically sequenced the extremophile lifeforms

239
0:13:03.106,000 --> 0:13:07,000
living in and around the river, and have found new lifeforms,

240
0:13:07.734,000 --> 0:13:1,000
unique species living in the boiling river.

241
0:13:12.264,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But again, despite all of these studies, all of these discoveries and the legends,

242
0:13:18.499,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a question remains:

243
0:13:21.704,000 --> 0:13:23,000
What is the significance of the boiling river?

244
0:13:26.601,000 --> 0:13:3,000
What is the significance of this stationary cloud

245
0:13:31.271,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that always hovers over this patch of jungle?

246
0:13:35.333,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And what is the significance

247
0:13:38.007,000 --> 0:13:4,000
of a detail in a childhood legend?

248
0:13:43.547,000 --> 0:13:46,000
To the shaman and his community, it's a sacred site.

249
0:13:47.414,000 --> 0:13:49,000
To me, as a geoscientist,

250
0:13:49.783,000 --> 0:13:51,000
it's a unique geothermal phenomenon.

251
0:13:54.074,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But to the illegal loggers and cattle farmers,

252
0:13:57.796,000 --> 0:14:,000
it's just another resource to exploit.

253
0:14:02.82,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And to the Peruvian government, it's just another stretch

254
0:14:06.631,000 --> 0:14:11,000
of unprotected land ready for development.

255
0:14:14.186,000 --> 0:14:17,000
My goal is to ensure that whoever controls this land

256
0:14:17.806,000 --> 0:14:21,000
understands the boiling river's uniqueness and significance.

257
0:14:22.892,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Because that's the question,

258
0:14:25.853,000 --> 0:14:26,000
one of significance.

259
0:14:28.568,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And the thing there is,

260
0:14:32.11,000 --> 0:14:34,000
we define significance.

261
0:14:34.998,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It's us. We have that power.

262
0:14:37.682,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We are the ones who draw that line

263
0:14:40.434,000 --> 0:14:42,000
between the sacred and the trivial.

264
0:14:43.736,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And in this age,

265
0:14:46.036,000 --> 0:14:49,000
where everything seems mapped, measured and studied,

266
0:14:51.29,000 --> 0:14:53,000
in this age of information,

267
0:14:54.899,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I remind you all that discoveries are not just made

268
0:14:58.495,000 --> 0:15:02,000
in the black void of the unknown

269
0:15:04.153,000 --> 0:15:07,000
but in the white noise of overwhelming data.

270
0:15:09.862,000 --> 0:15:11,000
There remains so much to explore.

271
0:15:13.958,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We live in an incredible world.

272
0:15:17.477,000 --> 0:15:18,000
So go out.

273
0:15:20.306,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Be curious.

274
0:15:23.711,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Because we do live in a world

275
0:15:27.539,000 --> 0:15:3,000
where shamans still sing to the spirits of the jungle,

276
0:15:32.399,000 --> 0:15:33,000
where rivers do boil

277
0:15:35.299,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and where legends do come to life.

278
0:15:39.018,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Thank you very much.

279
0:15:40.223,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Applause)

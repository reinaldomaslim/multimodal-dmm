1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In October 2010,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Icons like Batman,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Superman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
will be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Jami and their colleagues.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's a story of intercultural intersections,

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and what better group

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to have this conversation

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
than those that grew out of fighting fascism

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in their respective histories and geographies?

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
an unlikely reaction came out of North America.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
As Christian iconography got changed,

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and swastikas were created out of crucifixes,

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
in the United States and Canada,

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
also going back to the Bible.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Consider this:

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
like the prophets, all the superheroes

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
are missing parents.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Superman's parents die on Krypton

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
before the age of one.

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Spiderman is raised

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
by his aunt and uncle.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
from God through Gabriel,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
get their message from above.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
when the spider descends from above

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and gives him his message through a bite.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
when a big bat flies over his head,

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Superman is not only sent to Earth

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
from the heavens, or Krypton,

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
saying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son."

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Applause)

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
These are clearly biblical archetypes,

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and the thinking behind that was to create

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
positive, globally-resonating storylines

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that could be tied to the same things

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that other people were pulling mean messages out of

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
just becomes a bad man with a bad message.

52
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And it's only by linking positive things

53
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that the negative can be delinked.

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This is the kind of thinking that went into

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
creating The 99.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It doesn't matter what your religion is;

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
"Make sure you lie three times a day."

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Those are basic human values.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And so the backstory of The 99

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
takes place in 1258,

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
All the books from Bait al-Hikma library,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and the Tigris changes color with ink.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's a story passed on generation after generation.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I rewrote that story,

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen --

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and here's a side note:

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So the librarians find out

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water,

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that when mixed with 99 stones

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But the Mongols get there first.

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that we all think is lost to civilization.

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
of 33 stones each

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But in 1492, two important things happen.

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The first is the fall of Granada,

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the last Muslim enclave in Europe.

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So 33 of the stones are smuggled

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
onto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and are spread in the New World.

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
from 99 different countries.

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now it's very easy to assume

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library,

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
his name was al-Ma'mun -- he was Harun al-Rashid's son.

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
He had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,

106
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I will pay them its weight in gold."

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
After a while, his advisers complained.

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold."

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is worth a lot more than what we're paying them."

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is not new to my neck of the desert.

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The concept centers on something called the Noor stones.

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Noor is Arabic for light.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Number two, all of The 99,

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
they use it for self-interest.

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,

123
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
you get taken advantage of

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
by people who will exploit your powers, okay.

125
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them

126
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
a mechanism that self-updates.

127
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Some believe that means that the original interpretation

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.

131
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I don't belong there.

132
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,

133
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.

134
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now the main bad guy, Rughal,

135
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
does not want these stones to update,

136
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so he's trying to get them to stop updating.

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
He can't use the stones, but he can stop them.

138
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,

139
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
where he gets some of The 99 to work for him --

140
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms

141
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.

142
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And he controls them from the top down --

143
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
whereas when they work for the other side, eventually,

144
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
they actually, each one has a different, colorful

146
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
kind of dress.

147
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So The 99 work in teams of three.

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Why three? A couple of reasons.

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Number one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
because the third person is temptation or the devil, right?

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I think that's there in all cultures, right?

153
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
There's this very strong social message

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that needs to get to kind of

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the deepest crevices of intolerance,

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And so this is the way I dealt with it.

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
three boys, three girls, no problem.

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.

163
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Well ...

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope

165
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
so you -- (Laughter)

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.

168
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So here's some of the characters that we have.

169
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
She's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,

171
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but when she first gets her power,

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
she starts going on game shows and making money.

173
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.

174
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.

175
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;

176
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
there's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,

177
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and there's also the kind, the generous.

178
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
He's the technology wiz.

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Musawwira from Ghana,

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Al-Batina is the hidden.

187
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.

188
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you."

189
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.

190
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And she said, "Show me." So I showed this.

191
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
She said, "That's not me."

192
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes."

193
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

194
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
So I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production.

195
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.

196
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So from day one, the people involved in the project,

197
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
bottom left is Fabian Nicieza,

198
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
writer for X-Men and Power Rangers.

199
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Next to him is Dan Panosian,

200
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.

201
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.

202
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Next to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.

203
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we entered Western consciousness

204
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,"

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
back in 2005.

206
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,

207
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.

208
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Didn't have a product, but had energy.

209
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And I found somebody from The New York Times,

210
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I cornered him, and I pitched him.

211
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I think I scared him -- (Laughter)

212
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because he basically promised me --

213
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
we had no product -- but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section

214
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
if you'll just go away."

215
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
(Laughter)

216
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.

217
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year."

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
He said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations."

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Like I care, right?

220
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"So when's the article coming out?"

221
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?

222
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
That's not timely.

223
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out."

224
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So a few days after that, what happens?

225
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I became timely.

227
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

228
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.

229
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Next thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
January 22nd, 2006,

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
which changed our lives forever,

232
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,

233
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
guess what they got; they got me.

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And The 99 were like superheroes

235
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
kind of flying out of what was happening around the world.

236
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And that led to all kinds of things,

237
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
from being in curricula in universities and schools to --

238
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,

239
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it was a couple of men with long beards

240
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school.

241
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
The good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,

242
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and they found me to sign the picture.

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

245
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We've been able to license The 99 comic books

246
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
into eight languages so far --

247
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Chinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.

248
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago

249
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
called The 99 Village Theme Park --

250
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:

251
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey.

252
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing,

253
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is that we've done a 26-episode animated series,

254
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
which is done for global audiences:

255
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.

256
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.

259
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,

260
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
there is a struggle.

261
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Two of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,

262
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and Noora, the one that can use light,

263
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform

264
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
because they're being manipulated.

265
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They don't know, OK,

266
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.

267
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So there's a struggle within the team.

268
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So if we can get the lights ...

269
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
["The 99"]

270
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Jabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold.

271
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I need more light.

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
What's happening?

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Dana: There's too much darkness.

274
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Rughal: There must be something we can do.

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Man: I won't send any more commandos in

276
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
until I know it's safe.

277
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos.

278
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Miklos: Must download file contents.

279
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I can't forget auntie.

280
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you.

281
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Dana: But I can't help.

282
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Jabbar: You can,

283
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
even if you don't believe in yourself right now.

284
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I believe in you.

285
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You are Noora the Light.

286
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Dana: No.

287
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.

288
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Jabbar: Then what about the rest of us?

289
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?

290
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Now, tell me which way to go.

291
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Dana: That way.

292
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Alarm: Threat imminent.

293
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Jabbar: Aaaahhh!

294
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Miklos: Stay away from me.

295
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Jabbar: We're here to help you.

296
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Dr. Razem: Don't listen to them.

297
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Dana: Miklos, that man is not your friend.

298
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Miklos: No. He gave me access,

299
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear].

300
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
["The 99"]

301
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

302
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

303
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment;

304
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
it's design.

305
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But that's only half the story.

306
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
As the father of five sons,

307
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I worry about who they're going to be using as role models.

308
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I worry because all around me, even within my extended family,

309
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I see religion being manipulated.

310
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
As a psychologist, I worry

311
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
for the world in general,

312
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
but worry about the perception of how people see themselves

313
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
in my part of the world.

314
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.

315
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program,

316
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and I heard one too many stories of people growing up

317
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to idolize their leadership,

318
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
only to end up being tortured by their heroes.

319
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,

320
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that just breaks you in so many ways.

321
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I left Bellevue, went to business school and started this.

322
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Now, one of the things that I refer to

323
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
when I -- about the importance of this message --

324
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,

325
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,

326
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times

327
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and one from New York magazine.

328
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts.

329
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God,

330
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.

331
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Any boys and girls caught flirting

332
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
would get married off immediately, okay.

333
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The second one was about a woman complaining

334
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up

335
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and started interrogating her on the spot

336
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
for talking to a man who wasn't related to her.

337
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.

338
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.

339
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The second one, they were actually split

340
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
between Saudi and Afghanistan.

341
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India,

342
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
it was the party of a Hindu God.

343
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The second one took place in upstate New York.

344
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It was an Orthodox Jewish community.

345
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming

346
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is that in those two interviews,

347
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
the people around, who were interviewed as well,

348
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
refer to that behavior as Talibanization.

349
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.

350
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.

351
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us --

352
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and this is dangerous.

353
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself

354
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
as extreme.

355
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
This is one of my sons, Rayan,

356
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
who's a Scooby Doo addict.

357
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
You can tell by the glasses there.

358
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day.

359
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Laughter)

360
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.

361
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Last summer when we were in our home in New York,

362
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,

363
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy."

364
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.

365
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."

366
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And what Rayan did then

367
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,

368
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and he looked at me and he said, "Baba,

369
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I want you to come with me to my office in my house.

370
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I have work to do."

371
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
(Laughter)

372
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Applause)

373
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Rayan reframed the situation

374
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and brought himself down to my level.

375
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
(Laughter)

376
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And with The 99, that is what we aim to do.

377
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
You know, I think that there's a big parallel

378
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
between bending the crucifix out of shape

379
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and creating swastikas.

380
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles

381
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
who think it's cute to have a little child

382
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them

383
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to protest something,

384
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
the hope is by linking enough positive things

385
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
to the Koran,

386
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that one day we can move this child

387
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
from being proud in the way they're proud there,

388
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to that.

389
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And I think --

390
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I think The 99

391
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
can and will achieve its mission.

392
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day

393
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.

394
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And people came up and picked up

395
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
the culturally resonant image of the falafel,

396
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
ate it and, you know, talked and left.

397
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was

398
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.

399
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Laughter)

400
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Or so we thought,

401
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
until a woman came rushing across the campus

402
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,

403
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
"Who's falafel?"

404
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
(Laughter)

405
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
True story.

406
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
(Laughter)

407
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting.

408
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Laughter)

409
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Just today, D.C. Comics announced

410
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
the cover of our upcoming crossover.

411
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
On that cover you see Batman, Superman

412
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman

413
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
with our Saudi member of The 99,

414
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
our Emirati member and our Libyan member.

415
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
On April 26, 2010,

416
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
President Barack Obama said that

417
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech --

418
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
in which he reached out to the Muslim world --

419
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out

420
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
to the Justice League of America.

421
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,

422
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,

423
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and where religion can be twisted

424
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others.

425
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
In a world like that,

426
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
they'll always be a job for Superman and The 99.

427
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Thank you very much.

428
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
(Applause)

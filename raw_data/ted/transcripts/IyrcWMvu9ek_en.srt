1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Don't you love a good nap?

2
0:00:14.32,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:16.56,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Just stealing away that small block of time

4
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to curl up on your couch for that sweet moment of escape.

5
0:00:23.76,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's one of my favorite things,

6
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but something I took for granted

7
0:00:26.88,000 --> 0:00:28,000
before I began experiencing homelessness as a teenager.

8
0:00:31.44,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The ability to take a nap is only reserved for stability and sureness,

9
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:37,000
something you can't find

10
0:00:37.52,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when you're carrying everything you own in your book bag

11
0:00:40.2,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and carefully counting the amount of time you're allowed to sit in any given place

12
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
before being asked to leave.

13
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia,

14
0:00:50.04,000 --> 0:00:51,000
bouncing from house to house

15
0:00:51.88,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with a loving, close-knit family

16
0:00:54.2,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as we struggled to find stability

17
0:00:57.56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in our finances.

18
0:01:00.28,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But when my mom temporarily lost herself to mania

19
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and when that mania chose me as its primary scapegoat

20
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
through both emotional and physical abuse,

21
0:01:10.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I fled for my safety.

22
0:01:13.6,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I had come to the conclusion that homelessness was safer for me

23
0:01:17.239,000 --> 0:01:18,000
than being at home.

24
0:01:19.24,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I was 16.

25
0:01:22.52,000 --> 0:01:26,000
During my homelessness, I joined Atlanta's 3,300 homeless youth

26
0:01:26.64,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in feeling uncared for,

27
0:01:28.64,000 --> 0:01:3,000
left out and invisible each night.

28
0:01:32.12,000 --> 0:01:34,000
There wasn't and still is not any place

29
0:01:34.24,000 --> 0:01:36,000
for a homeless minor to walk off the street

30
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to access a bed.

31
0:01:39.4,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I realized that most people thought of homelessness

32
0:01:41.84,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as some kind of lazy, drug-induced squalor and inconvenience,

33
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but that didn't represent my book bag full of clothes and schoolbooks,

34
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or my A+ grade point average.

35
0:01:54.88,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I would sit on my favorite bench downtown

36
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and watch as the hours passed by

37
0:01:58.84,000 --> 0:02:01,000
until I could sneak in a few hours of sleep

38
0:02:02.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
on couches, in cars,

39
0:02:05.36,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in buildings or in storage units.

40
0:02:08.84,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I, like thousands of other homeless youth, disappeared into the shadows of the city

41
0:02:13.48,000 --> 0:02:15,000
while the whole world kept spinning

42
0:02:15.76,000 --> 0:02:17,000
as if nothing at all had gone terribly wrong.

43
0:02:19.4,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The invisibility alone almost completely broke my spirit.

44
0:02:25.32,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But when I had nothing else, I had the arts,

45
0:02:29.04,000 --> 0:02:3,000
something that didn't demand

46
0:02:30.48,000 --> 0:02:32,000
material wealth from me in exchange for refuge.

47
0:02:33.96,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A few hours of singing, writing poetry

48
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or saving up enough money

49
0:02:39.96,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to disappear into another world at a play

50
0:02:42.64,000 --> 0:02:45,000
kept me going and jolting me back to life when I felt at my lowest.

51
0:02:47.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I would go to church services on Wednesday evenings

52
0:02:50.32,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and, desperate for the relief the arts gave me,

53
0:02:53.84,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I would go a few hours early,

54
0:02:56.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
slip downstairs

55
0:02:58.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and into a part of the world where the only thing that mattered

56
0:03:01.88,000 --> 0:03:03,000
was whether or not I could hit the right note in the song

57
0:03:04.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I was perfecting that week.

58
0:03:06.56,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I would sing for hours.

59
0:03:09.24,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It gave me so much strength to give myself permission

60
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to just block it all out and sing.

61
0:03:17.28,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Five years later, I started my organization, ChopArt,

62
0:03:21.24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
which is a multidisciplinary arts organization for homeless minors.

63
0:03:26.32,000 --> 0:03:3,000
ChopArt uses the arts as a tool for trauma recovery

64
0:03:30.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
by taking what we know about building community

65
0:03:33.32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and restoring dignity

66
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and applying that to the creative process.

67
0:03:38.6,000 --> 0:03:4,000
ChopArt is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia,

68
0:03:41.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
with additional programs in Hyderabad, India, and Accra, Ghana,

69
0:03:45.04,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and since our start in 2010,

70
0:03:47.32,000 --> 0:03:49,000
we've served over 40,000 teens worldwide.

71
0:03:51.08,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Our teens take refuge

72
0:03:53.24,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in the transformative elements of the arts,

73
0:03:56.84,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and they depend on the safe space ChopArt provides for them to do that.

74
0:04:01.36,000 --> 0:04:06,000
An often invisible population uses the arts to step into their light,

75
0:04:07.12,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but that journey out of invisibility is not an easy one.

76
0:04:11.72,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We have a sibling pair, Jeremy and Kelly,

77
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
who have been with our program for over three years.

78
0:04:18.52,000 --> 0:04:21,000
They come to the ChopArt classes every Wednesday evening.

79
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But about a year ago,

80
0:04:25.76,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Jeremy and Kelly witnessed their mom seize and die right in front of them.

81
0:04:30.48,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They watched as the paramedics failed to revive her.

82
0:04:34.56,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They cried as their father

83
0:04:36.76,000 --> 0:04:39,000
signed over temporary custody to their ChopArt mentor, Erin,

84
0:04:40.56,000 --> 0:04:43,000
without even allowing them to take an extra pair of clothes on their way out.

85
0:04:45.56,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This series of events broke my heart,

86
0:04:49.24,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but Jeremy and Kelly's faith and resolve in ChopArt

87
0:04:52.8,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is what keeps me grounded in this work.

88
0:04:56.32,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Kelly calling Erin in her lowest moment,

89
0:04:58.52,000 --> 0:05:,000
knowing that Erin would do whatever she could

90
0:05:00.88,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to make them feel loved and cared for,

91
0:05:03.88,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is proof to me that by using the arts as the entry point,

92
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we can heal and build our homeless youth population.

93
0:05:13.24,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And we continue to build.

94
0:05:15.48,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We build with Devin,

95
0:05:17.24,000 --> 0:05:19,000
who became homeless with his family

96
0:05:19.44,000 --> 0:05:22,000
when his mom had to choose between medical bills or the rent.

97
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
He discovered his love of painting through ChopArt.

98
0:05:27.36,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We build with Liz,

99
0:05:29.04,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who has been on the streets most of her teenage years

100
0:05:32.24,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but turns to music to return to herself

101
0:05:35.28,000 --> 0:05:38,000
when her traumas feel too heavy for her young shoulders.

102
0:05:40.24,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We build for Maria,

103
0:05:42.24,000 --> 0:05:44,000
who uses poetry to heal

104
0:05:44.6,000 --> 0:05:46,000
after her grandfather died in the van

105
0:05:47.12,000 --> 0:05:49,000
she's living in with the rest of her family.

106
0:05:50.8,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And so to the youth out there experiencing homelessness,

107
0:05:56.4,000 --> 0:05:57,000
let me tell you,

108
0:05:58.76,000 --> 0:06:,000
you have the power to build within you.

109
0:06:02.04,000 --> 0:06:03,000
You have a voice through the arts

110
0:06:03.68,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that doesn't judge what you've been through.

111
0:06:06.52,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So never stop fighting to stand in your light

112
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because even in your darkest times,

113
0:06:12.36,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we see you.

114
0:06:14.12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Thank you.

115
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Applause)

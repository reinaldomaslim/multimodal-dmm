1
0:00:16.196,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I'm going to talk about work;

2
0:00:17.91,000 --> 0:00:2,000
specifically, why people can't seem to get work done at work,

3
0:00:21.72,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which is a problem we all kind of have.

4
0:00:24.173,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But let's sort of start at the beginning.

5
0:00:26.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So, we have companies and non-profits and charities

6
0:00:29.99,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort.

7
0:00:35.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And they expect these people who work for them

8
0:00:39.188,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to do great work --

9
0:00:40.894,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I would hope, at least.

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
At least good work, hopefully, at least it's good work --

11
0:00:44.999,000 --> 0:00:45,000
hopefully great work.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And so what they typically do is they decide

13
0:00:48.332,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind,

15
0:00:55.259,000 --> 0:00:59,000
unless you're working in Africa, if you're really lucky to do that --

16
0:00:59.447,000 --> 0:01:01,000
most people have to go to an office every day.

17
0:01:01.704,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And so these companies,

18
0:01:03.664,000 --> 0:01:04,000
they build offices.

19
0:01:05.413,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building,

20
0:01:08.333,000 --> 0:01:09,000
or they lease some space,

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and they fill this space with stuff.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They fill it with tables, or desks,

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
chairs, computer equipment,

24
0:01:19.159,000 --> 0:01:22,000
software, Internet access,

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,

26
0:01:25.529,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and they expect their employees, or their volunteers,

27
0:01:28.134,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to come to that location every day to do great work.

28
0:01:30.807,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It seems like it's perfectly reasonable to ask that.

29
0:01:33.752,000 --> 0:01:35,000
However, if you actually talk to people

30
0:01:36.109,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and even question yourself, and you ask yourself,

31
0:01:38.777,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done?

32
0:01:42.315,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You'll find out that people don't say what businesses think they would say.

33
0:01:46.065,000 --> 0:01:47,000
If you ask people the question:

34
0:01:47.586,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Where do you need to go when you need to get something done?

35
0:01:50.426,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Typically, you get three different kinds of answers.

36
0:01:52.924,000 --> 0:01:54,000
One is kind of a place or a location or a room.

37
0:01:55.811,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Another one is a moving object,

38
0:01:57.779,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and a third is a time.

39
0:01:59.47,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So here are some examples.

40
0:02:01.506,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I've been asking people this question for about 10 years:

41
0:02:04.761,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"Where do you go when you really need to get something done?"

42
0:02:07.941,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'll hear things like, the porch, the deck, the kitchen.

43
0:02:11.513,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I'll hear things like an extra room in the house,

44
0:02:14.585,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the basement,

45
0:02:15.886,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the coffee shop, the library.

46
0:02:18.807,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And then you'll hear things like the train,

47
0:02:21.386,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a plane, a car -- so, the commute.

48
0:02:24.926,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And then you'll hear people say,

49
0:02:26.662,000 --> 0:02:28,000
"Well, it doesn't really matter where I am,

50
0:02:28.688,000 --> 0:02:31,000
as long as it's early in the morning or late at night or on the weekends."

51
0:02:32.224,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You almost never hear someone say, "The office."

52
0:02:35.073,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office,

53
0:02:38.669,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and they're making people go to it all the time,

54
0:02:40.947,000 --> 0:02:42,000
yet people don't do work in the office.

55
0:02:43.006,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What is that about?

56
0:02:44.193,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:45.677,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Why is that? Why is that happening?

58
0:02:49.353,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And what you find out is,

59
0:02:50.647,000 --> 0:02:53,000
if you dig a little bit deeper, you find out that people --

60
0:02:54.059,000 --> 0:02:55,000
this is what happens:

61
0:02:55.733,000 --> 0:02:56,000
People go to work,

62
0:02:57.486,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and they're basically trading in their work day

63
0:02:59.82,000 --> 0:03:02,000
for a series of "work moments" -- that's what happens at the office.

64
0:03:03.336,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You don't have a work day anymore. You have work moments.

65
0:03:06.043,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart,

66
0:03:08.845,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits,

67
0:03:11.171,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because you have 15 minutes here, 30 minutes there,

68
0:03:13.743,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and something else happens, you're pulled off your work,

69
0:03:16.49,000 --> 0:03:19,000
then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch, then you have something else to do ...

70
0:03:20.403,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Then you've got 15 minutes, and someone pulls you aside and asks you a question,

71
0:03:24.237,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,

72
0:03:26.457,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you look back on the day,

73
0:03:28.053,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and you realize that you didn't get anything done.

74
0:03:31.108,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We've all been through this.

75
0:03:32.489,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We probably went through it yesterday or the day before, or the day before that.

76
0:03:36.316,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You look back on your day,

77
0:03:37.754,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and you're like, "I got nothing done today.

78
0:03:39.794,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I was at work. I sat at my desk. I used my expensive computer.

79
0:03:44.408,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I used the software they told me to use.

80
0:03:46.669,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to.

81
0:03:49.146,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I did these conference calls. I did all this stuff.

82
0:03:51.867,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But I didn't actually do anything.

83
0:03:54.692,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I just did tasks.

84
0:03:55.868,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I didn't actually get meaningful work done."

85
0:03:58.707,000 --> 0:04:,000
And what you find is that, especially with creative people --

86
0:04:01.667,000 --> 0:04:06,000
designers, programmers, writers, engineers, thinkers --

87
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time

88
0:04:11.172,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to get something done.

89
0:04:12.518,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes

90
0:04:15.97,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and really think about a problem.

91
0:04:17.613,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You might have a quick idea,

92
0:04:19.003,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully,

93
0:04:22.986,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you need long stretches of uninterrupted time.

94
0:04:25.871,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And even though the work day is typically eight hours,

95
0:04:28.597,000 --> 0:04:31,000
how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office?

96
0:04:32.176,000 --> 0:04:33,000
How about seven hours?

97
0:04:33.367,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Six? Five? Four?

98
0:04:36.599,000 --> 0:04:39,000
When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office?

99
0:04:39.775,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Two hours? One, maybe?

100
0:04:41.821,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Very, very few people actually have

101
0:04:43.56,000 --> 0:04:45,000
long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office.

102
0:04:46.258,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And this is why people choose to do work at home,

103
0:04:49.812,000 --> 0:04:5,000
or they might go to the office,

104
0:04:51.415,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but they might go to the office really early in the day,

105
0:04:54.074,000 --> 0:04:55,000
or late at night when no one's around,

106
0:04:55.924,000 --> 0:04:57,000
or they stick around after everyone's left,

107
0:04:58.016,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or go in on the weekends,

108
0:04:59.454,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or they get work done on the plane, in the car or in the train,

109
0:05:02.569,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because there are no distractions.

110
0:05:04.498,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now there are different kinds of distractions,

111
0:05:06.717,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but not the really bad distractions, which I'll talk about in a minute.

112
0:05:10.13,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And this whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done

113
0:05:14.618,000 --> 0:05:17,000
reminds me of another thing that doesn't work when you're interrupted,

114
0:05:18.284,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and that is sleep.

115
0:05:20.031,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I think that sleep and work are very closely related --

116
0:05:23.244,000 --> 0:05:26,000
not because you can work while you're sleeping and sleep while you're working.

117
0:05:26.966,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's not really what I mean.

118
0:05:28.434,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I'm talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phase-based,

119
0:05:34.529,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or stage-based, events.

120
0:05:36.584,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages -- some people call them different things.

121
0:05:42.663,000 --> 0:05:45,000
There are five of them, and in order to get to the really deep ones,

122
0:05:46.521,000 --> 0:05:48,000
the meaningful ones, you have to go through the early ones.

123
0:05:49.314,000 --> 0:05:52,000
If you're interrupted while you're going through the early ones --

124
0:05:52.529,000 --> 0:05:55,000
if someone bumps you in bed, or there's a sound, or whatever happens --

125
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
you don't just pick up where you left off.

126
0:05:58.284,000 --> 0:05:59,000
If you're interrupted and woken up,

127
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
you have to start again.

128
0:06:02.022,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So you have to go back a few phases and start again.

129
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And what ends up happening -- you might have days like this

130
0:06:08.051,000 --> 0:06:11,000
where you wake up at eight or seven in the morning, or whenever you get up,

131
0:06:11.623,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and you're like, "I didn't sleep very well.

132
0:06:13.763,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I did the sleep thing -- I went to bed, I laid down,

133
0:06:16.355,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but I didn't really sleep."

134
0:06:18.757,000 --> 0:06:2,000
People say you go "to" sleep,

135
0:06:21.147,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but you don't go to sleep, you go towards sleep; it takes a while.

136
0:06:24.289,000 --> 0:06:26,000
You've got to go through phases and stuff,

137
0:06:26.368,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well.

138
0:06:28.701,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So does anyone here expect someone to sleep well

139
0:06:31.081,000 --> 0:06:32,000
if they're interrupted all night?

140
0:06:32.687,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I don't think anyone would say yes.

141
0:06:34.425,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Why do we expect people to work well

142
0:06:36.774,000 --> 0:06:38,000
if they're being interrupted all day at the office?

143
0:06:39.27,000 --> 0:06:41,000
How can we possibly expect people to do their job

144
0:06:41.728,000 --> 0:06:43,000
if they go to the office and are interrupted?

145
0:06:43.857,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That doesn't really seem like it makes a lot of sense, to me.

146
0:06:46.788,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So what are the interruptions that happen at the office but not at other places?

147
0:06:50.68,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Because in other places, you can have interruptions like the TV,

148
0:06:54.965,000 --> 0:06:57,000
or you could go for a walk, or there's a fridge downstairs,

149
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
or you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do.

150
0:07:01.389,000 --> 0:07:03,000
If you talk to certain managers, they'll tell you

151
0:07:04.222,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that they don't want their employees to work at home

152
0:07:06.817,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because of these distractions.

153
0:07:08.738,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They'll sometimes also say,

154
0:07:11.793,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"If I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?"

155
0:07:14.66,000 --> 0:07:17,000
which is ridiculous, but that's one of the excuses that managers give.

156
0:07:17.985,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And I'm one of these managers. I understand. I know how this goes.

157
0:07:21.266,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We all have to improve on this sort of thing.

158
0:07:24.013,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:

159
0:07:26.007,000 --> 0:07:27,000
"I can't let someone work at home.

160
0:07:27.665,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."

161
0:07:29.705,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting,

162
0:07:32.464,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Because those are voluntary distractions.

163
0:07:34.444,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV,

164
0:07:36.92,000 --> 0:07:37,000
when you want to turn something on,

165
0:07:38.635,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.

166
0:07:41.053,000 --> 0:07:42,000
At the office,

167
0:07:42.228,000 --> 0:07:44,000
most of the interruptions and distractions

168
0:07:44.275,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary.

169
0:07:47.416,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So let's go through a couple of those.

170
0:07:50.551,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Now, managers and bosses will often have you think

171
0:07:53.892,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that the real distractions at work

172
0:07:55.92,000 --> 0:07:57,000
are things like Facebook and Twitter

173
0:07:58.754,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and YouTube and other websites,

174
0:08:01.948,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and in fact, they'll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work.

175
0:08:05.814,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Some of you may work at places where you can't get to certain sites.

176
0:08:09.179,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I mean, is this China? What the hell is going on here?

177
0:08:11.822,000 --> 0:08:13,000
You can't go to a website at work, and that's the problem?

178
0:08:14.589,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That's why people aren't getting work done,

179
0:08:16.621,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because they're on Facebook and Twitter?

180
0:08:18.573,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That's kind of ridiculous. It's a total decoy.

181
0:08:21.557,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,

182
0:08:24.998,000 --> 0:08:26,000
these things are just modern-day smoke breaks.

183
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,

184
0:08:31.299,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so why does anyone care if someone goes to Facebook

185
0:08:33.941,000 --> 0:08:35,000
or Twitter or YouTube here and there?

186
0:08:36.076,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Those aren't the real problems in the office.

187
0:08:38.677,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The real problems are what I like to call the M&Ms,

188
0:08:42.312,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the Managers and the Meetings.

189
0:08:44.589,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Those are the real problems in the modern office today.

190
0:08:48.002,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And this is why things don't get done at work,

191
0:08:50.506,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it's because of the M&Ms.

192
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Now what's interesting is,

193
0:08:54.656,000 --> 0:08:57,000
if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work,

194
0:08:57.821,000 --> 0:09:,000
like at home, in the car, on a plane, late at night, or early in the morning,

195
0:09:01.809,000 --> 0:09:03,000
you don't find managers and meetings.

196
0:09:03.964,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You find a lot of other distractions, but not managers and meetings.

197
0:09:07.225,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So these are the things that you don't find elsewhere,

198
0:09:10.226,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but you do find at the office.

199
0:09:12.631,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people.

200
0:09:16.006,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people.

201
0:09:19.522,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They don't really do the work, so they make sure everyone else is doing work,

202
0:09:23.385,000 --> 0:09:24,000
which is an interruption.

203
0:09:25.133,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We have lots of managers in the world now, and a lot of people in the world,

204
0:09:28.751,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and a lot of interruptions by these managers.

205
0:09:30.876,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They have to check in: "Hey, how's it going?

206
0:09:32.953,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Show me what's up." This sort of thing.

207
0:09:34.861,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They keep interrupting you at the wrong time,

208
0:09:37.043,000 --> 0:09:4,000
while you're actually trying to do something they're paying you to do,

209
0:09:40.368,000 --> 0:09:41,000
they tend to interrupt you.

210
0:09:41.795,000 --> 0:09:42,000
That's kind of bad.

211
0:09:43.382,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But what's even worse is the thing that managers do most of all,

212
0:09:46.517,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which is call meetings.

213
0:09:47.988,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And meetings are just toxic,

214
0:09:50.558,000 --> 0:09:53,000
terrible, poisonous things

215
0:09:53.584,000 --> 0:09:54,000
during the day at work.

216
0:09:55.027,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Laughter)

217
0:09:56.267,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We all know this to be true,

218
0:09:58.078,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees.

219
0:10:01.323,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It doesn't work that way.

220
0:10:02.608,000 --> 0:10:03,000
The manager calls the meeting

221
0:10:04.36,000 --> 0:10:05,000
so the employees can all come together,

222
0:10:06.299,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and it's an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people --

223
0:10:09.046,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to say, "Hey look,

224
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
we're going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting.

225
0:10:13.982,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I don't care what you're doing,

226
0:10:15.498,000 --> 0:10:18,000
you've got to stop doing it, so you can have this meeting."

227
0:10:18.529,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I mean, what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop?

228
0:10:21.927,000 --> 0:10:24,000
What if they're thinking about something important, or doing important work?

229
0:10:25.704,000 --> 0:10:28,000
All of a sudden you tell them they have to stop doing that to do something else.

230
0:10:29.517,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So they go into a meeting room, they get together,

231
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter, usually.

232
0:10:35.556,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Because meetings aren't work.

233
0:10:37.224,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Meetings are places to go to talk about things

234
0:10:39.414,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you're supposed to be doing later.

235
0:10:41.135,000 --> 0:10:42,000
But meetings also procreate.

236
0:10:43.13,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting,

237
0:10:45.419,000 --> 0:10:46,000
which leads to another meeting.

238
0:10:46.928,000 --> 0:10:48,000
There's often too many people in the meetings,

239
0:10:49.158,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and they're very, very expensive to the organization.

240
0:10:51.907,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting,

241
0:10:55.056,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but that's not true, unless there's only one person.

242
0:10:57.541,000 --> 0:11:,000
If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting.

243
0:11:01.089,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization

244
0:11:04.39,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to have this one-hour meeting, which probably should have been handled

245
0:11:07.753,000 --> 0:11:09,000
by two or three people talking for a few minutes.

246
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
But instead, there's a long scheduled meeting,

247
0:11:12.823,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because meetings are scheduled the way software works,

248
0:11:15.418,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which is in increments of 15 minutes, or 30 minutes, or an hour.

249
0:11:18.843,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You don't schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook; you can't.

250
0:11:22.51,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour.

251
0:11:25.508,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And so we tend to fill these times up

252
0:11:27.506,000 --> 0:11:29,000
when things should go really quickly.

253
0:11:29.689,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today,

254
0:11:33.363,000 --> 0:11:34,000
especially at offices.

255
0:11:34.546,000 --> 0:11:36,000
These things don't exist outside of the office.

256
0:11:37.688,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation.

257
0:11:42.513,000 --> 0:11:43,000
What can managers do --

258
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
enlightened managers, hopefully --

259
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work,

260
0:11:49.756,000 --> 0:11:51,000
so it's not the last resort, but it's the first resort,

261
0:11:52.625,000 --> 0:11:53,000
so that people start to say,

262
0:11:53.991,000 --> 0:11:55,000
"When I really want to get stuff done, I go to the office."

263
0:11:56.792,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Because the offices are well-equipped;

264
0:11:58.73,000 --> 0:12:,000
everything is there for them to do the work.

265
0:12:00.888,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But they don't want to go there right now, so how do we change that?

266
0:12:04.173,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I have three suggestions to share with you.

267
0:12:06.231,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I have about three minutes, so that'll fit perfectly.

268
0:12:09.126,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We've all heard of the Casual Friday thing.

269
0:12:11.987,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I don't know if people still do that.

270
0:12:13.86,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But how about "No-talk Thursdays?"

271
0:12:15.56,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Laughter)

272
0:12:17.616,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Pick one Thursday once a month,

273
0:12:20.586,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and cut it in half, just the afternoon -- I'll make it easy for you.

274
0:12:23.921,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So just the afternoon, one Thursday.

275
0:12:25.675,000 --> 0:12:27,000
First Thursday of the month, just the afternoon,

276
0:12:27.953,000 --> 0:12:29,000
nobody in the office can talk to each other.

277
0:12:30.041,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Just silence, that's it.

278
0:12:31.603,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And what you'll find

279
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is that a tremendous amount of work gets done

280
0:12:35.692,000 --> 0:12:36,000
when no one talks to each other.

281
0:12:37.32,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is when people actually get stuff done,

282
0:12:39.408,000 --> 0:12:41,000
is when no one's bothering them or interrupting them.

283
0:12:41.948,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time

284
0:12:44.933,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is the best gift you can give anybody at work.

285
0:12:47.131,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It's better than a computer,

286
0:12:48.568,000 --> 0:12:5,000
better than a new monitor, better than new software,

287
0:12:51.346,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or whatever people typically use.

288
0:12:53.345,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office

289
0:12:55.773,000 --> 0:12:56,000
is going to be incredibly valuable.

290
0:12:57.718,000 --> 0:13:,000
If you try that, I think you'll agree, and hopefully you can do it more often.

291
0:13:01.71,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So maybe it's every other week,

292
0:13:03.456,000 --> 0:13:04,000
or every week, once a week,

293
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
afternoons no one can talk to each other.

294
0:13:07.337,000 --> 0:13:1,000
That's something that you'll find will really, really work.

295
0:13:10.448,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Another thing you can try,

296
0:13:12.774,000 --> 0:13:15,000
is switching from active communication and collaboration,

297
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
which is like face-to-face stuff -- tapping people on the shoulder,

298
0:13:19.475,000 --> 0:13:2,000
saying hi to them, having meetings,

299
0:13:21.475,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and replace that with more passive models of communication,

300
0:13:24.285,000 --> 0:13:26,000
using things like email and instant messaging,

301
0:13:26.61,000 --> 0:13:28,000
or collaboration products, things like that.

302
0:13:29.888,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Now some people might say email is really distracting,

303
0:13:32.833,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I.M. is really distracting, and these other things are really distracting,

304
0:13:36.427,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but they're distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing.

305
0:13:40.023,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You can quit the email app; you can't quit your boss.

306
0:13:42.855,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You can quit I.M.;

307
0:13:44.657,000 --> 0:13:45,000
you can't hide your manager.

308
0:13:46.498,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You can put these things away,

309
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time,

310
0:13:51.665,000 --> 0:13:53,000
when you're available, when you're ready to go again.

311
0:13:54.166,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Because work, like sleep, happens in phases.

312
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So you'll be going up, doing some work,

313
0:13:58.377,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and then you'll come down from that work,

314
0:14:00.36,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and then maybe it's time to check that email or I.M.

315
0:14:02.836,000 --> 0:14:04,000
There are very, very few things that are that urgent,

316
0:14:05.361,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that need to happen, that need to be answered right this second.

317
0:14:08.432,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So if you're a manager,

318
0:14:09.631,000 --> 0:14:11,000
start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email

319
0:14:12.639,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and other things that someone can put away

320
0:14:14.679,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and then get back to you on their own schedule.

321
0:14:16.904,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And the last suggestion I have is that,

322
0:14:20.507,000 --> 0:14:21,000
if you do have a meeting coming up,

323
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
if you have the power, just cancel it.

324
0:14:25.91,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Just cancel that next meeting.

325
0:14:27.394,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Laughter)

326
0:14:28.584,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Today's Friday, usually people have meetings on Monday.

327
0:14:31.253,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Just don't have it.

328
0:14:32.439,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I don't mean move it;

329
0:14:33.868,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I mean just erase it from memory, it's gone.

330
0:14:36.534,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And you'll find out that everything will be just fine.

331
0:14:39.146,000 --> 0:14:42,000
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make

332
0:14:42.186,000 --> 0:14:43,000
at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,

333
0:14:43.994,000 --> 0:14:45,000
just forget about them, and things will be fine.

334
0:14:46.315,000 --> 0:14:48,000
People will have a more open morning, they can actually think.

335
0:14:49.32,000 --> 0:14:51,000
You'll find out all these things you thought you had to do,

336
0:14:52.119,000 --> 0:14:53,000
you don't actually have to do.

337
0:14:53.596,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about.

338
0:14:57.612,000 --> 0:15:,000
I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough

339
0:15:00.661,000 --> 0:15:02,000
for managers and bosses and business owners

340
0:15:02.791,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and organizers and people who are in charge of other people,

341
0:15:05.631,000 --> 0:15:06,000
to think about laying off a little bit,

342
0:15:07.526,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and giving people more time to get work done.

343
0:15:09.685,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I think it'll all pay off in the end.

344
0:15:11.519,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So, thanks for listening.

345
0:15:13.545,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

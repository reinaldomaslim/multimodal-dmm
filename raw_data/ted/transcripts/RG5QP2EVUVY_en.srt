2
0:00:17.007,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My talk today is about something

3
0:00:19.045,000 --> 0:00:21,000
maybe a couple of you have already heard about.

4
0:00:21.378,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's called the Arab Spring.

5
0:00:23.712,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Anyone heard of it?

6
0:00:25.61,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Applause)

7
0:00:28.735,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So in 2011, power shifted,

8
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
from the few to the many,

9
0:00:36.123,000 --> 0:00:39,000
from oval offices to central squares,

10
0:00:39.878,000 --> 0:00:41,000
from carefully guarded airwaves

11
0:00:42.871,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to open-source networks.

12
0:00:45.558,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But before Tahrir was a global symbol of liberation,

13
0:00:50.342,000 --> 0:00:51,000
there were representative surveys

14
0:00:52.326,000 --> 0:00:54,000
already giving people a voice

15
0:00:55.316,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in quieter but still powerful ways.

16
0:00:58.809,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I study Muslim societies around the world at Gallup.

17
0:01:03.641,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Since 2001,

18
0:01:06.125,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we've interviewed hundreds of thousands of people --

19
0:01:09.506,000 --> 0:01:1,000
young and old, men and women,

20
0:01:11.281,000 --> 0:01:13,000
educated and illiterate.

21
0:01:13.421,000 --> 0:01:16,000
My talk today draws on this research

22
0:01:16.924,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to reveal why Arabs rose up

23
0:01:20.857,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and what they want now.

24
0:01:23.874,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now this region's very diverse,

25
0:01:27.056,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and every country is unique.

26
0:01:29.041,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But those who revolted

27
0:01:30.691,000 --> 0:01:32,000
shared a common set of grievances

28
0:01:33.63,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and have similar demands today.

29
0:01:36.807,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm going to focus a lot of my talk on Egypt.

30
0:01:39.658,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It has nothing to do with the fact that I was born there, of course.

31
0:01:43.024,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But it's the largest Arab country

32
0:01:46.608,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and it's also one with a great deal of influence.

33
0:01:50.023,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But I'm going to end by widening the lens to the entire region

34
0:01:54.007,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to look at the mundane topics

35
0:01:56.824,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of Arab views of religion and politics

36
0:01:59.607,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and how this impacts women,

37
0:02:02.792,000 --> 0:02:05,000
revealing some surprises along the way.

38
0:02:06.564,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So after analyzing mounds of data,

39
0:02:10.693,000 --> 0:02:12,000
what we discovered was this:

40
0:02:13.161,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Unemployment and poverty alone

41
0:02:16.4,000 --> 0:02:2,000
did not lead to the Arab revolts of 2011.

42
0:02:20.994,000 --> 0:02:23,000
If an act of desperation by a Tunisian fruit vendor

43
0:02:24.077,000 --> 0:02:25,000
sparked these revolutions,

44
0:02:25.795,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it was the difference between what Arabs experienced

45
0:02:29.795,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and what they expected

46
0:02:32.175,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that provided the fuel.

47
0:02:34.008,000 --> 0:02:35,000
To tell you what I mean,

48
0:02:35.409,000 --> 0:02:37,000
consider this trend in Egypt.

49
0:02:37.591,000 --> 0:02:39,000
On paper the country was doing great.

50
0:02:40.567,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In fact, it attracted accolades

51
0:02:43.424,000 --> 0:02:45,000
from multinational organizations

52
0:02:45.876,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because of its economic growth.

53
0:02:47.942,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But under the surface was a very different reality.

54
0:02:50.591,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In 2010, right before the revolution,

55
0:02:54.341,000 --> 0:02:56,000
even though GDP per capita

56
0:02:56.492,000 --> 0:02:59,000
had been growing at five percent for several years,

57
0:02:59.591,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives.

58
0:03:04.091,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now this is very unusual,

59
0:03:06.359,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because globally we find that, not surprisingly,

60
0:03:09.66,000 --> 0:03:12,000
people feel better as their country gets richer.

61
0:03:13.275,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that's because they have better job opportunities

62
0:03:16.058,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and their state offers better social services.

63
0:03:19.471,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.

64
0:03:21.859,000 --> 0:03:23,000
As the country got more well-off,

65
0:03:24.591,000 --> 0:03:26,000
unemployment actually rose

66
0:03:27.009,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and people's satisfaction

67
0:03:29.659,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with things like housing and education plummeted.

68
0:03:35.596,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.

69
0:03:39.886,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It was also people's deep longing for freedom.

70
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory,

71
0:03:51.526,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Arabs didn't despise Western liberty,

72
0:03:55.062,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they desired it.

73
0:03:57.014,000 --> 0:03:59,000
As early as 2001,

74
0:03:59.763,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we asked Arabs, and Muslims in general around the world,

75
0:04:03.236,000 --> 0:04:05,000
what they admired most about the West.

76
0:04:06.165,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Among the most frequent responses

77
0:04:08.832,000 --> 0:04:1,000
was liberty and justice.

78
0:04:11.184,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In their own words to an open-ended question

79
0:04:14.35,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we heard, "Their political system is transparent

80
0:04:17.266,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and it's following democracy in its true sense."

81
0:04:20.467,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Another said it was "liberty and freedom

82
0:04:22.466,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and being open-minded with each other."

83
0:04:25.198,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Majorities as high as 90 percent and greater

84
0:04:29.833,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in Egypt, Indonesia and Iran

85
0:04:32.251,000 --> 0:04:34,000
told us in 2005

86
0:04:34.934,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that if they were to write a new constitution

87
0:04:39.133,000 --> 0:04:42,000
for a theoretical new country

88
0:04:42.499,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that they would guarantee freedom of speech

89
0:04:44.824,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as a fundamental right,

90
0:04:47.234,000 --> 0:04:49,000
especially in Egypt.

91
0:04:49.318,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy

92
0:04:53.3,000 --> 0:04:55,000
would help Muslims progress --

93
0:04:55.866,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the highest percentage of any country we surveyed.

94
0:05:00.083,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But pressed up against these democratic aspirations

95
0:05:03.783,000 --> 0:05:06,000
was a very different day-to-day experience,

96
0:05:06.884,000 --> 0:05:08,000
especially in Egypt.

97
0:05:09.05,000 --> 0:05:12,000
While aspiring to democracy the most,

98
0:05:12.568,000 --> 0:05:16,000
they were the least likely population in the world

99
0:05:17.315,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to say that they had actually voiced their opinion

100
0:05:21.042,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to a public official in the last month --

101
0:05:23.416,000 --> 0:05:26,000
at only four percent.

102
0:05:27.099,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So while economic development made a few people rich,

103
0:05:31.867,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it left many more worse off.

104
0:05:34.865,000 --> 0:05:37,000
As people felt less and less free,

105
0:05:38.451,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they also felt less and less provided for.

106
0:05:42.2,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So rather than viewing their former regimes

107
0:05:45.95,000 --> 0:05:48,000
as generous if overprotective fathers,

108
0:05:49.384,000 --> 0:05:53,000
they viewed them as essentially prison wardens.

109
0:05:53.585,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So now that Egyptians have ended Mubarak's 30-year rule,

110
0:05:58.001,000 --> 0:06:,000
they potentially could be

111
0:06:00.168,000 --> 0:06:02,000
an example for the region.

112
0:06:02.834,000 --> 0:06:03,000
If Egypt is to succeed

113
0:06:04.556,000 --> 0:06:07,000
at building a society based on the rule of law,

114
0:06:08.023,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it could be a model.

115
0:06:10.875,000 --> 0:06:11,000
If, however,

116
0:06:12.2,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the core issues that propelled the revolution aren't addressed,

117
0:06:16.624,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the consequences could be catastrophic --

118
0:06:20.334,000 --> 0:06:21,000
not just for Egypt,

119
0:06:21.568,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but for the entire region.

120
0:06:24.84,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The signs don't look good, some have said.

121
0:06:28.468,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Islamists, not the young liberals that sparked the revolution,

122
0:06:33.301,000 --> 0:06:35,000
won the majority in Parliament.

123
0:06:35.9,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The military council

124
0:06:37.571,000 --> 0:06:41,000
has cracked down on civil society and protests

125
0:06:41.886,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and the country's economy continues to suffer.

126
0:06:45.254,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Evaluating Egypt on this basis alone, however,

127
0:06:50.019,000 --> 0:06:54,000
ignores the real revolution.

128
0:06:54.647,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Because Egyptians are more optimistic

129
0:06:56.826,000 --> 0:06:58,000
than they have been in years,

130
0:06:59.273,000 --> 0:07:02,000
far less divided on religious-secular lines

131
0:07:03.045,000 --> 0:07:04,000
than we would think

132
0:07:04.361,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and poised for the demands of democracy.

133
0:07:08.276,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Whether they support Islamists or liberals,

134
0:07:11.227,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Egyptians' priorities for this government are identical,

135
0:07:14.571,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and they are jobs, stability and education,

136
0:07:17.327,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not moral policing.

137
0:07:19.66,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But most of all,

138
0:07:20.728,000 --> 0:07:21,000
for the first time in decades,

139
0:07:22.159,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they expect to be active participants, not spectators,

140
0:07:25.909,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in the affairs of their country.

141
0:07:28.21,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I was meeting with a group of newly-elected parliamentarians

142
0:07:32.226,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from Egypt and Tunisia

143
0:07:33.761,000 --> 0:07:34,000
a couple of weeks ago.

144
0:07:35.293,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And what really struck me about them

145
0:07:38.071,000 --> 0:07:43,000
was that they weren't only optimistic,

146
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but they kind of struck me as nervous,

147
0:07:46.102,000 --> 0:07:47,000
for lack of a better word.

148
0:07:47.453,000 --> 0:07:48,000
One said to me,

149
0:07:48.742,000 --> 0:07:5,000
"Our people used to gather in cafes to watch football" --

150
0:07:51.665,000 --> 0:07:54,000
or soccer, as we say in America --

151
0:07:54.682,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"and now they gather to watch Parliament."

152
0:07:59.065,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Laughter)

153
0:08:02.419,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"They're really watching us,

154
0:08:04.641,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and we can't help but worry

155
0:08:08.628,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that we're not going to live up to their expectations."

156
0:08:11.148,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And what really struck me

157
0:08:12.656,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is that less than 24 months ago,

158
0:08:14.848,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it was the people that were nervous

159
0:08:17.099,000 --> 0:08:2,000
about being watched by their government.

160
0:08:20.181,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And the reason that they're expecting a lot

161
0:08:23.031,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is because they have a new-found hope for the future.

162
0:08:26.635,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So right before the revolution

163
0:08:28.421,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we said that Egyptians had never felt worse about their lives,

164
0:08:31.898,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but not only that, they thought their future would be no better.

165
0:08:36.198,000 --> 0:08:39,000
What really changed after the ouster of Mubarak

166
0:08:39.431,000 --> 0:08:4,000
wasn't that life got easier.

167
0:08:41.265,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It actually got harder.

168
0:08:43.372,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But people's expectations for their future

169
0:08:46.465,000 --> 0:08:47,000
went up significantly.

170
0:08:48.265,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And this hope, this optimism,

171
0:08:50.662,000 --> 0:08:54,000
endured a year of turbulent transition.

172
0:08:55.008,000 --> 0:08:58,000
One reason that there's this optimism

173
0:08:58.536,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is because, contrary to what many people have said,

174
0:09:02.267,000 --> 0:09:06,000
most Egyptians think things really have changed in many ways.

175
0:09:06.449,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So while Egyptians were known

176
0:09:09.283,000 --> 0:09:12,000
for their single-digit turnout

177
0:09:12.75,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in elections before the revolution,

178
0:09:15.018,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the last election had around 70 percent voter turnout --

179
0:09:18.85,000 --> 0:09:19,000
men and women.

180
0:09:20.849,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Where scarcely a quarter believed in the honesty of elections in 2010 --

181
0:09:25.763,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'm surprised it was a quarter --

182
0:09:27.444,000 --> 0:09:31,000
90 percent thought that this last election was honest.

183
0:09:31.556,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Now why this matters

184
0:09:33.134,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is because we discovered a link

185
0:09:36.3,000 --> 0:09:4,000
between people's faith in their democratic process

186
0:09:40.534,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and their faith that oppressed people

187
0:09:44.383,000 --> 0:09:46,000
can change their situation

188
0:09:46.9,000 --> 0:09:5,000
through peaceful means alone.

189
0:09:51.62,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Applause)

190
0:10:00.991,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now I know what some of you are thinking.

191
0:10:03.412,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The Egyptian people,

192
0:10:05.045,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and many other Arabs who've revolted and are in transition,

193
0:10:08.895,000 --> 0:10:11,000
have very high expectations of the government.

194
0:10:12.312,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They're just victims of a long-time autocracy,

195
0:10:17.11,000 --> 0:10:19,000
expecting a paternal state

196
0:10:19.327,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to solve all their problems.

197
0:10:21.706,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But this conclusion would ignore

198
0:10:25.295,000 --> 0:10:28,000
a tectonic shift taking place in Egypt

199
0:10:28.445,000 --> 0:10:32,000
far from the cameras in Tahrir Square.

200
0:10:32.461,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And that is Egyptians' elevated expectations

201
0:10:36.127,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are placed first on themselves.

202
0:10:39.494,000 --> 0:10:43,000
In the country once known for its passive resignation,

203
0:10:43.661,000 --> 0:10:44,000
where, as bad as things got,

204
0:10:45.527,000 --> 0:10:48,000
only four percent expressed their opinion to a public official,

205
0:10:48.996,000 --> 0:10:51,000
today 90 percent tell us

206
0:10:52.308,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that if there's a problem in their community,

207
0:10:54.58,000 --> 0:10:56,000
it's up to them to fix it.

208
0:10:57.013,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

209
0:11:04.706,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And three-fourths

210
0:11:06.509,000 --> 0:11:08,000
believe they not only have the responsibility,

211
0:11:09.34,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but the power to make change.

212
0:11:12.31,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And this empowerment

213
0:11:14.574,000 --> 0:11:16,000
also applies to women,

214
0:11:17.506,000 --> 0:11:18,000
whose role in the revolts

215
0:11:19.177,000 --> 0:11:21,000
cannot be underestimated.

216
0:11:21.328,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They were doctors and dissidents,

217
0:11:23.729,000 --> 0:11:24,000
artists and organizers.

218
0:11:25.295,000 --> 0:11:3,000
A full third of those who braved tanks and tear gas

219
0:11:30.428,000 --> 0:11:35,000
to ask or to demand liberty and justice in Egypt

220
0:11:35.463,000 --> 0:11:36,000
were women.

221
0:11:37.136,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Applause)

222
0:11:42.779,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now people have raised some real concerns

223
0:11:45.468,000 --> 0:11:48,000
about what the rise of Islamist parties means for women.

224
0:11:49.134,000 --> 0:11:53,000
What we've found about the role of religion in law

225
0:11:53.418,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and the role of religion in society

226
0:11:55.934,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is that there's no female consensus.

227
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We found that women in one country

228
0:12:03.103,000 --> 0:12:04,000
look more like the men in that country

229
0:12:05.07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
than their female counterparts across the border.

230
0:12:09.734,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Now what this suggests

231
0:12:11.252,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is that how women view religion's role in society

232
0:12:15.319,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is shaped more by their own country's culture and context

233
0:12:20.6,000 --> 0:12:22,000
than one monolithic view

234
0:12:23.115,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that religion is simply bad for women.

235
0:12:25.952,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Where women agree, however,

236
0:12:29.717,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is on their own role,

237
0:12:31.3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and that it must be central and active.

238
0:12:33.833,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And here is where we see the greatest gender difference within a country --

239
0:12:38.951,000 --> 0:12:4,000
on the issue of women's rights.

240
0:12:41.701,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Now how men feel about women's rights

241
0:12:44.301,000 --> 0:12:47,000
matters to the future of this region.

242
0:12:47.75,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Because we discovered a link

243
0:12:49.784,000 --> 0:12:53,000
between men's support for women's employment

244
0:12:53.786,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and how many women are actually employed

245
0:12:56.985,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in professional fields in that country.

246
0:13:00.169,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So the question becomes,

247
0:13:01.633,000 --> 0:13:05,000
What drives men's support for women's rights?

248
0:13:05.808,000 --> 0:13:11,000
What about men's views of religion and law?

249
0:13:12.557,000 --> 0:13:14,000
[Does] a man's opinion

250
0:13:15.442,000 --> 0:13:17,000
of the role of religion in politics

251
0:13:18.327,000 --> 0:13:21,000
shape their view of women's rights?

252
0:13:21.976,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The answer is no.

253
0:13:23.209,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We found absolutely no correlation,

254
0:13:26.094,000 --> 0:13:27,000
no impact whatsoever,

255
0:13:27.908,000 --> 0:13:29,000
between these two variables.

256
0:13:30.443,000 --> 0:13:33,000
What drives men's support for women's employment

257
0:13:34.159,000 --> 0:13:36,000
is men's employment,

258
0:13:37.043,000 --> 0:13:39,000
their level of education

259
0:13:39.542,000 --> 0:13:41,000
as well as a high score

260
0:13:42.327,000 --> 0:13:46,000
on their country's U.N. Human Development Index.

261
0:13:46.426,000 --> 0:13:47,000
What this means

262
0:13:47.617,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is that human development,

263
0:13:50.691,000 --> 0:13:52,000
not secularization,

264
0:13:52.987,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is what's key to women's empowerment

265
0:13:55.707,000 --> 0:13:58,000
in the transforming Middle East.

266
0:13:59.391,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And the transformation continues.

267
0:14:02.34,000 --> 0:14:05,000
From Wall Street to Mohammed Mahmoud Street,

268
0:14:06.223,000 --> 0:14:08,000
it has never been more important

269
0:14:08.28,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to understand the aspirations

270
0:14:10.624,000 --> 0:14:12,000
of ordinary people.

271
0:14:12.742,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Thank you.

272
0:14:14.473,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

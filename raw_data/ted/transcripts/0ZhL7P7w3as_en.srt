1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I just did something I've never done before.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now I'm not a scientist,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
from the University of South Florida

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in the Gulf of Mexico.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is the boat we were on, by the way.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The scientists I was with

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the birds, the turtles,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
They're looking at the really little stuff

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And what they're finding

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
which is very bad news,

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because so much life depends on it.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So contrary to what we heard a few months back

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
about how 75 percent of that oil

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
sort of magically disappeared

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and we didn't have to worry about it,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
this disaster is still unfolding.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's still working its way up the food chain.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Rachel Carson --

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the godmother of modern environmentalism --

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
warned us about this very thing

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
back in 1962.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
She pointed out that the "control men" --

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
as she called them --

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
who carpet-bombed towns and fields

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
with toxic insecticides like DDT,

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
not the birds.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But they forgot this:

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the fact that birds dine on grubs,

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that robins eat lots of worms

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
now saturated with DDT.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
songbirds died en masse,

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
towns fell silent.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Thus the title "Silent Spring."

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I've been trying to pinpoint

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
because I'm Canadian,

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I can draw no ancestral ties.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And I think what it is

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is I don't think we have fully come to terms

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
with the meaning of this disaster,

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with what it meant to witness a hole

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
ripped in our world,

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
gush forth on live TV,

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
24 hours a day,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
for months.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
After telling ourselves for so long

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that our tools and technology can control nature,

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
suddenly we were face-to-face

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
with our weakness,

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with our lack of control,

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
as the oil burst out

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of every attempt to contain it --

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"top hats," "top kills"

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and, most memorably, the "junk shot" --

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the bright idea

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of firing old tires and golf balls

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
down that hole in the world.

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But even more striking

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
than the ferocious power emanating from that well

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
was the recklessness

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
with which that power was unleashed --

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the carelessness, the lack of planning

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that characterized the operation

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
from drilling to clean-up.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
If there is one thing

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
BP's watery improv act made clear,

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
it is that, as a culture,

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we have become far too willing to gamble

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with things that are precious

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and irreplaceable,

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and to do so without a back-up plan,

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
without an exit strategy.

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And BP was hardly

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
our first experience of this in recent years.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Our leaders barrel into wars,

89
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
telling themselves happy stories

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
about cakewalks and welcome parades.

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Then, it is years of deadly damage control,

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Frankensteins of sieges and surges

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and counter-insurgencies,

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and once again, no exit strategy.

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Our financial wizards routinely fall victim

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to similar overconfidence,

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
convincing themselves that the latest bubble

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is a new kind of market --

99
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the kind that never goes down.

100
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And when it inevitably does,

101
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the best and the brightest

102
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in this case, throwing massive amounts

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of much-needed public money

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
down a very different kind of hole.

106
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
As with BP, the hole does get plugged,

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
at least temporarily,

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but not before

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
exacting a tremendous price.

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We have to figure out

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
why we keep letting this happen,

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because we are in the midst

113
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
deciding what to do, or not to do,

115
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
about climate change.

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now as you know,

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
a great deal of time is spent,

118
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in this country and around the world,

119
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
inside the climate debate,

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists

121
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
are all wrong?"

122
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now a far more relevant question --

123
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --

124
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is, "What if those scientists are right?"

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Given the stakes, the climate crisis

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
clearly calls for us to act

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
based on the precautionary principle --

128
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the theory that holds

129
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that when human health and the environment

130
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
are significantly at risk

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and when the potential damage is irreversible,

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we cannot afford to wait

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
for perfect scientific certainty.

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Better to err on the side of caution.

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
More overt, the burden of proving

136
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that a practice is safe

137
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,

138
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but rather on the industry that stands to profit.

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But climate policy in the wealthy world --

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to the extent that such a thing exists --

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is not based on precaution,

142
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but rather on cost-benefit analysis --

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
finding the course of action that economists believe

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
will have the least impact

145
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
on our GDP.

146
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
what can we do as quickly as possible

148
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to avoid potential catastrophe,

149
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we ask bizarre questions like this:

150
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"What is the latest possible moment we can wait

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
before we begin seriously lowering emissions?

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Can we put this off till 2020,

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
2030, 2050?"

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Or we ask,

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
"How much hotter can we let the planet get

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and still survive?

157
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --

158
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where we're currently going --

159
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
four degrees Celsius?"

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And by the way,

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the assumption that we can safely control

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the Earth's awesomely complex climate system

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
as if it had a thermostat,

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
making the planet not too hot, not too cold,

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --

166
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
this is pure fantasy,

167
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and it's not coming from the climate scientists.

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's coming from the economists

169
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
imposing their mechanistic thinking

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
on the science.

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
The fact is that we simply don't know

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
when the warming that we create

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
will be utterly overwhelmed

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
by feedback loops.

175
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So once again,

176
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
why do we take these crazy risks

177
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with the precious?

178
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
A range of explanations

179
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
may be popping into your mind by now,

180
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
like "greed."

181
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,

182
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because taking big risks, as we all know,

183
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
pays a lot of money.

184
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness

185
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is hubris.

186
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And greed and hubris

187
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
are intimately intertwined

188
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
when it comes to recklessness.

189
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker

190
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
taking home 100 times more

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
than a brain surgeon,

192
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
then you need a narrative,

193
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
you need a story

194
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that makes that disparity okay.

195
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And you actually don't have a lot of options.

196
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You're either an incredibly good scammer,

197
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --

198
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
or you're some kind of boy genius,

199
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the likes of which the world has never seen.

200
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --

201
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
are going to make you vastly overconfident

202
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and therefore more prone

203
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to taking even bigger risks in the future.

204
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,

205
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
had a plaque on his desk

206
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
inscribed with this inspirational slogan:

207
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"What would you attempt to do

208
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
if you knew you could not fail?"

209
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Now this is actually a popular plaque,

210
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and this is a crowd of overachievers,

211
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.

212
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Don't feel ashamed.

213
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Putting fear of failure out of your mind

214
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
can be a very good thing

215
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
if you're training for a triathlon

216
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
or preparing to give a TEDTalk,

217
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but personally, I think people with the power

218
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology

219
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
would do better having

220
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,

221
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because -- maybe not that one in particular --

222
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure

223
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
all of the time.

224
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So we have greed,

225
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we've got overconfidence/hubris,

226
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
but since we're here at TEDWomen,

227
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
let's consider one other factor

228
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that could be contributing in some small way

229
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to societal recklessness.

230
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now I'm not going to belabor this point,

231
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but studies do show that, as investors,

232
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
women are much less prone

233
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to taking reckless risks than men,

234
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
precisely because, as we've already heard,

235
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
women tend not to suffer from overconfidence

236
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in the same way that men do.

237
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So it turns out

238
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that being paid less and praised less

239
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
has its upsides --

240
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
for society at least.

241
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The flipside of this

242
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is that constantly being told

243
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that you are gifted, chosen

244
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and born to rule

245
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
has distinct societal downsides.

246
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" --

247
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
brings us closer, I think,

248
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to the root of our collective recklessness.

249
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Because none of us -- at least in the global North --

250
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
neither men nor women,

251
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
are fully exempt from this message.

252
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Here's what I'm talking about.

253
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Whether we actively believe them

254
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or consciously reject them,

255
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
our culture remains in the grips

256
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
of certain archetypal stories

257
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
about our supremacy

258
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
over others and over nature --

259
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the narrative of the newly discovered frontier

260
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and the conquering pioneer,

261
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the narrative of manifest destiny,

262
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.

263
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And just when you think these stories are fading into history,

264
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and that we've gotten over them,

265
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
they pop up in the strangest places.

266
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement

267
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
outside the women's washroom

268
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in the Kansas City airport.

269
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,

270
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and yes, it really does say,

271
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
"Slap Mother Nature in the face."

272
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --

273
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that's just a bonus.

274
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I'm showing it because --

275
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
they're not a sponsor, are they? --

276
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
because, in its own way,

277
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
this is a crass version

278
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
of our founding story.

279
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We slapped Mother Nature around and won,

280
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and we always win,

281
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
because dominating nature is our destiny.

282
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.

283
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
There's another one, equally important,

284
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
about how that very same Mother Nature

285
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
is so nurturing and so resilient

286
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that we can never make a dent in her abundance.

287
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.

288
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.

289
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it

290
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is tiny in relation to the total water volume."

291
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
In other words, the ocean is big;

292
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
she can take it.

293
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness

294
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that makes it possible

295
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to take the reckless risks that we do.

296
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Because this is our real master-narrative:

297
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
however much we mess up,

298
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
there will always be more --

299
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
more water, more land,

300
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
more untapped resources.

301
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
A new bubble will replace the old one.

302
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
A new technology will come along

303
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to fix the messes we made with the last one.

304
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
In a way, that is the story

305
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
of the settling of the Americas,

306
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the supposedly inexhaustible frontier

307
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to which Europeans escaped.

308
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And it's also the story of modern capitalism,

309
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because it was the wealth from this land

310
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that gave birth to our economic system,

311
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
one that cannot survive without perpetual growth

312
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and an unending supply

313
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
of new frontiers.

314
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now the problem is

315
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that the story was always a lie.

316
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The Earth always did have limits.

317
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
They were just beyond our sights.

318
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And now we are hitting those limits

319
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
on multiple fronts.

320
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I believe that we know this,

321
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.

322
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Not only do we continue to tell and retell

323
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
the same tired stories,

324
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but we are now doing so

325
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
with a frenzy and a fury

326
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that, frankly, verges on camp.

327
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
How else to explain the cultural space

328
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
occupied by Sarah Palin?

329
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now on the one hand,

330
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,"

331
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
because God put those resources into the ground

332
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in order for us to exploit them,

333
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and on the other, glorying in the wilderness

334
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
of Alaska's untouched beauty

335
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
on her hit reality TV show.

336
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.

337
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Ignore those creeping fears

338
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that we have finally hit the wall.

339
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
There are still no limits.

340
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
There will always be another frontier.

341
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So stop worrying and keep shopping.

342
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Now, would that this were just about

343
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.

344
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
In environmental circles,

345
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,

346
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
we are continuing with business as usual.

347
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This assessment, unfortunately,

348
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is far too optimistic.

349
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The truth is that we have already exhausted

350
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels

351
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that we have already entered

352
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
a far riskier business era,

353
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the era of extreme energy.

354
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,

355
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
including the icy Arctic seas,

356
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
where a clean-up may simply be impossible.

357
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas

358
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and massive strip-mining operations for coal,

359
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
the likes of which we haven't yet seen.

360
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And most controversially, it means the tar sands.

361
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I'm always surprised by how little

362
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
people outside of Canada

363
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
know about the Alberta Tar Sands,

364
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
which this year are projected to become

365
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
the number one source of imported oil

366
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to the United States.

367
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,

368
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because I believe it speaks to recklessness

369
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and the path we're on

370
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
like little else.

371
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So this is where the tar sands live,

372
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
under one of the last magnificent

373
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Boreal forests.

374
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
The oil is not liquid.

375
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.

376
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
Tar sand's oil is solid,

377
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
mixed in with the soil.

378
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So to get at it,

379
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
you first have to get rid of the trees.

380
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Then, you rip off the topsoil

381
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and get at that oily sand.

382
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
The process requires a huge amount of water,

383
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.

384
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
That's very bad news for local indigenous people

385
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
living downstream

386
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.

387
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Now looking at these images,

388
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,

389
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
which can already be seen from space

390
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and could grow to an area the size of England.

391
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I find it helps actually

392
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,

393
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
the largest ever built.

394
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
That's a person down there by the wheel.

395
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
My point is that

396
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
this is not oil drilling.

397
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It's not even mining.

398
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
It is terrestrial skinning.

399
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Vast, vivid landscapes

400
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
are being gutted,

401
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
left monochromatic gray.

402
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned

403
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
this would be an abomination

404
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
if it emitted not one particle of carbon.

405
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
But the truth is that, on average,

406
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
turning that gunk into crude oil

407
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution

408
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
than it does to produce conventional oil

409
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
in Canada.

410
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
How else to describe this,

411
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
but as a form of mass insanity?

412
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Just when we know we need to be learning

413
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
to live on the surface of our planet,

414
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
off the power of sun, wind and waves,

415
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we are frantically digging

416
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
to get at the dirtiest,

417
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
highest-emitting stuff imaginable.

418
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
This is where our story of endless growth

419
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
has taken us,

420
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
to this black hole at the center of my country --

421
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
a place of such planetary pain

422
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that, like the BP gusher,

423
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
one can only stand to look at it for so long.

424
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,

425
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
this is how civilizations commit suicide,

426
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
by slamming their foot on the accelerator

427
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
at the exact moment

428
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
when they should be putting on the brakes.

429
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
The problem is that our master-narrative

430
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
has an answer for that too.

431
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
At the very last minute, we are going to get saved

432
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
just like in every Hollywood movie,

433
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
just like in the Rapture.

434
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
But, of course, our secular religion is technology.

435
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Now, you may have noticed

436
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
more and more headlines like these.

437
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,

438
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
is that, as the planet heats up,

439
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles

440
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
into the stratosphere

441
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to reflect some of the sun's rays

442
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
back to space,

443
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
thereby cooling the planet.

444
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --

445
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
would put what is essentially a garden hose

446
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,

447
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
suspended by balloons,

448
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
to spew sulfur dioxide.

449
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.

450
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.

451
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
The serious scientists involved in this research

452
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
all stress that these techniques

453
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
are entirely untested.

454
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
They don't know if they'll work,

455
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and they have no idea

456
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.

457
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering

458
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
is being greeted in some circles,

459
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
particularly media circles,

460
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
with a relief tinged with euphoria.

461
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
An escape hatch has been reached.

462
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
A new frontier has been found.

463
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Most importantly,

464
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.

465
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
You see, for some people,

466
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.

467
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.

468
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
We badly need some new stories.

469
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
We need stories that have different kinds of heroes

470
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
willing to take different kinds of risks --

471
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
risks that confront recklessness head on,

472
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
that put the precautionary principle into practice,

473
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
even if that means through direct action --

474
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,

475
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
blocking dirty power plants

476
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.

477
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
We need stories

478
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
that replace that linear narrative of endless growth

479
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
with circular narratives

480
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
that remind us

481
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
that what goes around comes around.

482
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
That this is our only home.

483
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
There is no escape hatch.

484
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
Call it karma, call it physics,

485
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
action and reaction, call it precaution --

486
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
the principle that reminds us

487
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
that life is too precious to be risked

488
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
for any profit.

489
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Thank you.

490
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
(Applause)

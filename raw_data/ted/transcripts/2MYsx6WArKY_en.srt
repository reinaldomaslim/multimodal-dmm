1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I have a question for you:

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Are you religious?

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Please raise your hand right now

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
if you think of yourself as a religious person.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Let's see, I'd say about three or four percent.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I had no idea there were so many believers at a TED Conference.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Okay, here's another question:

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Do you think of yourself as spiritual

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in any way, shape or form? Raise your hand.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Okay, that's the majority.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
My Talk today

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is about the main reason, or one of the main reasons,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
why most people consider themselves

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to be spiritual in some way, shape or form.

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My Talk today is about self-transcendence.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's just a basic fact about being human

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that sometimes the self seems to just melt away.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And when that happens,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the feeling is ecstatic

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and we reach for metaphors of up and down

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to explain these feelings.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We talk about being uplifted

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or elevated.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now it's really hard to think about anything abstract like this

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
without a good concrete metaphor.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So here's the metaphor I'm offering today.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Think about the mind as being like a house with many rooms,

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
most of which we're very familiar with.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But sometimes it's as though a doorway appears

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
from out of nowhere

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and it opens onto a staircase.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We climb the staircase

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and experience a state of altered consciousness.

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In 1902,

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the great American psychologist William James

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
wrote about the many varieties of religious experience.

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
He collected all kinds of case studies.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
He quoted the words of all kinds of people

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
who'd had a variety of these experiences.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
One of the most exciting to me

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is this young man, Stephen Bradley,

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
had an encounter, he thought, with Jesus in 1820.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And here's what Bradley said about it.

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Music)

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Video) Stephen Bradley: I thought I saw the savior in human shape

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
for about one second in the room,

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
with arms extended,

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
appearing to say to me, "Come."

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The next day I rejoiced with trembling.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
My happiness was so great that I said I wanted to die.

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This world had no place in my affections.

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Previous to this time,

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I was very selfish and self-righteous.

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But now I desired the welfare of all mankind

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and could, with a feeling heart,

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
forgive my worst enemies.

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
JH: So note

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
how Bradley's petty, moralistic self

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
just dies on the way up the staircase.

61
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And on this higher level

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
he becomes loving and forgiving.

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The world's many religions have found so many ways

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to help people climb the staircase.

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Some shut down the self using meditation.

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Others use psychedelic drugs.

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is from a 16th century Aztec scroll

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
showing a man about to eat a psilocybin mushroom

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and at the same moment get yanked up the staircase by a god.

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Others use dancing, spinning and circling

71
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to promote self-transcendence.

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But you don't need a religion to get you through the staircase.

73
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Lots of people find self-transcendence in nature.

74
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Others overcome their self at raves.

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But here's the weirdest place of all:

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
war.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So many books about war say the same thing,

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that nothing brings people together

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
like war.

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And that bringing them together opens up the possibility

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
of extraordinary self-transcendent experiences.

82
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I'm going to play for you an excerpt

83
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from this book by Glenn Gray.

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Gray was a soldier in the American army in World War II.

85
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And after the war he interviewed a lot of other soldiers

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and wrote about the experience of men in battle.

87
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Here's a key passage

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
where he basically describes the staircase.

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Video) Glenn Gray: Many veterans will admit

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that the experience of communal effort in battle

91
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
has been the high point of their lives.

92
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"I" passes insensibly into a "we,"

93
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
"my" becomes "our"

94
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and individual faith

95
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
loses its central importance.

96
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I believe that it is nothing less

97
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
than the assurance of immortality

98
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that makes self-sacrifice at these moments

99
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
so relatively easy.

100
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I may fall, but I do not die,

101
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for that which is real in me goes forward

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and lives on in the comrades

103
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for whom I gave up my life.

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
JH: So what all of these cases have in common

105
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
is that the self seems to thin out, or melt away,

106
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and it feels good, it feels really good,

107
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in a way totally unlike anything we feel in our normal lives.

108
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It feels somehow uplifting.

109
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This idea that we move up was central in the writing

110
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of the great French sociologist Emile Durkheim.

111
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Durkheim even called us Homo duplex,

112
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or two-level man.

113
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The lower level he called the level of the profane.

114
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now profane is the opposite of sacred.

115
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It just means ordinary or common.

116
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And in our ordinary lives we exist as individuals.

117
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We want to satisfy our individual desires.

118
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We pursue our individual goals.

119
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But sometimes something happens

120
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that triggers a phase change.

121
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Individuals unite

122
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
into a team, a movement or a nation,

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
which is far more than the sum of its parts.

124
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Durkheim called this level the level of the sacred

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
because he believed that the function of religion

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
was to unite people into a group,

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
into a moral community.

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Durkheim believed that anything that unites us

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
takes on an air of sacredness.

130
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And once people circle around

131
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
some sacred object or value,

132
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
they'll then work as a team and fight to defend it.

133
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Durkheim wrote

134
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
about a set of intense collective emotions

135
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that accomplish this miracle of E pluribus unum,

136
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of making a group out of individuals.

137
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Think of the collective joy in Britain

138
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
on the day World War II ended.

139
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Think of the collective anger in Tahrir Square,

140
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which brought down a dictator.

141
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And think of the collective grief

142
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
in the United States

143
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that we all felt, that brought us all together,

144
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
after 9/11.

145
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So let me summarize where we are.

146
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I'm saying that the capacity for self-transcendence

147
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
is just a basic part of being human.

148
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'm offering the metaphor

149
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of a staircase in the mind.

150
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I'm saying we are Homo duplex

151
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and this staircase takes us up from the profane level

152
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to the level of the sacred.

153
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
When we climb that staircase,

154
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
self-interest fades away,

155
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we become just much less self-interested,

156
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and we feel as though we are better, nobler

157
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and somehow uplifted.

158
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So here's the million-dollar question

159
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
for social scientists like me:

160
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Is the staircase

161
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
a feature of our evolutionary design?

162
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Is it a product of natural selection,

163
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
like our hands?

164
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Or is it a bug, a mistake in the system --

165
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
this religious stuff is just something

166
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that happens when the wires cross in the brain --

167
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Jill has a stroke and she has this religious experience,

168
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it's just a mistake?

169
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Well many scientists who study religion take this view.

170
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The New Atheists, for example,

171
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
argue that religion is a set of memes,

172
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
sort of parasitic memes,

173
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that get inside our minds

174
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and make us do all kinds of crazy religious stuff,

175
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
self-destructive stuff, like suicide bombing.

176
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And after all,

177
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
how could it ever be good for us

178
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to lose ourselves?

179
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
How could it ever be adaptive

180
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
for any organism

181
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to overcome self-interest?

182
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Well let me show you.

183
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In "The Descent of Man,"

184
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Charles Darwin wrote a great deal

185
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
about the evolution of morality --

186
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
where did it come from, why do we have it.

187
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Darwin noted that many of our virtues

188
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
are of very little use to ourselves,

189
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but they're of great use to our groups.

190
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
He wrote about the scenario

191
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
in which two tribes of early humans

192
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
would have come in contact and competition.

193
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
He said, "If the one tribe included

194
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
a great number of courageous, sympathetic

195
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and faithful members

196
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who are always ready to aid and defend each other,

197
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
this tribe would succeed better

198
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and conquer the other."

199
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
He went on to say that "Selfish and contentious people

200
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
will not cohere,

201
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and without coherence

202
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
nothing can be effected."

203
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In other words,

204
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Charles Darwin believed

205
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in group selection.

206
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now this idea has been very controversial for the last 40 years,

207
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but it's about to make a major comeback this year,

208
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
especially after E.O. Wilson's book comes out in April,

209
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
making a very strong case

210
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that we, and several other species,

211
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
are products of group selection.

212
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But really the way to think about this

213
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is as multilevel selection.

214
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So look at it this way:

215
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You've got competition going on within groups and across groups.

216
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So here's a group of guys on a college crew team.

217
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Within this team

218
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
there's competition.

219
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There are guys competing with each other.

220
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The slowest rowers, the weakest rowers, are going to get cut from the team.

221
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And only a few of these guys are going to go on in the sport.

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Maybe one of them will make it to the Olympics.

223
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So within the team,

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
their interests are actually pitted against each other.

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And sometimes it would be advantageous

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for one of these guys

227
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to try to sabotage the other guys.

228
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Maybe he'll badmouth his chief rival

229
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to the coach.

230
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But while that competition is going on

231
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
within the boat,

232
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
this competition is going on across boats.

233
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat,

234
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
now they've got no choice but to cooperate

235
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because they're all in the same boat.

236
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
They can only win

237
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
if they all pull together as a team.

238
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I mean, these things sound trite,

239
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but they are deep evolutionary truths.

240
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The main argument against group selection

241
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
has always been

242
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that, well sure, it would be nice to have a group of cooperators,

243
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but as soon as you have a group of cooperators,

244
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they're just going to get taken over by free-riders,

245
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others.

246
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Let me illustrate this for you.

247
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Suppose we've got a group of little organisms --

248
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they can be bacteria, they can be hamsters; it doesn't matter what --

249
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and let's suppose that this little group here, they evolved to be cooperative.

250
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Well that's great. They graze, they defend each other,

251
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they work together, they generate wealth.

252
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And as you'll see in this simulation,

253
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
as they interact they gain points, as it were, they grow,

254
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and when they've doubled in size, you'll see them split,

255
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and that's how they reproduce and the population grows.

256
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But suppose then that one of them mutates.

257
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
There's a mutation in the gene

258
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and one of them mutates to follow a selfish strategy.

259
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It takes advantage of the others.

260
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And so when a green interacts with a blue,

261
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
you'll see the green gets larger and the blue gets smaller.

262
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So here's how things play out.

263
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We start with just one green,

264
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and as it interacts

265
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it gains wealth or points or food.

266
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And in short order, the cooperators are done for.

267
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The free-riders have taken over.

268
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
If a group cannot solve the free-rider problem

269
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
then it cannot reap the benefits of cooperation

270
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and group selection cannot get started.

271
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But there are solutions to the free-rider problem.

272
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's not that hard a problem.

273
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In fact, nature has solved it many, many times.

274
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And nature's favorite solution

275
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is to put everyone in the same boat.

276
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
For example,

277
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
why is it that the mitochondria in every cell

278
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
has its own DNA,

279
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
totally separate from the DNA in the nucleus?

280
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It's because they used to be

281
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
separate free-living bacteria

282
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and they came together

283
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and became a superorganism.

284
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Somehow or other -- maybe one swallowed another; we'll never know exactly why --

285
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but once they got a membrane around them,

286
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
they were all in the same membrane,

287
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
now all the wealth-created division of labor,

288
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
all the greatness created by cooperation,

289
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
stays locked inside the membrane

290
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and we've got a superorganism.

291
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And now let's rerun the simulation

292
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
putting one of these superorganisms

293
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
into a population of free-riders, of defectors, of cheaters

294
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and look what happens.

295
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
A superorganism can basically take what it wants.

296
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It's so big and powerful and efficient

297
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that it can take resources

298
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
from the greens, from the defectors, the cheaters.

299
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And pretty soon the whole population

300
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is actually composed of these new superorganisms.

301
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
What I've shown you here

302
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is sometimes called a major transition

303
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in evolutionary history.

304
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Darwin's laws don't change,

305
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but now there's a new kind of player on the field

306
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and things begin to look very different.

307
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now this transition was not a one-time freak of nature

308
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that just happened with some bacteria.

309
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It happened again

310
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
about 120 or a 140 million years ago

311
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
when some solitary wasps

312
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
began creating little simple, primitive

313
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
nests, or hives.

314
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Once several wasps were all together in the same hive,

315
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
they had no choice but to cooperate,

316
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because pretty soon they were locked into competition

317
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
with other hives.

318
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And the most cohesive hives won,

319
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
just as Darwin said.

320
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
These early wasps

321
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
gave rise to the bees and the ants

322
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that have covered the world

323
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and changed the biosphere.

324
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And it happened again,

325
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
even more spectacularly,

326
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
in the last half-million years

327
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
when our own ancestors

328
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
became cultural creatures,

329
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
they came together around a hearth or a campfire,

330
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
they divided labor,

331
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
they began painting their bodies, they spoke their own dialects,

332
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and eventually they worshiped their own gods.

333
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Once they were all in the same tribe,

334
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside.

335
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And they unlocked the most powerful force

336
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
ever known on this planet,

337
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
which is human cooperation --

338
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
a force for construction

339
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and destruction.

340
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Of course, human groups are nowhere near as cohesive

341
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
as beehives.

342
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Human groups may look like hives for brief moments,

343
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but they tend to then break apart.

344
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We're not locked into cooperation the way bees and ants are.

345
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
In fact, often,

346
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
as we've seen happen in a lot of the Arab Spring revolts,

347
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
often those divisions are along religious lines.

348
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Nonetheless, when people do come together

349
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and put themselves all into the same movement,

350
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
they can move mountains.

351
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Look at the people in these photos I've been showing you.

352
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Do you think they're there

353
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
pursuing their self-interest?

354
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Or are they pursuing communal interest,

355
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
which requires them to lose themselves

356
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and become simply a part of a whole?

357
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Okay, so that was my Talk

358
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
delivered in the standard TED way.

359
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And now I'm going to give the whole Talk over again

360
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in three minutes

361
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
in a more full-spectrum sort of way.

362
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Music)

363
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Video) Jonathan Haidt: We humans have many varieties

364
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
of religious experience,

365
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
as William James explained.

366
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
One of the most common is climbing the secret staircase

367
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and losing ourselves.

368
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
The staircase takes us

369
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
from the experience of life as profane or ordinary

370
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
upwards to the experience of life as sacred,

371
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
or deeply interconnected.

372
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We are Homo duplex,

373
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
as Durkheim explained.

374
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And we are Homo duplex

375
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
because we evolved by multilevel selection,

376
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
as Darwin explained.

377
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I can't be certain if the staircase is an adaptation

378
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
rather than a bug,

379
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
but if it is an adaptation,

380
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
then the implications are profound.

381
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
If it is an adaptation,

382
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
then we evolved to be religious.

383
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I don't mean that we evolved

384
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to join gigantic organized religions.

385
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Those things came along too recently.

386
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I mean that we evolved

387
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
to see sacredness all around us

388
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and to join with others into teams

389
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
and circle around sacred objects,

390
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
people and ideas.

391
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
This is why politics is so tribal.

392
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Politics is partly profane, it's partly about self-interest,

393
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but politics is also about sacredness.

394
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
It's about joining with others

395
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to pursue moral ideas.

396
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
It's about the eternal struggle between good and evil,

397
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and we all believe we're on the good team.

398
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And most importantly,

399
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
if the staircase is real,

400
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
it explains the persistent undercurrent

401
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
of dissatisfaction in modern life.

402
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Because human beings are, to some extent,

403
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
hivish creatures like bees.

404
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
We're bees. We busted out of the hive during the Enlightenment.

405
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
We broke down the old institutions

406
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and brought liberty to the oppressed.

407
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
We unleashed Earth-changing creativity

408
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and generated vast wealth and comfort.

409
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Nowadays we fly around

410
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
like individual bees exulting in our freedom.

411
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
But sometimes we wonder:

412
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Is this all there is?

413
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
What should I do with my life?

414
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
What's missing?

415
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
What's missing is that we are Homo duplex,

416
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
but modern, secular society was built

417
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
to satisfy our lower, profane selves.

418
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
It's really comfortable down here on the lower level.

419
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Come, have a seat in my home entertainment center.

420
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
One great challenge of modern life

421
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
is to find the staircase amid all the clutter

422
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and then to do something good and noble

423
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
once you climb to the top.

424
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I see this desire in my students at the University of Virginia.

425
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
They all want to find a cause or calling

426
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that they can throw themselves into.

427
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
They're all searching for their staircase.

428
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And that gives me hope

429
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
because people are not purely selfish.

430
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Most people long to overcome pettiness

431
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and become part of something larger.

432
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And this explains the extraordinary resonance

433
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
of this simple metaphor

434
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
conjured up nearly 400 years ago.

435
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
"No man is an island

436
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
entire of itself.

437
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Every man is a piece of the continent,

438
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
a part of the main."

439
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
JH: Thank you.

440
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
(Applause)

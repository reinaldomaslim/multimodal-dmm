2
0:00:16.837,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'd like to share with you

3
0:00:18.833,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the story of one of my patients called Celine.

4
0:00:22.67,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district

5
0:00:25.823,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of Cameroon in west Central Africa.

6
0:00:28.895,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Six years ago, at the time of her HIV diagnosis,

7
0:00:32.582,000 --> 0:00:35,000
she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial

8
0:00:35.583,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which was running in her health district at the time.

9
0:00:38.654,000 --> 0:00:41,000
When I first met Celine, a little over a year ago,

10
0:00:42.358,000 --> 0:00:43,000
she had gone for 18 months

11
0:00:44.042,000 --> 0:00:46,000
without any antiretroviral therapy,

12
0:00:46.329,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and she was very ill.

13
0:00:49.066,000 --> 0:00:51,000
She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic

14
0:00:51.464,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when the trial ended

15
0:00:53.015,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because she had no money for the bus fare

16
0:00:55.726,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance.

17
0:00:59.454,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now during the clinical trial,

18
0:01:01.198,000 --> 0:01:05,000
she'd been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge,

19
0:01:05.583,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and her transportation costs

20
0:01:07.614,000 --> 0:01:09,000
had been covered by the research funds.

21
0:01:10.221,000 --> 0:01:13,000
All of these ended once the trial was completed,

22
0:01:13.575,000 --> 0:01:15,000
leaving Celine with no alternatives.

23
0:01:16.567,000 --> 0:01:18,000
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs

24
0:01:19.243,000 --> 0:01:21,000
she'd received during the trial,

25
0:01:21.27,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or even what the trial had been about.

26
0:01:24.027,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I didn't bother to ask her what the results of the trial were

27
0:01:27.576,000 --> 0:01:31,000
because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue.

28
0:01:31.983,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Yet what puzzled me most

29
0:01:34.252,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was Celine had given her informed consent

30
0:01:37.359,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to be a part of this trial, yet she clearly did not understand

31
0:01:41.191,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the implications of being a participant

32
0:01:43.661,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed.

33
0:01:48.07,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, I have shared this story with you as an example

34
0:01:51.465,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial

35
0:01:54.394,000 --> 0:01:56,000
when it is poorly conducted.

36
0:01:56.853,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results.

37
0:02:00.718,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal.

38
0:02:04.407,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world

39
0:02:07.214,000 --> 0:02:12,000
on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients.

40
0:02:12.749,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But it would have done so at a price

41
0:02:15.535,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to hundreds of patients who, like Celine,

42
0:02:18.482,000 --> 0:02:2,000
were left to their own devices

43
0:02:20.726,000 --> 0:02:23,000
once the research had been completed.

44
0:02:23.797,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way

45
0:02:27.135,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that conducting HIV clinical trials

46
0:02:29.148,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in developing countries is bad.

47
0:02:31.363,000 --> 0:02:35,000
On the contrary, clinical trials are extremely useful tools,

48
0:02:35.73,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and are much needed to address the burden

49
0:02:38.028,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of disease in developing countries.

50
0:02:40.499,000 --> 0:02:42,000
However, the inequalities that exist between

51
0:02:43.358,000 --> 0:02:46,000
richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding

52
0:02:47.06,000 --> 0:02:5,000
pose a real risk for exploitation,

53
0:02:50.217,000 --> 0:02:53,000
especially in the context of externally-funded research.

54
0:02:54.102,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Sadly enough, the fact remains that

55
0:02:56.708,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries

56
0:03:00.692,000 --> 0:03:02,000
could never be authorized in the richer countries

57
0:03:03.268,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which fund the research.

58
0:03:05.516,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm sure you must be asking yourselves

59
0:03:07.763,000 --> 0:03:08,000
what makes developing countries,

60
0:03:09.679,000 --> 0:03:11,000
especially those in sub-Saharan Africa,

61
0:03:12.223,000 --> 0:03:15,000
so attractive for these HIV clinical trials?

62
0:03:15.79,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Well, in order for a clinical trial to generate

63
0:03:19.062,000 --> 0:03:22,000
valid and widely applicable results,

64
0:03:22.178,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants

65
0:03:26.178,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and preferably on a population

66
0:03:28.821,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with a high incidence of new HIV infections.

67
0:03:32.602,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description,

68
0:03:36.073,000 --> 0:03:39,000
with 22 million people living with HIV,

69
0:03:39.275,000 --> 0:03:42,000
an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people

70
0:03:42.915,000 --> 0:03:44,000
who are infected worldwide.

71
0:03:45.396,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Also, research within the continent

72
0:03:47.826,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty,

73
0:03:51.938,000 --> 0:03:54,000
endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems.

74
0:03:55.789,000 --> 0:03:57,000
A clinical trial that is considered to be

75
0:03:58.578,000 --> 0:04:,000
potentially beneficial to the population

76
0:04:01.328,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is more likely to be authorized,

77
0:04:03.635,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and in the absence of good health care systems,

78
0:04:06.435,000 --> 0:04:08,000
almost any offer of medical assistance

79
0:04:09.389,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is accepted as better than nothing.

80
0:04:12.307,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Even more problematic reasons include

81
0:04:14.893,000 --> 0:04:16,000
lower risk of litigation,

82
0:04:17.18,000 --> 0:04:19,000
less rigorous ethical reviews,

83
0:04:19.647,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and populations that are willing to participate

84
0:04:22.203,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in almost any study that hints at a cure.

85
0:04:26.867,000 --> 0:04:29,000
As funding for HIV research

86
0:04:30.492,000 --> 0:04:32,000
increases in developing countries

87
0:04:32.748,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and ethical review in richer countries become more strict,

88
0:04:36.755,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you can see why this context becomes

89
0:04:38.84,000 --> 0:04:4,000
very, very attractive.

90
0:04:41.401,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers

91
0:04:45.081,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable

92
0:04:49.565,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but on many levels ethically questionable.

93
0:04:52.844,000 --> 0:04:55,000
How then can we ensure that, in our search for the cure,

94
0:04:56.283,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we do not take an unfair advantage

95
0:04:58.603,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of those who are already most affected by the pandemic?

96
0:05:02.107,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on

97
0:05:05.963,000 --> 0:05:08,000
in order to improve the way in which things are done.

98
0:05:09.538,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The first of these is informed consent.

99
0:05:12.365,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, in order for a clinical trial to be

100
0:05:14.733,000 --> 0:05:17,000
considered ethically acceptable,

101
0:05:18.414,000 --> 0:05:2,000
participants must be given the relevant information

102
0:05:21.238,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in a way in which they can understand,

103
0:05:23.673,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and must freely consent to participate in the trial.

104
0:05:27.89,000 --> 0:05:29,000
This is especially important in developing countries,

105
0:05:30.568,000 --> 0:05:32,000
where a lot of participants consent to research

106
0:05:33.47,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because they believe it is the only way in which

107
0:05:36.158,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they can receive medical care or other benefits.

108
0:05:39.728,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Consent procedures that are used in richer countries

109
0:05:42.695,000 --> 0:05:44,000
are often inappropriate or ineffective

110
0:05:45.497,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in a lot of developing countries.

111
0:05:47.85,000 --> 0:05:49,000
For example, it is counterintuitive to have

112
0:05:50.823,000 --> 0:05:52,000
an illiterate study participant, like Celine,

113
0:05:53.822,000 --> 0:05:56,000
sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read,

114
0:05:57.149,000 --> 0:05:59,000
let alone understand.

115
0:05:59.256,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Local communities need to be more involved

116
0:06:02.336,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants

117
0:06:05.609,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in clinical trials, as well as the incentives for participation.

118
0:06:10.31,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The information in these trials

119
0:06:12.126,000 --> 0:06:14,000
needs to be given to the potential participants

120
0:06:15.077,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats.

121
0:06:19.505,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The second point I would like for you to consider

122
0:06:22.326,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is the standard of care that is provided

123
0:06:24.764,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to participants within any clinical trial.

124
0:06:27.71,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now, this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy.

125
0:06:31.407,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Should the control group in the clinical trial

126
0:06:34.388,000 --> 0:06:37,000
be given the best current treatment which is available

127
0:06:37.661,000 --> 0:06:39,000
anywhere in the world?

128
0:06:39.741,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Or should they be given an alternative standard of care,

129
0:06:42.709,000 --> 0:06:44,000
such as the best current treatment available

130
0:06:45.597,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in the country in which the research is being conducted?

131
0:06:48.909,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen

132
0:06:52.249,000 --> 0:06:55,000
which may not be affordable or accessible

133
0:06:55.325,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to the study participants once the research has been completed?

134
0:06:59.295,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now, in a situation where the best current treatment

135
0:07:03.036,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is inexpensive and simple to deliver,

136
0:07:05.675,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the answer is straightforward.

137
0:07:07.703,000 --> 0:07:1,000
However, the best current treatment available

138
0:07:10.853,000 --> 0:07:12,000
anywhere in the world is often very difficult

139
0:07:13.74,000 --> 0:07:15,000
to provide in developing countries.

140
0:07:16.427,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits

141
0:07:19.979,000 --> 0:07:21,000
of the standard of care which is to be provided

142
0:07:22.756,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to participants in any clinical trial,

143
0:07:25.237,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study

144
0:07:30.685,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and most beneficial for the participants within the study.

145
0:07:34.182,000 --> 0:07:37,000
That brings us to the third point I want you think about:

146
0:07:37.433,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the ethical review of research.

147
0:07:40.284,000 --> 0:07:43,000
An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability

148
0:07:44.083,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants

149
0:07:48.211,000 --> 0:07:5,000
within any clinical trial.

150
0:07:50.324,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Unfortunately, this is often lacking

151
0:07:53.236,000 --> 0:07:56,000
or inefficient in a lot of developing countries.

152
0:07:56.764,000 --> 0:08:,000
Local governments need to set up effective systems

153
0:08:01.127,000 --> 0:08:03,000
for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials

154
0:08:04.004,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which are authorized in different developing countries,

155
0:08:07.921,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they need to do this by setting up

156
0:08:10.195,000 --> 0:08:12,000
ethical review committees that are independent

157
0:08:12.705,000 --> 0:08:15,000
of the government and research sponsors.

158
0:08:16.09,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Public accountability needs to be promoted

159
0:08:18.5,000 --> 0:08:21,000
through transparency and independent review

160
0:08:21.733,000 --> 0:08:24,000
by nongovernmental and international organizations

161
0:08:24.772,000 --> 0:08:25,000
as appropriate.

162
0:08:26.343,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The final point I would like for you to consider tonight

163
0:08:29.853,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is what happens to participants in the clinical trial

164
0:08:33.076,000 --> 0:08:35,000
once the research has been completed.

165
0:08:35.851,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin

166
0:08:39.325,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in the first place without a clear plan

167
0:08:41.837,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for what would happen to the participants

168
0:08:43.916,000 --> 0:08:45,000
once the trial has ended.

169
0:08:46.356,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, researchers need to make every effort to ensure that

170
0:08:51.484,000 --> 0:08:53,000
an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial

171
0:08:54.468,000 --> 0:08:55,000
during a clinical trial

172
0:08:56.2,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is accessible to the participants of the trial

173
0:08:59.812,000 --> 0:09:01,000
once the trial has been completed.

174
0:09:02.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In addition, they should be able to consider the possibility

175
0:09:05.884,000 --> 0:09:08,000
of introducing and maintaining effective treatments

176
0:09:09.485,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in the wider community once the trial ends.

177
0:09:13.326,000 --> 0:09:16,000
If, for any reason, they feel that this might not be possible,

178
0:09:16.749,000 --> 0:09:18,000
then I think they should have to ethically justify

179
0:09:19.716,000 --> 0:09:23,000
why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place.

180
0:09:23.743,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Now, fortunately for Celine,

181
0:09:26.059,000 --> 0:09:28,000
our meeting did not end in my office.

182
0:09:28.734,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program

183
0:09:33.108,000 --> 0:09:34,000
closer to her home,

184
0:09:34.496,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and with a support group to help her cope.

185
0:09:38.27,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Her story has a positive ending,

186
0:09:40.604,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but there are thousands of others in similar situations

187
0:09:44.307,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who are much less fortunate.

188
0:09:46.604,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Although she may not know this,

189
0:09:49.028,000 --> 0:09:52,000
my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way

190
0:09:52.893,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries,

191
0:09:57.164,000 --> 0:10:,000
and made me even more determined to be part of the movement

192
0:10:00.884,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to change the way in which things are done.

193
0:10:03.741,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I believe that every single person

194
0:10:06.109,000 --> 0:10:1,000
listening to me tonight can be part of that change.

195
0:10:10.484,000 --> 0:10:12,000
If you are a researcher, I hold you

196
0:10:13.081,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to a higher standard of moral conscience,

197
0:10:15.651,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to remain ethical in your research,

198
0:10:18.078,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers.

199
0:10:21.566,000 --> 0:10:24,000
If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company,

200
0:10:25.244,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I challenge you to hold your employers

201
0:10:28.274,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to fund research that is ethically sound.

202
0:10:31.449,000 --> 0:10:34,000
If you come from a developing country like myself,

203
0:10:34.635,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I urge you to hold your government

204
0:10:37.707,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to a more thorough review of the clinical trials

205
0:10:40.323,000 --> 0:10:42,000
which are authorized in your country.

206
0:10:43.236,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Yes, there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV,

207
0:10:46.904,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to find an effective vaccine for malaria,

208
0:10:49.556,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B.,

209
0:10:53.398,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly

210
0:10:56.973,000 --> 0:11:,000
and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials

211
0:11:01.028,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to do this in a humane way.

212
0:11:03.254,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Thank you.

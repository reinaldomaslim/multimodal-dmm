1
0:00:14.349,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We have all probably wondered

2
0:00:17.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
how great minds achieved what they achieved, right?

3
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the more astonishing their achievements are,

4
0:00:24.12,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the more we call them geniuses,

5
0:00:26.68,000 --> 0:00:27,000
perhaps aliens

6
0:00:28.239,000 --> 0:00:3,000
coming from a different planet,

7
0:00:30.36,000 --> 0:00:32,000
definitely not someone like us.

8
0:00:33.04,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But is that true?

9
0:00:34.84,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So let me start with an example.

10
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You all know the story of Newton's apple, right? OK.

11
0:00:41.28,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Is that true? Probably not.

12
0:00:44.24,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Still, it's difficult to think that no apple at all was there.

13
0:00:49.48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I mean some stepping stone, some specific conditions

14
0:00:53.12,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that made universal gravitation not impossible to conceive.

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And definitely this was not impossible,

16
0:00:59.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
at least for Newton.

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It was possible,

18
0:01:02.44,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and for some reason, it was also there,

19
0:01:05.52,000 --> 0:01:08,000
available at some point, easy to pick as an apple.

20
0:01:09.32,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Here is the apple.

21
0:01:10.96,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And what about Einstein?

22
0:01:13.2,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Was relativity theory another big leap in the history of ideas

23
0:01:18.52,000 --> 0:01:2,000
no one else could even conceive?

24
0:01:21.2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Or rather, was it again something adjacent and possible,

25
0:01:25.68,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to Einstein of course,

26
0:01:27.8,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and he got there by small steps and his very peculiar scientific path?

27
0:01:32.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Of course we cannot conceive this path,

28
0:01:34.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but this doesn't mean that the path was not there.

29
0:01:38.76,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So all of this seems very evocative,

30
0:01:43.64,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but I would say hardly concrete

31
0:01:45.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
if we really want to grasp the origin of great ideas

32
0:01:48.8,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and more generally the way in which the new enters our lives.

33
0:01:52.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
As a physicist, as a scientist,

34
0:01:54.84,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I have learned that posing the right questions

35
0:01:57.04,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is half of the solution.

36
0:01:59.08,000 --> 0:02:03,000
But I think now we start having a great conceptual framework

37
0:02:03.84,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to conceive and address the right questions.

38
0:02:07.04,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So let me drive you to the edge of what is known,

39
0:02:10.52,000 --> 0:02:12,000
or at least, what I know,

40
0:02:12.64,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and let me show you that what is known

41
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:18,000
could be a powerful and fascinating starting point

42
0:02:19.32,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to grasp the deep meaning of words like novelty, innovation,

43
0:02:24.44,000 --> 0:02:25,000
creativity perhaps.

44
0:02:26.88,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So we are discussing the "new,"

45
0:02:30.24,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and of course, the science behind it.

46
0:02:32.92,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The new can enter our lives in many different ways,

47
0:02:35.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
can be very personal,

48
0:02:37.64,000 --> 0:02:38,000
like I meet a new person,

49
0:02:39.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I read a new book, or I listen to a new song.

50
0:02:42.92,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Or it could be global,

51
0:02:44.2,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I mean, something we call innovation.

52
0:02:46.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It could be a new theory, a new technology,

53
0:02:48.48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but it could also be a new book if you're the writer,

54
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or it could be a new song if you're the composer.

55
0:02:53.44,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In all of these global cases, the new is for everyone,

56
0:02:57.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
but experiencing the new can be also frightening,

57
0:03:01.6,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so the new can also frighten us.

58
0:03:05.36,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But still, experiencing the new means exploring a very peculiar space,

59
0:03:09.56,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the space of what could be,

60
0:03:11.68,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the space of the possible, the space of possibilities.

61
0:03:14.88,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's a very weird space, so I'll try to get you through this space.

62
0:03:18.36,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So it could be a physical space.

63
0:03:20.4,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So in this case, for instance,

64
0:03:22.04,000 --> 0:03:26,000
novelty could be climbing Machu Picchu for the first time,

65
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
as I did in 2016.

66
0:03:28.96,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It could be a conceptual space,

67
0:03:30.8,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so acquiring new information, making sense of it, in a word, learning.

68
0:03:35.24,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It could be a biological space.

69
0:03:37.2,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I mean, think about the never-ending fight of viruses and bacteria

70
0:03:41.32,000 --> 0:03:42,000
with our immune system.

71
0:03:43.28,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And now comes the bad news.

72
0:03:45.04,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We are very, very bad at grasping this space.

73
0:03:48.36,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Think of it. Let's make an experiment.

74
0:03:50.4,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Try to think about all the possible things you could do in the next, say, 24 hours.

75
0:03:58.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
Here the key word is "all."

76
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Of course you can conceive a few options, like having a drink, writing a letter,

77
0:04:06.84,000 --> 0:04:09,000
also sleeping during this boring talk,

78
0:04:10.04,000 --> 0:04:11,000
if you can.

79
0:04:11.76,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But not all of them.

80
0:04:13.44,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So think about an alien invasion, now, here, in Milan,

81
0:04:17.4,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or me -- I stopped thinking for 15 minutes.

82
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So it's very difficult to conceive this space,

83
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but actually we have an excuse.

84
0:04:26.8,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So it's not so easy to conceive this space

85
0:04:30.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because we are trying to conceive the occurrence of something brand new,

86
0:04:33.839,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so something that never occurred before,

87
0:04:35.84,000 --> 0:04:36,000
so we don't have clues.

88
0:04:38.04,000 --> 0:04:4,000
A typical solution could be

89
0:04:40.96,000 --> 0:04:43,000
looking at the future with the eyes of the past,

90
0:04:44.2,000 --> 0:04:47,000
so relying on all the time series of past events

91
0:04:47.52,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and hoping that this is enough to predict the future.

92
0:04:51.04,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But we know this is not working.

93
0:04:53.24,000 --> 0:04:58,000
For instance, this was the first attempt for weather forecasts, and it failed.

94
0:04:58.48,000 --> 0:05:,000
And it failed because of the great complexity

95
0:05:00.92,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of the underlying phenomenon.

96
0:05:02.88,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So now we know that predictions had to be based on modeling,

97
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:11,000
which means creating a synthetic model of the system,

98
0:05:12.04,000 --> 0:05:16,000
simulating this model and then projecting the system

99
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:18,000
into the future through this model.

100
0:05:18.76,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And now we can do this in a lot of cases

101
0:05:21.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
with the help of a lot of data.

102
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Looking at the future with the eye of the past

103
0:05:27.92,000 --> 0:05:29,000
could be misleading also for machines.

104
0:05:30.68,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Think about it.

105
0:05:31.92,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now picture yourself for a second in the middle of the Australian Outback.

106
0:05:37.44,000 --> 0:05:39,000
You stand there under the sun.

107
0:05:40.84,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So you see something weird happening.

108
0:05:43.08,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The car suddenly stops

109
0:05:45.84,000 --> 0:05:48,000
very, very far from a kangaroo crossing the street.

110
0:05:48.92,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You look closer

111
0:05:50.4,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and you realize that the car has no driver.

112
0:05:52.84,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It is not restarting, even after the kangaroo is not there anymore.

113
0:05:56.88,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So for some reasons,

114
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:,000
the algorithms driving the car cannot make sense

115
0:06:01.36,000 --> 0:06:04,000
of this strange beast jumping here and there on the street.

116
0:06:05.64,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So it just stops.

117
0:06:07.72,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now, I should tell you, this is a true story.

118
0:06:09.88,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It happened a few months ago to Volvo's self-driving cars

119
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in the middle of the Australian Outback.

120
0:06:14.56,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:16.28,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It is a general problem,

122
0:06:18.28,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and I guess this will affect more and more in the near future

123
0:06:21.28,000 --> 0:06:23,000
artificial intelligence and machine learning.

124
0:06:24.44,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's also a very old problem, I would say 17th century,

125
0:06:28.44,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but I guess now we have new tools and new clues to start solving it.

126
0:06:33.6,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So let me take a step back,

127
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:37,000
five years back.

128
0:06:38.56,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Italy. Rome. Winter.

129
0:06:41.56,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So the winter of 2012 was very special in Rome.

130
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Rome witnessed one of the greatest snowfalls of its history.

131
0:06:49.52,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That winter was special also for me and my colleagues,

132
0:06:53.24,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because we had an insight about the possible mathematical scheme --

133
0:06:56.76,000 --> 0:06:58,000
again, possible, possible mathematical scheme,

134
0:06:59.76,000 --> 0:07:,000
to conceive the occurrence of the new.

135
0:07:02.52,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I remember that day because it was snowing,

136
0:07:04.96,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so due to the snowfall, we were blocked, stuck in my department,

137
0:07:08.76,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and we couldn't go home,

138
0:07:10.2,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so we got another coffee, we relaxed

139
0:07:13.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and we kept discussing.

140
0:07:15.08,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But at some point -- maybe not that date, precisely --

141
0:07:18.8,000 --> 0:07:2,000
at some point we made the connection

142
0:07:21.72,000 --> 0:07:23,000
between the problem of the new

143
0:07:24.72,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and a beautiful concept proposed years before

144
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
by Stuart Kauffman,

145
0:07:28.96,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the adjacent possible.

146
0:07:31.72,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So the adjacent possible consists of all those things.

147
0:07:34.8,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It could be ideas, it could be molecules, it could be technological products

148
0:07:38.56,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that are one step away

149
0:07:41.52,000 --> 0:07:42,000
from what actually exists,

150
0:07:43.28,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and you can achieve them through incremental modifications

151
0:07:46.84,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and recombinations of the existing material.

152
0:07:50.52,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So for instance, if I speak about the space of my friends,

153
0:07:54.44,000 --> 0:07:57,000
my adjacent possible would be the set of all friends of my friends

154
0:07:58.44,000 --> 0:07:59,000
not already my friends.

155
0:08:00.24,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I hope that's clear.

156
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But now if I meet a new person,

157
0:08:03.84,000 --> 0:08:04,000
say Briar,

158
0:08:05.56,000 --> 0:08:09,000
all her friends would immediately enter my adjacent possible,

159
0:08:09.64,000 --> 0:08:1,000
pushing its boundaries further.

160
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So if you really want to look from the mathematical point of view --

161
0:08:15.4,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm sure you want --

162
0:08:18.2,000 --> 0:08:19,000
you can actually look at this picture.

163
0:08:20.2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So suppose now this is your universe.

164
0:08:22.12,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I know I'm asking a lot.

165
0:08:23.4,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I mean, this is your universe. Now you are the red spot.

166
0:08:27.32,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And the green spot is the adjacent possible for you,

167
0:08:29.96,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so something you've never touched before.

168
0:08:32.08,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So you do your normal life.

169
0:08:33.44,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You move. You move in the space.

170
0:08:35.12,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You have a drink. You meet friends. You read a book.

171
0:08:37.8,000 --> 0:08:39,000
At some point, you end up on the green spot,

172
0:08:40.72,000 --> 0:08:42,000
so you meet Briar for the first time.

173
0:08:42.92,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And what happens?

174
0:08:44.28,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So what happens is there is a new part,

175
0:08:46.6,000 --> 0:08:48,000
a brand new part of the space,

176
0:08:49.08,000 --> 0:08:53,000
becoming possible for you in this very moment,

177
0:08:53.36,000 --> 0:08:56,000
even without any possibility for you to foresee this

178
0:08:57.24,000 --> 0:08:59,000
before touching that point.

179
0:08:59.32,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And behind this there will be a huge set of points

180
0:09:02.04,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that could become possible at some later stages.

181
0:09:05.76,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So you see the space of the possible is very peculiar,

182
0:09:08.6,000 --> 0:09:1,000
because it's not predefined.

183
0:09:10.84,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's not something we can predefine.

184
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's something that gets continuously shaped and reshaped

185
0:09:16.56,000 --> 0:09:18,000
by our actions and our choices.

186
0:09:20.12,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we were so fascinated by these connections we made --

187
0:09:23.6,000 --> 0:09:24,000
scientists are like this.

188
0:09:25.52,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And based on this,

189
0:09:27.84,000 --> 0:09:3,000
we conceived our mathematical formulation for the adjacent possible,

190
0:09:31.08,000 --> 0:09:34,000
20 years after the original Kauffman proposals.

191
0:09:34.56,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In our theory -- this is a key point --

192
0:09:36.72,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I mean, it's crucially based on a complex interplay

193
0:09:40.28,000 --> 0:09:44,000
between the way in which this space of possibilities expands

194
0:09:45.08,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and gets restructured,

195
0:09:46.64,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and the way in which we explore it.

196
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
After the epiphany of 2012,

197
0:09:53.04,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we got back to work, real work,

198
0:09:54.72,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because we had to work out this theory,

199
0:09:56.64,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and we came up with a certain number of predictions

200
0:09:59.08,000 --> 0:10:,000
to be tested in real life.

201
0:10:00.36,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Of course, we need a testable framework

202
0:10:03.28,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to study innovation.

203
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So let me drive you across a few predictions we made.

204
0:10:08.84,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The first one concerns the pace of innovation,

205
0:10:11.76,000 --> 0:10:15,000
so the rate at which you observe novelties in very different systems.

206
0:10:16.68,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So our theory predicts that the rate of innovation

207
0:10:19.2,000 --> 0:10:2,000
should follow a universal curve,

208
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
like this one.

209
0:10:23.24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This is the rate of innovation versus time in very different conditions.

210
0:10:27.72,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And somehow, we predict that the rate of innovation

211
0:10:30.36,000 --> 0:10:32,000
should decrease steadily over time.

212
0:10:33.08,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So somehow, innovation is predicted to become more difficult

213
0:10:36.2,000 --> 0:10:37,000
as your progress over time.

214
0:10:38.96,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's neat. It's interesting. It's beautiful. We were happy.

215
0:10:42.52,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But the question is, is that true?

216
0:10:44.72,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Of course we should check with reality.

217
0:10:47.6,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So we went back to reality

218
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and we collected a lot of data, terabytes of data,

219
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
tracking innovation in Wikipedia, Twitter,

220
0:10:56.52,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the way in which we write free software,

221
0:10:58.76,000 --> 0:10:59,000
even the way we listen to music.

222
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I cannot tell you, we were so amazed and pleased and thrilled

223
0:11:04.92,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to discover that the same predictions we made in the theory

224
0:11:08.44,000 --> 0:11:1,000
were actually satisfied in real systems,

225
0:11:11.04,000 --> 0:11:12,000
many different real systems.

226
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We were so excited.

227
0:11:14.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Of course, apparently, we were on the right track,

228
0:11:16.96,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but of course, we couldn't stop,

229
0:11:19.48,000 --> 0:11:2,000
so we didn't stop.

230
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So we kept going on,

231
0:11:23.12,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and at some point we made another discovery

232
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that we dubbed "correlated novelties."

233
0:11:28.76,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It's very simple.

234
0:11:30.04,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So I guess we all experience this.

235
0:11:31.96,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So you listen to "Suzanne" by Leonard Cohen,

236
0:11:36.44,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and this experience triggers your passion for Cohen

237
0:11:40.12,000 --> 0:11:43,000
so that you start frantically listening to his whole production.

238
0:11:43.96,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And then you realize that Fabrizio De André here

239
0:11:46.28,000 --> 0:11:47,000
recorded an Italian version of "Suzanne,"

240
0:11:48.28,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and so on and so forth.

241
0:11:50.32,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So somehow for some reason,

242
0:11:52.32,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the very notion of adjacent possible is already encoding the common belief

243
0:11:56.24,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that one thing leads to another

244
0:11:59.72,000 --> 0:12:,000
in many different systems.

245
0:12:01.48,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But the reason why we were thrilled

246
0:12:03.8,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is because actually we could give, for the first time,

247
0:12:06.348,000 --> 0:12:08,000
a scientific substance to this intuition

248
0:12:08.44,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and start making predictions

249
0:12:10.12,000 --> 0:12:12,000
about the way in which we experience the new.

250
0:12:12.56,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So novelties are correlated.

251
0:12:16.32,000 --> 0:12:18,000
They are not occurring randomly.

252
0:12:18.4,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And this is good news,

253
0:12:19.88,000 --> 0:12:23,000
because it implies that impossible missions

254
0:12:24.64,000 --> 0:12:26,000
might not be so impossible after all,

255
0:12:27.04,000 --> 0:12:3,000
if we are guided by our intuition,

256
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
somehow leading us to trigger a positive chain reaction.

257
0:12:34.84,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But there is a third consequence of the existence of the adjacent possible

258
0:12:38.36,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that we named "waves of novelties."

259
0:12:41.92,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So just to make this simple, so in music,

260
0:12:44.64,000 --> 0:12:45,000
without waves of novelties,

261
0:12:46.04,000 --> 0:12:52,000
we would still be listening all the time to Mozart or Beethoven,

262
0:12:52.12,000 --> 0:12:53,000
which is great,

263
0:12:53.64,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but we don't do this all the time.

264
0:12:55.32,000 --> 0:13:,000
We also listen to the Pet Shop Boys or Justin Bieber -- well, some of us do.

265
0:13:00.36,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter)

266
0:13:02.56,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So we could see very clearly all of these patterns

267
0:13:06.48,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in the huge amounts of data we collected and analyzed.

268
0:13:10.24,000 --> 0:13:13,000
For instance, we discovered that popular hits in music

269
0:13:13.92,000 --> 0:13:14,000
are continuously born, you know that,

270
0:13:15.84,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and then they disappear, still leaving room for evergreens.

271
0:13:20.12,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So somehow waves of novelties ebb and flow

272
0:13:23.24,000 --> 0:13:25,000
while the tides always hold the classics.

273
0:13:25.84,000 --> 0:13:28,000
There is this coexistence between evergreens and new hits.

274
0:13:31.92,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Not only our theory predicts these waves of novelties.

275
0:13:34.64,000 --> 0:13:35,000
This would be trivial.

276
0:13:36.12,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But it also explains why they are there,

277
0:13:39.04,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and they are there for a specific reason,

278
0:13:41.04,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because we as humans display different strategies

279
0:13:44.28,000 --> 0:13:45,000
in the space of the possible.

280
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So some of us tend to retrace already known paths.

281
0:13:51.32,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So we say they exploit.

282
0:13:54.36,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Some of us always launch into new adventures.

283
0:13:57.24,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We say they explore.

284
0:13:58.96,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And what we discovered is all the systems we investigated

285
0:14:02.28,000 --> 0:14:05,000
are right at the edge between these two strategies,

286
0:14:05.48,000 --> 0:14:08,000
something like 80 percent exploiting, 20 percent exploring,

287
0:14:09.04,000 --> 0:14:11,000
something like blade runners of innovation.

288
0:14:12.72,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So it seems that the wise balance, you could also say a conservative balance,

289
0:14:17.96,000 --> 0:14:21,000
between past and future, between exploitation and exploration,

290
0:14:22.96,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is already in place and perhaps needed in our system.

291
0:14:26.4,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But again the good news is now we have scientific tools

292
0:14:30.04,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to investigate this equilibrium,

293
0:14:31.8,000 --> 0:14:34,000
perhaps pushing it further in the near future.

294
0:14:37.36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So as you can imagine,

295
0:14:39.64,000 --> 0:14:43,000
I was really fascinated by all this.

296
0:14:44.92,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Our mathematical scheme is already providing cues and hints

297
0:14:48.08,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to investigate the space of possibilities

298
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and the way in which all of us create it and explore it.

299
0:14:54.2,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But there is more.

300
0:14:55.56,000 --> 0:14:58,000
This, I guess, is a starting point of something that has the potential

301
0:14:58.96,000 --> 0:15:02,000
to become a wonderful journey for a scientific investigation of the new,

302
0:15:03.6,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but also I would say a personal investigation of the new.

303
0:15:09.32,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And I guess this can have a lot of consequences

304
0:15:12.24,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and a huge impact in key activities

305
0:15:14.4,000 --> 0:15:19,000
like learning, education, research, business.

306
0:15:20.68,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So for instance, if you think about artificial intelligence,

307
0:15:23.6,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I am sure -- I mean, artificial intelligence,

308
0:15:25.76,000 --> 0:15:26,000
we need to rely in the near future

309
0:15:27.6,000 --> 0:15:3,000
more and more on the structure of the adjacent possible,

310
0:15:31.44,000 --> 0:15:32,000
to restructure it, to change it,

311
0:15:33.4,000 --> 0:15:35,000
but also to cope with the unknowns of the future.

312
0:15:36.4,000 --> 0:15:37,000
In parallel, we have a lot of tools,

313
0:15:38.28,000 --> 0:15:41,000
new tools now, to investigate how creativity works

314
0:15:41.8,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and what triggers innovation.

315
0:15:44.08,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And the aim of all this is to raise a generation of people

316
0:15:47.28,000 --> 0:15:5,000
able to come up with new ideas to face the challenges in front of us.

317
0:15:50.92,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We all know.

318
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I think it's a long way to go,

319
0:15:54.28,000 --> 0:15:57,000
but the questions, and the tools,

320
0:15:57.36,000 --> 0:16:,000
are now there, adjacent and possible.

321
0:16:01.72,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Thank you.

322
0:16:02.96,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Applause)

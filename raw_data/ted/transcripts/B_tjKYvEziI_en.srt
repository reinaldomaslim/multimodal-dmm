1
0:00:13.936,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells?

2
0:00:19.15,000 --> 0:00:22,000
There's still some confusion about that question,

3
0:00:22.261,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as this is a fairly new field of research.

4
0:00:25.569,000 --> 0:00:28,000
For example, I was talking to one of my colleagues, Robert,

5
0:00:28.952,000 --> 0:00:29,000
who is an oncologist,

6
0:00:30.284,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and he was telling me,

7
0:00:32.014,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Sandrine, this is puzzling.

8
0:00:33.793,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Some of my patients that have been told they are cured of their cancer

9
0:00:38.131,000 --> 0:00:4,000
still develop symptoms of depression."

10
0:00:41.52,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I responded to him,

11
0:00:42.839,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"Well, from my point of view that makes sense.

12
0:00:45.203,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The drug you give to your patients that stops the cancer cells multiplying

13
0:00:49.765,000 --> 0:00:54,000
also stops the newborn neurons being generated in their brain."

14
0:00:55.82,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And then Robert looked at me like I was crazy and said,

15
0:00:58.63,000 --> 0:01:,000
"But Sandrine, these are adult patients --

16
0:01:00.836,000 --> 0:01:02,000
adults do not grow new nerve cells."

17
0:01:04.543,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And much to his surprise, I said, "Well actually, we do."

18
0:01:09.098,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And this is a phenomenon that we call neurogenesis.

19
0:01:13.948,000 --> 0:01:14,000
[Neurogenesis]

20
0:01:15.162,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now Robert is not a neuroscientist,

21
0:01:18.956,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and when he went to medical school he was not taught what we know now --

22
0:01:23.605,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that the adult brain can generate new nerve cells.

23
0:01:29.217,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So Robert, you know, being the good doctor that he is,

24
0:01:33.611,000 --> 0:01:34,000
wanted to come to my lab

25
0:01:35.334,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to understand the topic a little bit better.

26
0:01:38.881,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I took him for a tour

27
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
of one of the most exciting parts of the brain

28
0:01:44.097,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when it comes to neurogenesis --

29
0:01:46.294,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and this is the hippocampus.

30
0:01:49.08,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So this is this gray structure in the center of the brain.

31
0:01:53.613,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And what we've known already for very long,

32
0:01:56.059,000 --> 0:02:,000
is that this is important for learning, memory, mood and emotion.

33
0:02:01.343,000 --> 0:02:04,000
However, what we have learned more recently

34
0:02:04.414,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is that this is one of the unique structures of the adult brain

35
0:02:09.096,000 --> 0:02:11,000
where new neurons can be generated.

36
0:02:12.405,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And if we slice through the hippocampus

37
0:02:14.74,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and zoom in,

38
0:02:16.032,000 --> 0:02:18,000
what you actually see here in blue

39
0:02:18.857,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is a newborn neuron in an adult mouse brain.

40
0:02:24.769,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So when it comes to the human brain --

41
0:02:27.848,000 --> 0:02:3,000
my colleague Jonas Frisén from the Karolinska Institutet,

42
0:02:31.404,000 --> 0:02:36,000
has estimated that we produce 700 new neurons per day

43
0:02:37.168,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in the hippocampus.

44
0:02:39.183,000 --> 0:02:4,000
You might think this is not much,

45
0:02:40.882,000 --> 0:02:42,000
compared to the billions of neurons we have.

46
0:02:43.644,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But by the time we turn 50,

47
0:02:46.739,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we will have all exchanged the neurons we were born with in that structure

48
0:02:51.439,000 --> 0:02:53,000
with adult-born neurons.

49
0:02:55.248,000 --> 0:03:,000
So why are these new neurons important and what are their functions?

50
0:03:01.324,000 --> 0:03:04,000
First, we know that they're important for learning and memory.

51
0:03:05.046,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And in the lab we have shown

52
0:03:06.587,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that if we block the ability of the adult brain

53
0:03:09.847,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to produce new neurons in the hippocampus,

54
0:03:12.431,000 --> 0:03:14,000
then we block certain memory abilities.

55
0:03:15.721,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And this is especially new and true for spatial recognition --

56
0:03:22.657,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so like, how you navigate your way in the city.

57
0:03:26.181,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We are still learning a lot,

58
0:03:27.683,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and neurons are not only important for memory capacity,

59
0:03:30.77,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but also for the quality of the memory.

60
0:03:33.697,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And they will have been helpful to add time to our memory

61
0:03:37.766,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and they will help differentiate very similar memories, like:

62
0:03:42.472,000 --> 0:03:44,000
how do you find your bike

63
0:03:44.576,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that you park at the station every day in the same area,

64
0:03:48.116,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but in a slightly different position?

65
0:03:52.068,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And more interesting to my colleague Robert

66
0:03:54.576,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is the research we have been doing on neurogenesis and depression.

67
0:04:00.01,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So in an animal model of depression,

68
0:04:01.972,000 --> 0:04:05,000
we have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis.

69
0:04:06.5,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And if we give antidepressants,

70
0:04:08.767,000 --> 0:04:11,000
then we increase the production of these newborn neurons,

71
0:04:12.245,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and we decrease the symptoms of depression,

72
0:04:15.412,000 --> 0:04:2,000
establishing a clear link between neurogenesis and depression.

73
0:04:21.191,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But moreover, if you just block neurogenesis,

74
0:04:25.524,000 --> 0:04:27,000
then you block the efficacy of the antidepressant.

75
0:04:29.714,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So by then, Robert had understood

76
0:04:31.501,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that very likely his patients were suffering from depression

77
0:04:35.223,000 --> 0:04:37,000
even after being cured of their cancer,

78
0:04:37.842,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because the cancer drug had stopped newborn neurons from being generated.

79
0:04:42.247,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And it will take time to generate new neurons

80
0:04:45.899,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that reach normal functions.

81
0:04:49.78,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, collectively, now we think we have enough evidence

82
0:04:54.213,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to say that neurogenesis is a target of choice

83
0:04:57.952,000 --> 0:05:,000
if we want to improve memory formation or mood,

84
0:05:01.59,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or even prevent the decline associated with aging,

85
0:05:05.177,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or associated with stress.

86
0:05:08.288,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So the next question is:

87
0:05:10.043,000 --> 0:05:12,000
can we control neurogenesis?

88
0:05:13.066,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The answer is yes.

89
0:05:14.86,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And we are now going to do a little quiz.

90
0:05:18.201,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I'm going to give you a set of behaviors and activities,

91
0:05:21.406,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis

92
0:05:26.114,000 --> 0:05:28,000
or if they will decrease neurogenesis.

93
0:05:28.804,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Are we ready?

94
0:05:30.55,000 --> 0:05:31,000
OK, let's go.

95
0:05:32.034,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So what about learning?

96
0:05:34.521,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Increasing?

97
0:05:35.725,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Yes.

98
0:05:36.908,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Learning will increase the production of these new neurons.

99
0:05:40.718,000 --> 0:05:41,000
How about stress?

100
0:05:43.431,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Yes, stress will decrease the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.

101
0:05:48.192,000 --> 0:05:49,000
How about sleep deprivation?

102
0:05:51.375,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis.

103
0:05:54.098,000 --> 0:05:55,000
How about sex?

104
0:05:56.414,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Oh, wow!

105
0:05:57.59,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:58.881,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Yes, you are right, it will increase the production of new neurons.

107
0:06:02.658,000 --> 0:06:04,000
However, it's all about balance here.

108
0:06:04.834,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We don't want to fall in a situation --

109
0:06:07.071,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:09.023,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about too much sex leading to sleep deprivation.

111
0:06:11.881,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:14.753,000 --> 0:06:16,000
How about getting older?

113
0:06:19.645,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So the neurogenesis rate will decrease as we get older,

114
0:06:23.352,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but it is still occurring.

115
0:06:26.042,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And then finally, how about running?

116
0:06:29.912,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I will let you judge that one by yourself.

117
0:06:33.563,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So this is one of the first studies

118
0:06:35.383,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that was carried out by one of my mentors, Rusty Gage from the Salk Institute,

119
0:06:39.81,000 --> 0:06:41,000
showing that the environment can have an impact

120
0:06:42.108,000 --> 0:06:43,000
on the production of new neurons.

121
0:06:44.021,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And here you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse

122
0:06:48.299,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that had no running wheel in its cage.

123
0:06:50.568,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And the little black dots you see are actually newborn neurons-to-be.

124
0:06:55.246,000 --> 0:07:,000
And now, you see a section of the hippocampus of a mouse

125
0:07:00.408,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that had a running wheel in its cage.

126
0:07:03.028,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So you see the massive increase

127
0:07:04.575,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of the black dots representing the new neurons-to-be.

128
0:07:08.819,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So activity impacts neurogenesis, but that's not all.

129
0:07:13.639,000 --> 0:07:15,000
What you eat will have an effect

130
0:07:16.31,000 --> 0:07:18,000
on the production of new neurons in the hippocampus.

131
0:07:19.248,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So here we have a sample of diet --

132
0:07:22.232,000 --> 0:07:25,000
of nutrients that have been shown to have efficacy.

133
0:07:25.973,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And I'm just going to point a few out to you:

134
0:07:28.592,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent will increase neurogenesis.

135
0:07:34.128,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Intermittent fasting -- spacing the time between your meals --

136
0:07:37.634,000 --> 0:07:39,000
will increase neurogenesis.

137
0:07:39.797,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Intake of flavonoids,

138
0:07:41.144,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which are contained in dark chocolate or blueberries,

139
0:07:44.171,000 --> 0:07:45,000
will increase neurogenesis.

140
0:07:46.355,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Omega-3 fatty acids,

141
0:07:47.885,000 --> 0:07:49,000
present in fatty fish, like salmon,

142
0:07:50.12,000 --> 0:07:52,000
will increase the production of these new neurons.

143
0:07:53.502,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Conversely, a diet rich in high saturated fat

144
0:07:57.627,000 --> 0:07:59,000
will have a negative impact on neurogenesis.

145
0:08:01.232,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Ethanol -- intake of alcohol -- will decrease neurogenesis.

146
0:08:05.981,000 --> 0:08:07,000
However, not everything is lost;

147
0:08:08.727,000 --> 0:08:11,000
resveratrol, which is contained in red wine,

148
0:08:11.803,000 --> 0:08:14,000
has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons.

149
0:08:15.708,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So next time you are at a dinner party,

150
0:08:17.598,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you might want to reach for this possibly "neurogenesis-neutral" drink.

151
0:08:21.909,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:24.066,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And then finally, let me point out the last one --

153
0:08:26.591,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a quirky one.

154
0:08:27.773,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So Japanese groups are fascinated with food textures,

155
0:08:31.692,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and they have shown that actually soft diet impairs neurogenesis,

156
0:08:37.019,000 --> 0:08:41,000
as opposed to food that requires mastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food.

157
0:08:42.827,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So all of this data,

158
0:08:44.644,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where we need to look at the cellular level,

159
0:08:47.249,000 --> 0:08:49,000
has been generated using animal models.

160
0:08:50.47,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But this diet has also been given to human participants,

161
0:08:54.875,000 --> 0:09:,000
and what we could see is that the diet modulates memory and mood

162
0:09:01.057,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in the same direction as it modulates neurogenesis,

163
0:09:04.565,000 --> 0:09:08,000
such as: calorie restriction will improve memory capacity,

164
0:09:09.346,000 --> 0:09:14,000
whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate symptoms of depression --

165
0:09:14.469,000 --> 0:09:17,000
as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids, which increase neurogenesis,

166
0:09:18.357,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and also help to decrease the symptoms of depression.

167
0:09:23.643,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So we think that the effect of diet

168
0:09:28.484,000 --> 0:09:31,000
on mental health, on memory and mood,

169
0:09:32.103,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is actually mediated by the production of the new neurons in the hippocampus.

170
0:09:36.994,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And it's not only what you eat,

171
0:09:38.938,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but it's also the texture of the food, when you eat it

172
0:09:42.027,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and how much of it you eat.

173
0:09:45.841,000 --> 0:09:49,000
On our side -- neuroscientists interested in neurogenesis --

174
0:09:49.898,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we need to understand better the function of these new neurons,

175
0:09:53.587,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and how we can control their survival and their production.

176
0:09:57.896,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We also need to find a way to protect the neurogenesis of Robert's patients.

177
0:10:03.271,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And on your side --

178
0:10:04.672,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I leave you in charge of your neurogenesis.

179
0:10:07.691,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Thank you.

180
0:10:08.873,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Applause)

181
0:10:14.856,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Margaret Heffernan: Fantastic research, Sandrine.

182
0:10:17.212,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, I told you you changed my life --

183
0:10:19.481,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I now eat a lot of blueberries.

184
0:10:21.283,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Sandrine Thuret: Very good.

185
0:10:23.528,000 --> 0:10:25,000
MH: I'm really interested in the running thing.

186
0:10:26.869,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Do I have to run?

187
0:10:29.368,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Or is it really just about aerobic exercise,

188
0:10:32.034,000 --> 0:10:33,000
getting oxygen to the brain?

189
0:10:33.663,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise?

190
0:10:36.101,000 --> 0:10:37,000
ST: So for the moment,

191
0:10:37.862,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we can't really say if it's just the running itself,

192
0:10:41.126,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but we think that anything that indeed will increase the production --

193
0:10:46.187,000 --> 0:10:49,000
or moving the blood flow to the brain,

194
0:10:49.291,000 --> 0:10:5,000
should be beneficial.

195
0:10:51.353,000 --> 0:10:53,000
MH: So I don't have to get a running wheel in my office?

196
0:10:54.004,000 --> 0:10:55,000
ST: No, you don't!

197
0:10:55.191,000 --> 0:10:57,000
MH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful.

198
0:10:57.308,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much.

199
0:10:59.085,000 --> 0:11:,000
ST: Thank you, Margaret.

200
0:11:00.308,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.731,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So what I'm going to talk about here is, this is a power station.

2
0:00:16.38,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So if you've ever wondered

3
0:00:17.643,000 --> 0:00:19,000
what a couple of million horsepower looked like,

4
0:00:20.2,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that's pretty much what it looks like.

5
0:00:22.034,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And for me, it's always been about the rocket.

6
0:00:24.334,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In fact so much so that when I was growing up,

7
0:00:26.79,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the school called in my parents to have a bit of a discussion,

8
0:00:31.77,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because they believed that my aspirations

9
0:00:34.42,000 --> 0:00:36,000
were unrealistic for what I wanted to do.

10
0:00:37.204,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:38.229,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And they suggested that I take up a job at the local aluminium smelter,

12
0:00:42.38,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because I was very good with my hands.

13
0:00:44.5,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But for me, aluminium, or as you Canadians say, "aluminum,"

14
0:00:48.634,000 --> 0:00:5,000
was not part of my plan at all.

15
0:00:50.91,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So I started building rockets when I was at school.

16
0:00:53.32,000 --> 0:00:54,000
They got bigger and bigger.

17
0:00:54.641,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I actually hold an unofficial land speed record

18
0:00:56.97,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for a rocket bike and roller blades

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
while wearing a rocket pack.

20
0:01:00.671,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:02.156,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But as the rockets got larger and larger,

22
0:01:04.21,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and more and more complex,

23
0:01:05.473,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I started to be able to think I could do something with this.

24
0:01:08.54,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now today we hear about very large rockets

25
0:01:11.89,000 --> 0:01:14,000
taking humans to, or aspiring to take humans to,

26
0:01:15.214,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the Moon, and Mars and beyond.

27
0:01:17.21,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And that's really important,

28
0:01:18.93,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but there's a revolution going on in the space industry,

29
0:01:21.574,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and it's not a revolution of the big,

30
0:01:23.36,000 --> 0:01:25,000
it's a revolution of the small.

31
0:01:25.75,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So here we have an average-to-large-sized spacecraft in 1990.

32
0:01:30.13,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We can tell it's 1990 because of the powder blue smocks

33
0:01:32.94,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for all the trained in the clean rooms in 1990.

34
0:01:35.155,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But that was your average-to-large-sized spacecraft in 1990.

35
0:01:38.92,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Here's a spacecraft that's going to launch this year.

36
0:01:41.421,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This particular spacecraft has four high-resolution cameras,

37
0:01:44.36,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a whole lot of senors, a CoMP communication system.

38
0:01:47.22,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We're going to launch thousands of these into the solar system

39
0:01:50.201,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to look for extraterrestrial life.

40
0:01:52.71,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Quite different.

41
0:01:54.586,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You see that Moore's law really applied itself to spacecraft.

42
0:01:57.62,000 --> 0:01:59,000
However, the rockets that we've been building

43
0:01:59.85,000 --> 0:02:01,000
have been designed for carrying these very large,

44
0:02:02.41,000 --> 0:02:04,000
school-bus-sized spacecraft to orbit.

45
0:02:05.12,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But this kind of launch vehicle here is not very practical

46
0:02:08.71,000 --> 0:02:11,000
for launching something that will fit on the tip of my finger.

47
0:02:12.71,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And to give you a sense of scale here,

48
0:02:14.59,000 --> 0:02:17,000
this rocket is so large that I inserted a picture of myself

49
0:02:17.67,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in my underpants, in complete confidence,

50
0:02:19.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
knowing that you will not be able to find me.

51
0:02:21.84,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That's how big this rocket actually is.

52
0:02:23.755,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:25.95,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Moving on.

54
0:02:27.213,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:29.01,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So this is our rocket -- it's called the Electron.

56
0:02:31.91,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's a small launch vehicle

57
0:02:33.23,000 --> 0:02:36,000
for lifting these small payloads into orbit.

58
0:02:36.732,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And the key here is not the size of the rocket --

59
0:02:39.18,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the key here is frequency.

60
0:02:40.64,000 --> 0:02:42,000
If you actually wanted to democratize space

61
0:02:43.09,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and enable access to space,

62
0:02:44.403,000 --> 0:02:46,000
launch frequency is the absolute most important thing

63
0:02:47.264,000 --> 0:02:48,000
out of all of this.

64
0:02:48.75,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now in order to really democratize space, there's three things you have to do.

65
0:02:53.192,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And each one of these three things has kind of the equivalent amount of work.

66
0:02:57.53,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So the first is, obviously, you have to build a rocket.

67
0:03:00.149,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The second is regulatory, and the third is infrastructure.

68
0:03:05.057,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So let's talk a little bit about infrastructure.

69
0:03:07.32,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So this is our launch site --

70
0:03:09.34,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it's obviously not Cape Canaveral,

71
0:03:11.2,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but it's a little launch site --

72
0:03:12.794,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in fact, it's the only private orbiter launch site

73
0:03:15.152,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in the entire world, down in New Zealand.

74
0:03:17.194,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And you may think that's a bit of an odd place

75
0:03:19.464,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to build a rocket company and a launch site.

76
0:03:21.82,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But the thing is that every time you launch a rocket,

77
0:03:24.416,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you have to close down around about 2,000 kilometers of airspace,

78
0:03:27.582,000 --> 0:03:29,000
2,000 kilometers of marine and shipping space,

79
0:03:30.46,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and ironically, it's one of the things in America

80
0:03:32.77,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that doesn't scale very well,

81
0:03:34.19,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because every time you close down all that airspace,

82
0:03:36.643,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you disrupt all these travelers trying to get to their destination.

83
0:03:40.61,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The airlines really hate rocket companies,

84
0:03:42.634,000 --> 0:03:45,000
because it costs them around $70,000 a minute, and so on.

85
0:03:46.44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So what you really need,

86
0:03:47.65,000 --> 0:03:49,000
if you want to truly have rapid access to space,

87
0:03:50.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is a reliable and frequent access to space,

88
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is you need, basically, a small island nation

89
0:03:55.29,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in the middle of nowhere, with no neighbors and no air traffic.

90
0:03:58.42,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And that just happened to be New Zealand.

91
0:04:00.397,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:02.1,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So, that's kind of the infrastructure bit.

93
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now the next bit of that is regulatory.

94
0:04:07.86,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So, believe it or not,

95
0:04:09.06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
New Zealand is not known for its space prowess,

96
0:04:11.646,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or at least it wasn't.

97
0:04:13.03,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And you can't just rock on up to a country

98
0:04:16.15,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with what is essentially considered an ICBM,

99
0:04:20.07,000 --> 0:04:22,000
because unfortunately, if you can put a satellite into orbit,

100
0:04:22.952,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you can use that rocket for doing significantly nasty things.

101
0:04:26.52,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So quickly, you run afoul of a whole lot of rules and regulations,

102
0:04:29.646,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and international treaties

103
0:04:31.5,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and whatnot.

104
0:04:35.44,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So it becomes quite complex.

105
0:04:37.32,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So in order for us to launch down in New Zealand,

106
0:04:39.678,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we had to get the United States government and the New Zealand government

107
0:04:43.177,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to agree to sign a bilateral treaty.

108
0:04:45.12,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And then once that bilateral treaty was signed

109
0:04:47.287,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to safeguard the technology,

110
0:04:49.54,000 --> 0:04:51,000
the New Zealand government had a whole lot of obligations.

111
0:04:52.31,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And they had to create a lot of rules and regulations.

112
0:04:54.91,000 --> 0:04:56,000
In fact, they had to pass laws through a select committee

113
0:04:57.601,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and through Parliament, ultimately, and to complete laws.

114
0:05:00.37,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Once you have laws, you need somebody who administers them.

115
0:05:03.156,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So they had to create a space agency.

116
0:05:04.965,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And once they did, the Aussies felt left out,

117
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so they had to create a space agency.

118
0:05:09.45,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And on and on it goes.

119
0:05:10.88,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So you see, there's a massive portion of this, in fact,

120
0:05:13.476,000 --> 0:05:15,000
two thirds of it, that does not even involve the rocket.

121
0:05:16.864,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:18.25,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, let's talk about the rocket.

123
0:05:19.846,000 --> 0:05:22,000
You know, what I didn't say

124
0:05:23.04,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is that we're actually licensed to launch every 72 hours for the next 30 years.

125
0:05:27.51,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So we have more launch availability as a private company

126
0:05:30.67,000 --> 0:05:32,000
than America does as an entire country.

127
0:05:33.14,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And if you've got a launch every 72 hours,

128
0:05:35.164,000 --> 0:05:37,000
then that means you have to build a rocket every 72 hours.

129
0:05:38.1,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And unfortunately, there's no such thing as just a one-stop rocket shop.

130
0:05:41.561,000 --> 0:05:43,000
You can't go and buy bits to build a rocket.

131
0:05:44.42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Every rocket is absolutely bespoke,

132
0:05:46.82,000 --> 0:05:48,000
every component is absolutely bespoke.

133
0:05:49.185,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And you're in a constant battle with physics every day.

134
0:05:51.95,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Every single day, I wake up and I battle physics.

135
0:05:54.67,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I'll give you an example of this.

136
0:05:56.52,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So on the side of our rocket, there's a silver stripe.

137
0:05:59.19,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The reason is because there's avionic components behind there.

138
0:06:03.31,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We needed to lower the emissivity of the skin

139
0:06:05.43,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so we didn't cook the components from the sunlight.

140
0:06:08.22,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So we paint a silver stripe.

141
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Unfortunately, as you're sailing through the Earth's atmosphere,

142
0:06:12.664,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you generate a lot of static electricity.

143
0:06:14.65,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And if you don't have conductive paint,

144
0:06:16.61,000 --> 0:06:18,000
you'll basically send lightning bolts down to the Earth.

145
0:06:19.32,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So even the silver paint has to be triboelectrificated

146
0:06:22.6,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and certified and applied and everything,

147
0:06:25.107,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the stickers, they're a whole nother story.

148
0:06:27.323,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But even the simplest thing is always, always a real struggle.

149
0:06:33.85,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, to the heart of any launch vehicle is the engine.

150
0:06:36.73,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This is our Rutherford rocket engine.

151
0:06:38.79,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And usually, you measure rocket engines

152
0:06:41.08,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in terms of time to manufacture, in terms of sort of months

153
0:06:44.09,000 --> 0:06:47,000
or even sometimes years, on really big engines.

154
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But if you're launching every 72 hours --

155
0:06:49.982,000 --> 0:06:5,000
there's 10 engines per rocket --

156
0:06:51.561,000 --> 0:06:53,000
then you need to produce an engine very quickly.

157
0:06:54.09,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We needed to come up with a whole new process

158
0:06:56.3,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and a whole new cycle for the rocket engine.

159
0:06:58.43,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We came up with a new cycle called the electric turbo pump,

160
0:07:02.484,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but we also managed to be able to 3D-print these rocket engines.

161
0:07:05.65,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So each one of these engines is 3D-printed out of Inconel superalloy,

162
0:07:09.444,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and right now, we can print round about one engine every 24 hours.

163
0:07:14.14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, the electric turbo pump cycle

164
0:07:16.426,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is a totally different way to pump propellant

165
0:07:19.34,000 --> 0:07:2,000
into the rocket engine.

166
0:07:20.82,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So we carry about one megawatt where the battery is on board.

167
0:07:24.05,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And we have little electric turbo pumps, about the size of a Coke can,

168
0:07:27.66,000 --> 0:07:28,000
not much bigger than a Coke can.

169
0:07:29.208,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They spin at 42,000 RPM,

170
0:07:31.04,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and each one of those Coke-can-sized turbo pumps

171
0:07:33.75,000 --> 0:07:35,000
produces about the same amount of horsepower

172
0:07:35.822,000 --> 0:07:36,000
as your average family car,

173
0:07:37.28,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and we have 20 of them on the rocket.

174
0:07:39.39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So you can see even the simplest thing, like pumping propellants,

175
0:07:42.469,000 --> 0:07:44,000
always pretty much drives you insane.

176
0:07:45.1,000 --> 0:07:47,000
This is Electron, it works.

177
0:07:47.85,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

178
0:07:49.024,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Applause)

179
0:07:55.151,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Not only does it work once, it seems to work quite frequently,

180
0:07:58.13,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which is handy when you've got a lot of customers to put on orbit.

181
0:08:01.3,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So far, we've put 25 satellites in orbit.

182
0:08:03.63,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And the really cool thing

183
0:08:04.893,000 --> 0:08:06,000
is we're able to do it very, very accurately.

184
0:08:07.073,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In fact, we insert the satellites to within an accuracy of 1.4 kilometers.

185
0:08:11.61,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And I guess if you're riding in a cab,

186
0:08:13.516,000 --> 0:08:14,000
1.4 kilometers is not very accurate.

187
0:08:15.271,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But in, kind of, space terms,

188
0:08:17.22,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that equates to around about 180 milliseconds.

189
0:08:20.09,000 --> 0:08:23,000
We travel 1.4 kilometers in about 180 milliseconds.

190
0:08:23.5,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So, it's actually quite hard to do.

191
0:08:25.836,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:27.01,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now, what I want to talk about here is space junk.

193
0:08:29.62,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We've talked a lot during this talk about, you know,

194
0:08:34.692,000 --> 0:08:36,000
how we want to launch really frequently, every 72 hours,

195
0:08:37.391,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and all the rest of it.

196
0:08:38.566,000 --> 0:08:4,000
However, I don't want to go down in history

197
0:08:40.591,000 --> 0:08:43,000
as the guy that put the most amount of space junk in orbit.

198
0:08:43.92,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is kind of the industry's dirty little secret here,

199
0:08:47.01,000 --> 0:08:5,000
what most people don't realize is that the majority of space junk by mass

200
0:08:50.739,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is not actually satellites, it's dead rockets.

201
0:08:54.13,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Because as you ascend to orbit,

202
0:08:55.73,000 --> 0:08:57,000
you have to shed bits of the rocket to get there,

203
0:08:58.04,000 --> 0:08:59,000
with the battle of physics.

204
0:08:59.36,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So I'm going to give a little Orbital Mechanics 101 here,

205
0:09:02.14,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and talk about how we go to orbit,

206
0:09:03.816,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and how we do it really, really differently from everybody else.

207
0:09:07.22,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So the second stage cruises along

208
0:09:09.275,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then we separate off a thing at the top called the kick stage,

209
0:09:12.42,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but we leave the second stage in this highly elliptical orbit.

210
0:09:15.4,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And at the perigee of the orbit, or the lowest point,

211
0:09:17.901,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it dips into the Earth's atmosphere and basically burns back up.

212
0:09:21.34,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So now we're left with this little kick stage,

213
0:09:23.59,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that white thing on the corner of the screen.

214
0:09:25.843,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's got its own propulsion system,

215
0:09:27.59,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and we use it to raise and trim the orbit

216
0:09:30.07,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and then deploy the spacecraft.

217
0:09:31.8,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And then because it's got its own engine, we put it into a retro orbit,

218
0:09:35.191,000 --> 0:09:37,000
put it back into a highly elliptical orbit,

219
0:09:37.259,000 --> 0:09:39,000
reenter it into the atmosphere and burn it back up,

220
0:09:39.87,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and leave absolutely nothing behind.

221
0:09:42.13,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now everybody else in the industry is just downright filthy,

222
0:09:45.041,000 --> 0:09:47,000
they just leave their crap everywhere out there.

223
0:09:47.429,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

224
0:09:48.454,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Applause)

225
0:09:52.57,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So I want to tell you a little bit of a story,

226
0:09:54.794,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and this is going to date me,

227
0:09:56.204,000 --> 0:10:,000
but I went to a school at the very bottom of the South Island in New Zealand,

228
0:10:00.523,000 --> 0:10:01,000
tiny little school,

229
0:10:01.705,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and we had a computer not dissimilar to this one.

230
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And attached to that computer was a little black box called a modem,

231
0:10:07.568,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and every Friday, the class would gather around the computer

232
0:10:10.448,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and we would send an email to another school in America

233
0:10:13.707,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that was lucky enough to have the same kind of setup,

234
0:10:16.231,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and we would receive an email back.

235
0:10:18.056,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And we thought that was just incredible, absolutely incredible.

236
0:10:21.75,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now I often wonder

237
0:10:23.02,000 --> 0:10:25,000
what would happen if I traveled back in time

238
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and I sat down with myself

239
0:10:26.669,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and I explained all of the things that were going to occur

240
0:10:29.5,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because of that little black box connected to the computer.

241
0:10:32.286,000 --> 0:10:34,000
You would largely think that it would be complete fantasy.

242
0:10:35.2,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But the reality is that is where we are right now with space.

243
0:10:38.59,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We're right on the verge of democratizing space,

244
0:10:41.2,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and we have essentially sent our first email to space.

245
0:10:44.423,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Now I'll give you some examples.

246
0:10:46.05,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So last year, we flew a small satellite

247
0:10:48.431,000 --> 0:10:51,000
for a bunch of high school students who had built it.

248
0:10:51.73,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And the high school students were studying the atmosphere of Venus.

249
0:10:54.91,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Those are high school students launching their own satellite.

250
0:10:57.796,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Another great example,

251
0:10:58.971,000 --> 0:11:01,000
there's a number of really big programs right now

252
0:11:02.074,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to place large constellations, of small satellites in orbit

253
0:11:05.036,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to deliver internet to every square millimeter on the planet.

254
0:11:08.74,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And for pretty much everybody in this room,

255
0:11:10.764,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that's just handy,

256
0:11:11.939,000 --> 0:11:13,000
because we can stream Netflix anywhere we want.

257
0:11:14.57,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But if you think about the developing countries of the world,

258
0:11:17.504,000 --> 0:11:19,000
you've just disseminated the entire knowledge of the world

259
0:11:20.344,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to every single person in the world.

260
0:11:22.37,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And that's going to have a pretty major effect.

261
0:11:25.42,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Thanks very much.

262
0:11:26.595,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Applause)

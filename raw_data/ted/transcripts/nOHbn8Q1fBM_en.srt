2
0:00:12.46,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So what if I could make for you

3
0:00:14.94,000 --> 0:00:15,000
a designer baby?

4
0:00:17.94,000 --> 0:00:19,000
What if you as a parent-to-be

5
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I as a scientist decided to go down that road together?

6
0:00:25.86,000 --> 0:00:26,000
What if we didn't?

7
0:00:27.14,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What if we thought, "That's a bad idea,"

8
0:00:29.94,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but many of our family, friends and coworkers

9
0:00:33.34,000 --> 0:00:34,000
did make that decision?

10
0:00:36.14,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Let's fast-forward just 15 years from now.

11
0:00:39.78,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Let's pretend it's the year 2030,

12
0:00:42.58,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and you're a parent.

13
0:00:44.54,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You have your daughter, Marianne, next to you,

14
0:00:47.82,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and in 2030, she is what we call a natural

15
0:00:51.22,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because she has no genetic modifications.

16
0:00:55.1,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And because you and your partner consciously made that decision,

17
0:00:59.3,000 --> 0:01:02,000
many in your social circle, they kind of look down on you.

18
0:01:02.54,000 --> 0:01:04,000
They think you're, like, a Luddite or a technophobe.

19
0:01:07.34,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Marianne's best friend Jenna, who lives right next door,

20
0:01:10.34,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is a very different story.

21
0:01:12.74,000 --> 0:01:17,000
She was born a genetically modified designer baby with numerous upgrades.

22
0:01:20.54,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Yeah. Upgrades.

23
0:01:22.7,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And these enhancements were introduced

24
0:01:25.62,000 --> 0:01:27,000
using a new genetic modification technology

25
0:01:28.18,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that goes by the funny name CRISPR,

26
0:01:30.98,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you know, like something's crisp,

27
0:01:32.7,000 --> 0:01:33,000
this is CRISPR.

28
0:01:35.34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The scientist that Jenna's parents hired to do this

29
0:01:38.66,000 --> 0:01:39,000
for several million dollars

30
0:01:41.38,000 --> 0:01:44,000
introduced CRISPR into a whole panel of human embryos.

31
0:01:46.18,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And then they used genetic testing,

32
0:01:47.9,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and they predicted that that little tiny embryo, Jenna's embryo,

33
0:01:51.98,000 --> 0:01:52,000
would be the best of the bunch.

34
0:01:54.98,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And now, Jenna is an actual, real person.

35
0:01:58.46,000 --> 0:02:01,000
She's sitting on the carpet in your living room

36
0:02:01.7,000 --> 0:02:03,000
playing with your daughter Marianne.

37
0:02:04.9,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And your families have known each other for years now,

38
0:02:08.02,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and it's become very clear to you

39
0:02:10.46,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that Jenna is extraordinary.

40
0:02:13.02,000 --> 0:02:15,000
She's incredibly intelligent.

41
0:02:15.06,000 --> 0:02:18,000
If you're honest with yourself, she's smarter than you,

42
0:02:18.34,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and she's five years old.

43
0:02:20.859,000 --> 0:02:23,000
She's beautiful, tall, athletic,

44
0:02:24.78,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and the list goes on and on.

45
0:02:28.1,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And in fact, there's a whole new generation

46
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of these GM kids like Jenna.

47
0:02:33.74,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And so far it looks like

48
0:02:35.9,000 --> 0:02:37,000
they're healthier than their parents' generation,

49
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
than your generation.

50
0:02:40.02,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And they have lower health care costs.

51
0:02:43.86,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They're immune to a host of health conditions,

52
0:02:46.62,000 --> 0:02:49,000
including HIV/AIDS and genetic diseases.

53
0:02:50.9,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It all sounds so great,

54
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but you can't help but have this sort of unsettling feeling,

55
0:02:56.34,000 --> 0:03:01,000
a gut feeling, that there's something just not quite right about Jenna,

56
0:03:01.98,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and you've had the same feeling about other GM kids that you've met.

57
0:03:06.94,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You were also reading in the newspaper earlier this week

58
0:03:10.34,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that a study of these children who were born as designer babies

59
0:03:14.3,000 --> 0:03:15,000
indicates they may have some issues,

60
0:03:16.18,000 --> 0:03:19,000
like increased aggressiveness and narcissism.

61
0:03:21.46,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But more immediately on your mind

62
0:03:23.14,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is some news that you just got from Jenna's family.

63
0:03:26.86,000 --> 0:03:27,000
She's so smart,

64
0:03:28.38,000 --> 0:03:31,000
she's now going to be going to a special school,

65
0:03:31.5,000 --> 0:03:33,000
a different school than your daughter Marianne,

66
0:03:34.02,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and this is kind of throwing your family into a disarray.

67
0:03:37.78,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Marianne's been crying,

68
0:03:39.14,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and last night when you took her to bed to kiss her goodnight,

69
0:03:42.58,000 --> 0:03:46,000
she said, "Daddy, will Jenna even be my friend anymore?"

70
0:03:48.3,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So now, as I've been telling you this imagined 2030 story,

71
0:03:51.86,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I have a feeling that I may have put some of you

72
0:03:54.5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
into this sci-fi frame of reference. Right?

73
0:03:57.1,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You think you're reading a sci-fi book.

74
0:03:59.62,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Or maybe, like, in Halloween mode of thinking.

75
0:04:02.58,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But this is really a possible reality for us,

76
0:04:05.02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
just 15 years from now.

77
0:04:07.3,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I'm a stem cell and genetics researcher

78
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and I can see this new CRISPR technology

79
0:04:13.22,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and its potential impact.

80
0:04:15.42,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And we may find ourselves in that reality,

81
0:04:19.06,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and a lot will depend on what we decide to do today.

82
0:04:23.78,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And if you're still kind of thinking in sci-fi mode,

83
0:04:26.3,000 --> 0:04:3,000
consider that the world of science had a huge shock earlier this year,

84
0:04:30.82,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and the public largely doesn't even know about it.

85
0:04:33.779,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Researchers in China just a few months ago

86
0:04:36.58,000 --> 0:04:4,000
reported the creation of genetically modified human embryos.

87
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This was the first time in history.

88
0:04:43.82,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And they did it using this new CRISPR technology.

89
0:04:47.38,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It didn't work perfectly,

90
0:04:49.14,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but I still think they sort of cracked the door ajar

91
0:04:52.74,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on a Pandora's box here.

92
0:04:56.3,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I think some people are going to run with this technology

93
0:04:59.22,000 --> 0:05:,000
and try to make designer babies.

94
0:05:02.02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now, before I go on, some of you may hold up your hands and say,

95
0:05:05.1,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"Stop, Paul, wait a minute.

96
0:05:07.38,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Wouldn't that be illegal?

97
0:05:09.22,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You can't just go off and create a designer baby."

98
0:05:13.476,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And in fact, to some extent, you're right.

99
0:05:15.5,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In some countries, you couldn't do that.

100
0:05:18.34,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But in many other countries, including my country, the US,

101
0:05:21.62,000 --> 0:05:24,000
there's actually no law on this, so in theory, you could do it.

102
0:05:26.5,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And there was another development this year that resonates in this area,

103
0:05:30.98,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and that happened not so far from here over in the UK.

104
0:05:34.3,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And the UK traditionally has been the strictest country

105
0:05:37.42,000 --> 0:05:39,000
when it comes to human genetic modification.

106
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It was illegal there,

107
0:05:42.22,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but just a few months ago,

108
0:05:43.82,000 --> 0:05:45,000
they carved out an exception to that rule.

109
0:05:46.3,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They passed a new law

110
0:05:47.86,000 --> 0:05:5,000
allowing the creation of genetically modified humans

111
0:05:51.34,000 --> 0:05:55,000
with the noble goal of trying to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease.

112
0:05:56.22,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But still I think in combination these events are pushing us

113
0:05:59.94,000 --> 0:06:01,000
further towards an acceptance

114
0:06:02.5,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of human genetic modification.

115
0:06:05.66,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So I've been talking about this CRISPR technology.

116
0:06:08.58,000 --> 0:06:1,000
What actually is CRISPR?

117
0:06:11.18,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So if you think about the GMOs that we're all more familiar with,

118
0:06:14.54,000 --> 0:06:17,000
like GMO tomatoes and wheat

119
0:06:17.78,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and things like that,

120
0:06:19.74,000 --> 0:06:21,000
this technology is similar to the technologies

121
0:06:22.38,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that were used to make those,

122
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but it's dramatically better,

123
0:06:26.66,000 --> 0:06:27,000
cheaper and faster.

124
0:06:29.94,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So what is it?

125
0:06:31.5,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It's actually like a genetic Swiss army knife.

126
0:06:33.98,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We can pretend this is a Swiss army knife

127
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with different tools in it,

128
0:06:37.62,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and one of the tools is kind of like a magnifying glass

129
0:06:40.78,000 --> 0:06:42,000
or a GPS for our DNA,

130
0:06:43.7,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so it can home in on a certain spot.

131
0:06:46.3,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And the next tool is like scissors

132
0:06:47.98,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that can cut the DNA right in that spot.

133
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And finally we have a pen

134
0:06:52.86,000 --> 0:06:56,000
where we can literally rewrite the genetic code in that location.

135
0:06:57.38,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's really that simple.

136
0:06:59.5,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And this technology, which came on the scene just three years ago,

137
0:07:03.18,000 --> 0:07:04,000
has taken science by storm.

138
0:07:05.82,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It's evolving so fast, and it's so freaking exciting to scientists,

139
0:07:10.1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and I admit I'm fascinated by it and we use it in my own lab,

140
0:07:14.86,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that I think someone is going to go that extra step

141
0:07:18.46,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and continue the GM human embryo work

142
0:07:21.06,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and maybe make designer babies.

143
0:07:24.9,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This is so ubiquitous now.

144
0:07:26.58,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It just came on the scene three years ago.

145
0:07:29.02,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Thousands of labs literally have this in hand today,

146
0:07:33.38,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and they're doing important research.

147
0:07:35.78,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Most of them are not interested in designer babies.

148
0:07:38.42,000 --> 0:07:4,000
They're studying human disease

149
0:07:40.94,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and other important elements of science.

150
0:07:43.38,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So there's a lot of good research going on with CRISPR.

151
0:07:46.82,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And the fact that we can now do genetic modifications

152
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that used to take years and cost millions of dollars

153
0:07:54.06,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in a few weeks for a couple thousand bucks,

154
0:07:57.1,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to me as a scientist that's fantastic,

155
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but again, at the same time,

156
0:08:01.42,000 --> 0:08:04,000
it opens the door to people going too far.

157
0:08:05.14,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And I think for some people

158
0:08:06.58,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the focus is not going to be so much on science.

159
0:08:09.62,000 --> 0:08:11,000
That's not what's going to be driving them.

160
0:08:11.66,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's going to be ideology or the chase for a profit.

161
0:08:15.94,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And they're going to go for designer babies.

162
0:08:20.06,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So why should we be concerned about this?

163
0:08:23.94,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We know from Darwin, if we go back two centuries,

164
0:08:27.18,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that evolution and genetics profoundly have impacted humanity,

165
0:08:31.34,000 --> 0:08:33,000
who we are today.

166
0:08:33.5,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And some think there's like a social Darwinism at work in our world,

167
0:08:37.46,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and maybe even a eugenics as well.

168
0:08:40.54,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Imagine those trends, those forces,

169
0:08:44.3,000 --> 0:08:46,000
with a booster rocket of this CRISPR technology

170
0:08:47.3,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that is so powerful and so ubiquitous.

171
0:08:50.82,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And in fact, we can just go back one century to the last century

172
0:08:54.739,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to see the power that eugenics can have.

173
0:08:58.62,000 --> 0:09:,000
So my father, Peter Knoepfler,

174
0:09:01.1,000 --> 0:09:03,000
was actually born right here in Vienna.

175
0:09:03.9,000 --> 0:09:07,000
He was Viennese, and he was born here in 1929.

176
0:09:08.42,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And when my grandparents had little baby Peter,

177
0:09:12.34,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the world was very different. Right?

178
0:09:14.1,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It was a different Vienna.

179
0:09:15.42,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The United States was different.

180
0:09:17.02,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The world was different.

181
0:09:18.3,000 --> 0:09:2,000
There was a eugenics rising,

182
0:09:20.62,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and my grandparents realized,

183
0:09:22.98,000 --> 0:09:23,000
pretty quickly I think,

184
0:09:24.42,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that they were on the wrong side of the eugenics equation.

185
0:09:28.66,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And so despite this being their home

186
0:09:31.06,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and their whole extended family's home,

187
0:09:33.14,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and this area being their family's home for generations,

188
0:09:37.5,000 --> 0:09:4,000
they decided because of eugenics

189
0:09:40.54,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that they had to leave.

190
0:09:42.5,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And they survived, but they were heartbroken,

191
0:09:44.66,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and I'm not sure my dad ever really got over leaving Vienna.

192
0:09:48.82,000 --> 0:09:5,000
He left when he was just eight years old

193
0:09:51.18,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in 1938.

194
0:09:54.38,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So today, I see a new eugenics

195
0:09:57.46,000 --> 0:09:59,000
kind of bubbling to the surface.

196
0:09:59.82,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's supposed to be a kinder, gentler, positive eugenics,

197
0:10:04.82,000 --> 0:10:06,000
different than all that past stuff.

198
0:10:08.02,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But I think even though it's focused on trying to improve people,

199
0:10:12.42,000 --> 0:10:14,000
it could have negative consequences,

200
0:10:15.14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and it really worries me

201
0:10:16.42,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that some of the top proponents of this new eugenics,

202
0:10:19.22,000 --> 0:10:22,000
they think CRISPR is the ticket to make it happen.

203
0:10:24.18,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So I have to admit, you know,

204
0:10:25.94,000 --> 0:10:28,000
eugenics, we talk about making better people.

205
0:10:29.22,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's a tough question.

206
0:10:30.5,000 --> 0:10:32,000
What is better when we're talking about a human being?

207
0:10:34.18,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But I admit I think maybe a lot of us

208
0:10:36.86,000 --> 0:10:38,000
could agree that human beings,

209
0:10:39.82,000 --> 0:10:4,000
maybe we could use a little betterment.

210
0:10:41.82,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Look at our politicians

211
0:10:44.14,000 --> 0:10:46,000
here, you know, back in the US --

212
0:10:46.22,000 --> 0:10:49,000
God forbid we go there right now.

213
0:10:49.86,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Maybe even if we just look in the mirror,

214
0:10:51.86,000 --> 0:10:53,000
there might be ways we think we could be better.

215
0:10:54.42,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I might wish, honestly, that I had more hair here, instead of baldness.

216
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Some people might wish they were taller,

217
0:11:01.82,000 --> 0:11:03,000
have a different weight, a different face.

218
0:11:05.7,000 --> 0:11:08,000
If we could do those things, we could make those things happen,

219
0:11:09.18,000 --> 0:11:11,000
or we could make them happen in our children,

220
0:11:11.46,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it would be very seductive.

221
0:11:13.86,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And yet coming with it would be these risks.

222
0:11:16.78,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I talked about eugenics,

223
0:11:18.7,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but there would be risks to individuals as well.

224
0:11:21.54,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So if we forget about enhancing people

225
0:11:24.02,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and we just try to make them healthier using genetic modification,

226
0:11:28.5,000 --> 0:11:3,000
this technology is so new

227
0:11:30.98,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and so powerful,

228
0:11:32.58,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that by accident we could make them sicker.

229
0:11:36.34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
That easily could happen.

230
0:11:38.5,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And there's another risk,

231
0:11:39.78,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and that is that all of the legitimate, important genetic modification research

232
0:11:44.38,000 --> 0:11:45,000
going on just in the lab --

233
0:11:46.06,000 --> 0:11:49,000
again, no interest in designer babies --

234
0:11:49.1,000 --> 0:11:51,000
a few people going the designer baby route,

235
0:11:51.98,000 --> 0:11:52,000
things go badly,

236
0:11:53.38,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that entire field could be damaged.

237
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I also think it's not that unlikely

238
0:11:59.74,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that governments might start taking an interest in genetic modification.

239
0:12:04.7,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So for example our imagined GM Jenna child

240
0:12:09.66,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who is healthier,

241
0:12:10.9,000 --> 0:12:14,000
if there's a generation that looks like they have lower health care costs,

242
0:12:14.94,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it's possible that governments may start trying to compel their citizens

243
0:12:19.18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to go the GM route.

244
0:12:21.1,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Look at China's one-child policy.

245
0:12:23.14,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's thought that that prevented the birth of 400 million human beings.

246
0:12:30.02,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So it's not beyond the realm of possible

247
0:12:32.82,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that genetic modification could be something that governments push.

248
0:12:37.1,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And if designer babies become popular,

249
0:12:40.62,000 --> 0:12:41,000
in our digital age --

250
0:12:42.46,000 --> 0:12:44,000
viral videos, social media --

251
0:12:45.14,000 --> 0:12:47,000
what if designer babies are thought to be fashionable,

252
0:12:47.74,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and they kind of become the new glitterati,

253
0:12:49.9,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the new Kardashians or something?

254
0:12:51.66,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

255
0:12:52.7,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You know, are those trends that we really could control?

256
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I'm not convinced that we could.

257
0:13:00.46,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So again, today it's Halloween

258
0:13:03.66,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and when we talk about genetic modification,

259
0:13:06.14,000 --> 0:13:09,000
there's one Halloween-associated character

260
0:13:09.3,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that is talked about or invoked more than anything else,

261
0:13:11.98,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and that is Frankenstein.

262
0:13:14.42,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Mostly that's been Frankenfoods and all this other stuff.

263
0:13:18.86,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But if we think about this now and we think about it in the human context

264
0:13:23.46,000 --> 0:13:24,000
on a day like Halloween,

265
0:13:24.74,000 --> 0:13:29,000
if parents can in essence costume their children genetically,

266
0:13:30.18,000 --> 0:13:34,000
are we going to be talking about a Frankenstein 2.0 kind of situation?

267
0:13:36.06,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I don't think so. I don't think it's going to get to that extreme.

268
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But when we are going about hacking the human code,

269
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I think all bets are off in terms of what might come of that.

270
0:13:46.54,000 --> 0:13:47,000
There would still be dangers.

271
0:13:49.54,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And we can look in the past

272
0:13:50.9,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to other elements of transformative science

273
0:13:53.54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and see how they can basically go out of control

274
0:13:57.38,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and permeate society.

275
0:13:59.38,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So I'll just give you one example, and that is in vitro fertilization.

276
0:14:04.3,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Almost exactly 40 years ago,

277
0:14:07.94,000 --> 0:14:1,000
test tube baby number one Louise Brown was born,

278
0:14:11.66,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and that's a great thing,

279
0:14:12.94,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and I think since then five million IVF babies have been born,

280
0:14:18.5,000 --> 0:14:19,000
bringing immeasurable happiness.

281
0:14:20.18,000 --> 0:14:23,000
A lot of parents now can love those kids.

282
0:14:23.34,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But if you think about it, in four decades,

283
0:14:25.42,000 --> 0:14:28,000
five million babies being born from a new technology

284
0:14:29.34,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is pretty remarkable,

285
0:14:31.18,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and the same kind of thing could happen

286
0:14:33.42,000 --> 0:14:36,000
with human genetic modification and designer babies.

287
0:14:37.02,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So depending on the decisions we make in the next few months,

288
0:14:40.22,000 --> 0:14:41,000
the next year or so,

289
0:14:41.54,000 --> 0:14:44,000
if designer baby number one is born,

290
0:14:44.7,000 --> 0:14:45,000
within a few decades,

291
0:14:45.94,000 --> 0:14:48,000
there could well be millions of genetically modified humans.

292
0:14:49.62,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And there's a difference there too, because if we, you in the audience, or I,

293
0:14:54.1,000 --> 0:14:56,000
if we decide to have a designer baby,

294
0:14:57.02,000 --> 0:15:01,000
then their children will also be genetically modified, and so on,

295
0:15:01.06,000 --> 0:15:02,000
because it's heritable.

296
0:15:02.38,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So that's a big difference.

297
0:15:05.42,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So with all of this in mind,

298
0:15:07.34,000 --> 0:15:08,000
what should we do?

299
0:15:09.94,000 --> 0:15:1,000
There's actually going to be a meeting

300
0:15:11.78,000 --> 0:15:13,000
a month from tomorrow in Washington, D.C.

301
0:15:14.7,000 --> 0:15:15,000
by the US National Academy of Sciences

302
0:15:16.66,000 --> 0:15:18,000
to tackle that exact question.

303
0:15:19.3,000 --> 0:15:22,000
What is the right path forward with human genetic modification?

304
0:15:23.82,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I believe at this time

305
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
we need a moratorium.

306
0:15:27.74,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We have to ban this.

307
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We should not allow creating genetically modified people,

308
0:15:32.86,000 --> 0:15:35,000
because it's just too dangerous and too unpredictable.

309
0:15:37.18,000 --> 0:15:38,000
But there's a lot of people --

310
0:15:38.66,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Applause)

311
0:15:39.82,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Thanks.

312
0:15:41.06,000 --> 0:15:44,000
(Applause)

313
0:15:47.7,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And let me say, just as a scientist,

314
0:15:50.02,000 --> 0:15:52,000
it's a little bit scary for me to say that in public,

315
0:15:52.54,000 --> 0:15:57,000
because science generally doesn't like self-regulation and things like that.

316
0:15:59.06,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So I think we need to put a hold on this,

317
0:16:02.22,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but there are many people who not only disagree with me,

318
0:16:04.98,000 --> 0:16:05,000
they feel the exact opposite.

319
0:16:06.5,000 --> 0:16:09,000
They're like, step on the gas, full speed ahead,

320
0:16:09.86,000 --> 0:16:1,000
let's make designer babies.

321
0:16:11.5,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And so in the meeting in December

322
0:16:14.46,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and other meetings that are likely to follow in the next few months,

323
0:16:17.94,000 --> 0:16:2,000
it's very possible there may be no moratorium.

324
0:16:21.1,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And I think part of the problem that we have

325
0:16:24.18,000 --> 0:16:26,000
is that all of this trend,

326
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
this revolution in genetic modification applying to humans,

327
0:16:30.38,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the public hasn't known about it.

328
0:16:32.02,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Nobody has been saying,

329
0:16:33.86,000 --> 0:16:37,000
look, this is a big deal, this is a revolution,

330
0:16:37.94,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and this could affect you in very personal ways.

331
0:16:40.22,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And so part of my goal is actually to change that

332
0:16:43.06,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and to educate and engage with the public

333
0:16:46.02,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and get you guys talking about this.

334
0:16:49.34,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And so I hope at these meetings that there will be a role for the public

335
0:16:53.14,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to bring their voice to bear as well.

336
0:16:57.5,000 --> 0:17:01,000
So if we kind of circle back now to 2030 again, that imagined story,

337
0:17:03.02,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and depending on the decisions we make, again, today --

338
0:17:06.06,000 --> 0:17:07,000
literally we don't have a lot of time --

339
0:17:08.02,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in the next few months, the next year or so,

340
0:17:10.14,000 --> 0:17:12,000
because this technology is spreading like wildfire.

341
0:17:13.38,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Let's pretend we're back in that reality.

342
0:17:16.34,000 --> 0:17:17,000
We're at a park,

343
0:17:18.179,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and our kid is swinging on the swing.

344
0:17:22.419,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Is that kid a regular old kid,

345
0:17:25.06,000 --> 0:17:28,000
or did we decide to have a designer baby?

346
0:17:28.54,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And let's say we went the sort of traditional route,

347
0:17:32.02,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and there's our kid swinging on the swing,

348
0:17:34.54,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and frankly, they're kind of a mess.

349
0:17:37.38,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Their hair is all over the place like mine.

350
0:17:40.1,000 --> 0:17:42,000
They have a stuffy nose.

351
0:17:42.34,000 --> 0:17:44,000
They're not the best student in the world.

352
0:17:45.06,000 --> 0:17:47,000
They're adorable, you love them,

353
0:17:47.3,000 --> 0:17:48,000
but there on the swing next to them,

354
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
their best friend is a GM kid,

355
0:17:52.3,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and the two of them are kind of swinging like this,

356
0:17:54.74,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and you can't help but compare them, right?

357
0:17:56.78,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And the GM kid is swinging higher,

358
0:17:59.3,000 --> 0:18:01,000
they look better, they're a better student,

359
0:18:01.5,000 --> 0:18:03,000
they don't have that stuffy nose you need to wipe.

360
0:18:04.5,000 --> 0:18:06,000
How is that going to make you feel

361
0:18:06.78,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and what decision might you make next time?

362
0:18:10.66,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Thank you.

363
0:18:11.9,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm assuming everyone here has watched

2
0:00:14.177,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a TED Talk online at one time or another, right?

3
0:00:18.541,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So what I'm going to do is play this.

4
0:00:20.643,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This is the song from the TED Talks online.

5
0:00:23.494,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Music)

6
0:00:30.249,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I'm going to slow it down

7
0:00:31.54,000 --> 0:00:33,000
because things sound cooler when they're slower.

8
0:00:34.321,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Music)

9
0:01:18.683,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Ken Robinson: Good morning. How are you?

10
0:01:22.348,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Mark Applebaum: I'm going to -- Kate Stone: -- mix some music.

11
0:01:25.688,000 --> 0:01:27,000
MA: I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story.

12
0:01:27.794,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Tod Machover: Something nobody's ever heard before.

13
0:01:30.905,000 --> 0:01:31,000
KS: I have a crossfader.

14
0:01:32.399,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Julian Treasure: I call this the mixer.

15
0:01:34.048,000 --> 0:01:35,000
KS: Two D.J. decks.

16
0:01:35.348,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Chris Anderson: You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.

17
0:01:42.571,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Dan Ellsey: I have always loved music.

18
0:01:44.953,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Michael Tilson Thomas: Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude?

19
0:01:47.468,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Daniel Wolpert: Feeling everything that's going on inside my body.

20
0:01:50.124,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Adam Ockelford: In your brain is this amazing musical computer.

21
0:01:56.002,000 --> 0:02:04,000
MTT: Using computers and synthesizers to create works. It's a language that's still evolving.

22
0:02:07.647,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And the 21st century.

23
0:02:10.074,000 --> 0:02:12,000
KR: Turn on the radio. Pop into the discotheque.

24
0:02:12.712,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You will know what this person is doing: moving to the music.

25
0:02:27.61,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Mark Ronson: This is my favorite part.

26
0:02:29.982,000 --> 0:02:33,000
MA: You gotta have doorstops. That's important.

27
0:02:34.197,000 --> 0:02:35,000
TM: We all love music a great deal.

28
0:02:35.884,000 --> 0:02:38,000
MTT: Anthems, dance crazes, ballads and marches.

29
0:02:39.044,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Kirby Ferguson and JT: The remix: It is new music created from old music.

30
0:02:42.767,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Ryan Holladay: Blend seamlessly.

31
0:02:45.028,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Kathryn Schulz: And that's how it goes.

32
0:02:46.483,000 --> 0:02:53,000
MTT: What happens when the music stops?

33
0:02:53.918,000 --> 0:02:56,000
KS: Yay!

34
0:02:57.684,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Applause)

35
0:03:03.594,000 --> 0:03:07,000
MR: Obviously, I've been watching a lot of TED Talks.

36
0:03:08.124,000 --> 0:03:11,000
When I was first asked to speak at TED,

37
0:03:11.503,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I wasn't quite sure what my angle was, at first,

38
0:03:13.516,000 --> 0:03:15,000
so yeah, I immediately started watching tons of TED Talks,

39
0:03:16.468,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which is pretty much absolutely

40
0:03:18.484,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the worst thing that you can do

41
0:03:20.323,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because you start to go into panic mode, thinking,

42
0:03:23.151,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I haven't mounted a successful expedition to the North Pole yet.

43
0:03:26.652,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Neither have I provided electricity

44
0:03:30.552,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to my village through sheer ingenuity.

45
0:03:33.149,000 --> 0:03:35,000
In fact, I've pretty much wasted most of my life

46
0:03:35.969,000 --> 0:03:36,000
DJing in night clubs

47
0:03:37.266,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and producing pop records.

48
0:03:39.245,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But I still kept watching the videos,

49
0:03:41.92,000 --> 0:03:42,000
because I'm a masochist,

50
0:03:43.551,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and eventually, things like Michael Tilson Thomas

51
0:03:46.623,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and Tod Machover, and seeing

52
0:03:49.439,000 --> 0:03:51,000
their visceral passion talking about music,

53
0:03:51.606,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it definitely stirred something in me,

54
0:03:53.433,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and I'm a sucker for anyone talking devotedly

55
0:03:55.778,000 --> 0:03:56,000
about the power of music.

56
0:03:57.169,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I started to write down on these little note cards

57
0:03:59.829,000 --> 0:04:,000
every time I heard something

58
0:04:01.172,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that struck a chord in me, pardon the pun,

59
0:04:03.387,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or something that I thought I could use,

60
0:04:05.143,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and pretty soon, my studio looked like this,

61
0:04:09.81,000 --> 0:04:12,000
kind of like a John Nash, "Beautiful Mind" vibe.

62
0:04:13.573,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The other good thing about watching TED Talks,

63
0:04:16.368,000 --> 0:04:17,000
when you see a really good one,

64
0:04:18.255,000 --> 0:04:19,000
you kind of all of a sudden wish the speaker

65
0:04:20.188,000 --> 0:04:22,000
was your best friend, don't you? Like, just for a day.

66
0:04:23.032,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They seem like a nice person.

67
0:04:25.027,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You'd take a bike ride, maybe share an ice cream.

68
0:04:28.009,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You'd certainly learn a lot.

69
0:04:30.76,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And every now and then they'd chide you,

70
0:04:32.214,000 --> 0:04:33,000
when they got frustrated that you couldn't really

71
0:04:33.95,000 --> 0:04:35,000
keep up with half of the technical things they're banging on about all the time.

72
0:04:36.879,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But then they'd remember that you're but a mere human

73
0:04:39.348,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of ordinary, mortal intelligence

74
0:04:40.83,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that didn't finish university,

75
0:04:42.229,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and they'd kind of forgive you,

76
0:04:43.795,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and pet you like the dog.

77
0:04:47.39,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:49.515,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Man, yeah, back to the real world,

79
0:04:52.253,000 --> 0:04:53,000
probably Sir Ken Robinson and I

80
0:04:53.78,000 --> 0:04:54,000
are not going to end up being best of friends.

81
0:04:55.484,000 --> 0:04:58,000
He lives all the way in L.A. and I imagine is quite busy,

82
0:04:58.917,000 --> 0:05:,000
but through the tools available to me -- technology

83
0:05:01.654,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and the innate way that I approach making music --

84
0:05:03.922,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I can sort of bully our existences

85
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:07,000
into a shared event,

86
0:05:07.971,000 --> 0:05:09,000
which is sort of what you saw.

87
0:05:10.537,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I can hear something that I love in a piece of media

88
0:05:13.546,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I can co-opt it

89
0:05:14.93,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and insert myself in that narrative,

90
0:05:17.266,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or alter it, even.

91
0:05:20.238,000 --> 0:05:21,000
In a nutshell, that's what I was trying to do

92
0:05:21.968,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with these things, but more importantly,

93
0:05:24.174,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that's what the past 30 years of music has been.

94
0:05:26.564,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's the major thread.

95
0:05:28.252,000 --> 0:05:3,000
See, 30 years ago, you had the first digital samplers,

96
0:05:30.975,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and they changed everything overnight.

97
0:05:32.46,000 --> 0:05:33,000
All of a sudden, artists could sample

98
0:05:34.125,000 --> 0:05:36,000
from anything and everything that came before them,

99
0:05:36.93,000 --> 0:05:38,000
from a snare drum from the Funky Meters,

100
0:05:39.125,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to a Ron Carter bassline,

101
0:05:40.939,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the theme to "The Price Is Right."

102
0:05:43.01,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Albums like De La Soul's "3 Feet High and Rising"

103
0:05:45.143,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the Beastie Boys' "Paul's Boutique"

104
0:05:47.297,000 --> 0:05:49,000
looted from decades of recorded music

105
0:05:49.555,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to create these sonic, layered masterpieces

106
0:05:52.604,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that were basically the Sgt. Peppers of their day.

107
0:05:54.856,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And they weren't sampling these records

108
0:05:57.503,000 --> 0:05:59,000
because they were too lazy to write their own music.

109
0:06:00.312,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They weren't sampling these records to cash in on

110
0:06:02.277,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the familiarity of the original stuff.

111
0:06:03.946,000 --> 0:06:04,000
To be honest, it was all about sampling

112
0:06:05.503,000 --> 0:06:06,000
really obscure things,

113
0:06:07.044,000 --> 0:06:08,000
except for a few obvious exceptions

114
0:06:08.532,000 --> 0:06:1,000
like Vanilla Ice and "doo doo doo da da doo doo"

115
0:06:11.361,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that we know about.

116
0:06:12.77,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But the thing is,

117
0:06:14.205,000 --> 0:06:15,000
they were sampling those records

118
0:06:15.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because they heard something in that music

119
0:06:17.478,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that spoke to them

120
0:06:19.643,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that they instantly wanted to inject themselves

121
0:06:21.641,000 --> 0:06:22,000
into the narrative of that music.

122
0:06:23.137,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They heard it, they wanted to be a part of it,

123
0:06:24.907,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and all of a sudden they found themselves

124
0:06:26.501,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in possession of the technology to do so,

125
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
not much unlike the way the Delta blues

126
0:06:31.351,000 --> 0:06:33,000
struck a chord with the Stones and the Beatles and Clapton,

127
0:06:34.02,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and they felt the need to co-opt that music

128
0:06:36.31,000 --> 0:06:37,000
for the tools of their day.

129
0:06:38.07,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You know, in music we take something that we love

130
0:06:40.702,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and we build on it.

131
0:06:42.12,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I'd like to play a song for you.

132
0:06:52.068,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Doug E. Fresh & Slick Rick)

133
0:07:11.139,000 --> 0:07:13,000
That's "La Di Da Di" and it's the fifth-most sampled

134
0:07:13.728,000 --> 0:07:14,000
song of all time.

135
0:07:15.032,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's been sampled 547 times.

136
0:07:18.202,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It was made in 1984 by these two legends of hip-hop,

137
0:07:21.638,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Slick Rick and Doug E. Fresh,

138
0:07:24.817,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and the Ray-Ban and Jheri curl look is so strong.

139
0:07:28.227,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I do hope that comes back soon.

140
0:07:30.255,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Anyway, this predated the sampling era.

141
0:07:34.348,000 --> 0:07:35,000
There were no samples in this record,

142
0:07:35.85,000 --> 0:07:37,000
although I did look up on the Internet last night,

143
0:07:38.206,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I mean several months ago,

144
0:07:40.254,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that "La Di Da Di" means, it's an old

145
0:07:42.779,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Cockney expression from the late 1800s in England,

146
0:07:45.819,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so maybe a remix with Mrs. Patmore

147
0:07:47.935,000 --> 0:07:48,000
from "Downton Abbey" coming soon,

148
0:07:49.861,000 --> 0:07:52,000
or that's for another day.

149
0:07:53.445,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Doug E. Fresh was the human beat box.

150
0:07:55.171,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Slick Rick is the voice you hear on the record,

151
0:07:56.955,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and because of Slick Rick's sing-songy,

152
0:08:00.015,000 --> 0:08:02,000
super-catchy vocals, it provides endless sound bites

153
0:08:02.804,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and samples for future pop records.

154
0:08:05.546,000 --> 0:08:06,000
That was 1984.

155
0:08:06.876,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is me in 1984, in case you were wondering

156
0:08:09.779,000 --> 0:08:11,000
how I was doing, thank you for asking.

157
0:08:12.31,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's Throwback Thursday already.

158
0:08:14.411,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was involved in a heavy love affair

159
0:08:16.764,000 --> 0:08:17,000
with the music of Duran Duran,

160
0:08:18.093,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as you can probably tell from my outfit.

161
0:08:20.164,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I was in the middle.

162
0:08:21.818,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the simplest way that I knew

163
0:08:23.949,000 --> 0:08:25,000
how to co-opt myself into that experience

164
0:08:26.53,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of wanting to be in that song somehow

165
0:08:28.463,000 --> 0:08:3,000
was to just get a band together of fellow nine-year-olds

166
0:08:30.884,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and play "Wild Boys" at the school talent show.

167
0:08:33.391,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So that's what we did, and long story short,

168
0:08:35.88,000 --> 0:08:36,000
we were booed off the stage,

169
0:08:37.622,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and if you ever have a chance to live your life

170
0:08:40.435,000 --> 0:08:42,000
escaping hearing the sound of an auditorium

171
0:08:42.976,000 --> 0:08:43,000
full of second- and third-graders booing,

172
0:08:44.529,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I would highly recommend it. It's not really fun.

173
0:08:47.137,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But it didn't really matter,

174
0:08:48.437,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because what I wanted somehow

175
0:08:50.205,000 --> 0:08:52,000
was to just be in the history of that song for a minute.

176
0:08:52.932,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I didn't care who liked it.

177
0:08:54.123,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I just loved it, and I thought I could put myself in there.

178
0:08:57.442,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Over the next 10 years, "La Di Da Di"

179
0:08:59.21,000 --> 0:09:,000
continues to be sampled by countless records,

180
0:09:01.155,000 --> 0:09:04,000
ending up on massive hits like "Here Comes the Hotstepper"

181
0:09:04.879,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and "I Wanna Sex You Up."

182
0:09:06.36,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Snoop Doggy Dogg covers this song

183
0:09:08.241,000 --> 0:09:12,000
on his debut album "Doggystyle" and calls it "Lodi Dodi."

184
0:09:12.304,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Copyright lawyers are having a field day at this point.

185
0:09:14.712,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And then you fast forward to 1997,

186
0:09:17.48,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the Notorious B.I.G., or Biggie,

187
0:09:20.334,000 --> 0:09:22,000
reinterprets "La Di Da Di"

188
0:09:23.296,000 --> 0:09:25,000
on his number one hit called "Hypnotize,"

189
0:09:26.104,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which I will play a little bit of

190
0:09:27.626,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and I will play you a little bit of the Slick Rick

191
0:09:29.208,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to show you where they got it from.

192
0:09:32.277,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Music: "Hypnotize" by The Notorious B.I.G.)

193
0:09:59.385,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So Biggie was killed

194
0:10:03.372,000 --> 0:10:05,000
weeks before that song made it to number one,

195
0:10:05.376,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in one of the great tragedies of the hip-hop era,

196
0:10:07.578,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but he would have been 13 years old

197
0:10:09.294,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and very much alive when "La Di Da Di" first came out,

198
0:10:11.603,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and as a young boy

199
0:10:12.865,000 --> 0:10:13,000
growing up in Brooklyn,

200
0:10:14.516,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it's hard not to think that that song probably held

201
0:10:16.658,000 --> 0:10:17,000
some fond memories for him.

202
0:10:18.089,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But the way he interpreted it, as you hear,

203
0:10:19.875,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is completely his own.

204
0:10:21.29,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He flips it, makes it,

205
0:10:23.365,000 --> 0:10:25,000
there's nothing pastiche whatsoever about it.

206
0:10:25.721,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's thoroughly modern Biggie.

207
0:10:28.529,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I had to make that joke in this room,

208
0:10:30.257,000 --> 0:10:32,000
because you would be the only people that I'd ever have a chance of getting it.

209
0:10:33.083,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And so, it's a groaner. (Laughter)

210
0:10:36.323,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Elsewhere in the pop and rap world,

211
0:10:39.876,000 --> 0:10:4,000
we're going a little bit sample-crazy.

212
0:10:41.792,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We're getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing,

213
0:10:44.29,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and all of a sudden everyone's taking

214
0:10:45.626,000 --> 0:10:47,000
these massive '80s tunes like Bowie, "Let's Dance,"

215
0:10:48.437,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and all these disco records, and just rapping on them.

216
0:10:50.816,000 --> 0:10:51,000
These records don't really age that well.

217
0:10:52.66,000 --> 0:10:54,000
You don't hear them now, because they borrowed

218
0:10:54.715,000 --> 0:10:55,000
from an era that was too steeped

219
0:10:56.309,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in its own connotation.

220
0:10:58.257,000 --> 0:11:02,000
You can't just hijack nostalgia wholesale.

221
0:11:02.969,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It leaves the listener feeling sickly.

222
0:11:05.093,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You have to take an element of those things

223
0:11:07.356,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and then bring something fresh and new to it,

224
0:11:10.235,000 --> 0:11:11,000
which was something that I learned

225
0:11:11.425,000 --> 0:11:12,000
when I was working with the late,

226
0:11:13.143,000 --> 0:11:14,000
amazing Amy Winehouse

227
0:11:14.455,000 --> 0:11:16,000
on her album "Back to Black."

228
0:11:16.696,000 --> 0:11:19,000
A lot of fuss was made about the sonic of the album

229
0:11:19.752,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that myself and Salaam Remi, the other producer,

230
0:11:21.781,000 --> 0:11:22,000
achieved, how we captured this long-lost sound,

231
0:11:23.669,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but without the very, very 21st-century personality

232
0:11:27.444,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and firebrand that was Amy Winehouse

233
0:11:29.397,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and her lyrics about rehab and Roger Moore

234
0:11:32.55,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and even a mention of Slick Rick,

235
0:11:34.476,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the whole thing would have run the risk

236
0:11:35.761,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of being very pastiche, to be honest.

237
0:11:39.222,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Imagine any other singer from that era over it

238
0:11:41.51,000 --> 0:11:43,000
singing the same old lyrics.

239
0:11:44.201,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It runs a risk of being completely bland.

240
0:11:46.338,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I mean, there was no doubt that Amy

241
0:11:48.851,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and I and Salaam all had this love

242
0:11:50.809,000 --> 0:11:51,000
for this gospel, soul and blues and jazz

243
0:11:52.599,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that was evident listening to the musical arrangements.

244
0:11:55.818,000 --> 0:11:57,000
She brought the ingredients that made it urgent

245
0:11:57.862,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and of the time.

246
0:11:59.521,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So if we come all the way up to the present day now,

247
0:12:02.558,000 --> 0:12:05,000
the cultural tour de force that is Miley Cyrus,

248
0:12:06.07,000 --> 0:12:08,000
she reinterprets "La Di Da Di"

249
0:12:08.292,000 --> 0:12:1,000
completely for her generation,

250
0:12:10.454,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and we'll take a listen to the Slick Rick part

251
0:12:13.398,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and then see how she sort of flipped it.

252
0:12:18.309,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Music: "La Di Da Di" by Slick Rick & Doug E. Fresh)

253
0:12:31.953,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Music: "We Can't Stop" by Miley Cyrus)

254
0:12:37.936,000 --> 0:12:38,000
So Miley Cyrus,

255
0:12:39.777,000 --> 0:12:42,000
who wasn't even born yet when "La Di Da Di" was made,

256
0:12:43.315,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and neither were any of the co-writers on the song,

257
0:12:46.849,000 --> 0:12:48,000
has found this song that somehow

258
0:12:48.959,000 --> 0:12:51,000
etched its way into the collective consciousness of pop music,

259
0:12:52.004,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and now, with its timeless playfulness of the original,

260
0:12:55.957,000 --> 0:12:57,000
has kind of translated to a whole new generation

261
0:12:58.38,000 --> 0:13:01,000
who will probably co-opt it as their own.

262
0:13:02.048,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Since the dawn of the sampling era,

263
0:13:05.25,000 --> 0:13:06,000
there's been endless debate

264
0:13:06.771,000 --> 0:13:08,000
about the validity of music that contains samples.

265
0:13:09.369,000 --> 0:13:1,000
You know, the Grammy committee says that

266
0:13:10.995,000 --> 0:13:12,000
if your song contains some kind of pre-written

267
0:13:13.653,000 --> 0:13:14,000
or pre-existing music,

268
0:13:14.898,000 --> 0:13:15,000
you're ineligible for song of the year.

269
0:13:16.893,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Rockists, who are racist

270
0:13:19.17,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but only about rock music,

271
0:13:20.92,000 --> 0:13:24,000
constantly use the argument to —

272
0:13:25.151,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That's a real word. That is a real word.

273
0:13:27.173,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They constantly use the argument to devalue rap

274
0:13:29.789,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and modern pop,

275
0:13:31.699,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and these arguments completely miss the point,

276
0:13:35.861,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because the dam has burst.

277
0:13:37.82,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We live in the post-sampling era.

278
0:13:39.853,000 --> 0:13:4,000
We take the things that we love

279
0:13:41.48,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and we build on them.

280
0:13:42.858,000 --> 0:13:43,000
That's just how it goes.

281
0:13:44.498,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And when we really add something significant and original

282
0:13:47.59,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and we merge our musical journey with this,

283
0:13:50.087,000 --> 0:13:51,000
then we have a chance to be

284
0:13:51.925,000 --> 0:13:53,000
a part of the evolution of that music that we love

285
0:13:54.558,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and be linked with it once it becomes something new again.

286
0:13:57.799,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So I would like to do one more piece

287
0:14:03.163,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that I put together for you tonight,

288
0:14:04.881,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and it takes place with two

289
0:14:07.236,000 --> 0:14:1,000
pretty inspiring TED performances that I've seen.

290
0:14:10.272,000 --> 0:14:13,000
One of them is the piano player Derek Paravicini,

291
0:14:13.907,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who happens to be a blind,

292
0:14:15.989,000 --> 0:14:16,000
autistic genius at the piano,

293
0:14:17.527,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and Emmanuel Jal, who is an ex-child soldier

294
0:14:19.94,000 --> 0:14:2,000
from the South Sudan,

295
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
who is a spoken word poet and rapper.

296
0:14:24.122,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And once again I found a way to annoyingly

297
0:14:26.46,000 --> 0:14:28,000
me-me-me myself into the musical history

298
0:14:28.721,000 --> 0:14:3,000
of these songs,

299
0:14:31.235,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but I can't help it,

300
0:14:32.343,000 --> 0:14:33,000
because they're these things that I love,

301
0:14:34.048,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and I want to mess around with them.

302
0:14:35.975,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So I hope you enjoy this. Here we go.

303
0:14:39.712,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Let's hear that TED sound again, right?

304
0:14:41.793,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Music)

305
0:16:43.423,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

306
0:16:46.448,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

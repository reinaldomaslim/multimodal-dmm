1
0:00:12.648,000 --> 0:00:15,000
T. Morgan Dixon: I would like to tell you about the most powerful woman

2
0:00:16.398,000 --> 0:00:17,000
you've never heard of.

3
0:00:19.017,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is Septima Clark.

4
0:00:21.126,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Remember her name: Septima Clark.

5
0:00:22.934,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Dr. King called her the "the architect of the civil rights movement,"

6
0:00:26.695,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because she created something called Citizenship Schools.

7
0:00:29.386,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And in those schools, she taught ordinary women the practical skills

8
0:00:32.626,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to go back into their communities and teach people to read.

9
0:00:35.834,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Because if they could read,

10
0:00:37.906,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they could vote.

11
0:00:39.383,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Well, these women took those organizing skills,

12
0:00:41.722,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and they became some of the most legendary civil rights activists

13
0:00:44.819,000 --> 0:00:45,000
this country has ever seen.

14
0:00:46.833,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Women like Diane Nash.

15
0:00:49.092,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You may know her.

16
0:00:50.291,000 --> 0:00:53,000
She orchestrated the entire walk from Selma to Montgomery.

17
0:00:53.547,000 --> 0:00:56,000
She was a cofounder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,

18
0:00:57.271,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and they integrated lunch counters,

19
0:00:59.031,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they created the Freedom Rides.

20
0:01:00.874,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Or you may remember Fannie Lou Hamer,

21
0:01:02.661,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who sat on the floor of the Democratic National Convention

22
0:01:06.121,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and talked about being beaten in jail cells

23
0:01:08.434,000 --> 0:01:1,000
as she registered people to vote in Mississippi.

24
0:01:11.286,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And her most famous student,

25
0:01:13.112,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Rosa Parks.

26
0:01:14.43,000 --> 0:01:16,000
She said Septima Clark was the one who taught her

27
0:01:17.063,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the peaceful act of resistance.

28
0:01:19.031,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And when she sat down,

29
0:01:20.282,000 --> 0:01:22,000
she inspired a nation to stand.

30
0:01:24.174,000 --> 0:01:26,000
These were just three of her 10,000 students.

31
0:01:26.686,000 --> 0:01:28,000
These women stood on the front lines of change,

32
0:01:29.627,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and by doing so,

33
0:01:31.134,000 --> 0:01:34,000
they taught people to read in her Citizenship School model

34
0:01:34.505,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and empowered 700,000 new voters.

35
0:01:38.714,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And that's not it.

36
0:01:39.893,000 --> 0:01:42,000
She created a new culture of social activism.

37
0:01:43.761,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Pete Seeger said it was Septima Clark who changed the lyrics

38
0:01:47.042,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to the old gospel song

39
0:01:48.651,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and made the anthem we all know:

40
0:01:50.76,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"We Shall Overcome."

41
0:01:53.467,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Vanessa Garrison: Now, many of you may know us.

42
0:01:55.702,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We are the cofounders of GirlTrek,

43
0:01:58.203,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the largest health organization for Black women in America.

44
0:02:02.335,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Our mission is simple:

45
0:02:04.292,000 --> 0:02:05,000
ask Black women,

46
0:02:06.609,000 --> 0:02:08,000
80 percent of whom are over a healthy body weight,

47
0:02:09.561,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to walk outside of their front door every day

48
0:02:12.934,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to establish a lifesaving habit of walking;

49
0:02:17.972,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in doing so, ignite a radical movement

50
0:02:21.408,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in which Black women reverse the devastating impacts

51
0:02:24.773,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of chronic disease,

52
0:02:26.112,000 --> 0:02:28,000
reclaim the streets of their neighborhoods,

53
0:02:28.437,000 --> 0:02:3,000
create a new culture of health for their families

54
0:02:31.266,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and stand on the front lines for justice.

55
0:02:33.999,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Today, all across America,

56
0:02:37.102,000 --> 0:02:42,000
more than 100,000 Black women are wearing this GirlTrek blue shirt

57
0:02:42.204,000 --> 0:02:44,000
as they move through their communities --

58
0:02:44.635,000 --> 0:02:45,000
a heroic force.

59
0:02:46.983,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We walk in the footsteps of Septima Clark.

60
0:02:50.478,000 --> 0:02:53,000
She gave us a blueprint for change-making.

61
0:02:54.852,000 --> 0:02:56,000
One, to have a bold idea,

62
0:02:57.597,000 --> 0:02:59,000
bigger than anyone is comfortable with.

63
0:02:59.635,000 --> 0:03:03,000
To two: root down in the cultural traditions of your community

64
0:03:03.798,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and lean heavily on what has come before.

65
0:03:07.074,000 --> 0:03:09,000
To three: name it --

66
0:03:09.604,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that one thing that everyone is willing to work hard for;

67
0:03:13.375,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a ridiculously simple goal that doesn't just benefit the individual

68
0:03:18.875,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but the village around them.

69
0:03:21.906,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And to, lastly:

70
0:03:24.529,000 --> 0:03:26,000
never ask permission to save your own life.

71
0:03:27.73,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It is our fundamental right as human beings

72
0:03:31.584,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to solve our own problems.

73
0:03:37.578,000 --> 0:03:41,000
TMD: So to the women all out there gathered in your living rooms,

74
0:03:41.613,000 --> 0:03:44,000
rooting for us, acting crazy on social media right now --

75
0:03:44.64,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we see you.

76
0:03:45.823,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:46.855,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We see you every day. We love you.

78
0:03:49.317,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You are not alone,

79
0:03:50.69,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and our bigger work starts now.

80
0:03:53.525,000 --> 0:03:55,000
VG: You got us onto this stage --

81
0:03:56.145,000 --> 0:03:57,000
your leadership;

82
0:03:57.673,000 --> 0:03:59,000
auditing blighted streets in Detroit;

83
0:04:00.44,000 --> 0:04:03,000
working with hospitals and health care systems in Harlem;

84
0:04:03.808,000 --> 0:04:08,000
praying over the streets of Sacramento, Charlotte, Brooklyn, Flint

85
0:04:09.288,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and every community that has seen trauma;

86
0:04:12.214,000 --> 0:04:14,000
changing traffic patterns, making your streets safer;

87
0:04:14.784,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and most importantly,

88
0:04:16.319,000 --> 0:04:18,000
standing as role models.

89
0:04:18.972,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And it all started with your commitment to start walking,

90
0:04:22.963,000 --> 0:04:24,000
your agreement to organize your friends and family

91
0:04:25.682,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and your belief in our broader mission.

92
0:04:29.017,000 --> 0:04:32,000
TMD: It's important to me that everyone in this room understands

93
0:04:32.101,000 --> 0:04:34,000
exactly how change-making works in GirlTrek.

94
0:04:34.452,000 --> 0:04:38,000
One well-trained organizer has the power to change the behavior

95
0:04:38.652,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of 100 of her friends.

96
0:04:39.897,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We know that is true,

97
0:04:41.087,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because the [1,000] women blowing up social media right now

98
0:04:44.236,000 --> 0:04:49,000
have already inspired over 100,000 women to walk.

99
0:04:50.64,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause)

100
0:04:56.282,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But that is not nearly enough.

101
0:04:58.766,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And so our goal is to create critical mass.

102
0:05:03.341,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And in order to do that,

103
0:05:04.635,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we have an audacious plan to scale our intervention.

104
0:05:09.646,000 --> 0:05:1,000
A thousand organizers is not enough.

105
0:05:12.192,000 --> 0:05:16,000
GirlTrek is going to create the next Citizenship School.

106
0:05:16.242,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And in doing so, we will train 10,000 frontline health activists

107
0:05:21.707,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and deploy them into the highest-need communities in America.

108
0:05:24.623,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Because when we do, we will disrupt disease;

109
0:05:26.721,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we will create a new culture of health.

110
0:05:28.604,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And what we will do is create a support system

111
0:05:30.986,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for one million Black women to walk to save their own lives.

112
0:05:34.785,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Applause)

113
0:05:41.276,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And our training is unparalleled.

114
0:05:44.639,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I just want you to imagine.

115
0:05:45.963,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's like a revival, tent-like festival,

116
0:05:48.115,000 --> 0:05:51,000
not unlike the civil rights movement teach-ins.

117
0:05:51.414,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And we're going to go all across the country.

118
0:05:53.909,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It is the biggest announcement this week:

119
0:05:56.203,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Vanessa and I and a team of masterful teachers,

120
0:05:59.358,000 --> 0:06:01,000
all to culminate next year,

121
0:06:01.72,000 --> 0:06:02,000
on sacred ground,

122
0:06:03.461,000 --> 0:06:04,000
in Selma, Alabama,

123
0:06:05.389,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to create a new annual tradition that we are calling "Summer of Selma."

124
0:06:11.482,000 --> 0:06:13,000
VG: Summer of Selma will be an annual pilgrimage

125
0:06:14.094,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that will include a walk --

126
0:06:16.117,000 --> 0:06:17,000
54 miles,

127
0:06:17.703,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the sacred route from Selma to Montgomery.

128
0:06:20.745,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It will also include rigorous training.

129
0:06:23.403,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Picture it,

130
0:06:24.654,000 --> 0:06:28,000
as women come to learn organizing and recruitment strategies,

131
0:06:28.774,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to study exercise science,

132
0:06:30.706,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to take nutrition classes,

133
0:06:32.471,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to learn storytelling,

134
0:06:34.221,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to become certified as outdoor trip leaders

135
0:06:37.315,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and community advocates.

136
0:06:40.474,000 --> 0:06:41,000
TMD: This is going to be unprecedented.

137
0:06:42.4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's going to be a moment in time like a cultural institution,

138
0:06:45.341,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and in fact,

139
0:06:46.487,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it's going to be the Woodstock of Black Girl Healing.

140
0:06:49.163,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:50.857,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

142
0:06:55.012,000 --> 0:06:56,000
VG: And the need --

143
0:06:57.605,000 --> 0:06:58,000
it's more urgent than ever.

144
0:07:00.691,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We are losing our communities' greatest resource.

145
0:07:06.569,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Black women are dying in plain sight.

146
0:07:11.317,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And not only is no one talking about it,

147
0:07:15.075,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but we refuse to acknowledge

148
0:07:17.216,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that the source of this crisis is rooted in the same injustice

149
0:07:21.398,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that first propelled the civil rights movement.

150
0:07:25.234,000 --> 0:07:28,000
On December 30 of 2017,

151
0:07:29.717,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Erica Garner,

152
0:07:32.116,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the daughter of Eric Garner,

153
0:07:34.475,000 --> 0:07:36,000
a Black man who died on the streets of New York

154
0:07:37.17,000 --> 0:07:38,000
from a police choke hold,

155
0:07:38.998,000 --> 0:07:4,000
passed away of a heart attack.

156
0:07:42.276,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Erica was just 27 years old,

157
0:07:44.598,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the mother of two children.

158
0:07:47.369,000 --> 0:07:51,000
She would be one of 137 Black women that day --

159
0:07:51.516,000 --> 0:07:53,000
more than 50,000 in the last year --

160
0:07:54.105,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to die from a heart-related issue,

161
0:07:57.159,000 --> 0:07:59,000
many of their hearts broken from trauma.

162
0:08:01.431,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The impacts of stress on Black women

163
0:08:06.466,000 --> 0:08:09,000
who send their children and spouses out the door each day,

164
0:08:10.318,000 --> 0:08:13,000
unsure if they will come home alive;

165
0:08:13.457,000 --> 0:08:19,000
who work jobs where they are paid 63 cents to every dollar paid to white men;

166
0:08:19.791,000 --> 0:08:22,000
who live in communities with crumbling infrastructure

167
0:08:23.136,000 --> 0:08:26,000
with no access to fresh fruits or vegetables;

168
0:08:26.485,000 --> 0:08:29,000
with little to no walkable or green spaces --

169
0:08:30.954,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the impact of this inequality is killing Black women

170
0:08:34.824,000 --> 0:08:39,000
at higher and faster rates than any other group in the country.

171
0:08:39.987,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But that is about to change.

172
0:08:42.2,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It has to.

173
0:08:47.537,000 --> 0:08:48,000
TMD: So let me tell you a story.

174
0:08:49.89,000 --> 0:08:5,000
About three weeks ago --

175
0:08:52.282,000 --> 0:08:53,000
many of you may have watched --

176
0:08:53.852,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Vanessa and I and a team of 10 women walked 100 miles

177
0:08:57.046,000 --> 0:08:59,000
on the actual Underground Railroad.

178
0:08:59.66,000 --> 0:09:,000
We did it in five days --

179
0:09:01.15,000 --> 0:09:03,000
five long and beautiful days.

180
0:09:03.604,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And the world watched.

181
0:09:05.821,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Three million people watched the live stream.

182
0:09:08.178,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Some of you in here, the influencers, shared the story.

183
0:09:11.289,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Urban Radio blasted it across the country.

184
0:09:13.74,000 --> 0:09:16,000
VG: Even the E! News channel interrupted a story about the Kardashians --

185
0:09:17.317,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which, if you asked us, is just a little bit of justice --

186
0:09:20.421,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

187
0:09:21.454,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to report that GirlTrek had made it safely on our hundred-mile journey.

188
0:09:25.4,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

189
0:09:32.429,000 --> 0:09:33,000
TMD: People were rooting for us.

190
0:09:34.423,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And they were rooting for us because in this time of confusion and contention,

191
0:09:39.187,000 --> 0:09:43,000
this journey allowed us all to reflect on what it meant to be American.

192
0:09:44.548,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We saw America up close and personal as we walked.

193
0:09:47.055,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We walked through historic towns,

194
0:09:49.725,000 --> 0:09:5,000
through dense forest,

195
0:09:51.27,000 --> 0:09:53,000
past former plantations.

196
0:09:53.726,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And one day,

197
0:09:55.636,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we walked into a gas station that was also a café,

198
0:09:59.152,000 --> 0:10:,000
and it was filled with men.

199
0:10:01.092,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They were wearing camo and had hunting supplies.

200
0:10:03.837,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And out front were all of their trucks, and one had a Confederate flag.

201
0:10:07.532,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And so we left the establishment.

202
0:10:09.415,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And as we were walking along this narrow strip of road,

203
0:10:12.277,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a few of the trucks reared by us so close,

204
0:10:16.619,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and out of their tailpipe was the specter of mob violence.

205
0:10:20.512,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It was unnerving.

206
0:10:23.232,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But then it happened.

207
0:10:25.28,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Right on the border of Maryland and Delaware,

208
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:29,000
we saw a man standing by his truck.

209
0:10:30.736,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The tailgate was down.

210
0:10:32.199,000 --> 0:10:33,000
He had on a brown jacket.

211
0:10:34.04,000 --> 0:10:35,000
He was standing there awkwardly.

212
0:10:35.607,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The first two girls in our group, Jewel and Sandria,

213
0:10:38.095,000 --> 0:10:4,000
they walked by because he looked suspicious.

214
0:10:40.324,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:41.355,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But the bigger group, we stopped to give him a chance.

216
0:10:44.032,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And he walked up to us and he said,

217
0:10:45.765,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Hi, my name is Jake Green.

218
0:10:47.746,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I heard you on Christian radio this morning,

219
0:10:49.829,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and God told me to bring you supplies."

220
0:10:53.793,000 --> 0:10:54,000
He brought us water,

221
0:10:55.651,000 --> 0:10:56,000
he brought us granola,

222
0:10:56.937,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and he brought us tissue.

223
0:10:59.18,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And we needed tissue because we had just walked through a nor'easter;

224
0:11:02.5,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it was 29 degrees, it was sleeting on our faces.

225
0:11:04.815,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Our sneakers and our socks were frozen and wet and frozen again.

226
0:11:09.48,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We needed that tissue more than he could have possibly understood.

227
0:11:13.152,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So on that day, in that moment,

228
0:11:14.966,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Jake Green renewed my faith in God for sure,

229
0:11:18.599,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but he renewed my faith in humanity.

230
0:11:22.196,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We have a choice to make.

231
0:11:26.01,000 --> 0:11:31,000
In America, we can fall further into the darkness of discord, or not.

232
0:11:31.048,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And I am here to tell you

233
0:11:32.282,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that the women of GirlTrek are walking through the streets

234
0:11:35.031,000 --> 0:11:37,000
with a light that cannot be extinguished.

235
0:11:37.308,000 --> 0:11:39,000
VG: They are also walking through the streets with a mission

236
0:11:40.187,000 --> 0:11:44,000
as clear and as powerful as the women who marched in Montgomery:

237
0:11:44.711,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that disease stops here,

238
0:11:47.182,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that trauma stops here.

239
0:11:50.769,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And with your support

240
0:11:52.842,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and in our ancestors' footsteps,

241
0:11:55.36,000 --> 0:12:,000
these 10,000 newly trained activists will launch the largest health revolution

242
0:12:01.177,000 --> 0:12:02,000
this country has ever seen.

243
0:12:03.73,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And they will return to their communities and model the best of human flourishing.

244
0:12:09.675,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And we --

245
0:12:11.112,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we will all celebrate.

246
0:12:12.978,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Because like Jake Green understood,

247
0:12:15.945,000 --> 0:12:17,000
our fates are intertwined.

248
0:12:19.321,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Septima Clark once said,

249
0:12:22.657,000 --> 0:12:26,000
"The air has finally gotten to a place where we can breathe it together."

250
0:12:28.231,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And yet,

251
0:12:30.334,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the haunting last words of Eric Garner were: "I can't breathe."

252
0:12:36.671,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And his daughter Erica died at 27 years old,

253
0:12:40.382,000 --> 0:12:42,000
still seeking justice.

254
0:12:42.862,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So we --

255
0:12:44.037,000 --> 0:12:46,000
we're going to keep doing Septima's work

256
0:12:46.971,000 --> 0:12:48,000
until her words become reality,

257
0:12:50.206,000 --> 0:12:53,000
until Black women are no longer dying,

258
0:12:55.891,000 --> 0:12:58,000
until we can all breathe the air together.

259
0:12:59.895,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

260
0:13:01.07,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Applause)

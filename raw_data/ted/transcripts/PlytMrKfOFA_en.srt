1
0:00:12.873,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In the late 19th century, scientists were trying to solve a mystery.

2
0:00:18.254,000 --> 0:00:21,000
They found that if they had a vacuum tube like this one

3
0:00:21.792,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and applied a high voltage across it,

4
0:00:24.443,000 --> 0:00:25,000
something strange happened.

5
0:00:36.666,000 --> 0:00:38,000
They called them cathode rays.

6
0:00:39.531,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But the question was: What were they made of?

7
0:00:42.858,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In England, the 19th-century physicist J.J. Thompson

8
0:00:46.755,000 --> 0:00:5,000
conducted experiments using magnets and electricity, like this.

9
0:00:57.552,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And he came to an incredible revelation.

10
0:01:00.956,000 --> 0:01:03,000
These rays were made of negatively charged particles

11
0:01:04.514,000 --> 0:01:07,000
around 2,000 times lighter than the hydrogen atom,

12
0:01:08.53,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the smallest thing they knew.

13
0:01:10.673,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So Thompson had discovered the first subatomic particle,

14
0:01:14.911,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which we now call electrons.

15
0:01:17.561,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, at the time, this seemed to be a completely impractical discovery.

16
0:01:21.418,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I mean, Thompson didn't think there were any applications of electrons.

17
0:01:25.653,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Around his lab in Cambridge, he used to like to propose a toast:

18
0:01:29.95,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"To the electron.

19
0:01:31.323,000 --> 0:01:33,000
May it never be of use to anybody."

20
0:01:33.497,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:36.085,000 --> 0:01:39,000
He was strongly in favor of doing research out of sheer curiosity,

22
0:01:40.03,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to arrive at a deeper understanding of the world.

23
0:01:43.696,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And what he found did cause a revolution in science.

24
0:01:47.704,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But it also caused a second, unexpected revolution in technology.

25
0:01:53.582,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Today, I'd like to make a case for curiosity-driven research,

26
0:01:57.939,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because without it,

27
0:01:59.399,000 --> 0:02:01,000
none of the technologies I'll talk about today

28
0:02:01.919,000 --> 0:02:02,000
would have been possible.

29
0:02:04.077,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, what Thompson found here has actually changed our view of reality.

30
0:02:08.792,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I mean, I think I'm standing on a stage,

31
0:02:11.704,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and you think you're sitting in a seat.

32
0:02:13.768,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But that's just the electrons in your body

33
0:02:15.816,000 --> 0:02:17,000
pushing back against the electrons in the seat,

34
0:02:18.609,000 --> 0:02:2,000
opposing the force of gravity.

35
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You're not even really touching the seat.

36
0:02:24.014,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You're hovering ever so slightly above it.

37
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But in many ways, our modern society was actually built on this discovery.

38
0:02:33.085,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I mean, these tubes were the start of electronics.

39
0:02:35.609,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And then for many years,

40
0:02:37.127,000 --> 0:02:4,000
most of us actually had one of these, if you remember, in your living room,

41
0:02:40.863,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in cathode-ray tube televisions.

42
0:02:43.895,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But -- I mean, how impoverished would our lives be

43
0:02:46.633,000 --> 0:02:49,000
if the only invention that had come from here was the television?

44
0:02:50.167,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:52.387,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Thankfully, this tube was just a start,

46
0:02:55.093,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because something else happens when the electrons here

47
0:02:57.852,000 --> 0:02:59,000
hit the piece of metal inside the tube.

48
0:03:00.212,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Let me show you.

49
0:03:04.599,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Pop this one back on.

50
0:03:07.163,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So as the electrons screech to a halt inside the metal,

51
0:03:10.218,000 --> 0:03:12,000
their energy gets thrown out again

52
0:03:12.417,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in a form of high-energy light, which we call X-rays.

53
0:03:16.087,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Buzzing)

54
0:03:19.793,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Buzzing)

55
0:03:21.661,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And within 15 years of discovering the electron,

56
0:03:24.911,000 --> 0:03:28,000
these X-rays were being used to make images inside the human body,

57
0:03:29.53,000 --> 0:03:33,000
helping soldiers' lives being saved by surgeons,

58
0:03:33.846,000 --> 0:03:36,000
who could then find pieces of bullets and shrapnel inside their bodies.

59
0:03:38.236,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But there's no way we could have come up with that technology

60
0:03:41.245,000 --> 0:03:44,000
by asking scientists to build better surgical probes.

61
0:03:45.22,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Only research done out of sheer curiosity, with no application in mind,

62
0:03:50.125,000 --> 0:03:53,000
could have given us the discovery of the electron and X-rays.

63
0:03:54.99,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Now, this tube also threw open the gates for our understanding of the universe

64
0:04:00.085,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and the field of particle physics,

65
0:04:02.307,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because it's also the first, very simple particle accelerator.

66
0:04:07.785,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, I'm an accelerator physicist, so I design particle accelerators,

67
0:04:11.983,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I try and understand how beams behave.

68
0:04:15.229,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And my field's a bit unusual,

69
0:04:16.977,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because it crosses between curiosity-driven research

70
0:04:20.673,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and technology with real-world applications.

71
0:04:24.586,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But it's the combination of those two things

72
0:04:26.713,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that gets me really excited about what I do.

73
0:04:30.704,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, over the last 100 years,

74
0:04:32.459,000 --> 0:04:34,000
there have been far too many examples for me to list them all.

75
0:04:35.392,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But I want to share with you just a few.

76
0:04:37.569,000 --> 0:04:42,000
In 1928, a physicist named Paul Dirac found something strange in his equations.

77
0:04:43.938,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And he predicted, based purely on mathematical insight,

78
0:04:48.367,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that there ought to be a second kind of matter,

79
0:04:51.161,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the opposite to normal matter,

80
0:04:53.363,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that literally annihilates when it comes in contact:

81
0:04:57.379,000 --> 0:04:58,000
antimatter.

82
0:04:59.76,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I mean, the idea sounded ridiculous.

83
0:05:02.427,000 --> 0:05:04,000
But within four years, they'd found it.

84
0:05:04.847,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And nowadays, we use it every day in hospitals,

85
0:05:07.157,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in positron emission tomography, or PET scans, used for detecting disease.

86
0:05:13.655,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Or, take these X-rays.

87
0:05:15.861,000 --> 0:05:17,000
If you can get these electrons up to a higher energy,

88
0:05:18.409,000 --> 0:05:2,000
so about 1,000 times higher than this tube,

89
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the X-rays that those produce

90
0:05:24.009,000 --> 0:05:27,000
can actually deliver enough ionizing radiation to kill human cells.

91
0:05:28.588,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And if you can shape and direct those X-rays where you want them to go,

92
0:05:32.069,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that allows us to do an incredible thing:

93
0:05:35.077,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to treat cancer without drugs or surgery,

94
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:4,000
which we call radiotherapy.

95
0:05:40.268,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In countries like Australia and the UK,

96
0:05:43.014,000 --> 0:05:47,000
around half of all cancer patients are treated using radiotherapy.

97
0:05:47.474,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And so, electron accelerators are actually standard equipment

98
0:05:51.513,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in most hospitals.

99
0:05:53.68,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Or, a little closer to home:

100
0:05:56.022,000 --> 0:05:58,000
if you have a smartphone or a computer --

101
0:05:58.58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and this is TEDx, so you've got both with you right now, right?

102
0:06:03.855,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well, inside those devices

103
0:06:06.72,000 --> 0:06:1,000
are chips that are made by implanting single ions into silicon,

104
0:06:10.98,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in a process called ion implantation.

105
0:06:13.617,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And that uses a particle accelerator.

106
0:06:18.546,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Without curiosity-driven research, though,

107
0:06:22.292,000 --> 0:06:25,000
none of these things would exist at all.

108
0:06:27.66,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So, over the years, we really learned to explore inside the atom.

109
0:06:33.509,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And to do that, we had to learn to develop particle accelerators.

110
0:06:37.696,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The first ones we developed let us split the atom.

111
0:06:41.474,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And then we got to higher and higher energies;

112
0:06:45.004,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we created circular accelerators that let us delve into the nucleus

113
0:06:49.331,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and then create new elements, even.

114
0:06:53.717,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And at that point, we were no longer just exploring inside the atom.

115
0:06:58.542,000 --> 0:07:,000
We'd actually learned how to control these particles.

116
0:07:01.304,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We'd learned how to interact with our world

117
0:07:03.95,000 --> 0:07:07,000
on a scale that's too small for humans to see or touch

118
0:07:08.537,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or even sense that it's there.

119
0:07:12.276,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And then we built larger and larger accelerators,

120
0:07:16.035,000 --> 0:07:19,000
because we were curious about the nature of the universe.

121
0:07:19.633,000 --> 0:07:23,000
As we went deeper and deeper, new particles started popping up.

122
0:07:24.823,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Eventually, we got to huge ring-like machines

123
0:07:27.768,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that take two beams of particles in opposite directions,

124
0:07:31.199,000 --> 0:07:33,000
squeeze them down to less than the width of a hair

125
0:07:33.691,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and smash them together.

126
0:07:35.476,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And then, using Einstein's E=mc2,

127
0:07:38.092,000 --> 0:07:42,000
you can take all of that energy and convert it into new matter,

128
0:07:42.276,000 --> 0:07:47,000
new particles which we rip from the very fabric of the universe.

129
0:07:48.791,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Nowadays, there are about 35,000 accelerators in the world,

130
0:07:53.223,000 --> 0:07:54,000
not including televisions.

131
0:07:55.45,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And inside each one of these incredible machines,

132
0:07:59.014,000 --> 0:08:02,000
there are hundreds of billions of tiny particles,

133
0:08:02.657,000 --> 0:08:05,000
dancing and swirling in systems that are more complex

134
0:08:06.403,000 --> 0:08:08,000
than the formation of galaxies.

135
0:08:08.719,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You guys, I can't even begin to explain how incredible it is

136
0:08:12.144,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that we can do this.

137
0:08:14.125,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

138
0:08:16.149,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Applause)

139
0:08:23.531,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So I want to encourage you to invest your time and energy

140
0:08:27.616,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in people that do curiosity-driven research.

141
0:08:31.777,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It was Jonathan Swift who once said,

142
0:08:34.623,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"Vision is the art of seeing the invisible."

143
0:08:38.3,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And over a century ago, J.J. Thompson did just that,

144
0:08:41.219,000 --> 0:08:44,000
when he pulled back the veil on the subatomic world.

145
0:08:45.965,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And now we need to invest in curiosity-driven research,

146
0:08:49.592,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because we have so many challenges that we face.

147
0:08:52.561,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And we need patience;

148
0:08:54.496,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we need to give scientists the time, the space and the means

149
0:08:58.052,000 --> 0:09:,000
to continue their quest,

150
0:09:00.362,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because history tells us

151
0:09:02.514,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that if we can remain curious and open-minded

152
0:09:05.696,000 --> 0:09:07,000
about the outcomes of research,

153
0:09:08.085,000 --> 0:09:1,000
the more world-changing our discoveries will be.

154
0:09:11.397,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Thank you.

155
0:09:12.571,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
at multiple levels, over multiple timescales.

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And when I look out in the future, I can't imagine a world, 500 years from now,

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
where we don't have robots everywhere.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future --

6
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
assuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.

7
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years,

8
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
are they going to be everywhere sooner than that?

9
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Are they going to be around in 50 years?

10
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Yeah, I think that's pretty likely -- there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.

11
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that.

12
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common,

13
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years,

14
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
where the first few robots are starting to appear.

15
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Computers sort of came around through games and toys.

16
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And you know, the first computer most people had in the house

17
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
may have been a computer to play Pong,

18
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
a little microprocessor embedded,

19
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and then other games that came after that.

20
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots:

21
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
LEGO Mindstorms, Furbies -- who here -- did anyone here have a Furby?

22
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Yeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide.

23
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot,

24
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
a simple robot with some sensors,

25
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a little bit of processing actuation.

26
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
On the right there is another robot doll, who you could get a couple of years ago.

27
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And just as in the early days,

28
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers,

29
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
you can now get various hacking kits, how-to-hack books.

30
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics,

31
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI

32
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to wander around your house and do various stuff.

33
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys --

34
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
the Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed,

35
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release.

36
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there.

37
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And we've seen, over the last two or three years, lawn-mowing robots,

38
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Husqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company.

39
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And then in the last 12 months or so

40
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.

41
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot

42
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
from a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive --

43
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
3,500 dollars -- they didn't release it.

44
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But at the bottom left, you see Electrolux, which is on sale.

45
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Another one from Karcher.

46
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab

47
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
about 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product.

48
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And let me just show you that.

49
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.

50
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.

51
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles.

52
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If it hits something -- you people see that?

53
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet

54
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to clean up around me. Let's see, let's --

55
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
oh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies!

56
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!

58
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
See, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.

60
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It's grown-ups that get really upset.

61
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We'll just put some crap here.

63
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Okay.

65
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there,

67
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.

68
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Yeah, OK. So --

69
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we'll leave that for later.

70
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Applause)

71
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism, actually;

72
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the intelligence on board was fairly simple.

73
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And that's true with a lot of robots.

74
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists,

75
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and think that computation is everything,

76
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but the mechanics still matter.

77
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Here's another robot, the PackBot,

78
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that we've been building for a bunch of years.

79
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops --

80
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
looking at caves, for instance.

81
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But we had to make it fairly robust,

82
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
much more robust than the robots we build in our labs.

83
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

84
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
On board that robot is a PC running Linux.

85
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence:

86
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range,

87
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
can go upstairs by itself, et cetera.

88
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Okay, so it's doing local navigation there.

89
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.

90
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
That was not a controlled descent.

91
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now it's going to head off.

93
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.

94
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening.

95
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile,

96
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
things were just too -- there was nothing left to do.

97
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated,

98
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and searched for possible survivors in the buildings

99
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that were too dangerous to go into.

100
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Let's run this video.

101
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Reporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.

102
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Nick Robertson has that story.

103
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Rodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?

104
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Okay, good.

105
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.

106
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
He's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on.

107
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The robot's being totally autonomous.

108
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far

109
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
was one of the robots fell down ten meters.

110
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So one year ago, the US military didn't have these robots.

111
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day.

112
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.

113
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
There's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going.

114
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Thanks.

115
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And over the next couple of months,

116
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we're going to be sending robots in production

117
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.

118
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000

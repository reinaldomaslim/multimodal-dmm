1
0:00:12.853,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 1956, a documentary by Jacques Cousteau won

2
0:00:17.661,000 --> 0:00:2,000
both the Palme d'Or and an Oscar award.

3
0:00:20.686,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This film was called, "Le Monde Du Silence,"

4
0:00:23.571,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or, "The Silent World."

5
0:00:26.247,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The premise of the title was that the underwater world was a quiet world.

6
0:00:32.279,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We now know, 60 years later,

7
0:00:34.618,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that the underwater world is anything but silent.

8
0:00:38.497,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Although the sounds are inaudible above water

9
0:00:41.528,000 --> 0:00:44,000
depending on where you are and the time of year,

10
0:00:44.862,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the underwater soundscape can be as noisy as any jungle or rainforest.

11
0:00:51.611,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Invertebrates like snapping shrimp, fish and marine mammals

12
0:00:56.493,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all use sound.

13
0:00:58.174,000 --> 0:01:,000
They use sound to study their habitat,

14
0:01:01.111,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to keep in communication with each other,

15
0:01:03.437,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to navigate,

16
0:01:04.744,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to detect predators and prey.

17
0:01:07.557,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They also use sound by listening to know something about their environment.

18
0:01:12.87,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Take, for an example, the Arctic.

19
0:01:15.573,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It's considered a vast, inhospitable place,

20
0:01:18.825,000 --> 0:01:2,000
sometimes described as a desert,

21
0:01:21.43,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because it is so cold and so remote

22
0:01:24.387,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and ice-covered for much of the year.

23
0:01:27.088,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And despite this,

24
0:01:28.825,000 --> 0:01:32,000
there is no place on Earth that I would rather be than the Arctic,

25
0:01:32.893,000 --> 0:01:35,000
especially as days lengthen and spring comes.

26
0:01:37.284,000 --> 0:01:41,000
To me, the Arctic really embodies this disconnect

27
0:01:41.611,000 --> 0:01:46,000
between what we see on the surface and what's going on underwater.

28
0:01:47.505,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You can look out across the ice -- all white and blue and cold --

29
0:01:53.511,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and see nothing.

30
0:01:55.473,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But if you could hear underwater,

31
0:01:58.134,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the sounds you would hear would at first amaze

32
0:02:01.539,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then delight you.

33
0:02:03.65,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And while your eyes are seeing nothing for kilometers but ice,

34
0:02:07.696,000 --> 0:02:12,000
your ears are telling you that out there are bowhead and beluga whales,

35
0:02:13.183,000 --> 0:02:15,000
walrus and bearded seals.

36
0:02:16.481,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The ice, too, makes sounds.

37
0:02:18.414,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It screeches and cracks and pops and groans,

38
0:02:21.922,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as it collides and rubs when temperature or currents or winds change.

39
0:02:27.932,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And under 100 percent sea ice in the dead of winter,

40
0:02:32.604,000 --> 0:02:34,000
bowhead whales are singing.

41
0:02:36.067,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And you would never expect that,

42
0:02:37.958,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because we humans,

43
0:02:40.173,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we tend to be very visual animals.

44
0:02:43.254,000 --> 0:02:46,000
For most of us, but not all,

45
0:02:46.323,000 --> 0:02:48,000
our sense of sight is how we navigate our world.

46
0:02:49.545,000 --> 0:02:51,000
For marine mammals that live underwater,

47
0:02:52.261,000 --> 0:02:55,000
where chemical cues and light transmit poorly,

48
0:02:56.148,000 --> 0:03:,000
sound is the sense by which they see.

49
0:03:00.247,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And sound transmits very well underwater,

50
0:03:02.585,000 --> 0:03:03,000
much better than it does in air,

51
0:03:04.541,000 --> 0:03:06,000
so signals can be heard over great distances.

52
0:03:08.09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In the Arctic, this is especially important,

53
0:03:11.205,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because not only do Arctic marine mammals have to hear each other,

54
0:03:15.142,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but they also have to listen for cues in the environment

55
0:03:18.277,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that might indicate heavy ice ahead or open water.

56
0:03:22.682,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Remember, although they spend most of their lives underwater,

57
0:03:26.105,000 --> 0:03:27,000
they are mammals,

58
0:03:27.353,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and so they have to surface to breathe.

59
0:03:30.278,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So they might listen for thin ice or no ice,

60
0:03:34.158,000 --> 0:03:37,000
or listen for echoes off nearby ice.

61
0:03:38.914,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Arctic marine mammals live in a rich and varied underwater soundscape.

62
0:03:44.546,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In the spring,

63
0:03:45.812,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it can be a cacophony of sound.

64
0:03:49.149,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Marine mammal sounds)

65
0:04:04.989,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But when the ice is frozen solid,

66
0:04:07.903,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and there are no big temperature shifts or current changes,

67
0:04:11.635,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the underwater Arctic has some of the lowest ambient noise levels

68
0:04:15.958,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of the world's oceans.

69
0:04:17.702,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But this is changing.

70
0:04:19.048,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This is primarily due to a decrease in seasonal sea ice,

71
0:04:23.616,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which is a direct result of human greenhouse gas emissions.

72
0:04:28.174,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We are, in effect, with climate change,

73
0:04:31.104,000 --> 0:04:34,000
conducting a completely uncontrolled experiment with our planet.

74
0:04:35.585,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Over the past 30 years,

75
0:04:37.698,000 --> 0:04:4,000
areas of the Arctic have seen decreases in seasonal sea ice

76
0:04:41.575,000 --> 0:04:45,000
from anywhere from six weeks to four months.

77
0:04:46.64,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This decrease in sea ice is sometimes referred to as an increase

78
0:04:51.274,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in the open water season.

79
0:04:53.161,000 --> 0:04:56,000
That is the time of year when the Arctic is navigable to vessels.

80
0:04:57.38,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And not only is the extent of ice changing,

81
0:05:01.165,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but the age and the width of ice is, too.

82
0:05:05.176,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now, you may well have heard

83
0:05:06.658,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that a decrease in seasonal sea ice is causing a loss of habitat

84
0:05:10.165,000 --> 0:05:12,000
for animals that rely on sea ice,

85
0:05:12.32,000 --> 0:05:15,000
such as ice seals, or walrus, or polar bears.

86
0:05:16.678,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Decreasing sea ice is also causing increased erosion along coastal villages,

87
0:05:21.541,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and changing prey availability for marine birds and mammals.

88
0:05:26.139,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Climate change and decreases in sea ice

89
0:05:29.241,000 --> 0:05:33,000
are also altering the underwater soundscape of the Arctic.

90
0:05:35.19,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What do I mean by soundscape?

91
0:05:37.653,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Those of us who eavesdrop on the oceans for a living

92
0:05:40.534,000 --> 0:05:42,000
use instruments called hydrophones,

93
0:05:42.812,000 --> 0:05:44,000
which are underwater microphones,

94
0:05:44.881,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and we record ambient noise --

95
0:05:46.851,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the noise all around us.

96
0:05:48.799,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And the soundscape describes the different contributors

97
0:05:52.164,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to this noise field.

98
0:05:54.563,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What we are hearing on our hydrophones

99
0:05:57.188,000 --> 0:06:,000
are the very real sounds of climate change.

100
0:06:01.323,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We are hearing these changes from three fronts:

101
0:06:04.651,000 --> 0:06:05,000
from the air,

102
0:06:06.447,000 --> 0:06:07,000
from the water

103
0:06:07.924,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and from land.

104
0:06:10.139,000 --> 0:06:12,000
First: air.

105
0:06:13.724,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Wind on water creates waves.

106
0:06:16.361,000 --> 0:06:17,000
These waves make bubbles;

107
0:06:18.21,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the bubbles break,

108
0:06:19.601,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and when they do,

109
0:06:21.131,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they make noise.

110
0:06:22.358,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And this noise is like a hiss or a static in the background.

111
0:06:27.118,000 --> 0:06:29,000
In the Arctic, when it's ice-covered,

112
0:06:30.093,000 --> 0:06:33,000
most of the noise from wind doesn't make it into the water column,

113
0:06:33.748,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because the ice acts as a buffer between the atmosphere and the water.

114
0:06:38.82,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is one of the reasons

115
0:06:40.189,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that the Arctic can have very low ambient noise levels.

116
0:06:44.654,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But with decreases in seasonal sea ice,

117
0:06:47.308,000 --> 0:06:51,000
not only is the Arctic now open to this wave noise,

118
0:06:52.279,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but the number of storms and the intensity of storms in the Arctic

119
0:06:55.79,000 --> 0:06:56,000
has been increasing.

120
0:06:57.545,000 --> 0:07:01,000
All of this is raising noise levels in a previously quiet ocean.

121
0:07:02.568,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Second: water.

122
0:07:06.301,000 --> 0:07:07,000
With less seasonal sea ice,

123
0:07:08.199,000 --> 0:07:1,000
subarctic species are moving north,

124
0:07:10.899,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and taking advantage of the new habitat that is created by more open water.

125
0:07:16.324,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, Arctic whales, like this bowhead,

126
0:07:19.373,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they have no dorsal fin,

127
0:07:21.109,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because they have evolved to live and swim in ice-covered waters,

128
0:07:25.901,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and having something sticking off of your back is not very conducive

129
0:07:29.448,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to migrating through ice,

130
0:07:31.282,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and may, in fact, be excluding animals from the ice.

131
0:07:35.655,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But now, everywhere we've listened,

132
0:07:38.326,000 --> 0:07:41,000
we're hearing the sounds of fin whales and humpback whales

133
0:07:41.408,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and killer whales,

134
0:07:42.901,000 --> 0:07:44,000
further and further north,

135
0:07:45.156,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and later and later in the season.

136
0:07:47.823,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We are hearing, in essence,

137
0:07:49.259,000 --> 0:07:52,000
an invasion of the Arctic by subarctic species.

138
0:07:53.694,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And we don't know what this means.

139
0:07:55.681,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Will there be competition for food between Arctic and subarctic animals?

140
0:08:00.785,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Might these subarctic species introduce diseases or parasites into the Arctic?

141
0:08:06.855,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And what are the new sounds that they are producing

142
0:08:09.656,000 --> 0:08:11,000
doing to the soundscape underwater?

143
0:08:12.8,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And third: land.

144
0:08:15.008,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And by land ...

145
0:08:16.688,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I mean people.

146
0:08:18.534,000 --> 0:08:21,000
More open water means increased human use of the Arctic.

147
0:08:23.074,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Just this past summer,

148
0:08:24.416,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a massive cruise ship made its way through the Northwest Passage --

149
0:08:28.621,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the once-mythical route between Europe and the Pacific.

150
0:08:33.206,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Decreases in sea ice have allowed humans to occupy the Arctic more often.

151
0:08:39.987,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It has allowed increases in oil and gas exploration and extraction,

152
0:08:44.652,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the potential for commercial shipping,

153
0:08:47.306,000 --> 0:08:48,000
as well as increased tourism.

154
0:08:50.214,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And we now know that ship noise increases levels of stress hormones in whales

155
0:08:55.103,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and can disrupt feeding behavior.

156
0:08:57.871,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Air guns, which produce loud, low-frequency "whoomps"

157
0:09:03.144,000 --> 0:09:05,000
every 10 to 20 seconds,

158
0:09:05.742,000 --> 0:09:08,000
changed the swimming and vocal behavior of whales.

159
0:09:09.543,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And all of these sound sources are decreasing the acoustic space

160
0:09:14.505,000 --> 0:09:17,000
over which Arctic marine mammals can communicate.

161
0:09:18.734,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now, Arctic marine mammals are used to very high levels of noise

162
0:09:23.142,000 --> 0:09:24,000
at certain times of the year.

163
0:09:25.147,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But this is primarily from other animals or from sea ice,

164
0:09:29.247,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and these are the sounds with which they've evolved,

165
0:09:31.767,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and these are sounds that are vital to their very survival.

166
0:09:35.281,000 --> 0:09:38,000
These new sounds are loud and they're alien.

167
0:09:38.981,000 --> 0:09:43,000
They might impact the environment in ways that we think we understand,

168
0:09:44.156,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but also in ways that we don't.

169
0:09:48.818,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Remember, sound is the most important sense for these animals.

170
0:09:53.643,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And not only is the physical habitat of the Arctic changing rapidly,

171
0:09:58.242,000 --> 0:10:,000
but the acoustic habitat is, too.

172
0:10:00.906,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's as if we've plucked these animals up from the quiet countryside

173
0:10:04.647,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and dropped them into a big city in the middle of rush hour.

174
0:10:08.657,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And they can't escape it.

175
0:10:11.505,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So what can we do now?

176
0:10:14.839,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We can't decrease wind speeds

177
0:10:17.251,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or keep subarctic animals from migrating north,

178
0:10:20.455,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but we can work on local solutions

179
0:10:22.912,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to reducing human-caused underwater noise.

180
0:10:26.637,000 --> 0:10:29,000
One of these solutions is to slow down ships

181
0:10:29.818,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that traverse the Arctic,

182
0:10:31.632,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because a slower ship is a quieter ship.

183
0:10:35.754,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We can restrict access in seasons and regions

184
0:10:39.57,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that are important for mating or feeding or migrating.

185
0:10:44.317,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We can get smarter about quieting ships

186
0:10:47.645,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and find better ways to explore the ocean bottom.

187
0:10:51.547,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And the good news is,

188
0:10:53.514,000 --> 0:10:55,000
there are people working on this right now.

189
0:10:58.06,000 --> 0:10:59,000
But ultimately,

190
0:10:59.585,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we humans have to do the hard work

191
0:11:02.476,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of reversing or at the very least decelerating

192
0:11:06.656,000 --> 0:11:08,000
human-caused atmospheric changes.

193
0:11:09.152,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So, let's return to this idea of a silent world underwater.

194
0:11:14.826,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It's entirely possible

195
0:11:16.345,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that many of the whales swimming in the Arctic today,

196
0:11:19.706,000 --> 0:11:22,000
especially long-lived species like the bowhead whale

197
0:11:23.265,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that the Inuits say can live two human lives --

198
0:11:27.046,000 --> 0:11:3,000
it's possible that these whales were alive in 1956,

199
0:11:30.831,000 --> 0:11:31,000
when Jacques Cousteau made his film.

200
0:11:33.697,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And in retrospect,

201
0:11:35.433,000 --> 0:11:38,000
considering all the noise we are creating in the oceans today,

202
0:11:40.464,000 --> 0:11:43,000
perhaps it really was "The Silent World."

203
0:11:44.693,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Thank you.

204
0:11:45.981,000 --> 0:11:47,000

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The oceans cover some 70 percent of our planet.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And I think Arthur C. Clarke probably had it right

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
when he said that perhaps we ought to call our planet

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Planet Ocean.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And the oceans are hugely productive,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as you can see by the satellite image

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of photosynthesis, the production of new life.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In fact, the oceans produce half of the new life every day on Earth

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
as well as about half the oxygen that we breathe.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
In addition to that, it harbors a lot of the biodiversity on Earth,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and much of it we don't know about.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But I'll tell you some of that today.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That also doesn't even get into the whole protein extraction

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that we do from the ocean.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That's about 10 percent of our global needs

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and 100 percent of some island nations.

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
If you were to descend

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
into the 95 percent of the biosphere that's livable,

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it would quickly become pitch black,

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
interrupted only by pinpoints of light

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
from bioluminescent organisms.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And if you turn the lights on,

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you might periodically see spectacular organisms swim by,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because those are the denizens of the deep,

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the things that live in the deep ocean.

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And eventually, the deep sea floor would come into view.

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This type of habitat covers more of the Earth's surface

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
than all other habitats combined.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And yet, we know more about the surface of the Moon and about Mars

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
than we do about this habitat,

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
despite the fact that we have yet to extract

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a gram of food, a breath of oxygen or a drop of water

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from those bodies.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And so 10 years ago,

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
an international program began called the Census of Marine Life,

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which set out to try and improve our understanding

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of life in the global oceans.

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It involved 17 different projects around the world.

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
As you can see, these are the footprints of the different projects.

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I hope you'll appreciate the level of global coverage

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that it managed to achieve.

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It all began when two scientists, Fred Grassle and Jesse Ausubel,

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
met in Woods Hole, Massachusetts

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute.

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And Fred was lamenting the state of marine biodiversity

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and the fact that it was in trouble and nothing was being done about it.

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Well, from that discussion grew this program

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that involved 2,700 scientists

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
from more than 80 countries around the world

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
who engaged in 540 ocean expeditions

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
at a combined cost of 650 million dollars

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to study the distribution, diversity and abundance

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of life in the global ocean.

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And so what did we find?

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We found spectacular new species,

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
the most beautiful and visually stunning things everywhere we looked --

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
from the shoreline to the abyss,

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
form microbes all the way up to fish and everything in between.

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life,

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
but rather the taxonomic specialists

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
who can identify and catalog these species

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that became the limiting step.

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
There are actually four to five new species

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
described everyday for the oceans.

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And as I say, it could be a much larger number.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now, I come from Newfoundland in Canada --

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's an island off the east coast of that continent --

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where we experienced one of the worst fishing disasters

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
in human history.

71
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And so this photograph shows a small boy next to a codfish.

72
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It's around 1900.

73
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, when I was a boy of about his age,

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I would go out fishing with my grandfather

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and we would catch fish about half that size.

76
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I thought that was the norm,

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because I had never seen fish like this.

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If you were to go out there today, 20 years after this fishery collapsed,

79
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
if you could catch a fish, which would be a bit of a challenge,

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it would be half that size still.

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So what we're experiencing is something called shifting baselines.

82
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Our expectations of what the oceans can produce

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is something that we don't really appreciate

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because we haven't seen it in our lifetimes.

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Now most of us, and I would say me included,

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
think that human exploitation of the oceans

87
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
really only became very serious

88
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in the last 50 to, perhaps, 100 years or so.

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The census actually tried to look back in time,

90
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
using every source of information they could get their hands on.

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And so anything from restaurant menus

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to monastery records to ships' logs

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to see what the oceans looked like.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Because science data really goes back

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to, at best, World War II, for the most part.

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And so what they found, in fact,

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
is that exploitation really began heavily with the Romans.

98
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And so at that time, of course, there was no refrigeration.

99
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So fishermen could only catch

100
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
what they could either eat or sell that day.

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But the Romans developed salting.

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And with salting,

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances.

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And so began industrial fishing.

105
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And so these are the sorts of extrapolations that we have

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of what sort of loss we've had

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
relative to pre-human impacts on the ocean.

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They range from 65 to 98 percent

109
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for these major groups of organisms,

110
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
as shown in the dark blue bars.

111
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Now for those species the we managed to leave alone, that we protect --

112
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for example, marine mammals in recent years and sea birds --

113
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
there is some recovery.

114
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So it's not all hopeless.

115
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But for the most part, we've gone from salting to exhausting.

116
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now this other line of evidence is a really interesting one.

117
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's from trophy fish caught off the coast of Florida.

118
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And so this is a photograph from the 1950s.

119
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I want you to notice the scale on the slide,

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because when you see the same picture from the 1980s,

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we see the fish are much smaller

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and we're also seeing a change

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in terms of the composition of those fish.

124
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
By 2007, the catch was actually laughable

125
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in terms of the size for a trophy fish.

126
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But this is no laughing matter.

127
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The oceans have lost a lot of their productivity

128
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we're responsible for it.

129
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So what's left? Actually quite a lot.

130
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There's a lot of exciting things, and I'm going to tell you a little bit about them.

131
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And I want to start with a bit on technology,

132
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because, of course, this is a TED Conference

133
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and you want to hear something on technology.

134
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So one of the tools that we use to sample the deep ocean

135
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
are remotely operated vehicles.

136
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So these are tethered vehicles we lower down to the sea floor

137
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
where they're our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom.

138
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So a couple of years ago, I was supposed to go on an oceanographic cruise

139
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I couldn't go because of a scheduling conflict.

140
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But through a satellite link I was able to sit at my study at home

141
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
with my dog curled up at my feet, a cup of tea in my hand,

142
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and I could tell the pilot, "I want a sample right there."

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And that's exactly what the pilot did for me.

144
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
That's the sort of technology that's available today

145
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that really wasn't available even a decade ago.

146
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So it allows us to sample these amazing habitats

147
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that are very far from the surface

148
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and very far from light.

149
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
is acoustics, or sound waves.

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And the advantage of sound waves

152
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is that they actually pass well through water, unlike light.

153
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And so we can send out sound waves,

154
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they bounce off objects like fish and are reflected back.

155
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And so in this example, a census scientist took out two ships.

156
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
One would send out sound waves that would bounce back.

157
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
They would be received by a second ship,

158
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and that would give us very precise estimates, in this case,

159
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
of 250 billion herring

160
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in a period of about a minute.

161
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And that's an area about the size of Manhattan Island.

162
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And to be able to do that is a tremendous fisheries tool,

163
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because knowing how many fish are there is really critical.

164
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We can also use satellite tags

165
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to track animals as they move through the oceans.

166
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And so for animals that come to the surface to breathe,

167
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
such as this elephant seal,

168
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
it's an opportunity to send data back to shore

169
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and tell us where exactly it is in the ocean.

170
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And so from that we can produce these tracks.

171
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
For example, the dark blue

172
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
shows you where the elephant seal moved in the north Pacific.

173
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Now I realize for those of you who are colorblind, this slide is not very helpful,

174
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
but stick with me nonetheless.

175
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
For animals that don't surface,

176
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we have something called pop-up tags,

177
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
which collect data about light and what time the sun rises and sets.

178
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And then at some period of time

179
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
it pops up to the surface and, again, relays that data back to shore.

180
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Because GPS doesn't work under water. That's why we need these tools.

181
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And so from this we're able to identify these blue highways,

182
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
these hot spots in the ocean,

183
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that should be real priority areas

184
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
for ocean conservation.

185
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now one of the other things that you may think about

186
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is that, when you go to the supermarket and you buy things, they're scanned.

187
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And so there's a barcode on that product

188
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that tells the computer exactly what the product is.

189
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding.

190
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And what barcoding does

191
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is use a specific gene called CO1

192
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that's consistent within a species, but varies among species.

193
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so what that means is we can unambiguously identify

194
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which species are which

195
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
even if they look similar to each other,

196
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but may be biologically quite different.

197
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now one of the nicest examples I like to cite on this

198
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is the story of two young women, high school students in New York City,

199
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
who worked with the census.

200
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
They went out and collected fish from markets and from restaurants in New York City

201
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and they barcoded it.

202
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Well what they found was mislabeled fish.

203
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So for example,

204
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
they found something which was sold as tuna, which is very valuable,

205
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
was in fact tilapia, which is a much less valuable fish.

206
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They also found an endangered species

207
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
sold as a common one.

208
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So barcoding allows us to know what we're working with

209
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and also what we're eating.

210
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The Ocean Biogeographic Information System

211
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
is the database for all the census data.

212
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It's open access; you can all go in and download data as you wish.

213
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And it contains all the data from the census

214
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
plus other data sets that people were willing to contribute.

215
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so what you can do with that

216
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is to plot the distribution of species and where they occur in the oceans.

217
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
What I've plotted up here is the data that we have on hand.

218
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This is where our sampling effort has concentrated.

219
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now what you can see

220
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is we've sampled the area in the North Atlantic,

221
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in the North Sea in particular,

222
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and also the east coast of North America fairly well.

223
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That's the warm colors which show a well-sampled region.

224
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The cold colors, the blue and the black,

225
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
show areas where we have almost no data.

226
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So even after a 10-year census,

227
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
there are large areas that still remain unexplored.

228
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now there are a group of scientists living in Texas, working in the Gulf of Mexico

229
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
who decided really as a labor of love

230
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to pull together all the knowledge they could

231
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
about biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico.

232
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And so they put this together, a list of all the species,

233
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
where they're known to occur,

234
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and it really seemed like a very esoteric, scientific type of exercise.

235
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
But then, of course, there was the Deep Horizon oil spill.

236
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So all of a sudden, this labor of love

237
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for no obvious economic reason

238
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
has become a critical piece of information

239
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in terms of how that system is going to recover, how long it will take

240
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and how the lawsuits

241
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and the multi-billion-dollar discussions that are going to happen in the coming years

242
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
are likely to be resolved.

243
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So what did we find?

244
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Well, I could stand here for hours, but, of course, I'm not allowed to do that.

245
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But I will tell you some of my favorite discoveries

246
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
from the census.

247
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So one of the things we discovered is where are the hot spots of diversity?

248
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Where do we find the most species of ocean life?

249
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And what we find if we plot up the well-known species

250
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
is this sort of a distribution.

251
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And what we see is that for coastal tags,

252
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
for those organisms that live near the shoreline,

253
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
they're most diverse in the tropics.

254
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
This is something we've actually known for a while,

255
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
so it's not a real breakthrough.

256
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
What is really exciting though

257
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is that the oceanic tags, or the ones that live far from the coast,

258
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
are actually more diverse at intermediate latitudes.

259
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
This is the sort of data, again, that managers could use

260
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if they want to prioritize areas of the ocean that we need to conserve.

261
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You can do this on a global scale, but you can also do it on a regional scale.

262
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And that's why biodiversity data can be so valuable.

263
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now while a lot of the species we discovered in the census

264
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
are things that are small and hard to see,

265
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that certainly wasn't always the case.

266
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
For example, while it's hard to believe

267
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that a three kilogram lobster could elude scientists,

268
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it did until a few years ago

269
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
when South African fishermen requested an export permit

270
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and scientists realized that this was something new to science.

271
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Similarly this Golden V kelp

272
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
collected in Alaska just below the low water mark

273
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is probably a new species.

274
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Even though it's three meters long,

275
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it actually, again, eluded science.

276
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now this guy, this bigfin squid, is seven meters in length.

277
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But to be fair, it lives in the deep waters of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

278
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
so it was a lot harder to find.

279
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But there's still potential for discovery of big and exciting things.

280
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
This particular shrimp, we've dubbed it the Jurassic shrimp,

281
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
it's thought to have gone extinct 50 years ago --

282
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
at least it was, until the census discovered

283
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it was living and doing just fine off the coast of Australia.

284
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And it shows that the ocean, because of its vastness,

285
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
can hide secrets for a very long time.

286
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So, Steven Spielberg, eat your heart out.

287
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
If we look at distributions, in fact distributions change dramatically.

288
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And so one of the records that we had

289
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
was this sooty shearwater, which undergoes these spectacular migrations

290
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
all the way from New Zealand

291
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
all the way up to Alaska and back again

292
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in search of endless summer

293
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
as they complete their life cycles.

294
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We also talked about the White Shark Cafe.

295
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
This is a location in the Pacific where white shark converge.

296
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We don't know why they converge there, we simply don't know.

297
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
That's a question for the future.

298
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
One of the things that we're taught in high school

299
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive.

300
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now this little critter, it's only about half a millimeter in size,

301
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
not terribly charismatic.

302
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But it was only discovered in the early 1980s.

303
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But the really interesting thing about it

304
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
is that, a few years ago, census scientists discovered

305
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that this guy can thrive in oxygen-poor sediments

306
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in the deep Mediterranean Sea.

307
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So now they know that, in fact,

308
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
animals can live without oxygen, at least some of them,

309
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and that they can adapt to even the harshest of conditions.

310
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
If you were to suck all the water out of the ocean,

311
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
this is what you'd be left behind with,

312
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and that's the biomass of life on the sea floor.

313
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Now what we see is huge biomass towards the poles

314
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and not much biomass in between.

315
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
We found life in the extremes.

316
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And so there were new species that were found

317
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that live inside ice

318
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and help to support an ice-based food web.

319
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And we also found this spectacular yeti crab

320
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
that lives near boiling hot hydrothermal vents at Easter Island.

321
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And this particular species

322
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
really captured the public's attention.

323
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
We also found the deepest vents known yet -- 5,000 meters --

324
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the hottest vents at 407 degrees Celsius --

325
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
vents in the South Pacific and also in the Arctic

326
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
where none had been found before.

327
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
So even new environments are still within the domain of the discoverable.

328
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now in terms of the unknowns, there are many.

329
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And I'm just going to summarize just a few of them

330
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
very quickly for you.

331
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
First of all, we might ask, how many fishes in the sea?

332
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We actually know the fishes better than we do any other group in the ocean

333
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
other than marine mammals.

334
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And so we can actually extrapolate based on rates of discovery

335
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
how many more species we're likely to discover.

336
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And from that, we actually calculate

337
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that we know about 16,500 marine species

338
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and there are probably another 1,000 to 4,000 left to go.

339
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So we've done pretty well.

340
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We've got about 75 percent of the fish,

341
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
maybe as much as 90 percent.

342
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But the fishes, as I say, are the best known.

343
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So our level of knowledge is much less for other groups of organisms.

344
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper

345
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that's going to come out in the journal PLoS Biology.

346
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And what is does is predict how many more species there are

347
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
on land and in the ocean.

348
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And what they found

349
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is that they think that we know of about nine percent of the species in the ocean.

350
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
That means 91 percent, even after the census,

351
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
still remain to be discovered.

352
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And so that turns out to be about two million species

353
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
once all is said and done.

354
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So we still have quite a lot of work to do

355
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in terms of unknowns.

356
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Now this bacterium

357
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
is part of mats that are found off the coast of Chile.

358
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And these mats actually cover an area the size of Greece.

359
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And so this particular bacterium is actually visible to the naked eye.

360
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
But you can imagine the biomass that represents.

361
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But the really intriguing thing about the microbes

362
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is just how diverse they are.

363
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
A single drop of seawater

364
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
could contain 160 different types of microbes.

365
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And the oceans themselves

366
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
are thought potentially to contain as many as a billion different types.

367
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So that's really exciting. What are they all doing out there?

368
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We actually don't know.

369
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
The most exciting thing, I would say, about this census

370
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is the role of global science.

371
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And so as we see in this image of light during the night,

372
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
there are lots of areas of the Earth

373
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
where human development is much greater

374
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and other areas where it's much less,

375
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
but between them we see large dark areas

376
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
of relatively unexplored ocean.

377
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The other point I'd like to make about this

378
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
is that this ocean's interconnected.

379
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Marine organisms do not care about international boundaries;

380
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
they move where they will.

381
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And so the importance then of global collaboration

382
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
becomes all the more important.

383
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
We've lost a lot of paradise.

384
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
For example, these tuna that were once so abundant in the North Sea

385
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
are now effectively gone.

386
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
There were trawls taken in the deep sea in the Mediterranean,

387
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
which collected more garbage than they did animals.

388
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And that's the deep sea, that's the environment that we consider to be

389
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
among the most pristine left on Earth.

390
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And there are a lot of other pressures.

391
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Ocean acidification is a really big issue that people are concerned with,

392
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
as well as ocean warming, and the effects they're going to have on coral reefs.

393
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
On the scale of decades, in our lifetimes,

394
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
we're going to see a lot of damage to coral reefs.

395
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And I could spend the rest of my time, which is getting very limited,

396
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
going through this litany of concerns about the ocean,

397
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but I want to end on a more positive note.

398
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And so the grand challenge then

399
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
is to try and make sure that we preserve what's left,

400
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
because there is still spectacular beauty.

401
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And the oceans are so productive,

402
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
there's so much going on in there that's of relevance to humans

403
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
that we really need to, even from a selfish perspective,

404
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
try to do better than we have in the past.

405
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So we need to recognize those hot spots

406
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and do our best to protect them.

407
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
When we look at pictures like this, they take our breath away,

408
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
in addition to helping to give us breath

409
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
by the oxygen that the oceans provide.

410
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Census scientists worked in the rain, they worked in the cold,

411
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
they worked under water and they worked above water

412
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
trying to illuminate the wondrous discovery,

413
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
the still vast unknown,

414
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
the spectacular adaptations that we see in ocean life.

415
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
So whether you're a yak herder living in the mountains of Chile,

416
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
whether you're a stockbroker in New York City

417
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
or whether you're a TEDster living in Edinburgh,

418
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
the oceans matter.

419
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And as the oceans go so shall we.

420
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Thanks for listening.

421
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Applause)

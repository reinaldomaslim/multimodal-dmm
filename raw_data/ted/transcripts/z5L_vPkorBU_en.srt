2
0:00:12.946,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm here to show you

3
0:00:14.67,000 --> 0:00:17,000
how something you can't see can be so much fun to look at.

4
0:00:18.371,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You're about to experience a new, available

5
0:00:22.174,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and exciting technology that's going to make us rethink

6
0:00:25.154,000 --> 0:00:27,000
how we waterproof our lives.

7
0:00:27.282,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What I have here is a cinder block

8
0:00:30.002,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that we've coated half with a nanotechnology spray

9
0:00:32.498,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that can be applied to almost any material.

10
0:00:35.09,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's called Ultra-Ever Dry,

11
0:00:37.427,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and when you apply it to any material,

12
0:00:39.853,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it turns into a superhydrophobic shield.

13
0:00:42.958,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So this is a cinder block, uncoated,

14
0:00:45.484,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and you can see that it's porous, it absorbs water.

15
0:00:49.785,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Not anymore.

16
0:00:52.439,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Porous, nonporous.

17
0:00:56.666,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So what's superhydrophobic?

18
0:00:59.418,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Superhydrophobic is how we measure

19
0:01:01.911,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a drop of water on a surface.

20
0:01:04.393,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The rounder it is, the more hydrophobic it is,

21
0:01:06.793,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and if it's really round, it's superhydrophobic.

22
0:01:09.721,000 --> 0:01:11,000
A freshly waxed car, the water molecules slump

23
0:01:12.667,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to about 90 degrees.

24
0:01:15.607,000 --> 0:01:18,000
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees.

25
0:01:18.695,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But what you're seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees,

26
0:01:21.476,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic.

27
0:01:25.488,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So as part of the demonstration,

28
0:01:27.037,000 --> 0:01:29,000
what I have is a pair of gloves,

29
0:01:29.551,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we've coated one of the gloves

30
0:01:31.719,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with the nanotechnology coating,

31
0:01:34.423,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and let's see if you can tell which one,

32
0:01:36.223,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and I'll give you a hint.

33
0:01:43.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Did you guess the one that was dry?

34
0:01:47.904,000 --> 0:01:51,000
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience,

35
0:01:52.606,000 --> 0:01:54,000
what's occurred is that we're able to now

36
0:01:55.278,000 --> 0:01:57,000
look at atoms and molecules and actually control them

37
0:01:57.791,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for great benefits.

38
0:02:00.223,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And we're talking really small here.

39
0:02:02.222,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers,

40
0:02:04.494,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter,

41
0:02:08.321,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and to put some scale to that,

42
0:02:09.968,000 --> 0:02:12,000
if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick,

43
0:02:13.274,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and you put it side by side, and you had 50,000 of them,

44
0:02:16.089,000 --> 0:02:18,000
you'd be the width of a human hair.

45
0:02:18.937,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So very small, but very useful.

46
0:02:21.945,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And it's not just water that this works with.

47
0:02:24.849,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's a lot of water-based materials like concrete,

48
0:02:27.6,000 --> 0:02:29,000
water-based paint,

49
0:02:29.769,000 --> 0:02:3,000
mud,

50
0:02:31.417,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and also some refined oils as well.

51
0:02:39.216,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You can see the difference.

52
0:02:43.605,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Moving onto the next demonstration,

53
0:02:45.095,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we've taken a pane of glass and we've coated the outside of it,

54
0:02:47.389,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we've framed it with the nanotechnology coating,

55
0:02:50.639,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and we're going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle,

56
0:02:54.414,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and you're going to see, it's going to spread out on glass

57
0:02:56.375,000 --> 0:02:57,000
like you'd normally think it would,

58
0:02:57.925,000 --> 0:03:,000
except when it hits the coating, it stops,

59
0:03:01.519,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I can't even coax it to leave.

60
0:03:05.304,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's that afraid of the water.

61
0:03:06.907,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Applause)

62
0:03:10.627,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So what's going on here? What's happening?

63
0:03:12.379,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Well, the surface of the spray coating

64
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is actually filled with nanoparticles

65
0:03:17.428,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that form a very rough and craggly surface.

66
0:03:19.502,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You'd think it'd be smooth, but it's actually not.

67
0:03:22.091,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And it has billions of interstitial spaces,

68
0:03:24.862,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and those spaces, along with the nanoparticles,

69
0:03:27.971,000 --> 0:03:29,000
reach up and grab the air molecules,

70
0:03:30.323,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and cover the surface with air.

71
0:03:32.386,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's an umbrella of air all across it,

72
0:03:35.131,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and that layer of air is what the water hits,

73
0:03:37.771,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the mud hits, the concrete hits, and it glides right off.

74
0:03:40.819,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So if I put this inside this water here,

75
0:03:42.835,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you can see a silver reflective coating around it,

76
0:03:46.955,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and that silver reflective coating

77
0:03:48.411,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is the layer of air that's protecting the water

78
0:03:50.682,000 --> 0:03:53,000
from touching the paddle, and it's dry.

79
0:03:57.34,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So what are the applications?

80
0:03:59.837,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I mean, many of you right now are probably going through your head.

81
0:04:02.285,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Everyone that sees this gets excited, and says,

82
0:04:03.783,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"Oh, I could use it for this and this and this."

83
0:04:05.712,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The applications in a general sense

84
0:04:07.774,000 --> 0:04:09,000
could be anything that's anti-wetting.

85
0:04:10.604,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We've certainly seen that today.

86
0:04:12.869,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It could be anything that's anti-icing,

87
0:04:15.453,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because if you don't have water, you don't have ice.

88
0:04:18.908,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It could be anti-corrosion.

89
0:04:21.18,000 --> 0:04:23,000
No water, no corrosion.

90
0:04:23.206,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It could be anti-bacterial.

91
0:04:25.404,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Without water, the bacteria won't survive.

92
0:04:28.113,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well.

93
0:04:33.629,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So imagine how something like this

94
0:04:37.501,000 --> 0:04:41,000
could help revolutionize your field of work.

95
0:04:41.622,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I'm going to leave you with one last demonstration,

96
0:04:44.021,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but before I do that, I would like to say thank you,

97
0:04:46.622,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and think small.

98
0:04:57.098,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Applause)

99
0:05:04.646,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's going to happen. Wait for it. Wait for it.

100
0:05:09.035,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Chris Anderson: You guys didn't hear about us cutting out the Design from TED? (Laughter)

101
0:05:13.817,000 --> 0:05:14,000
[Two minutes later...]

102
0:05:15.567,000 --> 0:05:17,000
He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part.

103
0:05:18.251,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's happening!

104
0:05:20.814,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Applause)

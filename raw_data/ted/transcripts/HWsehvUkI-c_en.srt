2
0:00:15.927,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, well, I do applied math,

3
0:00:18.03,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and this is a peculiar problem

4
0:00:19.554,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for anyone who does applied math, is that

5
0:00:21.727,000 --> 0:00:22,000
we are like management consultants.

6
0:00:23.66,000 --> 0:00:24,000
No one knows what the hell we do.

7
0:00:25.606,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today

8
0:00:27.88,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to try and explain to you what I do.

9
0:00:30.173,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.

10
0:00:33.494,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers

11
0:00:37.176,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you will see later on.

12
0:00:38.324,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise

13
0:00:41.014,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and a high level of skill,

14
0:00:43.928,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and probably a level of initial suitability

15
0:00:46.459,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that may well have a genetic component to it.

16
0:00:48.306,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease

17
0:00:51.699,000 --> 0:00:53,000
gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,

18
0:00:53.786,000 --> 0:00:55,000
as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was

19
0:00:56.109,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.

20
0:00:59.076,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.

21
0:01:02.13,000 --> 0:01:04,000
However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide

22
0:01:05.074,000 --> 0:01:08,000
who have the disease, and they have to live with

23
0:01:08.522,000 --> 0:01:1,000
incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity

24
0:01:11.09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,

25
0:01:12.947,000 --> 0:01:14,000
so what we need are objective tools

26
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to detect the disease before it's too late.

27
0:01:18.387,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We need to be able to measure progression objectively,

28
0:01:20.941,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and ultimately, the only way we're going to know

29
0:01:24.114,000 --> 0:01:26,000
when we actually have a cure is when we have

30
0:01:26.306,000 --> 0:01:29,000
an objective measure that can answer that for sure.

31
0:01:29.704,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease

32
0:01:32.554,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,

33
0:01:34.907,000 --> 0:01:36,000
so there's no simple blood test that you can do,

34
0:01:37.136,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the best that we have is like

35
0:01:38.938,000 --> 0:01:4,000
this 20-minute neurologist test.

36
0:01:41.179,000 --> 0:01:43,000
You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,

37
0:01:43.637,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and that means that, outside the clinical trials,

38
0:01:46.394,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it's just never done. It's never done.

39
0:01:49.122,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But what if patients could do this test at home?

40
0:01:52.199,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,

41
0:01:54.297,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?

42
0:01:58.551,000 --> 0:01:59,000
No expensive staff time required.

43
0:02:00.471,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Takes about $300, by the way,

44
0:02:01.889,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in the neurologist's clinic to do it.

45
0:02:03.882,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way

46
0:02:06.563,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in which we can try to achieve this,

47
0:02:08.077,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because, you see, in one sense, at least,

48
0:02:09.885,000 --> 0:02:12,000
we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.

49
0:02:13.141,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.

50
0:02:16.896,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,

51
0:02:20.125,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,

52
0:02:23.589,000 --> 0:02:25,000
because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs

53
0:02:25.803,000 --> 0:02:27,000
when we make sounds, and we all actually

54
0:02:28.098,000 --> 0:02:3,000
have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.

55
0:02:30.394,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.

56
0:02:33.107,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.

57
0:02:35.692,000 --> 0:02:37,000
From the sound, we can actually track

58
0:02:38.074,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the vocal fold position as it vibrates,

59
0:02:40.355,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,

60
0:02:42.898,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so too are the vocal organs.

61
0:02:45.679,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of

62
0:02:47.559,000 --> 0:02:48,000
irregular vocal fold tremor.

63
0:02:49.257,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We see all the same symptoms.

64
0:02:50.425,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.

65
0:02:53.355,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy

66
0:02:55.459,000 --> 0:02:57,000
after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.

67
0:02:57.692,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,

68
0:03:00.539,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in some cases, but with any digital microphone,

69
0:03:03.755,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and using precision voice analysis software

70
0:03:06.3,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in combination with the latest in machine learning,

71
0:03:08.709,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which is very advanced by now,

72
0:03:10.287,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies

73
0:03:13.173,000 --> 0:03:15,000
on a continuum between health and disease

74
0:03:16.054,000 --> 0:03:18,000
using voice signals alone.

75
0:03:18.65,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against

76
0:03:20.964,000 --> 0:03:22,000
expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.

77
0:03:23.114,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.

78
0:03:27.096,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.

79
0:03:30.1,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,

80
0:03:32.402,000 --> 0:03:35,000
voice-based tests are non-expert.

81
0:03:35.729,000 --> 0:03:36,000
That means they can be self-administered.

82
0:03:37.721,000 --> 0:03:39,000
They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.

83
0:03:40.301,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.

84
0:03:42.595,000 --> 0:03:44,000
When something becomes ultra-low cost,

85
0:03:45.035,000 --> 0:03:47,000
it becomes massively scalable.

86
0:03:47.331,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.

87
0:03:51.006,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.

88
0:03:53.432,000 --> 0:03:55,000
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.

89
0:03:55.744,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.

90
0:03:58.064,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,

91
0:04:02.169,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and we can make population-scale screening

92
0:04:04.284,000 --> 0:04:05,000
feasible for the first time.

93
0:04:05.88,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We have the opportunity to start to search

94
0:04:08.082,000 --> 0:04:11,000
for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.

95
0:04:11.623,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So, taking the first steps towards this today,

96
0:04:14.381,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.

97
0:04:16.507,000 --> 0:04:18,000
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming

98
0:04:18.739,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to record a very large number of voices worldwide

99
0:04:20.667,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.

100
0:04:23.807,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters

101
0:04:25.507,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of a billion people on the planet.

102
0:04:27.117,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,

103
0:04:30.194,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and leave recordings, a few cents each,

104
0:04:32.333,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit

105
0:04:34.523,000 --> 0:04:37,000
six percent of our target just in eight hours.

106
0:04:38.066,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Thank you. (Applause)

107
0:04:41.817,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Applause)

108
0:04:48.137,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,

109
0:04:51.712,000 --> 0:04:53,000
let's say, 10,000 people,

110
0:04:54.488,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?

111
0:04:57.342,000 --> 0:04:58,000
What are you going to get out of those samples?

112
0:04:59.027,000 --> 0:05:,000
Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,

113
0:05:00.857,000 --> 0:05:01,000
during the call you have to indicate whether or not

114
0:05:02.514,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.

115
0:05:03.781,000 --> 0:05:05,000
ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.

116
0:05:06.288,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected

117
0:05:09.005,000 --> 0:05:12,000
from all different circumstances, and it's getting it

118
0:05:12.413,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in different circumstances that matter because then

119
0:05:14.318,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,

120
0:05:17.702,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and looking for the actual markers of the disease.

121
0:05:19.863,000 --> 0:05:21,000
TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?

122
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:23,000
ML: It's much better than that.

123
0:05:23.554,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,

124
0:05:25.274,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because he's done some fantastic work,

125
0:05:27.144,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,

126
0:05:30.914,000 --> 0:05:33,000
which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.

127
0:05:34.304,000 --> 0:05:35,000
TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.

128
0:05:35.88,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So what that means is that people will be able to —

129
0:05:38.081,000 --> 0:05:39,000
ML: (Laughs)

130
0:05:39.933,000 --> 0:05:4,000
TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones

131
0:05:41.839,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,

132
0:05:44.911,000 --> 0:05:46,000
record their voice, and then their doctor can check up

133
0:05:47.781,000 --> 0:05:49,000
on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.

134
0:05:50.462,000 --> 0:05:5,000
ML: Absolutely.

135
0:05:51.432,000 --> 0:05:52,000
TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.

136
0:05:53.175,000 --> 0:05:58,000
ML: Thanks, Tom. (Applause)

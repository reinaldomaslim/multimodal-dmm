1
0:00:12.934,000 --> 0:00:14,000
To avoid dangerous climate change,

2
0:00:15.056,000 --> 0:00:17,000
we're going to need to cut emissions rapidly.

3
0:00:18.413,000 --> 0:00:21,000
That should be a pretty uncontentious statement,

4
0:00:21.521,000 --> 0:00:22,000
certainly with this audience.

5
0:00:23.401,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But here's something that's slightly more contentious:

6
0:00:26.349,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it's not going to be enough.

7
0:00:29.249,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We will munch our way through our remaining carbon budget

8
0:00:33.354,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for one and a half degrees

9
0:00:34.943,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in a few short years,

10
0:00:37.352,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and the two degree budget

11
0:00:38.998,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in about two decades.

12
0:00:41.401,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We need to not only cut emissions extremely rapidly,

13
0:00:45.358,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we also need to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

14
0:00:50.882,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Thank you.

15
0:00:52.062,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:53.678,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I work assessing a whole range of these proposed techniques

17
0:00:58.447,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to see if they can work.

18
0:01:00.625,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We could use plants to take CO2 out,

19
0:01:04.01,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and then store it in trees,

20
0:01:06.278,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in the soil, deep underground or in the oceans.

21
0:01:09.857,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We could build large machines, so-called artificial trees,

22
0:01:14.205,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that will scrub CO2 from the air.

23
0:01:16.809,000 --> 0:01:18,000
For these ideas to be feasible,

24
0:01:18.954,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we need to understand whether they can be applied

25
0:01:21.821,000 --> 0:01:26,000
at a vast scale in a way that is safe, economic and socially acceptable.

26
0:01:27.878,000 --> 0:01:29,000
All of these ideas come with tradeoffs.

27
0:01:30.576,000 --> 0:01:31,000
None of them are perfect,

28
0:01:32.453,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but many have potential.

29
0:01:35.187,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's unlikely that any one of them will solve it on its own.

30
0:01:38.683,000 --> 0:01:39,000
There is no silver bullet,

31
0:01:40.045,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but potentially together, they may form the silver buckshot

32
0:01:43.755,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that we need to stop climate change in its tracks.

33
0:01:48.569,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I'm working independently on one particular idea

34
0:01:52.11,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which uses natural gas to generate electricity

35
0:01:55.616,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in a way that takes carbon dioxide out of the air.

36
0:01:59.079,000 --> 0:02:,000
Huh? How does that work?

37
0:02:01.345,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So the Origen Power Process feeds natural gas into a fuel cell.

38
0:02:06.441,000 --> 0:02:09,000
About half the chemical energy is converted into electricity,

39
0:02:10.366,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and the remainder into heat,

40
0:02:12.429,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which is used to break down limestone

41
0:02:15.095,000 --> 0:02:17,000
into lime and carbon dioxide.

42
0:02:17.697,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now at this point, you're probably thinking that I'm nuts.

43
0:02:21.833,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's actually generating carbon dioxide.

44
0:02:24.488,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But the key point is, all of the carbon dioxide generated,

45
0:02:28.227,000 --> 0:02:31,000
both from the fuel cell and from the lime kiln, is pure,

46
0:02:31.91,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and that's really important,

47
0:02:33.275,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because it means you can either use that carbon dioxide

48
0:02:35.888,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or you can store it away deep underground at low cost.

49
0:02:40.488,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And then the lime that you produce can be used in industrial processes,

50
0:02:45.733,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and in being used, it scrubs CO2 out of the air.

51
0:02:50.002,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Overall, the process is carbon negative.

52
0:02:52.826,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It removes carbon dioxide from the air.

53
0:02:56.423,000 --> 0:03:,000
If you normally generate electricity from natural gas,

54
0:03:01.073,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you emit about 400 grams of CO2 into the air

55
0:03:04.902,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for every kilowatt-hour.

56
0:03:07.127,000 --> 0:03:12,000
With this process, that figure is minus 600.

57
0:03:13.157,000 --> 0:03:15,000
At the moment, power generation is responsible

58
0:03:15.902,000 --> 0:03:18,000
for about a quarter of all carbon dioxide emissions.

59
0:03:20.643,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Hypothetically, if you replaced all power generation with this process,

60
0:03:25.63,000 --> 0:03:28,000
then you would not only eliminate all of the emissions from power generation

61
0:03:29.594,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but you would start removing emissions from other sectors as well,

62
0:03:33.668,000 --> 0:03:37,000
potentially cutting 60 percent of overall carbon emissions.

63
0:03:38.682,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You could even use the lime

64
0:03:41.252,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to add it directly to seawater to counteract ocean acidification,

65
0:03:46.576,000 --> 0:03:5,000
one of the other issues that is caused by CO2 in the atmosphere.

66
0:03:51.91,000 --> 0:03:53,000
In fact, you get more bang for your buck.

67
0:03:54.503,000 --> 0:03:58,000
You absorb about twice as much carbon dioxide when you add it to seawater

68
0:03:58.802,000 --> 0:03:59,000
as when you use it industrially.

69
0:04:01.118,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But this is where it gets really complicated.

70
0:04:03.743,000 --> 0:04:07,000
While counteracting ocean acidification is a good thing,

71
0:04:08.158,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we don't fully understand what the environmental consequences are,

72
0:04:12.063,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and so we need to assess whether this treatment

73
0:04:15.317,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is actually better than the disease that it is seeking to cure.

74
0:04:18.865,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We need to put in place step-by-step governance

75
0:04:22.127,000 --> 0:04:24,000
for experiments to assess this safely.

76
0:04:25.375,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And the scale:

77
0:04:28.214,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to avoid dangerous climate change,

78
0:04:29.868,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we are going to need to remove trillions --

79
0:04:32.971,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and yes, that's trillions with a T --

80
0:04:34.784,000 --> 0:04:39,000
trillions of tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in the decades ahead.

81
0:04:40.739,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It will cost a few percent of GDP -- think defense-sized expenditure,

82
0:04:45.958,000 --> 0:04:46,000
lots of industrial activity

83
0:04:47.948,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and inevitably harmful side effects.

84
0:04:51.085,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But if the scale seems enormous,

85
0:04:53.176,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it is only because of the scale of the problem

86
0:04:55.726,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that we are seeking to solve.

87
0:04:57.878,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's enormous as well.

88
0:05:00.923,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We can no longer avoid these thorny issues.

89
0:05:03.963,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We face risks whichever way we turn:

90
0:05:06.559,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a world changed by climate change

91
0:05:08.53,000 --> 0:05:13,000
or a world changed by climate change and our efforts to counter climate change.

92
0:05:14.656,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Would that it were not so,

93
0:05:16.012,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but we can no longer afford to close our eyes, block our ears,

94
0:05:19.985,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and say la-la-la.

95
0:05:21.578,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We need to grow up and face the consequences of our actions.

96
0:05:25.756,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Applause)

97
0:05:30.901,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Does talk of curing climate change undermine the will to cut emissions?

98
0:05:37.077,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is a real concern,

99
0:05:38.938,000 --> 0:05:42,000
so we need to emphasize the paramount importance of reducing emissions

100
0:05:43.81,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and how speculative these ideas are.

101
0:05:46.34,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But having done so, we still need to examine them.

102
0:05:50.161,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Can we cure climate change?

103
0:05:52.706,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I don't know, but we certainly can't if we don't try.

104
0:05:56.729,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We need ambition without arrogance.

105
0:05:59.917,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We need the ambition to restore the atmosphere,

106
0:06:03.212,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to draw down carbon dioxide

107
0:06:05.054,000 --> 0:06:09,000
back to a level that is compatible with a stable climate and healthy oceans.

108
0:06:10.257,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This will be an enormous undertaking.

109
0:06:12.775,000 --> 0:06:15,000
You could describe it as a cathedral project.

110
0:06:16.145,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Those involved at the outset

111
0:06:18.151,000 --> 0:06:21,000
may draft the plans and dig the foundations,

112
0:06:21.531,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but they will not raise the spire to its full height.

113
0:06:24.418,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That task, that privilege,

114
0:06:26.401,000 --> 0:06:27,000
belongs to our descendants.

115
0:06:28.801,000 --> 0:06:31,000
None of us will see that day, but we must start in the hope

116
0:06:32.245,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that future generations will be able to finish the job.

117
0:06:36.442,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So, do you want to change the world?

118
0:06:40.114,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I don't.

119
0:06:41.904,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I do not seek the change the world,

120
0:06:44.157,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but rather keep it as it's meant to be.

121
0:06:47.641,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Thank you.

122
0:06:48.816,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:54.096,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Chris Anderson: Thanks. I just want to ask you a couple of other questions.

124
0:06:57.702,000 --> 0:07:,000
Tell us a bit more about this idea of putting lime in the ocean.

125
0:07:01.165,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I mean, on the face of it, it's pretty compelling --

126
0:07:03.696,000 --> 0:07:05,000
anti-ocean acidification --

127
0:07:05.914,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and it absorbs more CO2.

128
0:07:08.573,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You talked about, we need to do an experiment on this.

129
0:07:11.139,000 --> 0:07:13,000
What would a responsible experiment look like?

130
0:07:13.376,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Tim Kruger: So I think you need to do a series of experiments,

131
0:07:16.362,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but you need to do them just very small stage-by-stage.

132
0:07:18.988,000 --> 0:07:2,000
In the same way, when you're trialing a new drug,

133
0:07:21.298,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you wouldn't just go into human trials straight off.

134
0:07:23.808,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You would do a small experiment.

135
0:07:25.78,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And so the first things to do are experiments entirely on land,

136
0:07:29.396,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in special containers, away from the environment.

137
0:07:33.002,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And then once you are confident that that can be done safely,

138
0:07:36.505,000 --> 0:07:37,000
you move to the next stage.

139
0:07:37.86,000 --> 0:07:38,000
If you're not confident, you don't.

140
0:07:39.556,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But step by step.

141
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
CA: And who would fund such experiments?

142
0:07:43.638,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Because they kind of impact the whole planet at some level.

143
0:07:47.537,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Is that why nothing is happening on this?

144
0:07:50.087,000 --> 0:07:53,000
TK: So I think you can do small-scale experiments in national waters,

145
0:07:53.932,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and then it's probably the requirement of national funders to do that.

146
0:07:59.001,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But ultimately, if you wanted to counter ocean acidification in this way

147
0:08:04.077,000 --> 0:08:05,000
on a global scale,

148
0:08:05.572,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you would need to do it in international waters,

149
0:08:07.85,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and then you would need to have an international community working on it.

150
0:08:11.594,000 --> 0:08:14,000
CA: Even in national waters, you know, the ocean's all connected.

151
0:08:14.671,000 --> 0:08:15,000
That lime is going to get out there.

152
0:08:16.412,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And people feel outraged about doing experiments on the planet,

153
0:08:19.408,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as we've heard.

154
0:08:21.385,000 --> 0:08:22,000
How do you counter that?

155
0:08:23.072,000 --> 0:08:25,000
TK: I think you touch on something which is really important.

156
0:08:26.075,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's about a social license to operate.

157
0:08:28.515,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And I think it may be that it is impossible to do,

158
0:08:32.275,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but we need to have the courage to try,

159
0:08:34.739,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to move this forward,

160
0:08:36.053,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to see what we can do,

161
0:08:37.411,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and to engage openly.

162
0:08:38.8,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And we need to engage with people in a transparent way.

163
0:08:41.845,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We need to ask them beforehand.

164
0:08:43.875,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And I think if we ask them,

165
0:08:45.648,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we have to be open to the possibility that the answer will come back,

166
0:08:49.292,000 --> 0:08:5,000
"No, don't do it."

167
0:08:50.92,000 --> 0:08:52,000
CA: Thanks so much. That was really fascinating.

168
0:08:53.222,000 --> 0:08:55,000
TK: Thank you. (Applause)

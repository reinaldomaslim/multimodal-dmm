1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:13,000
What if our plants

2
0:00:14.58,000 --> 0:00:16,000
could sense the toxicity levels in the soil

3
0:00:17.3,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and express that toxicity through the color of its leaves?

4
0:00:21.5,000 --> 0:00:24,000
What if those plants could also remove those toxins from the soil?

5
0:00:26.38,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Instead, what if those plants

6
0:00:28.5,000 --> 0:00:29,000
grew their own packaging,

7
0:00:30.38,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or were designed to only be harvested

8
0:00:32.98,000 --> 0:00:34,000
by their owners' own patented machines?

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
What happens when biological design

10
0:00:37.18,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is driven by the motivations of mass-produced commodities?

11
0:00:40.74,000 --> 0:00:41,000
What kind of world would that be?

12
0:00:43.06,000 --> 0:00:47,000
My name is Ani, and I'm a designer and researcher at MIT Media Lab,

13
0:00:47.1,000 --> 0:00:51,000
where I'm part of a relatively new and unique group called Design Fiction,

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
where we're wedged somewhere between science fiction and science fact.

15
0:00:55.38,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And at MIT, I am lucky enough to rub shoulders with scientists

16
0:00:59.54,000 --> 0:01:,000
studying all kinds of cutting edge fields

17
0:01:01.54,000 --> 0:01:03,000
like synthetic neurobiology,

18
0:01:03.94,000 --> 0:01:05,000
artificial intelligence, artificial life

19
0:01:05.98,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and everything in between.

20
0:01:07.74,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And across campus, there's truly brilliant scientists

21
0:01:11.58,000 --> 0:01:14,000
asking questions like, "How can I make the world a better place?"

22
0:01:15.1,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And part of what my group likes to ask is, "What is better?"

23
0:01:18.02,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What is better for you, for me,

24
0:01:20.14,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for a white woman, a gay man,

25
0:01:22.3,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a veteran, a child with a prosthetic?

26
0:01:24.82,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Technology is never neutral.

27
0:01:26.9,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It frames a reality

28
0:01:28.58,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and reflects a context.

29
0:01:30.38,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Can you imagine what it would say about the work-life balance at your office

30
0:01:34.14,000 --> 0:01:36,000
if these were standard issue on the first day?

31
0:01:36.34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:37.78,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I believe it's the role of artists and designers

33
0:01:40.06,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to raise critical questions.

34
0:01:42.22,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Art is how you can see and feel the future,

35
0:01:44.66,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and today is an exciting time to be a designer,

36
0:01:47.14,000 --> 0:01:49,000
for all the new tools becoming accessible.

37
0:01:49.3,000 --> 0:01:5,000
For instance, synthetic biology

38
0:01:50.9,000 --> 0:01:52,000
seeks to write biology as a design problem.

39
0:01:53.82,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And through these developments,

40
0:01:55.38,000 --> 0:01:57,000
my lab asks, what are the roles and responsibilities

41
0:01:58.34,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of an artist, designer, scientist or businessman?

42
0:02:02.7,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What are the implications

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
of synthetic biology, genetic engineering,

44
0:02:07.02,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and how are they shaping our notions of what it means to be a human?

45
0:02:11.66,000 --> 0:02:14,000
What are the implications of this on society, on evolution

46
0:02:14.98,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and what are the stakes in this game?

47
0:02:17.58,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My own speculative design research at the current moment

48
0:02:20.82,000 --> 0:02:21,000
plays with synthetic biology,

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but for more emotionally driven output.

50
0:02:25.3,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I'm obsessed with olfaction as a design space,

51
0:02:28.1,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and this project started with this idea

52
0:02:30.94,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of what if you could take a smell selfie, a smelfie?

53
0:02:34.74,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:36.22,000 --> 0:02:38,000
What if you could take your own natural body odor

55
0:02:38.98,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and send it to a lover?

56
0:02:41.06,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Funny enough, I found that this was a 19th century Austrian tradition,

57
0:02:44.86,000 --> 0:02:46,000
where couples in courtship would keep a slice of apple

58
0:02:47.5,000 --> 0:02:49,000
crammed under their armpit during dances,

59
0:02:50.1,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and at the end of the evening,

60
0:02:51.66,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the girl would give the guy she most fancied her used fruit,

61
0:02:55.06,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and if the feeling was mutual,

62
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
he would wolf down that stinky apple.

63
0:02:59.22,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:03.5,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Famously, Napoleon wrote many love letters to Josephine,

65
0:03:06.82,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but perhaps amongst the most memorable is this brief and urgent note:

66
0:03:11.1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"Home in three days. Don't bathe."

67
0:03:13.34,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:15.42,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Both Napoleon and Josephine adored violets.

69
0:03:19.14,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Josephine wore violet-scented perfume,

70
0:03:21.3,000 --> 0:03:22,000
carried violets on their wedding day,

71
0:03:23.14,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and Napoleon sent her a bouquet of violets

72
0:03:25.179,000 --> 0:03:26,000
every year on their anniversary.

73
0:03:26.74,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When Josephine passed away,

74
0:03:28.34,000 --> 0:03:29,000
he planted violets at her grave,

75
0:03:29.94,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and just before his exile,

76
0:03:31.78,000 --> 0:03:33,000
he went back to that tomb site,

77
0:03:33.94,000 --> 0:03:35,000
picked some of those flowers, entombed them in a locket

78
0:03:36.62,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and wore them until the day he died.

79
0:03:38.38,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And I found this so moving,

80
0:03:39.94,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I thought, could I engineer that violet to smell just like Josephine?

81
0:03:43.86,000 --> 0:03:44,000
What if, for the rest of eternity,

82
0:03:45.54,000 --> 0:03:46,000
when you went to visit her site,

83
0:03:47.14,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you could smell Josephine just as Napoleon loved her?

84
0:03:50.42,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Could we engineer new ways of mourning,

85
0:03:52.86,000 --> 0:03:54,000
new rituals for remembering?

86
0:03:54.98,000 --> 0:03:56,000
After all, we've engineered transgenic crops

87
0:03:57.7,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to be maximized for profit,

88
0:03:59.86,000 --> 0:04:01,000
crops that stand up to transport,

89
0:04:02.02,000 --> 0:04:03,000
crops that have a long shelf life,

90
0:04:03.98,000 --> 0:04:05,000
crops that taste sugary sweet but resist pests,

91
0:04:06.46,000 --> 0:04:09,000
sometimes at the expense of nutritional value.

92
0:04:09.9,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Can we harness these same technologies for an emotionally sensitive output?

93
0:04:14.5,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So currently in my lab,

94
0:04:15.82,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I'm researching questions like, what makes a human smell like a human?

95
0:04:19.14,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And it turns out it's fairly complicated.

96
0:04:21.78,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Factors such as your diet, your medications, your lifestyle

97
0:04:25.02,000 --> 0:04:27,000
all factor into the way you smell.

98
0:04:27.06,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And I found that our sweat is mostly odorless,

99
0:04:29.62,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but it's our bacteria and microbiome

100
0:04:31.779,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that's responsible for your smells, your mood, your identity

101
0:04:35.54,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and so much beyond.

102
0:04:37.18,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And there's all kinds of molecules that you emit

103
0:04:39.5,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but which we only perceive subconsciously.

104
0:04:42.94,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So I've been cataloging and collecting

105
0:04:45.3,000 --> 0:04:47,000
bacteria from different sites of my body.

106
0:04:47.5,000 --> 0:04:48,000
After talking to a scientist, we thought,

107
0:04:49.5,000 --> 0:04:5,000
maybe the perfect concoction of Ani

108
0:04:51.22,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is like 10 percent collarbone, 30 percent underarm,

109
0:04:55.22,000 --> 0:04:57,000
40 percent bikini line and so forth,

110
0:04:57.54,000 --> 0:05:,000
and occasionally I let researchers from other labs

111
0:05:00.62,000 --> 0:05:01,000
take a sniff of my samples.

112
0:05:02.3,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And it's been interesting to hear how smell of the body

113
0:05:05.5,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is perceived outside of the context of the body.

114
0:05:08.34,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I've gotten feedback such as,

115
0:05:09.94,000 --> 0:05:11,000
smells like flowers, like chicken,

116
0:05:12.42,000 --> 0:05:13,000
like cornflakes,

117
0:05:13.66,000 --> 0:05:14,000
like beef carnitas.

118
0:05:15.14,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:17.06,000 --> 0:05:2,000
At the same time, I cultivate a set of carnivorous plants

120
0:05:20.7,000 --> 0:05:23,000
for their ability to emit fleshlike odors to attract prey,

121
0:05:24.38,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in an attempt to kind of create this symbiotic relationship

122
0:05:27.22,000 --> 0:05:29,000
between my bacteria and this organism.

123
0:05:31.34,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And as it so happens, I'm at MIT and I'm in a bar,

124
0:05:34.02,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and I was talking to a scientist

125
0:05:36.34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
who happens to be a chemist and a plant scientist,

126
0:05:38.74,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I was telling him about my project,

127
0:05:40.66,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and he was like, "Well, this sounds like botany for lonely women."

128
0:05:43.82,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:46.86,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Unperturbed, I said, "OK."

130
0:05:49.78,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I challenged him.

131
0:05:51.02,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"Can we engineer a plant that can love me back?"

132
0:05:54.34,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And for some reason, he was like, "Sure, why not?"

133
0:05:57.82,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So we started with, can we get a plant to grow towards me

134
0:06:00.78,000 --> 0:06:01,000
like I was the sun?

135
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And so we're looking at mechanisms in plants such as phototropism,

136
0:06:06.22,000 --> 0:06:08,000
which causes the plant to grow towards the sun

137
0:06:08.42,000 --> 0:06:09,000
by producing hormones like auxin,

138
0:06:10.42,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which causes cell elongation on the shady side.

139
0:06:13.1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And right now I'm creating a set of lipsticks

140
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that are infused with these chemicals

141
0:06:17.1,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that allow me to interact with a plant on its own chemical signatures --

142
0:06:20.78,000 --> 0:06:23,000
lipsticks that cause plants to grow where I kiss it,

143
0:06:24.22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
plants that blossom where I kiss the bloom.

144
0:06:26.98,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And through these projects,

145
0:06:29.78,000 --> 0:06:3,000
I'm asking questions like,

146
0:06:31.22,000 --> 0:06:32,000
how do we define nature?

147
0:06:32.94,000 --> 0:06:35,000
How do we define nature when we can reengineer its properties,

148
0:06:36.5,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and when should we do it?

149
0:06:37.94,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Should we do it for profit, for utility?

150
0:06:41.66,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Can we do it for emotional ends?

151
0:06:43.38,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Can biotechnology be used to create work as moving as music?

152
0:06:46.98,000 --> 0:06:47,000
What are the thresholds between science

153
0:06:48.9,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and its ability to shape our emotional landscape?

154
0:06:52.46,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's a famous design mantra that form follows function.

155
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Well, now, wedged somewhere between science, design and art

156
0:07:00.34,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I get to ask,

157
0:07:01.58,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what if fiction informs fact?

158
0:07:03.06,000 --> 0:07:05,000
What kind of R&D lab would that look like

159
0:07:05.14,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and what kind of questions would we ask together?

160
0:07:07.78,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We often look to technology as the answer,

161
0:07:10.14,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but as an artist and designer,

162
0:07:11.7,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I like to ask, but what is the question?

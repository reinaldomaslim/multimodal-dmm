1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The great philosopher Aristotle said

2
0:00:16.84,000 --> 0:00:19,000
if something doesn't exist, there's no word for it,

3
0:00:21.32,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and if there's no word for something,

4
0:00:23.8,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that something doesn't exist.

5
0:00:26.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So when we talk about elections,

6
0:00:28.36,000 --> 0:00:31,000
we in established democracies, we know what we're talking about.

7
0:00:31.96,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We've got the words. We have the vocabulary.

8
0:00:34.08,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We know what a polling station is.

9
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We know what a ballot paper is.

10
0:00:38.84,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But what about countries where democracy doesn't exist,

11
0:00:43.76,000 --> 0:00:47,000
countries where there are no words to describe the concepts

12
0:00:48.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that underpin a democratic society?

13
0:00:51.56,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I work in the field of electoral assistance,

14
0:00:53.88,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so that's to say we assist

15
0:00:56.04,000 --> 0:00:58,000
emerging democracies to organize

16
0:00:58.2,000 --> 0:00:59,000
what is often their first elections.

17
0:01:01.48,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When people ask me what I do,

18
0:01:02.92,000 --> 0:01:04,000
quite often I get this answer.

19
0:01:05.36,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"Oh, so you're one of these people who goes around the world

20
0:01:09.2,000 --> 0:01:12,000
imposing Western democracy on countries that can't handle it."

21
0:01:14.48,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Well, the United Nations does not impose anything on anybody.

22
0:01:19.6,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It really doesn't,

23
0:01:20.84,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and also, what we do

24
0:01:23.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is firmly anchored in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

25
0:01:29.56,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Article 21, that says

26
0:01:31.68,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that everybody should have the right to choose who governs them.

27
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So that's the basis of the work.

28
0:01:37.56,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I specialize in public outreach.

29
0:01:40.48,000 --> 0:01:42,000
What does that mean? Another jargon.

30
0:01:42.92,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It actually means designing information campaigns

31
0:01:46.72,000 --> 0:01:48,000
so that candidates and voters

32
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
who have never had the opportunity to participate or to vote

33
0:01:53.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
understand where, when, how to register;

34
0:01:57.24,000 --> 0:01:59,000
where, when, how to vote;

35
0:01:59.48,000 --> 0:02:01,000
why, why it is important to take part.

36
0:02:02.56,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I'll probably devise a specific campaign to reach out to women

37
0:02:07.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to make sure that they can take part,

38
0:02:09.08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that they can be part of the process.

39
0:02:11.4,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Young people as well.

40
0:02:13.28,000 --> 0:02:14,000
All sorts of people.

41
0:02:14.52,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Handicapped people.

42
0:02:15.96,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We try to reach everybody.

43
0:02:18.8,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And it's not always easy, because very often in this work,

44
0:02:22.28,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I've noticed now over the years that I've been doing it

45
0:02:25.44,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that words are lacking,

46
0:02:27.88,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and so what do you do?

47
0:02:30.12,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Afghanistan.

48
0:02:32.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's a country with high levels of illiteracy,

49
0:02:34.72,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the thing about that was, it was in 2005,

50
0:02:38.6,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we organized two elections on the same day.

51
0:02:42.6,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The reason was because the logistics are so incredibly difficult,

52
0:02:46.84,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it seemed to be more efficient to do that.

53
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It was,

54
0:02:50.36,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but on the other hand, explaining two elections instead of one

55
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was even more complicated.

56
0:02:56.36,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So we used a lot of images,

57
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
and when it came to the actual ballot,

58
0:03:02.36,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we had problems, because so many people wanted to take part,

59
0:03:05.48,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we had 300 candidates for 52 seats

60
0:03:10.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in the Wolesi Jirga, which is the parliamentary elections.

61
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And for the Provincial Council, we had even more candidates.

62
0:03:17.24,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We had 330 for 54 seats.

63
0:03:20.24,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So talking about ballot design,

64
0:03:23.32,000 --> 0:03:26,000
this is what the ballot looked like.

65
0:03:27.6,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's the size of a newspaper.

66
0:03:29.24,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot --

67
0:03:31.426,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Yeah, and --

69
0:03:35.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
this was the Provincial Council ballot.

70
0:03:39.4,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Even more.

71
0:03:40.72,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So you see, we did use a lot of symbols and things like that.

72
0:03:45.68,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And we had other problems in Southern Sudan.

73
0:03:50.48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Southern Sudan was a very different story.

74
0:03:53.24,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We had so many people who had never, of course, voted,

75
0:03:56.36,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but we had extremely, extremely high levels of illiteracy,

76
0:04:01.12,000 --> 0:04:02,000
very, very poor infrastructure.

77
0:04:02.92,000 --> 0:04:06,000
For example -- I mean, it's a country the size of Texas, more or less.

78
0:04:07.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We had seven kilometers of paved roads,

79
0:04:11.28,000 --> 0:04:13,000
seven kilometers in the whole country,

80
0:04:13.36,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and that includes the tarmac where we landed the planes

81
0:04:16.52,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in Juba Airport.

82
0:04:18.08,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So transporting electoral materials, etc.,

83
0:04:21.24,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is exceedingly difficult.

84
0:04:23.52,000 --> 0:04:27,000
People had no idea about what a box looked like.

85
0:04:28.519,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It was very complicated,

86
0:04:30.839,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so using verbal communication was obviously the way to go,

87
0:04:34.96,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but there were 132 languages.

88
0:04:38.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So that was extremely challenging.

89
0:04:42.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011.

90
0:04:46.36,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It was the Arab Spring.

91
0:04:48.04,000 --> 0:04:52,000
A huge amount of hope was generated by that enormous movement

92
0:04:52.36,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that was going on in the region.

93
0:04:53.96,000 --> 0:04:56,000
There was Libya, there was Egypt, there was Yemen.

94
0:04:57.12,000 --> 0:05:,000
It was an enormous, enormous historical moment.

95
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I was sitting with the election commission,

96
0:05:02.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and we were talking about various aspects of the election,

97
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and I was hearing them using words that I hadn't actually heard before,

98
0:05:09.88,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and I'd worked with Iraqis, I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians,

99
0:05:14.12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and suddenly they were using these words,

100
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I just thought, "This is strange."

101
0:05:18.44,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And what really gave rise to it was this word "observer."

102
0:05:21.36,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We were discussing election observers,

103
0:05:23.64,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and the election commissioner was talking about "mulahiz" in Arabic.

104
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This means "to notice" in a passive sort of sense,

105
0:05:32.6,000 --> 0:05:35,000
as in, "I noticed he was wearing a light blue shirt."

106
0:05:36.24,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Did I go and check whether the shirt was light blue or not?

107
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That is the role of an election observer.

108
0:05:41.96,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's very active, it's governed by all kinds of treaties,

109
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it has got that control function in it.

110
0:05:48.84,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And then I got wind of the fact that in Egypt,

111
0:05:51.04,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they were using this term "mutabi’," which means "to follow."

112
0:05:54.4,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So we were now having followers of an election.

113
0:05:56.72,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So that's not quite right either,

114
0:05:59.32,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because there is a term that's already accepted and in use,

115
0:06:02.106,000 --> 0:06:05,000
which was the word "muraqib" which means "a controller."

116
0:06:05.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's got that notion of control.

117
0:06:07.56,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So I thought, three words for one concept. This is not good.

118
0:06:11.32,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And with our colleagues, we thought perhaps it's our role

119
0:06:14.44,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to actually help make sure that the words are understood

120
0:06:18.52,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and actually create a work of reference

121
0:06:21.68,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that could be used across the Arab region.

122
0:06:24.36,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And that's what we did.

123
0:06:25.64,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So together with these colleagues,

124
0:06:27.32,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we launched the "Arabic Lexicon of Electoral Terminology,"

125
0:06:31.32,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and we worked in eight different countries.

126
0:06:34.6,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It meant actually defining 481 terms

127
0:06:39.2,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which formed the basis of everything you need to know

128
0:06:42.08,000 --> 0:06:44,000
if you're going to organize a democratic election.

129
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And we defined these terms,

130
0:06:46.24,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and we worked with the Arab colleagues

131
0:06:48.24,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and came to an agreement about what would be the appropriate word

132
0:06:52.04,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to use in Arabic.

133
0:06:53.64,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Because the Arabic language is very rich, and that's part of the problem.

134
0:06:57.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But there are 22 countries that speak Arabic,

135
0:07:00.92,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and they use modern standard Arabic,

136
0:07:05.64,000 --> 0:07:07,000
which is the Arabic that is used across the whole region

137
0:07:08.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in newspapers and broadcasts,

138
0:07:11.04,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but of course, then from one country to the next in day to day language and use

139
0:07:15.97,000 --> 0:07:18,000
it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc.

140
0:07:19.32,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So that was another added layer of complication.

141
0:07:21.92,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So in one sense you had the problem

142
0:07:24.44,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that language wasn't fully ripe, if you like,

143
0:07:28.12,000 --> 0:07:3,000
neologisms were coming up, new expressions.

144
0:07:31.4,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And so we defined all these terms,

145
0:07:33.08,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and then we had eight correspondents in the region.

146
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We submitted the draft to them,

147
0:07:38.32,000 --> 0:07:39,000
they responded back to us.

148
0:07:39.92,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"Yes, we understand the definition.

149
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We agree with it,

150
0:07:44.28,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but this is what we say in our country."

151
0:07:47.48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Because we were not going to harmonize or force harmonization.

152
0:07:51.12,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We were trying to facilitate understanding among people.

153
0:07:54.64,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So in yellow, you see the different expressions in use

154
0:07:59.72,000 --> 0:08:,000
in the various countries.

155
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So this, I'm happy to say, it took three years to produce this

156
0:08:05.96,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because we also finalized the draft and took it actually into the field,

157
0:08:10.32,000 --> 0:08:13,000
sat with the election commissions in all these different countries,

158
0:08:13.487,000 --> 0:08:15,000
debated and defined and refined the draft,

159
0:08:16.4,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and finally published it in November 2014 in Cairo.

160
0:08:21.44,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And it's gone a long way. We published 10,000 copies.

161
0:08:24.72,000 --> 0:08:29,000
To date, there's about 3,000 downloads off the internet in PDF form.

162
0:08:29.96,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I heard just recently from a colleague that they've taken it up in Somalia.

163
0:08:33.88,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They're going to produce a version of this in Somalia,

164
0:08:36.8,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because there's nothing in Somalia at all.

165
0:08:38.84,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So that's very good to know.

166
0:08:41.88,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And this newly formed Arab Organization for Electoral Management Bodies,

167
0:08:46.159,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which is trying to professionalize

168
0:08:49.12,000 --> 0:08:51,000
how elections are run in the region,

169
0:08:51.44,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they're using it as well.

170
0:08:53.559,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And the Arab League have now built up a pan-Arab observation unit,

171
0:08:59.52,000 --> 0:09:,000
and they're using it.

172
0:09:00.8,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So that's all really good.

173
0:09:03.44,000 --> 0:09:06,000
However, this work of reference is quite high-pitched.

174
0:09:07.28,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's complex, and a lot of the terms are quite technical,

175
0:09:10.2,000 --> 0:09:14,000
so the average person probably doesn't need to know at least a third of it.

176
0:09:14.96,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But the people of the Middle East

177
0:09:17.04,000 --> 0:09:21,000
have been deprived of any form of what we know as civic education.

178
0:09:21.56,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's part of our curriculum at school.

179
0:09:24.36,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It doesn't really exist in that part of the world,

180
0:09:27.48,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and I feel it's really the right of everybody

181
0:09:29.92,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to know how these things work.

182
0:09:32.04,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And it's a good thing to think about producing a work of reference

183
0:09:36.68,000 --> 0:09:37,000
for the average person,

184
0:09:38.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and bearing in mind that now

185
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:42,000
we have a basis to work with,

186
0:09:42.72,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but also we have technology,

187
0:09:44.88,000 --> 0:09:48,000
so we can reach out using telephone apps,

188
0:09:49.28,000 --> 0:09:51,000
video, animation.

189
0:09:51.44,000 --> 0:09:53,000
There's all sorts of tools that can be used now

190
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to communicate these ideas to people

191
0:09:56.28,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for the first time in their own language.

192
0:10:00.2,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We hear a lot of misery about the Middle East.

193
0:10:02.48,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We hear the chaos of war. We hear terrorism.

194
0:10:05.68,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We hear about sectarianism and all this horrible negative news

195
0:10:11.24,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that comes to us all the time.

196
0:10:12.92,000 --> 0:10:16,000
What we're not hearing is what are the people, the everyday people, thinking?

197
0:10:17.8,000 --> 0:10:18,000
What are they aspiring to?

198
0:10:19.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Let's give them the means, let's give them the words.

199
0:10:24.48,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The silent majority is silent

200
0:10:26.72,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because they don't have the words.

201
0:10:29.2,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The silent majority needs to know.

202
0:10:32.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It is time to provide people with the knowledge tools

203
0:10:35.48,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that they can inform themselves with.

204
0:10:38.92,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The silent majority does not need to be silent.

205
0:10:42.08,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Let's help them have a voice.

206
0:10:44.4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Thank you very much.

207
0:10:45.68,000 --> 0:10:49,000
(Applause)

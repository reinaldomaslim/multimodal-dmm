1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Walk around for four months with three wishes,

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and all the ideas will start to percolate up.

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to really drill down to the things that you feel are important,

6
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and really reflect on the world around us.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something,

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or come up with something,

9
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.

12
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I became very interested in the landscape as a Canadian.

13
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population,

14
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and my father was an avid outdoorsman.

15
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So I really had a chance to experience that.

16
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.

17
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But what I think it was telling me

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is that we are this transient thing that's happening,

19
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines,

20
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the untouched forest that I was able to see --

21
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:41,000
really bring in a sense of that geological time,

22
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that this has gone on for a long time,

23
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and we're experiencing it in a different way.

24
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And that, to me, was a reference point that I think I needed to have

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to be able to make the work that I did.

26
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,

27
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
along a roadside.

28
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years

29
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
trying to photograph the pristine landscape.

30
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt

31
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that it wouldn't catch on out there,

32
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.

33
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,

34
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.

35
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?

36
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I decided to rethink the landscape

37
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
as the landscape that we've transformed.

38
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I had a bit of an epiphany being lost in Pennsylvania,

39
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.

40
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And I ended up in a town called Frackville.

41
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I got out of the car, and I stood up,

42
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,

43
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.

44
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Totally transformed by man.

45
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this,

46
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions

47
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in the landscape that I could find.

48
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And that became the baseline of what I was doing.

49
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,

50
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and not have to re-invent myself --

51
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that this theme was large enough to become a life's work,

52
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to become something that I could sink my teeth into

53
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and just research and find out where these industries are.

54
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And I think one of the things I also wanted to say in my thanks,

55
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which I kind of missed,

56
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.

57
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs --

58
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to get into that place to make those photographs,

59
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and if it wasn't for those people letting me in

60
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
at the heads of those corporations,

61
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I would have never made this body of work.

62
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.

63
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I own a corporation. I work with them,

64
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and I feel that we all need them and they're important.

65
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But I am also for sustainability.

66
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So there's this thing that is pulling me in both directions.

67
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here,

68
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but it is a slow progression.

69
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:

70
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.

71
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And these ages of man are still at work today.

72
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But we've become totally disconnected from them.

73
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There's something that we're not seeing there.

74
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking

75
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
at the collective appetite for our lifestyles,

76
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and what we're doing to that landscape --

77
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.

78
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And through my photographs,

79
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,

80
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.

81
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Not to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it --

82
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level,

83
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."

84
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure

85
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that I think is what resonates out there,

86
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and it gets people to look at these things,

87
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too --

88
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that I'm drawn to have a good life.

89
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I want a house, and I want a car.

90
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But there's this consequence out there.

91
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?

92
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's even in my own conscience I'm having it,

93
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.

94
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
These things that I photographed -- this tire pile here

95
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.

96
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire

97
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.

98
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had --

99
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
if the earlier work of looking at the landscape

100
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,

101
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in the recycling work that you're seeing here

102
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.

103
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
That in the recycling work that I was doing,

104
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.

105
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:13,000
That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,

106
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
back into the system --

107
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
if we keep doing that -- we can continue on.

108
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Of course, listening at the conference,

109
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,

110
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and there's many other things that are coming on stream --

111
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:3,000
nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having

112
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to go into that landscape and tear it apart.

113
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And we all look forward to those things.

114
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But in the meantime, these things are scaling up.

115
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
These things are continuing to happen.

116
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh,

117
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so I started to move away from North America;

118
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I started to look at our world globally.

119
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
These images of Bangladesh

120
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
came out of a radio program I was listening to.

121
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
They were talking about Exxon Valdez,

122
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers

123
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because of the insurance industries.

124
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,

125
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.

126
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"

127
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:09,000
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,

128
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
literally, in third-world countries.

129
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So originally I was going to go to India.

130
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,

131
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and then I was able to get into Bangladesh,

132
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,

133
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that I had never actually thought was possible.

134
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin --

135
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
people everywhere -- the pollution was intense,

136
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and the working conditions were horrible.

137
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Here you're looking at some oil fields in California,

138
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:43,000
some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that --

139
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:46,000
there was another epiphany --

140
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that the whole world I was living in was

141
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a result of having plentiful oil.

142
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And that, to me, was again something that I started building on,

143
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I continued to build on.

144
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready

145
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in about two or three years,

146
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
under the heading of "The Oil Party."

147
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Because I think everything that we're involved in --

148
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:11,000
our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.

149
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm going to move to some pictures of China.

150
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago,

151
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,

152
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
not to mention that China, as well,

153
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.

154
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I came out of a blue-collar town,

155
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a GM town, and my father worked at GM,

156
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
so I was very familiar with that kind of industry

157
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and that also informed my work. But you know,

158
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.

159
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,

160
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.

161
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
Most of the engineers around the world left the project

162
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because they said, "It's just too big."

163
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,

164
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.

165
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It took fifteen days to fill it.

166
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,

167
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
one of the largest reservoirs ever created.

168
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that

169
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:27,000
was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,

170
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.

171
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is a "before and after." So that was before.

172
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.

173
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,

174
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.

175
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And this gives you an idea.

176
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And it was all the people who lived in those homes,

177
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
were the ones that were actually taking it apart

178
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.

179
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And these are some of the images from that.

180
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,

181
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.

182
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.

183
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.

184
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this

185
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:21,000
massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.

186
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And again, it's actually a relief for what's going on in China

187
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because I think on the table right now,

188
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.

189
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years

190
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because of the "NIMBY" problem -- "Not In My BackYard."

191
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."

192
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And coal-burning furnaces are going in there

193
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:46,000
for hydroelectric power literally weekly.

194
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.

195
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges --

196
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;

197
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.

198
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,

199
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
depending on whose statistics you're looking at.

200
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And this is what they were building.

201
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
This is Wushan, one of the largest cities that was relocated.

202
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
This is the town hall for the city.

203
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see

204
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess,

205
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:26,000
what we know here, in terms of urban planning.

206
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
There were no parks; there were no green spaces.

207
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Very high-density living on the side of a hill.

208
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,

209
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but somehow were not connecting with them.

210
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Here is a sign that, translated, says, "Obey the birth control law.

211
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."

212
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So here, if you look at this poster,

213
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:53,000
it has all the trappings of Western culture.

214
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.

215
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:,000
But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture

216
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.

217
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So it's like marrying up all the things that we have

218
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.

219
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace,

220
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle

221
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:27,000
with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle

222
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.

223
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This is a shot in one of the biggest squares in Guangdong --

224
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.

225
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And there's about 130 million people in migration

226
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
trying to get into urban centers at all times,

227
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting

228
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
another 400 to 500 million people to migrate

229
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:55,000
into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.

230
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The manufacturers are --

231
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact

232
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that they all use the same color uniforms.

233
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.

234
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And they have dorms for the workers.

235
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.

236
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:16,000
This is one of the biggest shoe factories, the Yuyuan shoe factory

237
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.

238
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
This is a shift change, one of three.

239
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:27,000
There's two factories of this scale in the same town.

240
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:3,000
This is one with 45,000, so every lunch,

241
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.

242
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.

243
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce

244
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that's building there. Shanghai --

245
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai,

246
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and this is a whole area that will be flattened

247
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.

248
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:52,000
What's also happening in Shanghai is --

249
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:56,000
China is changing because this wouldn't have happened

250
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.

251
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.

252
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
They won't move. They're not negotiating.

253
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.

254
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.

255
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals

256
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
because most of them are getting a raw deal.

257
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
They're being put out about two hours --

258
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,

259
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
or maybe even thousands of years,

260
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas

261
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:27,000
outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys

262
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:32,000
holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.

263
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think,

264
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
ever attempted on the planet.

265
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And then the embrace of the things that they're replacing it with --

266
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there,

267
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.

268
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:54,000
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something,

269
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and these are called the villas.

270
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And also, like right now, they're just moving.

271
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area,

272
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and if you looked in the foreground on the big print,

273
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.

274
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So the industry's already growing

275
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
around these new developments.

276
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
This is a five-level bridge in Shanghai.

277
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level

278
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that I don't think any city has experienced.

279
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:32,000
In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone --

280
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:37,000
one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,

281
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.

282
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which --

283
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.

284
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
There's 9,000 of them here,

285
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and they're being built for most of the big cities,

286
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.

287
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.

288
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And what we would see here as a suburban development --

289
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:15,000
a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.

290
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:17,000
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time,

291
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and they just go up in the same way

292
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:26,000
as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.

293
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And the density is quite incredible.

294
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out

295
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,000
is that when I saw these kinds of buildings,

296
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I was shocked to see

297
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that they're not using a central air-conditioning system;

298
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
every window has an air conditioner in it.

299
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And I'm sure there are people here who probably

300
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
know better than I do about efficiencies,

301
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner

302
0:16:57,000 --> 0:16:59,000
is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.

303
0:16:59,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And when you start looking at that,

304
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,

305
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:09,000
it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.

306
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:15,000
It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.

307
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And you can see in the foreground of this picture,

308
0:17:17,000 --> 0:17:2,000
it's still one of the last areas that was being held up.

309
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago --

310
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.

311
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.

312
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Most recently I went in, and I started looking

313
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:4,000
at some of the biggest industries in China.

314
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.

315
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:49,000
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.

316
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,

317
0:17:56,000 --> 0:18:,000
five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.

318
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So they're building very large blast furnaces

319
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:09,000
to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.

320
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:14,000
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.

321
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:2,000
And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.

322
0:18:2,000 --> 0:18:25,000
This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.

323
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:42,000
10 hours a day at this speed.

324
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:58,000
I think one of the issues

325
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:04,000
that we here are facing with China,

326
0:19:04,000 --> 0:19:07,000
is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.

327
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:1,000
In that one, there were 400 people that worked on the floor.

328
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,

329
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:19,000
and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,

330
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and picked this one woman.

331
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:23,000
And it was just lightning fast;

332
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:25,000
the way she was working was almost unbelievable.

333
0:19:25,000 --> 0:19:28,000
But that is the trick that they've got right now,

334
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:31,000
that they're winning with, is that they're using

335
0:19:31,000 --> 0:19:33,000
all the latest technologies and extrusion machines,

336
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and bringing all the components into play,

337
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:4,000
but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in --

338
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:45,000
the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.

339
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:49,000
There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.

340
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:52,000
That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years

341
0:19:52,000 --> 0:19:55,000
if they realize what they want, which is, you know,

342
0:19:55,000 --> 0:19:58,000
400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.

343
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:01,000
In this particular case -- this is the assembly line that you saw;

344
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:02,000
this is a shot of it.

345
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:05,000
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.

346
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:1,000
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.

347
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:13,000
It took me five fake tries

348
0:20:13,000 --> 0:20:17,000
because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.

349
0:20:17,000 --> 0:20:2,000
They were just wound up doing these things all day long,

350
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:22,000
until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,

351
0:20:22,000 --> 0:20:24,000
"Okay, everybody freeze."

352
0:20:24,000 --> 0:20:27,000
It wasn't too bad,

353
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:33,000
but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.

354
0:20:33,000 --> 0:20:4,000
This is a textile mill doing synthetic silk, an oil byproduct.

355
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:42,000
And what you're seeing here is,

356
0:20:42,000 --> 0:20:46,000
again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.

357
0:20:46,000 --> 0:20:49,000
There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.

358
0:20:49,000 --> 0:20:51,000
So you have about 12 people running this,

359
0:20:51,000 --> 0:20:54,000
and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.

360
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:56,000
The machines are all running,

361
0:20:56,000 --> 0:20:59,000
absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.

362
0:20:59,000 --> 0:21:04,000
And I started getting in further and further into the factories.

363
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:07,000
And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings

364
0:21:07,000 --> 0:21:1,000
to try and get the sense of scale in these places.

365
0:21:1,000 --> 0:21:12,000
This is a line where they get the threads

366
0:21:12,000 --> 0:21:14,000
and they wind the threads together,

367
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:18,000
pre-going into the textile mills.

368
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:2,000
Here's something that's far more labor-intensive,

369
0:21:2,000 --> 0:21:22,000
which is the making of shoes.

370
0:21:22,000 --> 0:21:27,000
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.

371
0:21:27,000 --> 0:21:31,000
The company itself had about 10,000 employees,

372
0:21:31,000 --> 0:21:34,000
and they're doing domestic shoes.

373
0:21:34,000 --> 0:21:37,000
It was very hard to get into the international companies

374
0:21:37,000 --> 0:21:41,000
because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,

375
0:21:41,000 --> 0:21:43,000
and that's very hard to get.

376
0:21:43,000 --> 0:21:45,000
And they don't want to let me in.

377
0:21:45,000 --> 0:21:47,000
But the domestic was much easier to do.

378
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:5,000
It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where,

379
0:21:5,000 --> 0:21:53,000
really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China

380
0:21:53,000 --> 0:21:56,000
and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.

381
0:21:56,000 --> 0:22:01,000
It was such a high labor component to it

382
0:22:01,000 --> 0:22:04,000
that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.

383
0:22:04,000 --> 0:22:08,000
This is a high-tech mobile phone: Bird mobile phone,

384
0:22:08,000 --> 0:22:1,000
one of the largest mobile makers in China.

385
0:22:1,000 --> 0:22:13,000
I think mobile phone companies

386
0:22:13,000 --> 0:22:17,000
are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,

387
0:22:17,000 --> 0:22:21,000
and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.

388
0:22:21,000 --> 0:22:25,000
This is a textile where they're doing shirts --

389
0:22:25,000 --> 0:22:28,000
Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.

390
0:22:28,000 --> 0:22:32,000
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.

391
0:22:32,000 --> 0:22:34,000
Everything is very efficient.

392
0:22:34,000 --> 0:22:36,000
While setting up this shot,

393
0:22:36,000 --> 0:22:42,000
people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.

394
0:22:44,000 --> 0:22:46,000
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.

395
0:22:46,000 --> 0:22:51,000
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker

396
0:22:51,000 --> 0:22:55,000
and the biggest iron makers --

397
0:22:55,000 --> 0:22:57,000
they make 20 million of them in the world.

398
0:22:57,000 --> 0:23:02,000
There's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them --

399
0:23:02,000 --> 0:23:04,000
is half a kilometer long.

400
0:23:04,000 --> 0:23:07,000
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago,

401
0:23:07,000 --> 0:23:1,000
so you're the first ones to be seeing these,

402
0:23:1,000 --> 0:23:13,000
these new factory pictures I've taken.

403
0:23:13,000 --> 0:23:18,000
So it's taken me almost a year to gain access into these places.

404
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:22,000
The other aspect of what's happening in China

405
0:23:22,000 --> 0:23:25,000
is that there's a real need for materials there.

406
0:23:25,000 --> 0:23:28,000
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here

407
0:23:28,000 --> 0:23:31,000
are being recycled and taken to China by ships.

408
0:23:31,000 --> 0:23:35,000
That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,

409
0:23:35,000 --> 0:23:37,000
where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel

410
0:23:37,000 --> 0:23:42,000
from electrical motors out, and recycling them.

411
0:23:42,000 --> 0:23:45,000
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.

412
0:23:45,000 --> 0:23:48,000
But this is what happens to most of the computers.

413
0:23:48,000 --> 0:23:52,000
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.

414
0:23:52,000 --> 0:23:54,000
It's referred to as "e-waste" there.

415
0:23:54,000 --> 0:23:58,000
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards

416
0:23:58,000 --> 0:24:01,000
is that they actually use the coal briquettes,

417
0:24:01,000 --> 0:24:04,000
which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,

418
0:24:04,000 --> 0:24:07,000
and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.

419
0:24:07,000 --> 0:24:1,000
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.

420
0:24:1,000 --> 0:24:13,000
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town

421
0:24:13,000 --> 0:24:16,000
that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,

422
0:24:16,000 --> 0:24:19,000
you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.

423
0:24:19,000 --> 0:24:22,000
Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries,

424
0:24:22,000 --> 0:24:27,000
so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches,

425
0:24:27,000 --> 0:24:33,000
in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,

426
0:24:33,000 --> 0:24:36,000
if there's a concern for somebody coming by --

427
0:24:36,000 --> 0:24:39,000
because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,

428
0:24:39,000 --> 0:24:43,000
but they can't stop the product from coming in.

429
0:24:43,000 --> 0:24:46,000
This portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits,

430
0:24:46,000 --> 0:24:5,000
but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao,

431
0:24:5,000 --> 0:24:52,000
and she's been through the Great Leap Forward,

432
0:24:52,000 --> 0:24:55,000
and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch

433
0:24:55,000 --> 0:24:58,000
with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.

434
0:24:58,000 --> 0:25:02,000
This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards

435
0:25:02,000 --> 0:25:04,000
in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.

436
0:25:05,000 --> 0:25:09,000
So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.

437
0:25:09,000 --> 0:25:11,000
(Applause)

438
0:25:11,000 --> 0:25:13,000
I want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls.

439
0:25:13,000 --> 0:25:16,000
They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.

440
0:25:16,000 --> 0:25:19,000
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.

441
0:25:19,000 --> 0:25:21,000
And to me the whole notion --

442
0:25:21,000 --> 0:25:23,000
the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern

443
0:25:23,000 --> 0:25:28,000
about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.

444
0:25:28,000 --> 0:25:31,000
And as much as there are great things around the corner --

445
0:25:31,000 --> 0:25:34,000
and it's palpable in this room --

446
0:25:34,000 --> 0:25:36,000
of all of the things that are just about to break

447
0:25:36,000 --> 0:25:39,000
that can solve so many problems,

448
0:25:39,000 --> 0:25:42,000
I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world

449
0:25:42,000 --> 0:25:45,000
and will start to have a positive effect.

450
0:25:45,000 --> 0:25:47,000
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world,

451
0:25:47,000 --> 0:25:5,000
but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting

452
0:25:5,000 --> 0:25:55,000
our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint

453
0:25:55,000 --> 0:25:59,000
that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,

454
0:25:59,000 --> 0:26:04,000
and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,

455
0:26:04,000 --> 0:26:08,000
I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,

456
0:26:08,000 --> 0:26:12,000
because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.

457
0:26:12,000 --> 0:26:15,000
So part of my thinking, and part of my wishes,

458
0:26:15,000 --> 0:26:18,000
is sitting with these thoughts in mind,

459
0:26:18,000 --> 0:26:2,000
and thinking about,

460
0:26:2,000 --> 0:26:23,000
"How is their life going to be when they want to have children,

461
0:26:23,000 --> 0:26:26,000
or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever,

462
0:26:26,000 --> 0:26:28,000
15 years from now?"

463
0:26:28,000 --> 0:26:31,000
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking --

464
0:26:31,000 --> 0:26:39,000
in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.

465
0:26:39,000 --> 0:26:43,000
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images

466
0:26:43,000 --> 0:26:48,000
to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.

467
0:26:48,000 --> 0:26:51,000
And it is through communications today

468
0:26:51,000 --> 0:26:55,000
that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.

469
0:26:55,000 --> 0:26:59,000
Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind,

470
0:26:59,000 --> 0:27:03,000
hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.

471
0:27:03,000 --> 0:27:06,000
One of them I'm starting from almost nothing, but the other one,

472
0:27:06,000 --> 0:27:09,000
I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.

473
0:27:09,000 --> 0:27:17,000
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog

474
0:27:17,000 --> 0:27:22,000
is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.

475
0:27:22,000 --> 0:27:27,000
And it just started about 14 months ago.

476
0:27:27,000 --> 0:27:29,000
And the beauty of what's going on there

477
0:27:29,000 --> 0:27:35,000
is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.

478
0:27:35,000 --> 0:27:38,000
What they're doing there is that they're not --

479
0:27:38,000 --> 0:27:41,000
I think the environmental movement has failed

480
0:27:41,000 --> 0:27:43,000
in that it's used the stick too much;

481
0:27:43,000 --> 0:27:46,000
it's used the apocalyptic tone too much;

482
0:27:46,000 --> 0:27:51,000
it hasn't sold the positive aspects of

483
0:27:51,000 --> 0:27:54,000
being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.

484
0:27:54,000 --> 0:27:57,000
Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog

485
0:27:57,000 --> 0:28:,000
is about positive movements,

486
0:28:,000 --> 0:28:03,000
about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.

487
0:28:03,000 --> 0:28:08,000
And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices,

488
0:28:08,000 --> 0:28:12,000
and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize

489
0:28:12,000 --> 0:28:15,000
the movement towards sustainability.

490
0:28:15,000 --> 0:28:19,000
And so for me, one of the things that I thought

491
0:28:19,000 --> 0:28:25,000
would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting

492
0:28:25,000 --> 0:28:28,000
the Worldchanging.com website.

493
0:28:28,000 --> 0:28:33,000
Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I

494
0:28:33,000 --> 0:28:37,000
are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;

495
0:28:37,000 --> 0:28:43,000
these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,

496
0:28:43,000 --> 0:28:45,000
can be placed into any kind of media.

497
0:28:45,000 --> 0:28:48,000
They could be posted through the Web;

498
0:28:48,000 --> 0:28:55,000
they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.

499
0:28:55,000 --> 0:28:59,000
So we're looking at this as trying to build out.

500
0:28:59,000 --> 0:29:01,000
And what we ended up discussing

501
0:29:01,000 --> 0:29:06,000
was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,

502
0:29:06,000 --> 0:29:08,000
and the text is blasted all over.

503
0:29:08,000 --> 0:29:1,000
What was unusual, according to Stephen,

504
0:29:1,000 --> 0:29:15,000
is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.

505
0:29:15,000 --> 0:29:17,000
And so in this case,

506
0:29:17,000 --> 0:29:2,000
because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent,

507
0:29:2,000 --> 0:29:22,000
and the kinds of questions they bring up,

508
0:29:22,000 --> 0:29:27,000
that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,

509
0:29:27,000 --> 0:29:32,000
"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"

510
0:29:32,000 --> 0:29:36,000
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.

511
0:29:36,000 --> 0:29:4,000
So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,

512
0:29:4,000 --> 0:29:43,000
and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog

513
0:29:43,000 --> 0:29:45,000
where we're all going to follow each other to death.

514
0:29:45,000 --> 0:29:48,000
This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,

515
0:29:48,000 --> 0:29:51,000
and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations

516
0:29:51,000 --> 0:29:53,000
in India, in China, in South America --

517
0:29:53,000 --> 0:29:56,000
there's entries coming from all around the world.

518
0:29:56,000 --> 0:29:59,000
I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation

519
0:29:59,000 --> 0:30:02,000
about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.

520
0:30:02,000 --> 0:30:07,000
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.

521
0:30:07,000 --> 0:30:1,000
Wish two is more of the bottom-up, ground-up one that I'm trying to work with.

522
0:30:1,000 --> 0:30:14,000
And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition

523
0:30:14,000 --> 0:30:21,000
that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.

524
0:30:21,000 --> 0:30:23,000
And one of the things that came out --

525
0:30:23,000 --> 0:30:26,000
Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on

526
0:30:26,000 --> 0:30:29,000
in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada

527
0:30:29,000 --> 0:30:37,000
had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.

528
0:30:37,000 --> 0:30:39,000
And you think about it, you know,

529
0:30:39,000 --> 0:30:43,000
grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,

530
0:30:43,000 --> 0:30:47,000
so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.

531
0:30:47,000 --> 0:30:49,000
So it's this great window where they actually are --

532
0:30:49,000 --> 0:30:52,000
you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?

533
0:30:52,000 --> 0:30:55,000
You know, we know that from earlier presentations.

534
0:30:55,000 --> 0:31:02,000
So my thinking here is that we try to motivate those kids

535
0:31:02,000 --> 0:31:06,000
to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,

536
0:31:06,000 --> 0:31:08,000
and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.

537
0:31:08,000 --> 0:31:13,000
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,

538
0:31:13,000 --> 0:31:17,000
so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,

539
0:31:17,000 --> 0:31:19,000
and the rest is going to be to manage this project,

540
0:31:19,000 --> 0:31:22,000
but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.

541
0:31:22,000 --> 0:31:24,000
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic

542
0:31:24,000 --> 0:31:28,000
was to create these -- call them "prize targets."

543
0:31:28,000 --> 0:31:32,000
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea

544
0:31:32,000 --> 0:31:37,000
for an in-school project, the best one for a household project,

545
0:31:37,000 --> 0:31:4,000
or it could be the best community project for sustainability.

546
0:31:4,000 --> 0:31:43,000
And I also thought there should be a nice prize

547
0:31:43,000 --> 0:31:47,000
for the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen --

548
0:31:47,000 --> 0:31:52,000
it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things --

549
0:31:52,000 --> 0:31:54,000
whether it's equipment, like a media lab,

550
0:31:54,000 --> 0:31:56,000
or money to make the prize significant enough --

551
0:31:56,000 --> 0:32:01,000
and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,

552
0:32:01,000 --> 0:32:03,000
or schools that are with kids that age,

553
0:32:03,000 --> 0:32:06,000
and make it a wide-open competition for them

554
0:32:06,000 --> 0:32:08,000
to go after those prizes and to submit them.

555
0:32:08,000 --> 0:32:13,000
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.

556
0:32:13,000 --> 0:32:16,000
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them

557
0:32:16,000 --> 0:32:19,000
and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.

558
0:32:19,000 --> 0:32:21,000
In that way, what's happening is that

559
0:32:21,000 --> 0:32:24,000
we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.

560
0:32:24,000 --> 0:32:29,000
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into,

561
0:32:29,000 --> 0:32:33,000
I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,

562
0:32:33,000 --> 0:32:35,000
and trying to help them with the projects.

563
0:32:35,000 --> 0:32:39,000
And I think it starts to motivate the whole idea towards sustainability

564
0:32:39,000 --> 0:32:41,000
in a very positive way,

565
0:32:41,000 --> 0:32:44,000
and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,

566
0:32:44,000 --> 0:32:47,000
but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,

567
0:32:47,000 --> 0:32:5,000
and the energy footprint, and how that matters.

568
0:32:5,000 --> 0:32:54,000
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,

569
0:32:54,000 --> 0:32:58,000
and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.

570
0:32:59,000 --> 0:33:01,000
And again, in "In My World," the competition --

571
0:33:01,000 --> 0:33:05,000
we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.

572
0:33:05,000 --> 0:33:07,000
And I like the words, "in my world,"

573
0:33:07,000 --> 0:33:1,000
because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.

574
0:33:1,000 --> 0:33:13,000
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;

575
0:33:13,000 --> 0:33:18,000
I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity

576
0:33:18,000 --> 0:33:23,000
to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids --

577
0:33:23,000 --> 0:33:25,000
and engage their imagination into a project,

578
0:33:25,000 --> 0:33:27,000
and do something for schools.

579
0:33:27,000 --> 0:33:3,000
I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash --

580
0:33:3,000 --> 0:33:34,000
it's going to be an incentive for them to do that.

581
0:33:34,000 --> 0:33:37,000
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where

582
0:33:37,000 --> 0:33:43,000
we could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."

583
0:33:43,000 --> 0:33:49,000
And wish three is: Imax film. So I was told I should do one for myself,

584
0:33:49,000 --> 0:33:53,000
and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.

585
0:33:53,000 --> 0:33:56,000
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with --

586
0:33:56,000 --> 0:33:59,000
when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,

587
0:33:59,000 --> 0:34:01,000
"There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do

588
0:34:01,000 --> 0:34:04,000
and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."

589
0:34:04,000 --> 0:34:08,000
And I think there's a real possibility

590
0:34:08,000 --> 0:34:1,000
to reach new audiences if I had a chance.

591
0:34:1,000 --> 0:34:14,000
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.

592
0:34:14,000 --> 0:34:17,000
I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now --

593
0:34:17,000 --> 0:34:19,000
I'm too busy. So I need somebody

594
0:34:19,000 --> 0:34:24,000
who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,

595
0:34:24,000 --> 0:34:28,000
and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.

596
0:34:28,000 --> 0:34:31,000
That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.

597
0:34:31,000 --> 0:34:32,000
(Applause)

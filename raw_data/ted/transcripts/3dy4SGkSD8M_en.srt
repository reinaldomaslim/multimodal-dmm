1
0:00:12.905,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Eric Hirshberg: So I assume that Norman doesn't need much of an introduction,

2
0:00:16.549,000 --> 0:00:17,000
but TED's audience is global,

3
0:00:18.078,000 --> 0:00:19,000
it's diverse,

4
0:00:19.299,000 --> 0:00:21,000
so I've been tasked with starting with his bio,

5
0:00:22.309,000 --> 0:00:24,000
which could easily take up the entire 18 minutes.

6
0:00:24.619,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So instead we're going to do 93 years in 93 seconds or less.

7
0:00:28.586,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:30.258,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You were born in New Hampshire.

9
0:00:31.829,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Norman Lear: New Haven, Connecticut.

10
0:00:33.568,000 --> 0:00:34,000
EH: New Haven, Connecticut.

11
0:00:34.878,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:37.79,000 --> 0:00:38,000
NL: There goes seven more seconds.

13
0:00:39.434,000 --> 0:00:4,000
EH: Nailed it.

14
0:00:40.701,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:43.042,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You were born in New Haven, Connecticut.

16
0:00:44.971,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Your father was a con man -- I got that right.

17
0:00:47.4,000 --> 0:00:49,000
He was taken away to prison when you were nine years old.

18
0:00:50.171,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You flew 52 missions as a fighter pilot in World War II.

19
0:00:53.686,000 --> 0:00:54,000
You came back to --

20
0:00:54.86,000 --> 0:00:55,000
NL: Radio operator.

21
0:00:56.542,000 --> 0:00:58,000
EH: You came to LA to break into Hollywood,

22
0:00:59.049,000 --> 0:01:,000
first in publicity, then in TV.

23
0:01:00.953,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You had no training as a writer, formally,

24
0:01:03.136,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but you hustled your way in.

25
0:01:04.564,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Your breakthrough, your debut,

26
0:01:06.041,000 --> 0:01:08,000
was a little show called "All in the Family."

27
0:01:08.333,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You followed that up with a string of hits

28
0:01:10.461,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that to this day is unmatched in Hollywood:

29
0:01:12.603,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"Sanford and Son," "Maude," "Good Times,"

30
0:01:14.667,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"The Jeffersons," "One Day at a Time,"

31
0:01:16.517,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman,"

32
0:01:17.954,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to name literally a fraction of them.

33
0:01:19.741,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Not only are they all commercially --

34
0:01:21.542,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Applause)

35
0:01:25.572,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Not only are they all commercially successful,

36
0:01:28.581,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but many of them push our culture forward

37
0:01:30.579,000 --> 0:01:32,000
by giving the underrepresented members of society

38
0:01:32.965,000 --> 0:01:34,000
their first prime-time voice.

39
0:01:35.333,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You have seven shows in the top 10 at one time.

40
0:01:39.033,000 --> 0:01:4,000
At one point,

41
0:01:40.286,000 --> 0:01:43,000
you aggregate an audience of 120 million people per week

42
0:01:43.647,000 --> 0:01:44,000
watching your content.

43
0:01:44.897,000 --> 0:01:46,000
That's more than the audience for Super Bowl 50,

44
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which happens once a year.

45
0:01:48.423,000 --> 0:01:49,000
NL: Holy shit.

46
0:01:49.669,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

47
0:01:51.466,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Applause)

48
0:01:53.712,000 --> 0:01:55,000
EH: And we're not even to the holy shit part.

49
0:01:56.095,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

50
0:01:57.158,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You land yourself on Richard Nixon's enemies list --

51
0:01:59.909,000 --> 0:02:,000
he had one.

52
0:02:01.399,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's an applause line, too.

53
0:02:03.518,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Applause)

54
0:02:05.344,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You're inducted into the TV Hall of Fame on the first day that it exists.

55
0:02:08.965,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Then came the movies.

56
0:02:10.389,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"Fried Green Tomatoes,"

57
0:02:11.993,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"The Princess Bride," "Stand By Me,"

58
0:02:14.042,000 --> 0:02:15,000
"This Is Spinal Tap."

59
0:02:15.239,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Applause)

60
0:02:16.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Again, just to name a fraction.

61
0:02:17.956,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Applause)

62
0:02:19.011,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Then you wipe the slate clean,

63
0:02:20.541,000 --> 0:02:24,000
start a third act as a political activist focusing on protecting the First Amendment

64
0:02:24.612,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and the separation of church and state.

65
0:02:26.586,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You start People For The American Way.

66
0:02:28.5,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You buy the Declaration of Independence

67
0:02:30.382,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and give it back to the people.

68
0:02:31.897,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You stay active in both entertainment and politics

69
0:02:34.259,000 --> 0:02:35,000
until the ripe old of age of 93,

70
0:02:35.815,000 --> 0:02:36,000
when you write a book

71
0:02:37.085,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and make a documentary about your life story.

72
0:02:39.273,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And after all that,

73
0:02:40.471,000 --> 0:02:42,000
they finally think you're ready for a TED Talk.

74
0:02:43.037,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

75
0:02:44.842,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Applause)

76
0:02:49.438,000 --> 0:02:5,000
NL: I love being here.

77
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I love you for agreeing to do this.

78
0:02:53.999,000 --> 0:02:54,000
EH: Thank you for asking. It's my honor.

79
0:02:56.012,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So here's my first question.

80
0:02:57.919,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Was your mother proud of you?

81
0:02:59.657,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:02.055,000 --> 0:03:03,000
NL: My mother ...

83
0:03:03.412,000 --> 0:03:04,000
what a place to start.

84
0:03:06.967,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Let me put it this way --

85
0:03:09.142,000 --> 0:03:1,000
when I came back from the war,

86
0:03:10.786,000 --> 0:03:15,000
she showed me the letters that I had written her from overseas,

87
0:03:16.398,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and they were absolute love letters.

88
0:03:21.961,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:23.564,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This really sums up my mother.

90
0:03:25.73,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They were love letters,

91
0:03:26.905,000 --> 0:03:28,000
as if I had written them to --

92
0:03:29.131,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they were love letters.

93
0:03:33.214,000 --> 0:03:37,000
A year later I asked my mother if I could have them,

94
0:03:37.771,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because I'd like to keep them all the years of my life ...

95
0:03:42.072,000 --> 0:03:43,000
She had thrown them away.

96
0:03:43.605,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

97
0:03:48.89,000 --> 0:03:49,000
That's my mother.

98
0:03:50.218,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

99
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The best way I can sum it up in more recent times is --

100
0:03:59.264,000 --> 0:04:01,000
this is also more recent times --

101
0:04:01.585,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a number of years ago,

102
0:04:02.791,000 --> 0:04:05,000
when they started the Hall of Fame to which you referred.

103
0:04:06.688,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It was a Sunday morning,

104
0:04:08.495,000 --> 0:04:13,000
when I got a call from the fellow who ran the TV Academy of Arts & Sciences.

105
0:04:13.773,000 --> 0:04:15,000
He was calling me to tell me they had met all day yesterday

106
0:04:16.766,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and he was confidentially telling me they were going to start a hall of fame

107
0:04:21.003,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and these were the inductees.

108
0:04:27.201,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I started to say "Richard Nixon,"

109
0:04:29.147,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because Richard Nixon --

110
0:04:30.813,000 --> 0:04:31,000
EH: I don't think he was on their list.

111
0:04:32.708,000 --> 0:04:34,000
NL: William Paley, who started CBS,

112
0:04:35.255,000 --> 0:04:38,000
David Sarnoff, who started NBC,

113
0:04:38.913,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Edward R. Murrow,

114
0:04:40.092,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the greatest of the foreign correspondents,

115
0:04:43.818,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Paddy Chayefsky --

116
0:04:45.013,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I think the best writer that ever came out of television --

117
0:04:47.799,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Milton Berle, Lucille Ball

118
0:04:49.8,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and me.

119
0:04:51.205,000 --> 0:04:52,000
EH: Not bad.

120
0:04:52.38,000 --> 0:04:54,000
NL: I call my mother immediately in Hartford, Connecticut.

121
0:04:55.119,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"Mom, this is what's happened,

122
0:04:56.666,000 --> 0:04:57,000
they're starting a hall of fame."

123
0:04:58.289,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I tell her the list of names and me,

124
0:05:00.036,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and she says,

125
0:05:01.218,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"Listen, if that's what they want to do, who am I to say?"

126
0:05:03.979,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:07.504,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Applause)

128
0:05:10.444,000 --> 0:05:11,000
That's my Ma.

129
0:05:11.825,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I think it earns that kind of a laugh

130
0:05:13.729,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because everybody has a piece of that mother.

131
0:05:15.849,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:17.047,000 --> 0:05:19,000
EH: And the sitcom Jewish mother is born, right there.

133
0:05:20.348,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So your father also played a large role in your life,

134
0:05:25.182,000 --> 0:05:26,000
mostly by his absence.

135
0:05:26.856,000 --> 0:05:27,000
NL: Yeah.

136
0:05:28.037,000 --> 0:05:3,000
EH: Tell us what happened when you were nine years old.

137
0:05:30.684,000 --> 0:05:34,000
NL: He was flying to Oklahoma

138
0:05:35.587,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with three guys that my mother said,

139
0:05:37.682,000 --> 0:05:39,000
"I don't want you to have anything to do with them,

140
0:05:40.088,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I don't trust those men."

141
0:05:42.04,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That's when I heard,

142
0:05:43.414,000 --> 0:05:44,000
maybe not for the first time,

143
0:05:44.921,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"Stifle yourself, Jeanette, I'm going."

144
0:05:48.611,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And he went.

145
0:05:50.112,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It turns out he was picking up some fake bonds,

146
0:05:55.153,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which he was flying across the country to sell.

147
0:05:59.764,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But the fact that he was going to Oklahoma in a plane,

148
0:06:03.335,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and he was going to bring me back a 10-gallon hat,

149
0:06:07.05,000 --> 0:06:12,000
just like Ken Maynard, my favorite cowboy wore.

150
0:06:14.124,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You know, this was a few years after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic.

151
0:06:19.236,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I mean, it was exotic that my father was going there.

152
0:06:22.857,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But when he came back,

153
0:06:24.122,000 --> 0:06:26,000
they arrested him as he got off the plane.

154
0:06:26.553,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That night newspapers were all over the house,

155
0:06:30.973,000 --> 0:06:32,000
my father was with his hat in front of his face,

156
0:06:33.617,000 --> 0:06:34,000
manacled to a detective.

157
0:06:35.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And my mother was selling the furniture, because we were leaving --

158
0:06:39.402,000 --> 0:06:42,000
she didn't want to stay in that state of shame,

159
0:06:43.235,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in Chelsea, Massachusetts.

160
0:06:46.528,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And selling the furniture --

161
0:06:50.216,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the house was loaded with people.

162
0:06:52.712,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And in the middle of all of that,

163
0:06:54.854,000 --> 0:07:,000
some strange horse's ass put his hand on my shoulder and said,

164
0:07:01.066,000 --> 0:07:03,000
"Well, you're the man of the house now."

165
0:07:04.982,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I'm crying, and this asshole says, "You're the man of the house now."

166
0:07:11.268,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And I think that was the moment

167
0:07:14.226,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I began to understand the foolishness of the human condition.

168
0:07:19.678,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So ...

169
0:07:22.558,000 --> 0:07:26,000
it took a lot of years to look back at it and feel it was a benefit.

170
0:07:28.437,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But --

171
0:07:29.611,000 --> 0:07:31,000
EH: It's interesting you call it a benefit.

172
0:07:31.903,000 --> 0:07:33,000
NL: Benefit in that it gave me that springboard.

173
0:07:34.358,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I mean that I could think

174
0:07:38.162,000 --> 0:07:41,000
how foolish it was to say to this crying nine-year-old boy,

175
0:07:41.374,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"You're the man of the house now."

176
0:07:43.303,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And then I was crying, and then he said,

177
0:07:46.74,000 --> 0:07:48,000
"And men of the house don't cry."

178
0:07:49.755,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I ...

179
0:07:51.319,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

180
0:07:52.628,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So ...

181
0:07:56.413,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I look back, and I think

182
0:07:57.944,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that's when I learned the foolishness of the human condition,

183
0:08:02.111,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and it's been that gift that I've used.

184
0:08:06.015,000 --> 0:08:08,000
EH: So you have a father who's absent,

185
0:08:08.567,000 --> 0:08:1,000
you have a mother for whom apparently nothing is good enough.

186
0:08:11.87,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Do you think that starting out as a kid who maybe never felt heard

187
0:08:17.156,000 --> 0:08:18,000
started you down a journey

188
0:08:18.702,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that ended with you being an adult

189
0:08:20.504,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with a weekly audience of 120 million people?

190
0:08:23.869,000 --> 0:08:26,000
NL: I love the way you put that question,

191
0:08:26.903,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because I guess I've spent my life wanting --

192
0:08:30.746,000 --> 0:08:31,000
if anything, wanting to be heard.

193
0:08:36.898,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I think --

194
0:08:40.524,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's a simple answer, yes,

195
0:08:42.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that was what sparked --

196
0:08:45.857,000 --> 0:08:46,000
well, there were other things, too.

197
0:08:47.588,000 --> 0:08:49,000
When my father was away,

198
0:08:50.443,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I was fooling with a crystal radio set that we had made together,

199
0:08:56.509,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I caught a signal that turned out to be Father Coughlin.

200
0:09:01.684,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

201
0:09:04.77,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Yeah, somebody laughed.

202
0:09:06.136,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:07.587,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But not funny,

204
0:09:09.042,000 --> 0:09:1,000
this was a horse's --

205
0:09:10.566,000 --> 0:09:11,000
another horse's ass --

206
0:09:12.206,000 --> 0:09:14,000
who was very vocal about hating the New Deal

207
0:09:14.821,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and Roosevelt and Jews.

208
0:09:18.256,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The first time I ran into an understanding

209
0:09:21.613,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that there were people in this world that hated me

210
0:09:24.53,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because I was born to Jewish parents.

211
0:09:27.291,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And that had an enormous effect on my life.

212
0:09:32.059,000 --> 0:09:33,000
EH: So you had a childhood

213
0:09:34.066,000 --> 0:09:37,000
with little in the way of strong male role models,

214
0:09:37.172,000 --> 0:09:38,000
except for your grandfather.

215
0:09:39.272,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Tell us about him.

216
0:09:41.176,000 --> 0:09:42,000
NL: Oh, my grandfather.

217
0:09:43.323,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Well here's the way I always talked about that grandfather.

218
0:09:49.606,000 --> 0:09:5,000
There were parades,

219
0:09:50.78,000 --> 0:09:51,000
lots of parades when I was a kid.

220
0:09:52.685,000 --> 0:09:53,000
There were parades on Veteran's Day --

221
0:09:54.621,000 --> 0:09:55,000
there wasn't a President's Day.

222
0:09:56.213,000 --> 0:09:57,000
There was Abraham Lincoln's birthday,

223
0:09:58.15,000 --> 0:10:,000
George Washington's birthday

224
0:10:00.278,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and Flag Day ...

225
0:10:03.821,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And lots of little parades.

226
0:10:05.604,000 --> 0:10:06,000
My grandfather used to take me

227
0:10:07.057,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and we'd stand on the street corner,

228
0:10:08.807,000 --> 0:10:09,000
he'd hold my hand,

229
0:10:10.167,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and I'd look up and I'd see a tear running down his eye.

230
0:10:15.91,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And he meant a great deal to me.

231
0:10:18.298,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And he used to write presidents of the United States.

232
0:10:23.68,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Every letter started,

233
0:10:25.324,000 --> 0:10:28,000
"My dearest, darling Mr. President,"

234
0:10:28.427,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and he'd tell him something wonderful about what he did.

235
0:10:33.069,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But when he disagreed with the President, he also wrote,

236
0:10:36.025,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"My dearest, darling Mr. President,

237
0:10:37.716,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Didn't I tell you last week ...?"

238
0:10:39.534,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

239
0:10:41.559,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And I would run down the stairs every now and then

240
0:10:46.763,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and pick up the mail.

241
0:10:48.019,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We were three flights up,

242
0:10:49.262,000 --> 0:10:51,000
74 York Street, New Haven, Connecticut.

243
0:10:52.945,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And I'd pick up a little white envelope reading, "Shya C. called at this address."

244
0:11:02.734,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And that's the story I have told about my grandfather --

245
0:11:07.294,000 --> 0:11:09,000
EH: They wrote him back on the envelopes --

246
0:11:09.339,000 --> 0:11:1,000
NL: They wrote back.

247
0:11:12.862,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But I have shown them myself,

248
0:11:17.292,000 --> 0:11:22,000
going way back to Phil Donahue and others before him,

249
0:11:22.434,000 --> 0:11:26,000
literally dozens of interviews in which I told that story.

250
0:11:28.283,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This will be the second time I have said the whole story was a lie.

251
0:11:36.151,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The truth was my grandfather took me to parades,

252
0:11:40.367,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we had lots of those.

253
0:11:42.094,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The truth is a tear came down his eye.

254
0:11:45.34,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The truth is he would write an occasional letter,

255
0:11:49.071,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and I did pick up those little envelopes.

256
0:11:52.536,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But "My dearest darling Mr. President,"

257
0:11:55.972,000 --> 0:11:57,000
all the rest of it,

258
0:11:58.458,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is a story I borrowed from a good friend

259
0:12:02.998,000 --> 0:12:07,000
whose grandfather was that grandfather who wrote those letters.

260
0:12:10.506,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And, I mean, I stole Arthur Marshall's grandfather

261
0:12:16.975,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and made him my own.

262
0:12:20.997,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Always.

263
0:12:22.171,000 --> 0:12:24,000
When I started to write my memoir --

264
0:12:24.809,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"Even this --"

265
0:12:26.285,000 --> 0:12:27,000
How about that?

266
0:12:27.474,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"Even This I Get to Experience."

267
0:12:30.848,000 --> 0:12:31,000
When I started to write the memoir

268
0:12:32.623,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and I started to think about it,

269
0:12:34.206,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and then I --

270
0:12:36.275,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I --

271
0:12:38.529,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I did a reasonable amount of crying,

272
0:12:42.355,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and I realized how much I needed the father.

273
0:12:47.139,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So much so that I appropriated Arthur Marshall's grandfather.

274
0:12:51.575,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So much so, the word "father" --

275
0:12:54.573,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I have six kids by the way.

276
0:12:57.273,000 --> 0:12:58,000
My favorite role in life.

277
0:13:01.482,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It and husband to my wife Lyn.

278
0:13:07.972,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But I stole the man's identity because I needed the father.

279
0:13:13.243,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Now I've gone through a whole lot of shit

280
0:13:16.95,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and come out on the other side,

281
0:13:18.981,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and I forgive my father --

282
0:13:20.592,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the best thing I --

283
0:13:21.826,000 --> 0:13:22,000
the worst thing I --

284
0:13:23.711,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The word I'd like to use about him and think about him is --

285
0:13:26.819,000 --> 0:13:27,000
he was a rascal.

286
0:13:29.02,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The fact that he lied and stole and cheated

287
0:13:33.957,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and went to prison ...

288
0:13:37.349,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I submerge that in the word "rascal."

289
0:13:41.809,000 --> 0:13:47,000
EH: Well there's a saying that amateurs borrow and professionals steal.

290
0:13:48.366,000 --> 0:13:49,000
NL: I'm a pro.

291
0:13:49.615,000 --> 0:13:5,000
EH: You're a pro.

292
0:13:50.79,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

293
0:13:52.13,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And that quote is widely attributed to John Lennon,

294
0:13:55.301,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but it turns out he stole it from T.S. Eliot.

295
0:13:57.515,000 --> 0:13:58,000
So you're in good company.

296
0:13:58.928,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

297
0:14:02.602,000 --> 0:14:04,000
EH: I want to talk about your work.

298
0:14:04.951,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Obviously the impact of your work has been written about

299
0:14:07.681,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and I'm sure you've heard about it all your life:

300
0:14:10.071,000 --> 0:14:11,000
what it meant to people,

301
0:14:11.246,000 --> 0:14:12,000
what it meant to our culture,

302
0:14:12.7,000 --> 0:14:15,000
you heard the applause when I just named the names of the shows,

303
0:14:15.725,000 --> 0:14:18,000
you raised half the people in the room through your work.

304
0:14:19.177,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But have there ever been any stories about the impact of your work

305
0:14:22.736,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that surprised you?

306
0:14:24.74,000 --> 0:14:25,000
NL: Oh, god --

307
0:14:26.387,000 --> 0:14:3,000
surprised me and delighted me from head to toe.

308
0:14:33.437,000 --> 0:14:38,000
There was "An Evening with Norman Lear" within the last year

309
0:14:38.954,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that a group of hip-hop impresarios,

310
0:14:42.482,000 --> 0:14:45,000
performers and the Academy put together.

311
0:14:47.902,000 --> 0:14:48,000
The subtext of "An Evening with ..."

312
0:14:49.83,000 --> 0:14:53,000
was: What do a 92-year-old Jew --

313
0:14:53.943,000 --> 0:14:54,000
then 92 --

314
0:14:55.118,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and the world of hip-hop have in common?

315
0:14:57.155,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Russell Simmons was among seven on the stage.

316
0:15:00.783,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And when he talked about the shows,

317
0:15:05.128,000 --> 0:15:09,000
he wasn't talking about the Hollywood,

318
0:15:09.685,000 --> 0:15:12,000
George Jefferson in "The Jeffersons,"

319
0:15:13.433,000 --> 0:15:15,000
or the show that was a number five show.

320
0:15:16.847,000 --> 0:15:21,000
He was talking about a simple thing that made a big --

321
0:15:25.324,000 --> 0:15:26,000
EH: Impact on him?

322
0:15:26.549,000 --> 0:15:27,000
NL: An impact on him --

323
0:15:28.511,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I was hesitating over the word, "change."

324
0:15:31.43,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It's hard for me to imagine,

325
0:15:34.017,000 --> 0:15:35,000
you know, changing somebody's life,

326
0:15:35.869,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but that's the way he put it.

327
0:15:37.678,000 --> 0:15:43,000
He saw George Jefferson write a check on "The Jeffersons,"

328
0:15:43.791,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and he never knew that a black man could write a check.

329
0:15:48.788,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And he says it just impacted his life so --

330
0:15:53.765,000 --> 0:15:54,000
it changed his life.

331
0:15:55.474,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And when I hear things like that --

332
0:15:58.972,000 --> 0:15:59,000
little things --

333
0:16:00.671,000 --> 0:16:03,000
because I know that there isn't anybody in this audience

334
0:16:03.877,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that wasn't likely responsible today for some little thing they did for somebody,

335
0:16:10.404,000 --> 0:16:15,000
whether it's as little as a smile or an unexpected "Hello,"

336
0:16:15.77,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that's how little this thing was.

337
0:16:18.833,000 --> 0:16:22,000
It could have been the dresser of the set

338
0:16:23.128,000 --> 0:16:24,000
who put the checkbook on the thing,

339
0:16:24.838,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and George had nothing to do while he was speaking, so he wrote it,

340
0:16:28.551,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I don't know.

341
0:16:29.851,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But --

342
0:16:31.634,000 --> 0:16:33,000
EH: So in addition to the long list I shared in the beginning,

343
0:16:34.596,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I should have also mentioned that you invented hip-hop.

344
0:16:37.266,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Laughter)

345
0:16:38.391,000 --> 0:16:39,000
NL: Well ...

346
0:16:40.755,000 --> 0:16:41,000
EH: I want to talk about --

347
0:16:42.264,000 --> 0:16:43,000
NL: Well, then do it.

348
0:16:43.588,000 --> 0:16:47,000
(Laughter)

349
0:16:49.706,000 --> 0:16:51,000
EH: You've lead a life of accomplishment,

350
0:16:52.492,000 --> 0:16:53,000
but you've also built a life of meaning.

351
0:16:54.809,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And all of us strive to do both of those things --

352
0:16:57.405,000 --> 0:16:58,000
not all of us manage to.

353
0:16:59.984,000 --> 0:17:02,000
But even those of us who do manage to accomplish both of those,

354
0:17:03.779,000 --> 0:17:05,000
very rarely do we figure out how to do them together.

355
0:17:06.884,000 --> 0:17:1,000
You managed to push culture forward through your art

356
0:17:11.788,000 --> 0:17:14,000
while also achieving world-beating commercial success.

357
0:17:15.67,000 --> 0:17:16,000
How did you do both?

358
0:17:23.391,000 --> 0:17:28,000
NL: Here's where my mind goes when I hear that recitation of all I accomplished.

359
0:17:31.304,000 --> 0:17:35,000
This planet is one of a billion,

360
0:17:35.384,000 --> 0:17:36,000
they tell us,

361
0:17:36.875,000 --> 0:17:41,000
in a universe of which there are billions --

362
0:17:42.717,000 --> 0:17:43,000
billions of universes,

363
0:17:44.309,000 --> 0:17:47,000
billions of planets ...

364
0:17:47.94,000 --> 0:17:48,000
which we're trying to save

365
0:17:49.847,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and it requires saving.

366
0:17:53.549,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But ...

367
0:17:55.699,000 --> 0:17:58,000
anything I may have accomplished is --

368
0:17:59.77,000 --> 0:18:03,000
my sister once asked me what she does about something

369
0:18:03.833,000 --> 0:18:05,000
that was going on in Newington, Connecticut.

370
0:18:06.799,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And I said, "Write your alderman or your mayor or something."

371
0:18:09.748,000 --> 0:18:12,000
She said, "Well I'm not Norman Lear, I'm Claire Lear."

372
0:18:13.819,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And that was the first time I said what I'm saying,

373
0:18:18.359,000 --> 0:18:22,000
I said, "Claire. With everything you think about what I may have done

374
0:18:22.722,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and everything you've done," --

375
0:18:24.223,000 --> 0:18:26,000
she never left Newington --

376
0:18:26.59,000 --> 0:18:27,000
"can you get your fingers close enough

377
0:18:28.424,000 --> 0:18:31,000
when you consider the size of the planet and so forth,

378
0:18:32.365,000 --> 0:18:35,000
to measure anything I may have done to anything you may have done?"

379
0:18:36.15,000 --> 0:18:37,000
So ...

380
0:18:38.486,000 --> 0:18:41,000
I am convinced we're all responsible

381
0:18:42.098,000 --> 0:18:45,000
for doing as much as I may have accomplished.

382
0:18:47.269,000 --> 0:18:48,000
And I understand what you're saying --

383
0:18:49.183,000 --> 0:18:5,000
EH: It's an articulate deflection --

384
0:18:50.922,000 --> 0:18:53,000
NL: But you have to really buy into the size and scope

385
0:18:54.904,000 --> 0:18:55,000
of the creator's enterprise, here.

386
0:18:56.882,000 --> 0:18:58,000
EH: But here on this planet you have really mattered.

387
0:18:59.49,000 --> 0:19:,000
NL: I'm a son of a gun.

388
0:19:00.981,000 --> 0:19:01,000
(Laughter)

389
0:19:02.526,000 --> 0:19:05,000
EH: So I have one more question for you.

390
0:19:06.348,000 --> 0:19:07,000
How old do you feel?

391
0:19:09.411,000 --> 0:19:13,000
NL: I am the peer of whoever I'm talking to.

392
0:19:14.704,000 --> 0:19:15,000
EH: Well, I feel 93.

393
0:19:16.1,000 --> 0:19:22,000
(Applause)

394
0:19:22.684,000 --> 0:19:23,000
NL: We out of here?

395
0:19:24.018,000 --> 0:19:25,000
EH: Well, I feel 93 years old,

396
0:19:25.926,000 --> 0:19:28,000
but I hope to one day feel as young as the person I'm sitting across from.

397
0:19:29.739,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

398
0:19:30.913,000 --> 0:19:31,000
the incomparable Norman Lear.

399
0:19:32.361,000 --> 0:19:37,000
(Applause)

400
0:19:38.049,000 --> 0:19:39,000
NL: Thank you.

401
0:19:39.224,000 --> 0:19:44,000
(Applause)

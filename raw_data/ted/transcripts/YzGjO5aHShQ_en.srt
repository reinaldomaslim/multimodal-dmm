Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.392,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm almost like a crazy evangelical.

3
0:00:14.586,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've always known that the age of design is upon us,

4
0:00:17.331,000 --> 0:00:19,000
almost like a rapture.

5
0:00:19.412,000 --> 0:00:2,000
If the day is sunny, I think,

6
0:00:20.947,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"Oh, the gods have had a good design day."

7
0:00:23.472,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Or, I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist,

8
0:00:27.788,000 --> 0:00:28,000
particularly beautiful, I say

9
0:00:29.09,000 --> 0:00:32,000
he's so good because he clearly looked to design

10
0:00:32.09,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to understand what he needed to do.

11
0:00:33.813,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I really do believe that design

12
0:00:36.514,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is the highest form of creative expression.

13
0:00:39.276,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design,

14
0:00:42.986,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the age of design is the age in which design

15
0:00:45.181,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is still cute furniture, is still posters,

16
0:00:49.02,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is still fast cars, what you see at MoMA today.

17
0:00:51.878,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But in truth, what I really would like to explain

18
0:00:55.703,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that

19
0:00:58.005,000 --> 0:01:,000
the most interesting chairs are the ones

20
0:01:00.668,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that are actually made by a robot,

21
0:01:03.545,000 --> 0:01:05,000
like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij,

22
0:01:06.326,000 --> 0:01:09,000
where a robot deposits a toothpaste-like slur

23
0:01:10.058,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of recycled refrigerator parts,

24
0:01:12.914,000 --> 0:01:16,000
as if he were a big candy, and makes a chair out of it.

25
0:01:17.382,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time

26
0:01:21.017,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and that become part of our identity.

27
0:01:23.146,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I want people to understand

28
0:01:24.866,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that design is so much more than cute chairs,

29
0:01:28.081,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that it is first and foremost everything that is around us

30
0:01:31.548,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in our life.

31
0:01:33.137,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about

32
0:01:35.97,000 --> 0:01:38,000
tonight is not simply design but interaction design.

33
0:01:39.146,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And in fact, interaction design is what I've been trying

34
0:01:43.023,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art

35
0:01:45.401,000 --> 0:01:47,000
for a few years, starting not very timidly

36
0:01:48.365,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but just pointedly with works, for instance,

37
0:01:51.139,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by Martin Wattenberg -- the way a machine

38
0:01:53.7,000 --> 0:01:55,000
plays chess with itself, that you see here,

39
0:01:56.644,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners, the Sugar interface

40
0:02:00.108,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for One Laptop Per Child,

41
0:02:02.218,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Toshio Iwai's Tenori-On musical instruments,

42
0:02:06.072,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters,

43
0:02:09.284,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and John Maeda's Reactive Books,

44
0:02:11.74,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me.

45
0:02:15.905,000 --> 0:02:17,000
These were some of the first acquisitions that really

46
0:02:18.596,000 --> 0:02:21,000
introduced the idea of interaction design to the public.

47
0:02:21.78,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But more recently, I've been trying really to go even deeper

48
0:02:26.019,000 --> 0:02:28,000
into interaction design with examples

49
0:02:28.252,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that are emotionally really suggestive

50
0:02:30.995,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and that really explain interaction design at a level

51
0:02:33.7,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that is almost undeniable.

52
0:02:35.771,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The Wind Map, by Wattenberg and Fernanda Viégas,

53
0:02:38.851,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I don't know if you've ever seen it -- it's really fantastic.

54
0:02:41.267,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It looks at the territory of the United States

55
0:02:43.789,000 --> 0:02:48,000
as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds

56
0:02:49.514,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and that is really giving you a pictorial image

57
0:02:52.687,000 --> 0:02:55,000
of what's going on with the winds in the United States.

58
0:02:55.911,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But also, more recently, we started acquiring video games,

59
0:03:00.53,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and that's where all hell broke loose

60
0:03:03.073,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in a really interesting way. (Laughter)

61
0:03:05.241,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low.

62
0:03:07.921,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And that's really what I find so intriguing

63
0:03:10.895,000 --> 0:03:14,000
about the reactions that we've had to the anointment

64
0:03:15.444,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of video games in the MoMA collection.

65
0:03:17.68,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We've -- No, first of all, New York Magazine always gets it.

66
0:03:20.967,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I love them. So we are in the right quadrant.

67
0:03:23.112,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We are in the Highbrow -- that's daring, that's courageous --

68
0:03:27.346,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and Brilliant, which is great.

69
0:03:28.769,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Timidly, we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations,

70
0:03:32.105,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good. (Laughter)

71
0:03:35.472,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But here comes the art critic. Oh, that was fantastic.

72
0:03:38.6,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.

73
0:03:40.816,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Sorry, MoMA, video games are not art."

74
0:03:43.484,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Did I ever say they were art? I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.

75
0:03:47.769,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Exhibiting Pac-Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh" --

76
0:03:51.576,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They're two floors away. (Laughter) —

77
0:03:54.736,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"will mean game over for any real understanding of art."

78
0:03:59.404,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know?

79
0:04:03.379,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We were talking about the rapture? It's coming.

80
0:04:05.216,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And Jonathan Jones is making it happen.

81
0:04:07.953,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So the same Guardian rebuts,

82
0:04:10.727,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Are video games art: the debate that shouldn't be.

83
0:04:13.466,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Last week, Guardian art critic blah blah suggested

84
0:04:16.055,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right?

85
0:04:19.369,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And does it matter?" Thank you. Does it matter?

86
0:04:21.844,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You know, it's like once again there's this whole problem

87
0:04:24.585,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of design being often misunderstood for art,

88
0:04:27.537,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to

89
0:04:31.404,000 --> 0:04:34,000
aspire to, would like to be called, artists.

90
0:04:34.729,000 --> 0:04:37,000
No. Designers aspire to be really great designers.

91
0:04:38.041,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Thank you very much. And that's more than enough.

92
0:04:39.954,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So my knight in shining armor, John Maeda,

93
0:04:43.441,000 --> 0:04:46,000
without any prompt, came out with this big declaration

94
0:04:46.943,000 --> 0:04:48,000
on why video games belong in the MoMA.

95
0:04:49.313,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it.

96
0:04:51.473,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article

97
0:04:55.129,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that came out in The New Republic, so pretentious,

98
0:04:58.177,000 --> 0:05:01,000
by Liel Leibovitz, and it said, "MoMA has mistaken video games for art." Again.

99
0:05:02.137,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"The museum is putting Pac-Man alongside Picasso." Again.

100
0:05:05.557,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"That misses the point."

101
0:05:06.676,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Excuse me. You're missing the point.

102
0:05:08.534,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And here, look, the above question is put bluntly:

103
0:05:12.582,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"Are video games art? No. Video games aren't art

104
0:05:15.932,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because they are quite thoroughly something else: code."

105
0:05:20.453,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Oh, so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right?

106
0:05:24.004,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So it's so fantastic to see

107
0:05:26.234,000 --> 0:05:29,000
how these feathers that were ruffled,

108
0:05:29.43,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and these reactions, were so vehement.

109
0:05:31.496,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And you know what?

110
0:05:32.555,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The International Cat Video Film Festival

111
0:05:35.072,000 --> 0:05:37,000
didn't have that much of a reaction. (Laughter)

112
0:05:37.505,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I think this was truly fantastic.

113
0:05:39.244,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We were talking about dancing ponies, but I was really jealous

114
0:05:42.219,000 --> 0:05:45,000
of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival,

115
0:05:45.535,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because it's very, very wonderful.

116
0:05:47.919,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And there's this Flaubert quote that I love:

117
0:05:50.859,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"I have always tried to live in an ivory tower,

118
0:05:52.804,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but a tide of shit is beating at its walls,

119
0:05:55.164,000 --> 0:05:56,000
threatening to undermine it."

120
0:05:57.11,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I consider myself the tide of shit.

121
0:05:59.255,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

122
0:06:04.899,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You know, we have to go through that.

123
0:06:06.589,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Even in the 1930s, my colleagues

124
0:06:09.365,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that were trying to put together an abstract art show

125
0:06:11.89,000 --> 0:06:13,000
had all of these works stopped by the customs officers

126
0:06:14.887,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that decided they were not art.

127
0:06:16.891,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So it's happened before, and it will happen in the future,

128
0:06:19.459,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but right now I can tell you that I am so, so proud

129
0:06:23.739,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to be able to call Pac-Man part of the MoMA collection.

130
0:06:27.963,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And the same with, for instance, Tetris, original version, the Soviet one.

131
0:06:33.356,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And you know, the amount of work --

132
0:06:35.882,000 --> 0:06:38,000
yeah, Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government

133
0:06:39.471,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and that's how he developed Tetris,

134
0:06:41.325,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game

135
0:06:45.211,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube

136
0:06:48.949,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that makes it look slightly bombed.

137
0:06:52.46,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And it's fantastic.

138
0:06:53.964,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work,

139
0:06:57.128,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because we're still the Museum of Modern Art,

140
0:06:58.531,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so even when we tackle popular culture,

141
0:07:00.238,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we tackle it as a form of interaction design

142
0:07:03.367,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA,

143
0:07:05.517,000 --> 0:07:07,000
therefore, has to be researched.

144
0:07:07.581,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's

145
0:07:10.531,000 --> 0:07:12,000
wonderful Another World, amongst others,

146
0:07:13.179,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we put together a panel of experts,

147
0:07:14.859,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and we worked on this acquisition,

148
0:07:16.369,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway.

149
0:07:19.876,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We worked on it for a year and a half.

150
0:07:22.125,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So many people helped us — designers of games,

151
0:07:25.098,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you might know Jamin Warren

152
0:07:27.268,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine,

153
0:07:29.756,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and you know, Kevin Slavin. You name it.

154
0:07:31.488,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We bugged everybody, because we knew that we were ignorant.

155
0:07:34.752,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We were not real gamers enough,

156
0:07:36.898,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so we had to really talk to them.

157
0:07:38.954,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And so we decided, of course, to have Sim City 2000,

158
0:07:42.515,000 --> 0:07:44,000
not the other Sim City, that one in particular,

159
0:07:45.443,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so the criteria that we developed along the way

160
0:07:48.442,000 --> 0:07:51,000
were really strong, and were not only criteria of selection.

161
0:07:51.691,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation.

162
0:07:55.875,000 --> 0:07:58,000
That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game

163
0:07:59.178,000 --> 0:08:02,000
or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve

164
0:08:03.069,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and show artifacts that will more and more

165
0:08:05.884,000 --> 0:08:06,000
become part of our lives in the future.

166
0:08:07.847,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We live today, as you know very well, not in the digital,

167
0:08:10.899,000 --> 0:08:13,000
not in the physical, but in the kind of minestrone

168
0:08:14.115,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that our mind makes of the two.

169
0:08:16.155,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And that's really where interaction lies,

170
0:08:19.284,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and that's the importance of interaction.

171
0:08:21.539,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And in order to explain interaction, we need to really

172
0:08:24.683,000 --> 0:08:26,000
bring people in and make them realize

173
0:08:27.324,000 --> 0:08:28,000
how interaction is part of their lives.

174
0:08:29.03,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So when I talk about it, I don't talk only about video games,

175
0:08:31.859,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which are in a way the purest form of interaction,

176
0:08:34.372,000 --> 0:08:37,000
unadulterated by any kind of function or finality.

177
0:08:37.844,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine,

178
0:08:40.991,000 --> 0:08:42,000
which I consider a masterpiece of interaction.

179
0:08:43.117,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I mean, that interface is beautiful.

180
0:08:45.428,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel.

181
0:08:49.005,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You know, with your mitt you can actually paw

182
0:08:52.564,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the MetroCard, and I talk about how bad

183
0:08:55.833,000 --> 0:08:58,000
ATM machines usually are.

184
0:08:58.894,000 --> 0:09:,000
So I let people understand that it's up to them

185
0:09:01.723,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to know how to judge interaction

186
0:09:03.965,000 --> 0:09:05,000
so as to know when it's good or when it's bad.

187
0:09:05.992,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So when I show The Sims,

188
0:09:07.645,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I try to make people really feel what it meant

189
0:09:11.122,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to have an interaction with The Sims,

190
0:09:13.021,000 --> 0:09:15,000
not only the fun but also the responsibility

191
0:09:15.378,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that came with the Tamagotchi.

192
0:09:17.253,000 --> 0:09:18,000
You know, video games can be truly deep

193
0:09:19.133,000 --> 0:09:2,000
even when they're completely mindless.

194
0:09:20.877,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy.

195
0:09:23.405,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can

196
0:09:27.126,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in a finite amount of time

197
0:09:28.957,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet.

198
0:09:31.32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I've never made it into a planet, but that's it.

199
0:09:33.565,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Or, you know, Vib-Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States.

200
0:09:36.733,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It was a PlayStation game, but mostly for Japan.

201
0:09:38.925,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And it was one of the first video games

202
0:09:40.594,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in which you could choose your own music.

203
0:09:42.295,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So you would put into the PlayStation,

204
0:09:44.617,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you would put your own CD,

205
0:09:46.422,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic.

206
0:09:51.184,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Not to mention Eve Online.

207
0:09:52.595,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Eve Online is an artificial universe, if you wish,

208
0:09:55.676,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi,

209
0:09:58.229,000 --> 0:10:,000
not Ambassador Stevens, but one of his collaborators,

210
0:10:00.837,000 --> 0:10:01,000
was a really big shot in Eve Online,

211
0:10:02.705,000 --> 0:10:04,000
so here you have a diplomat in the real world

212
0:10:05.325,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that spends his time in Eve Online

213
0:10:07.813,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to kind of test, maybe, all of his ideas about diplomacy

214
0:10:11.982,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and about universe-building, and to the point that

215
0:10:14.939,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the first announcement of the bombing

216
0:10:16.949,000 --> 0:10:18,000
was actually given on Eve Online,

217
0:10:19.365,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and after his death, several parts of the universe

218
0:10:21.749,000 --> 0:10:22,000
were named after him.

219
0:10:23.209,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival

220
0:10:27.043,000 --> 0:10:29,000
in Reykjavík that was quite amazing.

221
0:10:29.181,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I mean, we're talking about an experience

222
0:10:31.733,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that of course can seem weird to many,

223
0:10:34.525,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but that is very educational.

224
0:10:36.423,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Of course, there are games that are even more educational.

225
0:10:39.296,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail

226
0:10:41.988,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of this kind of massive multiplayer online game,

227
0:10:44.377,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjavík,

228
0:10:46.923,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and they were greeted

229
0:10:49.557,000 --> 0:10:52,000
by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans.

230
0:10:52.765,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game.

231
0:10:55.357,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So you start seeing here that

232
0:10:57.901,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the aesthetics that are so important

233
0:10:59.661,000 --> 0:11:,000
to a museum collection like MoMA's

234
0:11:01.504,000 --> 0:11:04,000
are kept alive also by the selection of these games.

235
0:11:05.165,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And you know, Valve -- you know, Portal --

236
0:11:07.125,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is an example of a video game in which

237
0:11:09.248,000 --> 0:11:11,000
you have a certain type of violence

238
0:11:11.562,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which also leads me to talk about

239
0:11:13.661,000 --> 0:11:15,000
one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss

240
0:11:16.007,000 --> 0:11:18,000
when we acquired the video games, what to do with violence.

241
0:11:18.267,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Right? We had to make decisions.

242
0:11:20.671,000 --> 0:11:23,000
At MoMA, interestingly, there's a lot of violence

243
0:11:24.229,000 --> 0:11:26,000
depicted in the art part of the collection,

244
0:11:27.133,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but when I came to MoMA 19 years ago, and as an Italian,

245
0:11:30.349,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I said, "You know what, we need a Beretta."

246
0:11:31.9,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I was told, "No. No guns in the design collection."

247
0:11:35.013,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And I was like, "Why?"

248
0:11:35.945,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Interestingly, I learned that it's considered

249
0:11:39.461,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that in design and in the design collection,

250
0:11:41.211,000 --> 0:11:42,000
what you see is what you get.

251
0:11:42.448,000 --> 0:11:45,000
So when you see a gun, it's an instrument for killing in the design collection.

252
0:11:46.338,000 --> 0:11:47,000
If it's in the art collection,

253
0:11:47.951,000 --> 0:11:5,000
it might be a critique of the killing instrument.

254
0:11:51.695,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So it's very interesting.

255
0:11:53.401,000 --> 0:11:55,000
But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design,

256
0:11:56.04,000 --> 0:11:58,000
so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns.

257
0:11:58.531,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But here, in this particular case, we decided,

258
0:12:01.795,000 --> 0:12:02,000
you know, with Kate and Paul,

259
0:12:03.078,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that we would have no gratuitous violence.

260
0:12:05.337,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So we have Portal because you shoot walls

261
0:12:08.089,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in order to create new spaces.

262
0:12:09.409,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We have Street Fighter II, because martial arts are good.

263
0:12:12.514,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter)

264
0:12:14.03,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But we don't have GTA because,

265
0:12:18.132,000 --> 0:12:19,000
maybe it's my own reflection,

266
0:12:19.739,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars

267
0:12:22.122,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and shooting prostitutes and pimps.

268
0:12:24.082,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So it was not very constructive. (Laughter)

269
0:12:27.623,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So, I'm making fun of it, but we discussed this

270
0:12:31.869,000 --> 0:12:34,000
for so many days. You have no idea.

271
0:12:34.956,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And to this day, I am ambivalent,

272
0:12:37.283,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but when you have instead games like Flow, there's no doubt.

273
0:12:40.699,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's like, it's about serenity and it's about sublime.

274
0:12:43.899,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature.

275
0:12:48.185,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Then we have a few also side-scrollers -- classical ones.

276
0:12:52.01,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So it's quite a hefty collection.

277
0:12:53.844,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And right now, we started with the first 14,

278
0:12:56.102,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but we have several that are coming up,

279
0:12:57.995,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet

280
0:12:59.907,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is because you don't acquire just the game.

281
0:13:02.335,000 --> 0:13:04,000
You acquire the relationship with the company.

282
0:13:04.409,000 --> 0:13:07,000
What we want, what we aspire to, is the code.

283
0:13:07.507,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It's very hard to get, of course.

284
0:13:08.904,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But that's what would enable us to preserve

285
0:13:10.777,000 --> 0:13:11,000
the video games for a really long time,

286
0:13:12.766,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and that's what museums do.

287
0:13:14.039,000 --> 0:13:16,000
They also preserve artifacts for posterity.

288
0:13:16.64,000 --> 0:13:18,000
In absence of the code, because, you know,

289
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases,

290
0:13:23.027,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in absence of that, we acquire the relationship with the company.

291
0:13:26.523,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We're going to stay with them forever.

292
0:13:27.803,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They're not going to get rid of us.

293
0:13:29.036,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And one day, we'll get that code. (Laughter)

294
0:13:32.507,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose

295
0:13:35.675,000 --> 0:13:38,000
for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important.

296
0:13:38.697,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And I'm showing you Core War here,

297
0:13:40.738,000 --> 0:13:43,000
which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically

298
0:13:44.053,000 --> 0:13:45,000
of the limitations of the processor.

299
0:13:45.874,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So the kind of interferences that you see here

300
0:13:49.123,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that look like beautiful barriers in the game

301
0:13:51.767,000 --> 0:13:55,000
are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness,

302
0:13:56.114,000 --> 0:13:59,000
which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important.

303
0:13:59.194,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And so is space, the spatial aspect of games.

304
0:14:03.198,000 --> 0:14:05,000
You know, I feel that the best video games

305
0:14:05.342,000 --> 0:14:08,000
are the ones that have really savvy architects

306
0:14:08.878,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that are behind them, and if they're not architects,

307
0:14:11.501,000 --> 0:14:13,000
bona fide trained in architecture, they have that feeling.

308
0:14:14.139,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important.

309
0:14:18.227,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Time. The way we experience time in video games,

310
0:14:21.187,000 --> 0:14:23,000
as in other forms of interaction design,

311
0:14:23.969,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is really quite amazing.

312
0:14:25.228,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It can be real time or it can be the time within the game,

313
0:14:28.233,000 --> 0:14:3,000
as is in Animal Crossing, where seasons

314
0:14:30.449,000 --> 0:14:32,000
follow each other at their own pace.

315
0:14:33.041,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So time, space, aesthetics,

316
0:14:36.32,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and then, most important, behavior.

317
0:14:38.689,000 --> 0:14:42,000
The real core issue of interaction design is behavior.

318
0:14:42.809,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors

319
0:14:46.286,000 --> 0:14:48,000
that go to influence the rest of our lives.

320
0:14:48.601,000 --> 0:14:5,000
They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen.

321
0:14:51.136,000 --> 0:14:53,000
In this case, I'm showing you Marble Madness,

322
0:14:53.185,000 --> 0:14:54,000
which is a beautiful game

323
0:14:54.386,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you,

324
0:14:57.657,000 --> 0:14:59,000
so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape,

325
0:15:00.09,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and the sphere, the controller itself, gives you a sense of the movement.

326
0:15:04.622,000 --> 0:15:06,000
In a way, you can see how video games

327
0:15:06.977,000 --> 0:15:08,000
are the purest aspect of interaction design

328
0:15:09.689,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and are very useful to explain what interaction is.

329
0:15:14.308,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We don't want to show the video games

330
0:15:16.393,000 --> 0:15:18,000
with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia.

331
0:15:19.335,000 --> 0:15:2,000
If anything, we want to show the code,

332
0:15:21.017,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac-Man,

333
0:15:24.031,000 --> 0:15:25,000
of the Pac-Man code.

334
0:15:25.52,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So the way we acquired the games is very interesting

335
0:15:29.859,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and very unorthodox. You see them here

336
0:15:32.055,000 --> 0:15:36,000
displayed alongside other examples of design,

337
0:15:36.063,000 --> 0:15:37,000
furniture and other parts,

338
0:15:37.673,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but there's no paraphernalia, no nostalagia,

339
0:15:40.901,000 --> 0:15:42,000
only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers.

340
0:15:43.85,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The controllers are, of course, part of the experience,

341
0:15:45.994,000 --> 0:15:47,000
so you cannot do away with it.

342
0:15:48.443,000 --> 0:15:52,000
But interestingly, this choice was not condemned

343
0:15:52.941,000 --> 0:15:53,000
too vehemently by gamers.

344
0:15:54.286,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I was afraid that they would kill us,

345
0:15:55.593,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and instead they understood, especially

346
0:15:57.659,000 --> 0:15:59,000
when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem

347
0:16:00.363,000 --> 0:16:03,000
that Philip Johnson applied in 1934

348
0:16:03.505,000 --> 0:16:05,000
when he wanted to make people understand

349
0:16:05.547,000 --> 0:16:07,000
the importance of design, and he took propeller blades

350
0:16:07.859,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and pieces of machinery and

351
0:16:10.139,000 --> 0:16:13,000
in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals

352
0:16:13.266,000 --> 0:16:16,000
against white walls, as if they were Brancusi sculptures.

353
0:16:16.483,000 --> 0:16:19,000
He created this strange distance, this shock,

354
0:16:20.211,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that made people realize how gorgeous formally,

355
0:16:23.869,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and also important functionally, design pieces were.

356
0:16:27.637,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I would like to do the same with video games.

357
0:16:29.891,000 --> 0:16:32,000
By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts

358
0:16:32.971,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and everything else that we might remember from our childhood,

359
0:16:35.579,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I want people to understand

360
0:16:40.15,000 --> 0:16:41,000
that those are important forms of design.

361
0:16:42.019,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And in a way, the video games, the fonts and everything else

362
0:16:45.197,000 --> 0:16:47,000
lead us to make people understand

363
0:16:47.881,000 --> 0:16:49,000
a wider meaning for design.

364
0:16:50.223,000 --> 0:16:52,000
One of my dream acquisitions,

365
0:16:52.276,000 --> 0:16:53,000
which has been on hold for a few years

366
0:16:54.191,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but now will come back on the front burner,

367
0:16:57.193,000 --> 0:16:58,000
is a 747.

368
0:16:58.625,000 --> 0:17:,000
I would like to acquire it, but without owning it.

369
0:17:01.563,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA.

370
0:17:04.874,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I want it to keep flying.

371
0:17:06.258,000 --> 0:17:09,000
So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement

372
0:17:09.798,000 --> 0:17:13,000
with an airline and keeps the Boeing 747 flying.

373
0:17:14.565,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And the same with the "@" sign that we acquired a few years ago.

374
0:17:17.683,000 --> 0:17:19,000
It was the first example of an acquisition of something

375
0:17:19.865,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that is in the public domain.

376
0:17:21.27,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And what I say to people, it's almost as if

377
0:17:23.03,000 --> 0:17:24,000
a butterfly were flying by

378
0:17:25.004,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and we captured the shadow on the wall,

379
0:17:28.153,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and just we're showing the shadow.

380
0:17:29.61,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So in a way, we're showing a manifestation

381
0:17:31.818,000 --> 0:17:33,000
of something that is truly important

382
0:17:34.331,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have.

383
0:17:37.962,000 --> 0:17:38,000
And it's too long to explain the acquisition,

384
0:17:39.898,000 --> 0:17:41,000
but if you want to go on the MoMA blog,

385
0:17:42.404,000 --> 0:17:44,000
there's a long post where I explain why

386
0:17:44.498,000 --> 0:17:46,000
it's such a great example of design.

387
0:17:46.786,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Along the way, I've had to burn a few chairs. You know?

388
0:17:50.147,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past.

389
0:17:54.466,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But I see that people are coming along,

390
0:17:57.282,000 --> 0:17:58,000
that the audiences, paradoxically,

391
0:17:59.032,000 --> 0:18:01,000
are much more responsive and much more understanding

392
0:18:01.858,000 --> 0:18:05,000
of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are.

393
0:18:05.916,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Design is truly everywhere,

394
0:18:07.443,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and design is as important as anything,

395
0:18:10.411,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and I'm so glad that, because of its diversity

396
0:18:12.871,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and because of its centrality to our lives,

397
0:18:15.186,000 --> 0:18:16,000
many more people are coming to it

398
0:18:16.914,000 --> 0:18:18,000
as a profession, as a passion,

399
0:18:19.003,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and as, very simply, part of their own culture.

400
0:18:21.977,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you very much.

401
0:18:23.12,000 --> 0:18:27,000
(Applause)

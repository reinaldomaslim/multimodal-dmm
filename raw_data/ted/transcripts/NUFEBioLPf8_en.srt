0:00:00.039,000 --> 0:00:01,000
[Citizens of the world]

2
0:00:02.035,000 --> 0:00:05,000
[We face a global crisis of unprecedented scale]

3
0:00:05.17,000 --> 0:00:07,000
[Please stand by for a message from ... ]

4
0:00:07.553,000 --> 0:00:1,000
[the Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres]

5
0:00:10.746,000 --> 0:00:14,000
The climate emergency is the defining crisis of our time.

6
0:00:14.913,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We are in a race against time, and we are losing.

7
0:00:18.294,000 --> 0:00:21,000
There is a growing tide of impatience, especially among young people,

8
0:00:22.033,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with global inaction.

9
0:00:23.785,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We need more ambition from all:

10
0:00:25.721,000 --> 0:00:29,000
governments, cities, businesses, investors and people everywhere.

11
0:00:30.319,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So I'm pleased you are launching TED Countdown.

12
0:00:33.66,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Your influence and ideas can help accelerate momentum

13
0:00:36.732,000 --> 0:00:38,000
for a carbon-neutral world by 2050.

14
0:00:39.836,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That is the only way to avert the worst impacts of global heating.

15
0:00:44.074,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We have the tools, the science and the resources.

16
0:00:47.526,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Let us now get into this race with political will and energy.

17
0:00:51.963,000 --> 0:00:54,000
To do anything less will be a betrayal of our entire human family

18
0:00:55.82,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and generations to come.

19
0:00:57.693,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Thank you.

20
0:00:59.487,000 --> 0:01:,000
Announcer: And now, please welcome

21
0:01:01.207,000 --> 0:01:03,000
one of the architects of the Paris Climate Agreement

22
0:01:03.69,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Christiana Figueres

23
0:01:04.873,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and the head of TED, Chris Anderson.

24
0:01:06.922,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Applause)

25
0:01:14.982,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Chris Anderson: Welcome, welcome.

26
0:01:17.54,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Something remarkable is going to happen in the next hour.

27
0:01:21.851,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The world's single most alarming challenge,

28
0:01:24.51,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which looks something like this ...

29
0:01:29.271,000 --> 0:01:3,000
is about to go head-to-head

30
0:01:30.841,000 --> 0:01:32,000
with some of the world's most amazing minds

31
0:01:33.546,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and courageous hearts,

32
0:01:35.419,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which look something like you.

33
0:01:38.434,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The extraordinary audience we have here in New York and around the world.

34
0:01:41.974,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Christiana, it's quite the crowd we get to hang out with this morning.

35
0:01:45.331,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Christiana Figueres: It sure is, no kidding.

36
0:01:47.411,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's a good thing that everyone is here together,

37
0:01:49.76,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because actually, this initiative that we're just about to launch

38
0:01:53.499,000 --> 0:01:55,000
needs everyone to participate.

39
0:01:56.173,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And here it is.

40
0:01:58.881,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Countdown.

41
0:02:00.358,000 --> 0:02:03,000
CA: Countdown is a global initiative to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

42
0:02:04.215,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's seeking bold solutions in five big areas,

43
0:02:07.358,000 --> 0:02:08,000
imagining what could be achieved

44
0:02:09.008,000 --> 0:02:13,000
if different groups broke out of their silos and acted together.

45
0:02:14.133,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Starting today, you can go to countdown.ted.com

46
0:02:18.068,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and sign up to join the Countdown.

47
0:02:21.163,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Early in 2020,

48
0:02:22.917,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we'll be sharing plans on how you can connect

49
0:02:25.052,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with others in your company, your city or your school

50
0:02:27.618,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to engage in this issue.

51
0:02:30.442,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It's all leading up to global gatherings

52
0:02:32.371,000 --> 0:02:34,000
on 10.10.2020.

53
0:02:35.18,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Everyone in the world is invited to participate.

54
0:02:38.244,000 --> 0:02:39,000
CF: And so that's why,

55
0:02:39.442,000 --> 0:02:42,000
although I've been part of many initiatives along the years,

56
0:02:42.975,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I'm really excited about this one.

57
0:02:44.927,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Because Countdown is an invitation to everyone, everyone,

58
0:02:49.425,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to play their part in saving our planet

59
0:02:51.852,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and creating an exciting future.

60
0:02:55.471,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Politicians and citizens,

61
0:02:57.879,000 --> 0:02:59,000
CEOs and their customers,

62
0:03:00.173,000 --> 0:03:02,000
their employees, their investors,

63
0:03:03.093,000 --> 0:03:05,000
old and young,

64
0:03:05.268,000 --> 0:03:06,000
north and south.

65
0:03:06.617,000 --> 0:03:08,000
CA: (Laughs) I see what you did there.

66
0:03:08.95,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:10.982,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But look, our goal is not to plunge in

68
0:03:13.806,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with something new that is competitive

69
0:03:15.695,000 --> 0:03:18,000
with the amazing initiatives already out there.

70
0:03:18.727,000 --> 0:03:19,000
No.

71
0:03:19.901,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's to identify the best solutions that have already been worked on,

72
0:03:24.72,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to cross-fertilize them, to amplify them

73
0:03:28.125,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and then activate them

74
0:03:29.966,000 --> 0:03:31,000
by bringing together these different groups.

75
0:03:33.49,000 --> 0:03:34,000
CF: And if that happens,

76
0:03:34.721,000 --> 0:03:37,000
we believe there is a way out of the climate crisis.

77
0:03:38.379,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's what we want to facilitate.

78
0:03:40.03,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But now, Chris, question:

79
0:03:42.815,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Why are you and TED interested in participating

80
0:03:46.529,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and actually activating the climate agenda,

81
0:03:49.737,000 --> 0:03:52,000
when I thought you were all about spreading ideas?

82
0:03:53.394,000 --> 0:03:57,000
CA: Well, indeed, that has been our focused mission for the last 15 years,

83
0:03:57.522,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Ideas Worth Spreading.

84
0:04:00.022,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But last summer,

85
0:04:01.292,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we concluded that the urgency of some issues,

86
0:04:04.474,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and especially climate,

87
0:04:06.038,000 --> 0:04:08,000
demanded that we try to do more than just spread ideas,

88
0:04:09.038,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that we actually try to activate them.

89
0:04:12.53,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now, we're just a relatively small nonprofit --

90
0:04:15.863,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that would not amount to anything if we fail to bring other people on board.

91
0:04:20.196,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But the amazing thing is that that has happened.

92
0:04:22.919,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Everyone we've spoken to about this has got excited about participating.

93
0:04:28.284,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And one of the key moments, frankly, was when you came on board, Christiana.

94
0:04:32.413,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I mean, you were key to the Paris Agreement.

95
0:04:36.564,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And the world was stunned at the consensus that emerged there.

96
0:04:39.929,000 --> 0:04:42,000
What was the key to creating that consensus?

97
0:04:43.036,000 --> 0:04:48,000
CF: I would say it was to really challenge and change people's assumption

98
0:04:48.227,000 --> 0:04:52,000
about what is possible if we set a shared intention

99
0:04:53.125,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and then collectively pursue it and achieve it.

100
0:04:57.736,000 --> 0:05:,000
So our mantra then, and continues to be:

101
0:05:01.641,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Impossible is not a fact,

102
0:05:04.752,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it's an attitude."

103
0:05:06.649,000 --> 0:05:07,000
In fact, only an attitude,

104
0:05:08.363,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and that is something we can change.

105
0:05:11.41,000 --> 0:05:14,000
CA: Well, that mantra, certainly, we're going to have to hold onto

106
0:05:14.65,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in the months ahead,

107
0:05:15.848,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because the scientific consensus is actually worsening.

108
0:05:19.989,000 --> 0:05:2,000
For a quick report from the front lines,

109
0:05:21.934,000 --> 0:05:23,000
here's the head of the thousands of scientists

110
0:05:24.397,000 --> 0:05:27,000
who make up the IPCC, Dr. Hoesung Lee.

111
0:05:29.795,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Video) Hoesung Lee: We recently released three special reports

112
0:05:33.47,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that show the damage and risks of past and future climate change.

113
0:05:38.376,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They also show that stabilizing climate

114
0:05:41.315,000 --> 0:05:44,000
would imply a drastic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions

115
0:05:44.546,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in the near term.

116
0:05:46.062,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Society will have to go through unprecedented changes

117
0:05:49.887,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to meet this goal.

118
0:05:51.442,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius

119
0:05:54.776,000 --> 0:05:57,000
will bring more extreme weather,

120
0:05:58.403,000 --> 0:05:59,000
rising sea levels

121
0:06:00.117,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and water shortages in some regions,

122
0:06:02.99,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and threats to food security and biodiversity.

123
0:06:06.386,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Higher temperature will bring more of these damages,

124
0:06:10.619,000 --> 0:06:12,000
threatening lives and livelihoods

125
0:06:13.214,000 --> 0:06:15,000
of millions of people all around the world.

126
0:06:16.952,000 --> 0:06:19,000
CA: We're lucky to have with us another world-leading scientist,

127
0:06:19.998,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Johan Rockström here.

128
0:06:21.649,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He was responsible for creating the Planetary Boundaries framework.

129
0:06:26.546,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Johan, how serious is our situation?

130
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Video) Johan Rockström: Last week, we released in "Nature"

131
0:06:34.116,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the 10-year update of the risk of crossing tipping points,

132
0:06:37.362,000 --> 0:06:39,000
irreversible tipping points, in the Earth system.

133
0:06:40.03,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We know 15 such tipping points,

134
0:06:42.745,000 --> 0:06:44,000
including the Greenland and West Antarctic ice shelf,

135
0:06:45.49,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the permafrost in the Siberian tundra, for example,

136
0:06:48.641,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and we today have observational evidence,

137
0:06:50.649,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I mean, empirical evidence,

138
0:06:52.013,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that nine of the 15 have woken up and are on the move.

139
0:06:56.391,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We haven't crossed the tipping point yet,

140
0:06:58.368,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the window is still open,

141
0:06:59.615,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but they are warning us that now is the time to truly move,

142
0:07:02.733,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because the moment we cross them,

143
0:07:04.574,000 --> 0:07:07,000
like, for example, approaching a tipping point in the Amazon rain forest,

144
0:07:08.414,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we would risk losing the battle,

145
0:07:10.905,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because the planet will be taking over its self-reinforced warming.

146
0:07:14.7,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So that is why this initiative is so incredibly important.

147
0:07:18.12,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Let's go.

148
0:07:19.342,000 --> 0:07:2,000
CA: Well said.

149
0:07:20.516,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Applause)

150
0:07:21.719,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So, both are very clear there that this agenda of cutting emissions

151
0:07:26.207,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is absolutely crucial.

152
0:07:28.076,000 --> 0:07:29,000
How has that been going?

153
0:07:29.3,000 --> 0:07:31,000
CF: Not very well, because despite what we know,

154
0:07:31.911,000 --> 0:07:33,000
despite everything that science has told us,

155
0:07:34.038,000 --> 0:07:35,000
despite everything that we have done,

156
0:07:35.829,000 --> 0:07:36,000
including adopting the Paris Agreement,

157
0:07:37.768,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we've actually been increasing greenhouse gases consistently

158
0:07:42.998,000 --> 0:07:43,000
over the past few decades,

159
0:07:44.475,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to the point where we're now at 55 gigatons

160
0:07:47.784,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of carbon dioxide equivalent

161
0:07:49.49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that we are collectively, as humanity, emitting every year.

162
0:07:54.725,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And as we have heard, we have one path,

163
0:07:58.493,000 --> 0:08:,000
there is one path that we have to follow, and that is:

164
0:08:01.415,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Start now to decrease emissions,

165
0:08:03.97,000 --> 0:08:04,000
instead of going up, go down --

166
0:08:05.602,000 --> 0:08:07,000
reverse the trend, bend the curve.

167
0:08:08.601,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Reduce emissions, starting in 2020,

168
0:08:11.022,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to the point where we will be at one half the current level of emissions by 2030,

169
0:08:16.768,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and then continue decreasing them, until we are at net zero by 2050.

170
0:08:22.467,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It's the only path that we can accept.

171
0:08:24.903,000 --> 0:08:27,000
CA: How do you even begin to start tackling a goal as daunting as that?

172
0:08:29.157,000 --> 0:08:33,000
CF: Well, we could starting by breaking

173
0:08:33.355,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the simple, yet daunting, challenge

174
0:08:36.522,000 --> 0:08:38,000
into its constituent pieces,

175
0:08:38.792,000 --> 0:08:39,000
five main areas.

176
0:08:42.066,000 --> 0:08:47,000
CA: And so these five together are actually all huge,

177
0:08:47.185,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and if we can find compelling solutions in each of them,

178
0:08:50.47,000 --> 0:08:53,000
they would actually add up to an action plan

179
0:08:54.064,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that matches the scale of the problem.

180
0:08:57.365,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Well, here are the five.

181
0:09:01.111,000 --> 0:09:02,000
CF: Power.

182
0:09:02.934,000 --> 0:09:06,000
How rapidly can we move to 100 percent clean energy?

183
0:09:08.007,000 --> 0:09:09,000
CA: The built environment.

184
0:09:09.484,000 --> 0:09:13,000
How can we re-engineer the stuff that surrounds us?

185
0:09:14.793,000 --> 0:09:15,000
CF: Transport.

186
0:09:16.252,000 --> 0:09:21,000
How do we transform the ways we move -- ourselves and goods?

187
0:09:22.728,000 --> 0:09:23,000
CA: Food.

188
0:09:24.323,000 --> 0:09:28,000
How can we spark a worldwide shift to healthier food systems?

189
0:09:29.567,000 --> 0:09:3,000
CF: And certainly, nature.

190
0:09:31.868,000 --> 0:09:35,000
How extensively can we re-green the earth?

191
0:09:36.662,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, it's worth noting that the answers to these questions

192
0:09:40.889,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and the measures that we would undertake

193
0:09:43.276,000 --> 0:09:45,000
don't just reduce net emissions --

194
0:09:45.974,000 --> 0:09:48,000
they do that, certainly, together, to zero --

195
0:09:49.244,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but they also point the way to a future

196
0:09:51.847,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that is much better and genuinely exciting.

197
0:09:55.974,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So, think about cool new forms of transport,

198
0:10:00.379,000 --> 0:10:04,000
clean air, healthier food, beautiful forests

199
0:10:04.567,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and oceans bursting with life.

200
0:10:08.268,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So, you know, solving the climate crisis

201
0:10:10.737,000 --> 0:10:14,000
isn't about sacrificing and settling for a mediocre future,

202
0:10:15.705,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it's about the exact opposite.

203
0:10:18.039,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's about co-creating a much better future for all of us.

204
0:10:22.804,000 --> 0:10:24,000
CA: So how do we tackle these questions?

205
0:10:25.741,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:26.955,000 --> 0:10:29,000
CA: Let's take this question here and think about this.

207
0:10:30.741,000 --> 0:10:32,000
How extensively can we re-green the earth?

208
0:10:33.052,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I mean, there are obviously many responses to this question,

209
0:10:36.323,000 --> 0:10:37,000
many proposals.

210
0:10:37.498,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's fundamentally about,

211
0:10:38.752,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"How do we increase the amount of sustainable photosynthesis

212
0:10:42.434,000 --> 0:10:43,000
on planet Earth."

213
0:10:43.609,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Photosynthesis sequesters carbon.

214
0:10:46.109,000 --> 0:10:5,000
There could be proposals around giant kelp forests or seagrass,

215
0:10:50.68,000 --> 0:10:53,000
or about forms of plants that have deeper roots

216
0:10:53.839,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and can sequester across the planet.

217
0:10:57.785,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But suppose a major proposal that came out was about reforestation.

218
0:11:02.523,000 --> 0:11:06,000
A massive, global reforestation campaign.

219
0:11:07.498,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I mean, a single organization, no matter how big,

220
0:11:10.673,000 --> 0:11:12,000
cannot take that on.

221
0:11:13.815,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The key is for everyone to join forces,

222
0:11:16.315,000 --> 0:11:17,000
for governments (with zoning),

223
0:11:17.855,000 --> 0:11:18,000
businesses to invest,

224
0:11:19.196,000 --> 0:11:2,000
investors to do that investing,

225
0:11:21.003,000 --> 0:11:24,000
environmental groups and philanthropists who support them,

226
0:11:24.146,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and just a massive movement among citizens everywhere,

227
0:11:28.86,000 --> 0:11:3,000
transforming their lawns, their cities, their neighborhoods,

228
0:11:31.734,000 --> 0:11:32,000
going on trips together.

229
0:11:32.934,000 --> 0:11:36,000
That is where, suddenly, you can dream about something really big.

230
0:11:37.538,000 --> 0:11:39,000
CF: So can we test that theory?

231
0:11:39.617,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Because we are fortunate to have with us today

232
0:11:42.768,000 --> 0:11:46,000
someone who grew up inside a tree-planting movement,

233
0:11:47.673,000 --> 0:11:49,000
probably the most well-recognized tree-planting movement.

234
0:11:51.03,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And she is the daughter of the Nobel Prize winner

235
0:11:54.061,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Wangari Maathai,

236
0:11:55.284,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and she heads up the Wangari Maathai Foundation today.

237
0:11:58.942,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So can we invite our very dear friend Wanjira Mathai?

238
0:12:03.263,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Applause)

239
0:12:05.39,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Video) Wanjira Mathai: Thank you very much,

240
0:12:07.514,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Christiana and Chris, for doing this.

241
0:12:09.324,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Trees have been, indeed, a part of my life for as long as I can remember,

242
0:12:13.307,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but we also know that for centuries,

243
0:12:15.561,000 --> 0:12:2,000
trees and forests have cushioned us against the harsh impacts

244
0:12:20.766,000 --> 0:12:21,000
of climate variation

245
0:12:22.1,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for very many years.

246
0:12:23.672,000 --> 0:12:24,000
In my lifetime, my mother,

247
0:12:24.989,000 --> 0:12:26,000
through the Green Belt Movement, as you mentioned,

248
0:12:27.751,000 --> 0:12:31,000
inspired the planting of 50 million trees and counting

249
0:12:32.769,000 --> 0:12:34,000
through the work of the Green Belt Movement, one organization.

250
0:12:35.728,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But the world now needs us

251
0:12:37.928,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to plant 100 times more trees than we did then.

252
0:12:43.085,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And the only way to do that is for all of us to come together --

253
0:12:47.506,000 --> 0:12:52,000
cities, citizens, governments, companies, environmental organizations --

254
0:12:52.728,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and we must believe, therefore,

255
0:12:55.244,000 --> 0:12:59,000
in the capacity for each of us to be potent agents of change.

256
0:12:59.609,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And that together, we are a force.

257
0:13:02.464,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And I hope you will all join us.

258
0:13:05.828,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

259
0:13:07.002,000 --> 0:13:08,000
CF: So together we are a force.

260
0:13:08.582,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I think Wanjira really hits it right there on the head,

261
0:13:11.202,000 --> 0:13:13,000
because it's all about collaborating

262
0:13:13.229,000 --> 0:13:16,000
across a pretty broad spectrum of people.

263
0:13:16.76,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And happily, there are representatives from all of those groups here today.

264
0:13:22.673,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And we will be inviting you toward further engagement.

265
0:13:26.142,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But we wanted today to introduce you to a couple of those people,

266
0:13:30.384,000 --> 0:13:32,000
speaking from their own perspective.

267
0:13:32.813,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So we would like to start with the voice of a politician.

268
0:13:36.749,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We are incredibly honored to have with us today

269
0:13:40.021,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the former prime minister of Bhutan,

270
0:13:42.529,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and I will have you know that Bhutan is the only country in the world

271
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that actually absorbs more carbon than what it emits.

272
0:13:50.284,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Our good friend, Tshering Tobgay.

273
0:13:52.617,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Applause)

274
0:14:02.441,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Tshering Tobgay: My country is typical of the global south,

275
0:14:07.637,000 --> 0:14:11,000
in that we have not caused this climate-change crisis.

276
0:14:13.061,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Indeed, we are blessed

277
0:14:16.077,000 --> 0:14:19,000
with lush forests and many bountiful rivers

278
0:14:19.427,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that have enabled my country, Bhutan, to remain carbon-negative.

279
0:14:24.069,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And yet, climate change threatens to destroy our forests.

280
0:14:29.966,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And to turn those very rivers

281
0:14:33.713,000 --> 0:14:35,000
into terrible dangers for our people,

282
0:14:36.371,000 --> 0:14:41,000
as the Himalayan glaciers melt and threaten both near-term flooding

283
0:14:42.109,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and the longer-term loss of our natural water reserves.

284
0:14:48.458,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So, I'm proud to join

285
0:14:52.927,000 --> 0:14:54,000
this Countdown initiative

286
0:14:55.427,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and work with all of you and with you, and with you,

287
0:14:58.45,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

288
0:14:59.633,000 --> 0:15:04,000
constructively, to find solutions that are both powerful and just.

289
0:15:06.111,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Thank you.

290
0:15:07.292,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

291
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
CA: Thank you.

292
0:15:10.419,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Applause)

293
0:15:14.321,000 --> 0:15:16,000
CA: Business, of course, has a crucial role to play,

294
0:15:16.877,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and so do those who control the world's vast pools of investment capital.

295
0:15:21.758,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I was pleased to make the acquaintance recently

296
0:15:24.133,000 --> 0:15:25,000
of the chief investment officer

297
0:15:25.967,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of Japan's 1.6-trillion-dollar government pension fund.

298
0:15:30.609,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It's actually the world's largest pension fund.

299
0:15:33.72,000 --> 0:15:36,000
He's willing and interested to come with us on this journey

300
0:15:37.088,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and to bring others with him.

301
0:15:38.711,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So, somewhere is, I believe, Hiro.

302
0:15:42.996,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Hiro Mizuno.

303
0:15:44.179,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And you're live. Welcome, Hiro.

304
0:15:47.377,000 --> 0:15:48,000
(Video) Hiro Mizuno: Great.

305
0:15:48.704,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Thanks, Chris and Christiana, and the staff of TED,

306
0:15:52.331,000 --> 0:15:53,000
for making this possible.

307
0:15:54.244,000 --> 0:15:57,000
As a person in charge of the largest pension fund in the world

308
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and responsible for securing pension benefits for multiple generations,

309
0:16:03.619,000 --> 0:16:06,000
it is a hugely important issue, how to manage climate risk.

310
0:16:07.911,000 --> 0:16:09,000
We recently analyzed our global portfolio,

311
0:16:10.379,000 --> 0:16:12,000
how it's aligned with the Paris Agreement.

312
0:16:13.022,000 --> 0:16:14,000
It was diagnosed,

313
0:16:14.435,000 --> 0:16:17,000
our portfolio is on the path for more than three degrees.

314
0:16:18.116,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Far away from the Paris Agreement goals.

315
0:16:21.741,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Our portfolio is not only sizable

316
0:16:24.352,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but also one of the most globally diversified portfolios.

317
0:16:28.122,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So that means, the world is on that path.

318
0:16:31.45,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I'm tired of hearing the same comment repeatedly

319
0:16:34.371,000 --> 0:16:38,000
from our portfolio companies and, obviously, investment professionals:

320
0:16:39.085,000 --> 0:16:4,000
"We are realistic."

321
0:16:41.196,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Sorry, but being "realistic" is no longer an option.

322
0:16:45.395,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We are fully aware of our responsibility as the world's largest asset owner

323
0:16:50.418,000 --> 0:16:52,000
to inspire changes in the capital market.

324
0:16:53.165,000 --> 0:16:57,000
We will be actively engaging with all actors in the capital market

325
0:16:57.792,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to move the needle.

326
0:16:59.887,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I look forward to participating in this crucial dialogue with you all.

327
0:17:04.268,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Thank you.

328
0:17:05.625,000 --> 0:17:07,000
(Applause)

329
0:17:07.688,000 --> 0:17:11,000
CF: I'm sure all of you know that throughout the past 12 to 18 months,

330
0:17:12.427,000 --> 0:17:16,000
what has really been new and powerful and exciting

331
0:17:16.665,000 --> 0:17:19,000
is the amazing voices of so many young people,

332
0:17:19.887,000 --> 0:17:21,000
millions of young people who are out there on the streets,

333
0:17:22.891,000 --> 0:17:23,000
with anger, with outrage, with despair,

334
0:17:24.787,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and also, asking us to do our thing.

335
0:17:28.002,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And they have been inspired by Greta Thunberg

336
0:17:30.557,000 --> 0:17:33,000
but by so many other fantastic young people

337
0:17:34.019,000 --> 0:17:35,000
in almost every country of the world.

338
0:17:35.908,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And today, we are delighted to have four young activists

339
0:17:40.601,000 --> 0:17:42,000
come join us today.

340
0:17:42.687,000 --> 0:17:44,000
(Applause)

341
0:17:45.671,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Cheers)

342
0:17:47.526,000 --> 0:17:54,000
(Applause)

343
0:17:55.959,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Alexandria Villaseñor: This Friday,

344
0:17:57.705,000 --> 0:17:59,000
I'll have been on climate strike for 52 weeks.

345
0:18:00.205,000 --> 0:18:01,000
That's an entire year.

346
0:18:02.435,000 --> 0:18:03,000
During that time,

347
0:18:03.681,000 --> 0:18:05,000
I found that many people don't know about climate change

348
0:18:06.442,000 --> 0:18:08,000
or how serious the climate crisis is.

349
0:18:08.942,000 --> 0:18:1,000
So I founded Earth Uprising International

350
0:18:11.522,000 --> 0:18:13,000
to teach young people about climate change,

351
0:18:14.157,000 --> 0:18:17,000
because when they know the science and the impacts,

352
0:18:17.347,000 --> 0:18:18,000
they want to take action.

353
0:18:19.498,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Being an activist means making change happen.

354
0:18:23.077,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Jamie Margolin: I became a climate activist

355
0:18:25.101,000 --> 0:18:26,000
because my life depends on it.

356
0:18:26.831,000 --> 0:18:27,000
I'm applying to colleges right now,

357
0:18:28.522,000 --> 0:18:29,000
trying to plan for my future.

358
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
There will be nothing to look forward to

359
0:18:32.212,000 --> 0:18:34,000
if we don't take urgent action to stop the climate crisis now.

360
0:18:35.803,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I started the youth climate justice movement called Zero Hour back in 2017,

361
0:18:40.898,000 --> 0:18:43,000
because this is zero hour to act on climate change.

362
0:18:44.303,000 --> 0:18:45,000
We have no more time.

363
0:18:45.859,000 --> 0:18:46,000
It became clear to me

364
0:18:47.038,000 --> 0:18:49,000
that our leaders were not going to take real action

365
0:18:49.498,000 --> 0:18:51,000
unless the people stood up and demanded it,

366
0:18:51.561,000 --> 0:18:53,000
so that's exactly what we did.

367
0:18:53.839,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Natalie Sweet: I became a climate-justice activist

368
0:18:56.235,000 --> 0:18:59,000
because if I don't fight for the rights of the people today,

369
0:18:59.505,000 --> 0:19:,000
and for the people in the future,

370
0:19:01.108,000 --> 0:19:02,000
who will?

371
0:19:02.282,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Xiye Bastida: I became a climate justice activist

372
0:19:04.917,000 --> 0:19:08,000
when I realized that the climate crisis impacts marginalized communities the most,

373
0:19:09.498,000 --> 0:19:11,000
including my town in Mexico.

374
0:19:11.641,000 --> 0:19:13,000
I strike with Fridays for Future

375
0:19:13.748,000 --> 0:19:14,000
every Friday,

376
0:19:14.933,000 --> 0:19:16,000
because our movement is not about gaining momentum

377
0:19:17.828,000 --> 0:19:19,000
but about igniting cultural change.

378
0:19:20.335,000 --> 0:19:24,000
But the fact that thousands of students strike for climate

379
0:19:24.497,000 --> 0:19:26,000
means that we are already implementing climate justice

380
0:19:27.196,000 --> 0:19:29,000
into every aspect of our lives,

381
0:19:29.442,000 --> 0:19:31,000
which is already redefining the world.

382
0:19:32.398,000 --> 0:19:33,000
JM: Over the course of our lifetimes,

383
0:19:34.192,000 --> 0:19:36,000
we've seen the Earth deteriorate at a rapid speed

384
0:19:37.215,000 --> 0:19:39,000
and groups of people traumatized and displaced

385
0:19:39.642,000 --> 0:19:41,000
by an ever-increasing number of natural disasters.

386
0:19:42.905,000 --> 0:19:44,000
In 2030, I'll be 28 years old.

387
0:19:46.001,000 --> 0:19:47,000
AV: I'll be 24 years old.

388
0:19:48.152,000 --> 0:19:49,000
XB: I will be 27.

389
0:19:50.103,000 --> 0:19:51,000
NS: I'll be 26.

390
0:19:51.564,000 --> 0:19:54,000
We want to be able to hand the planet over to our children

391
0:19:54.693,000 --> 0:19:55,000
and our children's children,

392
0:19:56.248,000 --> 0:19:58,000
just like many of you have been able to do.

393
0:19:59.193,000 --> 0:20:,000
AV: So unless everyone --

394
0:20:01.121,000 --> 0:20:05,000
governments, companies, schools, scientists and citizens --

395
0:20:05.879,000 --> 0:20:09,000
make a united commitment to reversing the damage that we've caused,

396
0:20:10.466,000 --> 0:20:12,000
it will be too late.

397
0:20:13.644,000 --> 0:20:16,000
XB: We are not only asking you to take care of our future,

398
0:20:16.906,000 --> 0:20:18,000
we are also asking you to take care of our past.

399
0:20:20.183,000 --> 0:20:24,000
Indigenous people have been taking care of the Earth for thousands of years,

400
0:20:25.006,000 --> 0:20:28,000
which is why indigenous philosophy is crucial

401
0:20:28.315,000 --> 0:20:3,000
when implementing climate action.

402
0:20:32.427,000 --> 0:20:35,000
JM: This climate crisis can feel like an impossible thing to fix.

403
0:20:36.077,000 --> 0:20:37,000
But it's not.

404
0:20:37.263,000 --> 0:20:38,000
And it can't be,

405
0:20:38.439,000 --> 0:20:39,000
because failure is simply not an option.

406
0:20:40.387,000 --> 0:20:42,000
Failure means losing everything we love

407
0:20:42.436,000 --> 0:20:43,000
and everything that matters.

408
0:20:44.339,000 --> 0:20:47,000
So many of us are already working to save the future of our world,

409
0:20:47.744,000 --> 0:20:49,000
but it can't just be on the next generation to fix.

410
0:20:50.736,000 --> 0:20:53,000
This is too much of a burden to just put on young people's shoulders.

411
0:20:54.982,000 --> 0:20:56,000
It is time for you to go all hands on deck

412
0:20:57.792,000 --> 0:21:01,000
and do everything within your power to save everything before it's too late.

413
0:21:02.8,000 --> 0:21:03,000
Are you with us?

414
0:21:04.519,000 --> 0:21:05,000
Audience: Yes.

415
0:21:05.706,000 --> 0:21:12,000
(Applause and cheers)

416
0:21:12.73,000 --> 0:21:18,000
(Applause)

417
0:21:19.397,000 --> 0:21:2,000
CA: Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

418
0:21:21.323,000 --> 0:21:22,000
And then, of course,

419
0:21:22.501,000 --> 0:21:25,000
there's a crucial role to be played by the world's storytellers,

420
0:21:26.395,000 --> 0:21:3,000
and those with influence on social media platforms.

421
0:21:30.728,000 --> 0:21:32,000
Each of the following has expressed excitement

422
0:21:32.911,000 --> 0:21:33,000
to be part of this project.

423
0:21:34.228,000 --> 0:21:35,000
They've lent us their names and support.

424
0:21:36.165,000 --> 0:21:37,000
We have some of them here today.

425
0:21:37.752,000 --> 0:21:39,000
Thank you so much for being here.

426
0:21:40.228,000 --> 0:21:42,000
And let's hear from one of them, actually.

427
0:21:42.673,000 --> 0:21:43,000
Jimmy Kimmel: Hi, I'm Jimmy Kimmel,

428
0:21:44.379,000 --> 0:21:47,000
and I was asked to explain why I'm passionate about climate change.

429
0:21:47.679,000 --> 0:21:49,000
And the reason I'm passionate about climate change

430
0:21:50.33,000 --> 0:21:54,000
is the same reason people who are drowning are passionate about lifeguards.

431
0:21:55.298,000 --> 0:21:58,000
I care about this planet, because I live on it.

432
0:21:58.355,000 --> 0:21:59,000
I don't want to move to Mars,

433
0:21:59.903,000 --> 0:22:,000
Mars seems terrible.

434
0:22:01.22,000 --> 0:22:04,000
I want my kids and their kids to be able to live on Earth,

435
0:22:04.768,000 --> 0:22:06,000
with air they can breathe and water they can drink.

436
0:22:07.585,000 --> 0:22:09,000
That's why I care about climate change.

437
0:22:10.315,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And also, I have a crush on Leonardo DiCaprio.

438
0:22:13.03,000 --> 0:22:15,000
(Applause)

439
0:22:15.776,000 --> 0:22:17,000
CF: So with all these people coming together,

440
0:22:18.303,000 --> 0:22:22,000
we have an opportunity to explore a new space of possibility

441
0:22:22.561,000 --> 0:22:25,000
for solutions based on working together,

442
0:22:25.696,000 --> 0:22:26,000
challenging each other

443
0:22:27.228,000 --> 0:22:28,000
and inspiring one another.

444
0:22:29.466,000 --> 0:22:31,000
So in October next year,

445
0:22:31.514,000 --> 0:22:34,000
we will be inviting more or less 1,000 people

446
0:22:35.173,000 --> 0:22:39,000
from different constituencies to meet in Bergen, Norway

447
0:22:39.752,000 --> 0:22:44,000
to align on specific answers to our five big questions.

448
0:22:45.395,000 --> 0:22:47,000
CA: It will certainly be an epic event.

449
0:22:48.482,000 --> 0:22:5,000
But even more significant than what happens in Norway

450
0:22:51.014,000 --> 0:22:53,000
is what happens elsewhere in the world.

451
0:22:53.879,000 --> 0:22:55,000
Because on the final day of that conference,

452
0:22:55.958,000 --> 0:22:59,000
we're planning a major activation of our global TEDx community.

453
0:23:01.315,000 --> 0:23:04,000
TEDx allows initiatives to organize local events,

454
0:23:05.24,000 --> 0:23:08,000
and there are now 4,000 such events annually.

455
0:23:08.345,000 --> 0:23:09,000
Here's what they look like.

456
0:23:12.55,000 --> 0:23:14,000
They take place in more than 200 different countries,

457
0:23:15.529,000 --> 0:23:17,000
generate more than a billion views annually on YouTube.

458
0:23:18.363,000 --> 0:23:2,000
We're expecting to see events in hundreds of cities.

459
0:23:21.03,000 --> 0:23:23,000
We'll be connecting our TEDx organizers

460
0:23:23.237,000 --> 0:23:27,000
with city mayors committed to a clean future for their cities.

461
0:23:27.815,000 --> 0:23:28,000
This is the key to this.

462
0:23:29.077,000 --> 0:23:31,000
It's this connection between the powerful,

463
0:23:31.124,000 --> 0:23:33,000
who usually own the conversation,

464
0:23:34.037,000 --> 0:23:35,000
and millions of people around the world.

465
0:23:35.997,000 --> 0:23:38,000
Because of the zeitgeist shift that's happened in the last year or two,

466
0:23:39.664,000 --> 0:23:41,000
suddenly, ignition can happen here,

467
0:23:42.101,000 --> 0:23:44,000
because there's enough critical groundswell.

468
0:23:44.204,000 --> 0:23:46,000
If we can give people visibility of each other,

469
0:23:46.466,000 --> 0:23:47,000
connection to each other,

470
0:23:47.728,000 --> 0:23:48,000
let's dream a little here,

471
0:23:49.403,000 --> 0:23:5,000
and give each other permission to dream.

472
0:23:51.371,000 --> 0:23:54,000
CF: So our goal here is to build connections

473
0:23:54.553,000 --> 0:23:58,000
with and among all of the other organizations that are working on climate.

474
0:23:59.141,000 --> 0:24:,000
For example,

475
0:24:00.316,000 --> 0:24:02,000
the Solutions Project is a wonderful initiative

476
0:24:02.672,000 --> 0:24:05,000
founded by Mark Ruffalo and Don Cheadle.

477
0:24:06.347,000 --> 0:24:09,000
And let's hear from some of the leaders that they have supported.

478
0:24:10.236,000 --> 0:24:11,000
CA: Welcome, you're live.

479
0:24:11.958,000 --> 0:24:12,000
(Laughter)

480
0:24:13.013,000 --> 0:24:16,000
(Video) Wahleah Johns: Hi, my name is Wahleah Johns,

481
0:24:16.775,000 --> 0:24:17,000
I'm with Native Renewables,

482
0:24:18.522,000 --> 0:24:23,000
and we are working to provide solar power for tribes

483
0:24:24.069,000 --> 0:24:25,000
throughout the world.

484
0:24:25.736,000 --> 0:24:28,000
We have over 15,000 Native American families

485
0:24:29.736,000 --> 0:24:31,000
that don't have access to electricity,

486
0:24:32.353,000 --> 0:24:36,000
and we are working to provide solar plus battery storage for these families

487
0:24:37.29,000 --> 0:24:38,000
in the United States

488
0:24:38.56,000 --> 0:24:4,000
that don't have access to electricity.

489
0:24:40.974,000 --> 0:24:42,000
And they are located on my reservation,

490
0:24:43.53,000 --> 0:24:44,000
the Navajo Nation.

491
0:24:45.411,000 --> 0:24:46,000
Anna Lappé: Hi, everyone,

492
0:24:46.823,000 --> 0:24:48,000
I am Anna Lappé with Real Food Media,

493
0:24:49.64,000 --> 0:24:53,000
and we work to uplift the stories of farmers and ranchers

494
0:24:54.069,000 --> 0:24:56,000
as a key solution to the climate crisis.

495
0:24:56.966,000 --> 0:24:59,000
The global food system right now is a huge contributor to this crisis,

496
0:25:00.657,000 --> 0:25:01,000
but it doesn't have to be.

497
0:25:02.18,000 --> 0:25:03,000
Farmers and ranchers we really see

498
0:25:03.855,000 --> 0:25:06,000
as on the front lines of being part of solving the crisis.

499
0:25:07.259,000 --> 0:25:11,000
So we try to share the stories of the millions of farmers

500
0:25:11.897,000 --> 0:25:14,000
from Andhra Pradesh, India to the highlands of Oaxaca

501
0:25:15.254,000 --> 0:25:2,000
that are using regenerative agriculture to build healthy, carbon-rich soil,

502
0:25:20.792,000 --> 0:25:21,000
grow good food

503
0:25:22.007,000 --> 0:25:26,000
and foster the kind of resilient communities that we need.

504
0:25:27.736,000 --> 0:25:3,000
Rahwa Ghirmatzion: Hello from PUSH Buffalo -- my name is Rahwa --

505
0:25:30.889,000 --> 0:25:34,000
where every day, residents are visioning, planning and designing

506
0:25:34.99,000 --> 0:25:37,000
an equitable, holistic and sacred neighborhood,

507
0:25:38.117,000 --> 0:25:41,000
like where I'm phoning in from, School 77,

508
0:25:41.562,000 --> 0:25:43,000
a renovated vacant school building

509
0:25:43.855,000 --> 0:25:47,000
that has the first 100 percent affordable community solar array

510
0:25:48.697,000 --> 0:25:49,000
in New York state

511
0:25:49.919,000 --> 0:25:5,000
installed by local residents.

512
0:25:51.831,000 --> 0:25:54,000
It's also serving 30 affordable senior apartments

513
0:25:55.474,000 --> 0:25:58,000
and a mix of intergenerational spaces

514
0:25:58.887,000 --> 0:25:59,000
that serves as a community hub,

515
0:26:00.871,000 --> 0:26:02,000
where we're practicing new economy strategies

516
0:26:03.371,000 --> 0:26:04,000
towards a livable planet.

517
0:26:06.006,000 --> 0:26:07,000
CF: Thank you.

518
0:26:07.181,000 --> 0:26:08,000
CA: Bravo.

519
0:26:08.49,000 --> 0:26:1,000
(Applause)

520
0:26:11.293,000 --> 0:26:12,000
CA: It's so great.

521
0:26:12.515,000 --> 0:26:13,000
(Applause)

522
0:26:13.749,000 --> 0:26:14,000
CF: So you see, this is about everyone.

523
0:26:15.672,000 --> 0:26:16,000
It's about cities,

524
0:26:16.85,000 --> 0:26:18,000
it's about grassroots organizations,

525
0:26:19.098,000 --> 0:26:21,000
but it's also, of course, about business.

526
0:26:21.879,000 --> 0:26:23,000
And so we're inviting all companies --

527
0:26:24.569,000 --> 0:26:25,000
underlined "all" --

528
0:26:26.292,000 --> 0:26:27,000
to join this initiative,

529
0:26:27.942,000 --> 0:26:31,000
to engage with your employees on how you can best protect the planet

530
0:26:32.934,000 --> 0:26:34,000
and your future, at the same time.

531
0:26:36.188,000 --> 0:26:39,000
So early next year, we'll be sharing a toolkit

532
0:26:39.53,000 --> 0:26:4,000
that can guide companies

533
0:26:41.28,000 --> 0:26:45,000
toward moving quickly towards science-based targets,

534
0:26:45.427,000 --> 0:26:49,000
which gets them then to net zero emissions

535
0:26:49.887,000 --> 0:26:51,000
by 2050 at the latest.

536
0:26:53.307,000 --> 0:26:54,000
CA: So think about this,

537
0:26:54.522,000 --> 0:26:56,000
because as an individual,

538
0:26:56.641,000 --> 0:26:59,000
many individuals feel powerless on this issue.

539
0:27:00.577,000 --> 0:27:04,000
But if you were to team up with others in your company,

540
0:27:05.521,000 --> 0:27:07,000
you might be amazed at how much power you actually have.

541
0:27:08.211,000 --> 0:27:13,000
Almost all emissions come from a company somewhere on the planet.

542
0:27:13.513,000 --> 0:27:16,000
And the thing is, many CEOs today

543
0:27:16.56,000 --> 0:27:18,000
are actually eager to help solve the problem.

544
0:27:19.497,000 --> 0:27:23,000
We just heard this morning from Anand Mahindra,

545
0:27:24.196,000 --> 0:27:26,000
who heads India's biggest business group,

546
0:27:26.593,000 --> 0:27:28,000
that he is personally committed on this issue

547
0:27:28.823,000 --> 0:27:3,000
and wants to be part of this journey with us --

548
0:27:31.053,000 --> 0:27:32,000
he's a supporter of Countdown.

549
0:27:33.434,000 --> 0:27:36,000
CEOs will be able to move much faster

550
0:27:36.516,000 --> 0:27:42,000
if there's a group of employees there to brainstorm with, to support them,

551
0:27:42.792,000 --> 0:27:46,000
to keep that sort of sense of urgency on the topic.

552
0:27:47.929,000 --> 0:27:5,000
Our website will help you connect with others in your company

553
0:27:51.715,000 --> 0:27:54,000
and give you guidance on smart questions to ask,

554
0:27:54.786,000 --> 0:27:55,000
initiatives to suggest,

555
0:27:56.747,000 --> 0:28:,000
because if companies can be persuaded to do the right thing,

556
0:28:00.852,000 --> 0:28:03,000
suddenly, this problem seems to become solvable.

557
0:28:05.533,000 --> 0:28:1,000
CF: So all of these efforts are building toward one fantastic day:

558
0:28:10.838,000 --> 0:28:13,000
Saturday, October 10, 2020 --

559
0:28:13.998,000 --> 0:28:17,000
that is, "10.10.2020." -- easy to remember --

560
0:28:18.934,000 --> 0:28:21,000
when this fantastic gathering will take place around the world.

561
0:28:23.284,000 --> 0:28:25,000
And we hope to have, by then,

562
0:28:25.982,000 --> 0:28:28,000
thrilling news of the report of the very specific solutions

563
0:28:29.458,000 --> 0:28:33,000
that nations, cities, companies, citizens

564
0:28:33.822,000 --> 0:28:36,000
are actually already collaborating on by then.

565
0:28:37.326,000 --> 0:28:4,000
It's a day when every citizen of the planet

566
0:28:40.564,000 --> 0:28:42,000
is invited to participate.

567
0:28:42.649,000 --> 0:28:46,000
Your one ticket of entrance is you are a citizen of the planet.

568
0:28:46.863,000 --> 0:28:51,000
CA: Key to the success of the event is for this to happen at scale.

569
0:28:51.897,000 --> 0:28:53,000
We want to make it easy for anyone and everyone

570
0:28:54.548,000 --> 0:28:57,000
to find out about the initiative and to play an active part in it.

571
0:28:57.904,000 --> 0:28:58,000
But how do you do that?

572
0:28:59.214,000 --> 0:29:01,000
You know, the world's a noisy place.

573
0:29:01.307,000 --> 0:29:03,000
I mean, the TED platform can help a bit, maybe,

574
0:29:03.974,000 --> 0:29:06,000
but there's a much bigger content platform out there.

575
0:29:07.665,000 --> 0:29:09,000
It's called YouTube.

576
0:29:10.249,000 --> 0:29:13,000
And we're delighted to be working with them on this endeavor.

577
0:29:13.963,000 --> 0:29:15,000
We'll be inviting many of their top creators

578
0:29:16.392,000 --> 0:29:18,000
to be part of Countdown.

579
0:29:19.257,000 --> 0:29:22,000
Collectively, they could reach an audience in the many millions.

580
0:29:22.304,000 --> 0:29:23,000
In fact, let's meet one of them,

581
0:29:23.866,000 --> 0:29:24,000
Dr. Joe Hanson of "Hot Mess,"

582
0:29:25.859,000 --> 0:29:29,000
a new web series about the impact of climate change on all of us.

583
0:29:31.284,000 --> 0:29:32,000
(Video) My name's Joe Hanson,

584
0:29:33.284,000 --> 0:29:34,000
and I am a YouTube educator.

585
0:29:34.661,000 --> 0:29:35,000
And you can count me in.

586
0:29:36.625,000 --> 0:29:39,000
I work with tomorrow's scientists, inventors and leaders,

587
0:29:40.135,000 --> 0:29:43,000
and they deserve to know the truth of what the science says,

588
0:29:43.711,000 --> 0:29:47,000
so that they can help us invent a better future for everyone.

589
0:29:49.72,000 --> 0:29:51,000
CA: Imagine that multiplied by many others --

590
0:29:51.864,000 --> 0:29:53,000
it's very, very exciting, honestly.

591
0:29:54.561,000 --> 0:29:57,000
CF: And of course, when it comes to spreading the word,

592
0:29:57.633,000 --> 0:30:,000
every one of you in this room can actually play your part.

593
0:30:02.014,000 --> 0:30:05,000
So if you have any way of reaching anyone

594
0:30:05.541,000 --> 0:30:07,000
who is concerned about building a better future --

595
0:30:08.283,000 --> 0:30:1,000
and that should be every single one of us --

596
0:30:11.212,000 --> 0:30:13,000
please, invite them to join Countdown.

597
0:30:14.173,000 --> 0:30:15,000
CA: There's one more card up our sleeve.

598
0:30:16.149,000 --> 0:30:2,000
We're excited to unveil a global media campaign.

599
0:30:20.722,000 --> 0:30:22,000
This is a campaign with a difference.

600
0:30:22.785,000 --> 0:30:24,000
Just as TEDx exploded

601
0:30:24.936,000 --> 0:30:27,000
by being allowed to grow as a grassroots phenomenon,

602
0:30:28.484,000 --> 0:30:33,000
this campaign is designed to be co-opted everywhere on the planet.

603
0:30:34.421,000 --> 0:30:36,000
If you happen to own a billboard company,

604
0:30:37.222,000 --> 0:30:39,000
or a TV station, or a radio station,

605
0:30:39.308,000 --> 0:30:4,000
or a website,

606
0:30:40.792,000 --> 0:30:43,000
or a social media account,

607
0:30:43.966,000 --> 0:30:46,000
we invite all of you to take the images you're about to see

608
0:30:47.277,000 --> 0:30:49,000
and to just spread them far and wide.

609
0:30:50.015,000 --> 0:30:52,000
Our website will make this easy.

610
0:30:52.309,000 --> 0:30:54,000
We actually plan to translate them into many languages,

611
0:30:54.92,000 --> 0:30:58,000
courtesy of our volunteer army of more than 20,000 translators worldwide.

612
0:30:59.849,000 --> 0:31:,000
Some of them are with us here.

613
0:31:01.317,000 --> 0:31:03,000
If you're a TED translator, would you wave, please?

614
0:31:05.539,000 --> 0:31:06,000
CF: There we go.

615
0:31:06.725,000 --> 0:31:08,000
(Applause)

616
0:31:08.887,000 --> 0:31:11,000
CA: Your work carries powerful ideas to every corner of the earth.

617
0:31:12.077,000 --> 0:31:14,000
We're so proud of you, so grateful to you.

618
0:31:14.339,000 --> 0:31:17,000
So this campaign's designed to grab attention

619
0:31:17.712,000 --> 0:31:2,000
and to communicate, yes, urgency

620
0:31:20.871,000 --> 0:31:22,000
but also a little smidgen of hope.

621
0:31:23.165,000 --> 0:31:27,000
We think it might be that combination is what is needed to really drive action.

622
0:31:27.712,000 --> 0:31:31,000
We'd love you to let us know what you think of these.

623
0:31:31.792,000 --> 0:31:32,000
CF: Right now.

624
0:31:32.971,000 --> 0:31:33,000
[Choose your future.]

625
0:31:34.317,000 --> 0:31:37,000
(Applause)

626
0:31:37.524,000 --> 0:31:39,000

(Video) Hi, I'm Claire O'Neill.

673
0:33:14.233,000 --> 0:33:18,000
I am the COP president-designate for next year's Conference of the Parties,

674
0:33:18.736,000 --> 0:33:2,000
the annual UN climate change talks, which will be in the UK,

675
0:33:21.657,000 --> 0:33:23,000
and we're looking forward to welcoming you there.

676
0:33:23.982,000 --> 0:33:25,000
But right now, I'm in Spain, in Madrid,

677
0:33:26.792,000 --> 0:33:28,000
at COP25, this annual event

678
0:33:29.434,000 --> 0:33:32,000
where we send negotiators and activists from all over the world

679
0:33:32.712,000 --> 0:33:34,000
to see what we can do to reduce CO2 emissions.

680
0:33:35.411,000 --> 0:33:38,000
But the problem is this: emissions are going up, not down.

681
0:33:38.569,000 --> 0:33:41,000
And what I'm feeling is that 2020 is the year of action,

682
0:33:41.633,000 --> 0:33:42,000
the year where we have to stop talking

683
0:33:43.467,000 --> 0:33:44,000
and we have to start acting.

684
0:33:44.815,000 --> 0:33:46,000
And not just here, in these conference centers,

685
0:33:47.014,000 --> 0:33:48,000
but everybody.

686
0:33:48.189,000 --> 0:33:5,000
And so the value of the TED process,

687
0:33:50.764,000 --> 0:33:52,000
the value of what we're all doing together

688
0:33:52.815,000 --> 0:33:54,000
is that we're spreading out the conversations

689
0:33:54.974,000 --> 0:33:57,000
and the solutions from inside this space

690
0:33:58.292,000 --> 0:33:59,000
out to everybody.

691
0:33:59.712,000 --> 0:34:01,000
And I'm really looking forward to working with the TED group

692
0:34:02.553,000 --> 0:34:03,000
over the next year.

693
0:34:03.768,000 --> 0:34:06,000
2020, for me, will be the most important year for climate action,

but just a few more very special snippets.

698
0:34:17.712,000 --> 0:34:21,000
First, a word from one of the many great minds

699
0:34:22.164,000 --> 0:34:24,000
who will be accompanying us on this journey.

700
0:34:25.149,000 --> 0:34:29,000
A message from the great author, historian and futurist

701
0:34:29.712,000 --> 0:34:3,000
Yuval Harari.

702
0:34:31.927,000 --> 0:34:33,000
Yuval Harari: Climate change is about inequality.

703
0:34:34.745,000 --> 0:34:38,000
Inequality between the rich, who are mainly responsible for it,

704
0:34:38.792,000 --> 0:34:4,000
and the poor, who will suffer the most.

705
0:34:41.792,000 --> 0:34:43,000
Inequality between us, Homo sapiens,

706
0:34:44.586,000 --> 0:34:45,000
who control this planet,

707
0:34:46.204,000 --> 0:34:49,000
and the other animals, who are our helpless victims.

708
0:34:50.355,000 --> 0:34:52,000
Inequality between the scientists,

709
0:34:52.784,000 --> 0:34:54,000
who painstakingly search for the truth,

710
0:34:55.8,000 --> 0:34:57,000
and the professional deceivers,

711
0:34:57.839,000 --> 0:34:59,000
who spread falsehoods at the click of a button.

712
0:35:01.95,000 --> 0:35:03,000
Climate change is about making a choice.

713
0:35:04.8,000 --> 0:35:07,000
What kind of planet do we want to inhabit,

714
0:35:07.855,000 --> 0:35:09,000
and what kind of humans do we want to be?

715
0:35:11.371,000 --> 0:35:14,000
A choice between greed and compassion,

716
0:35:14.703,000 --> 0:35:17,000
between carelessness and responsibility,

717
0:35:17.798,000 --> 0:35:2,000
between closing our eyes to the truth

718
0:35:20.838,000 --> 0:35:22,000
and opening our hearts to the world.

719
0:35:24.696,000 --> 0:35:26,000
Climate change is a crisis,

720
0:35:26.831,000 --> 0:35:3,000
but for humans, a crisis is always also an opportunity.

721
0:35:31.744,000 --> 0:35:34,000
If we make the right choices in the coming years,

722
0:35:35.252,000 --> 0:35:37,000
we cannot only save the ecosystem,

723
0:35:38.212,000 --> 0:35:41,000
but we can also create a more just world

724
0:35:41.784,000 --> 0:35:43,000
and make ourselves better people.

725
0:35:46.228,000 --> 0:35:52,000
(Applause)

726
0:35:53.046,000 --> 0:35:56,000
CF: So isn't that a powerful framing of what we have ahead of us,

727
0:35:56.324,000 --> 0:35:59,000
and honestly, I think it is tragic

728
0:35:59.83,000 --> 0:36:02,000
that the power of transformation that we have ahead of us

729
0:36:03.569,000 --> 0:36:07,000
is so severely diminished by those who would want to politicize the issue

730
0:36:08.16,000 --> 0:36:11,000
and separate it into partisan politics.

731
0:36:11.549,000 --> 0:36:13,000
It cannot be a partisan issue,

732
0:36:14.192,000 --> 0:36:16,000
it cannot be a politicized issue.

733
0:36:16.768,000 --> 0:36:18,000
Happily, there are some who are working against that.

734
0:36:19.585,000 --> 0:36:21,000
Today, we have one of those people,

735
0:36:22.458,000 --> 0:36:25,000
a fantastically courageous climate scientist,

736
0:36:25.792,000 --> 0:36:26,000
who is a committed Christian,

737
0:36:27.752,000 --> 0:36:28,000
and who has been working on this issue

738
0:36:29.618,000 --> 0:36:33,000
with conservatives and with the religious and spiritual communities for years,

739
0:36:33.968,000 --> 0:36:35,000
with incredible courage.

740
0:36:36.572,000 --> 0:36:37,000
Katharine Hayhoe.

741
0:36:38.437,000 --> 0:36:4,000
(Applause)

742
0:36:40.548,000 --> 0:36:43,000
Katherine Hayhoe: When someone says climate change, we often think,

743
0:36:43.814,000 --> 0:36:44,000
"Oh, that's just an environmental issue.

744
0:36:45.788,000 --> 0:36:47,000
People who are tree huggers or scientists care about it,

745
0:36:48.455,000 --> 0:36:51,000
or maybe people who are on the left hand-side of the political spectrum."

746
0:36:51.921,000 --> 0:36:53,000
But the reality is, whether we know it or not,

747
0:36:54.108,000 --> 0:36:57,000
we already care about climate change, no matter who we are.

748
0:36:57.371,000 --> 0:36:58,000
Why?

749
0:36:58.563,000 --> 0:37:01,000
Because climate change affects everything we already care about today.

750
0:37:02.141,000 --> 0:37:03,000
It affects our health,

751
0:37:03.577,000 --> 0:37:04,000
it affects the food we eat,

752
0:37:05.331,000 --> 0:37:07,000
the water we drink, the air that we breathe.

753
0:37:08.101,000 --> 0:37:11,000
Climate change affects the economy and national security.

754
0:37:11.427,000 --> 0:37:14,000
I care about a changing climate because it is, as the military calls it,

755
0:37:15.363,000 --> 0:37:16,000
a threat multiplier.

756
0:37:17.331,000 --> 0:37:19,000
It takes issues like poverty and hunger,

757
0:37:19.95,000 --> 0:37:21,000
disease, lack of access to clean water,

758
0:37:22.427,000 --> 0:37:23,000
even political instability,

759
0:37:24.284,000 --> 0:37:26,000
and exacerbates or amplifies them.

760
0:37:27.069,000 --> 0:37:29,000
That's why, to care about a changing climate,

761
0:37:29.196,000 --> 0:37:31,000
we don't have to be a certain type of person.

762
0:37:31.331,000 --> 0:37:33,000
A thermometer isn't blue or red,

763
0:37:33.657,000 --> 0:37:34,000
liberal or conservative --

764
0:37:35.253,000 --> 0:37:37,000
it gives us the same number no matter how we vote.

765
0:37:38.18,000 --> 0:37:41,000
And we are all affected by the impacts of a changing climate.

766
0:37:41.601,000 --> 0:37:42,000
So to care about a changing climate,

767
0:37:43.434,000 --> 0:37:44,000
all we have to be is one thing:

768
0:37:45.22,000 --> 0:37:47,000
a human, living on planet Earth.

769
0:37:47.3,000 --> 0:37:48,000
And we're all that.

770
0:37:49.831,000 --> 0:37:51,000
(Applause)

771
0:37:52.831,000 --> 0:37:53,000
CF: And finally,

772
0:37:54.006,000 --> 0:37:58,000
the man who brought this issue so powerfully to everyone's attention

773
0:37:58.744,000 --> 0:37:59,000
years ago

774
0:38:00.252,000 --> 0:38:05,000

775

0:38:29.479,000 --> 0:38:3,000
I have just three messages.

785
0:38:31.268,000 --> 0:38:34,000
Number one, this crisis is incredibly urgent.

786
0:38:35.495,000 --> 0:38:38,000
Just yesterday, the scientists gave us the report

787
0:38:38.843,000 --> 0:38:4,000
that emissions are still going up.

788
0:38:41.597,000 --> 0:38:42,000
Every single day,

789
0:38:42.907,000 --> 0:38:47,000
we're putting 150 million tons of man-made global warming pollution

790
0:38:48.789,000 --> 0:38:51,000
into the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet.

791
0:38:52.305,000 --> 0:38:56,000
The accumulated amount now traps as much extra energy every day

792
0:38:56.712,000 --> 0:39:01,000
as would be released by 500,000 first-generation atomic bombs

793
0:39:01.952,000 --> 0:39:03,000
exploding every single day.

794
0:39:04.543,000 --> 0:39:07,000
And the consequences are increasingly clear --

795
0:39:07.829,000 --> 0:39:09,000
all that mother nature is telling us,

796
0:39:10.776,000 --> 0:39:11,000
the fires, and the sea-level rise,

797
0:39:12.593,000 --> 0:39:14,000
and the floods, and the mud slides,

798
0:39:14.72,000 --> 0:39:15,000
and the loss of living species.

799
0:39:16.696,000 --> 0:39:2,000
But the second message that I have is the hope is very real.

800
0:39:21.559,000 --> 0:39:25,000
We actually do have the solutions available to us.

801
0:39:25.639,000 --> 0:39:28,000
It is unfortunately true at this moment,

802
0:39:28.68,000 --> 0:39:33,000
that the crisis is getting worse faster than we are mobilizing these solutions.

803
0:39:34.56,000 --> 0:39:36,000
But renewable energy and electric vehicles

804
0:39:36.68,000 --> 0:39:38,000
and batteries and regenerative agriculture,

805
0:39:38.982,000 --> 0:39:39,000
circular manufacturing,

806
0:39:40.792,000 --> 0:39:43,000
and all of these other solutions are gaining momentum.

807
0:39:45.162,000 --> 0:39:46,000
The late economist Rudi Dornbusch,

808
0:39:46.932,000 --> 0:39:49,000
in articulating what's known as Dornbusch's law, said,

809
0:39:50.726,000 --> 0:39:53,000
"Things take longer to happen than you think they will.

810
0:39:54.234,000 --> 0:39:57,000
But then, they happen much faster than you thought they could."

811
0:39:57.919,000 --> 0:39:59,000
We can pick up the pace.

812
0:40:00.34,000 --> 0:40:01,000
We are gaining momentum

813
0:40:02.11,000 --> 0:40:04,000
and soon, we will be gaining on the crisis.

814
0:40:04.919,000 --> 0:40:07,000
But it is essential that everyone join --

815
0:40:07.96,000 --> 0:40:09,000
of every political persuasion,

816
0:40:10.173,000 --> 0:40:12,000
every ideological persuasion,

817
0:40:12.411,000 --> 0:40:13,000
every nationality,

818
0:40:13.678,000 --> 0:40:17,000
every division has to be obliterated, so that we, humanity,

819
0:40:18.427,000 --> 0:40:2,000
can join together.

820
0:40:20.466,000 --> 0:40:24,000
And in closing, I would just say that for anyone who doubts

821
0:40:24.625,000 --> 0:40:26,000
that we as human beings

822
0:40:27.396,000 --> 0:40:3,000
have the ability to rise to this occasion,

823
0:40:31.197,000 --> 0:40:33,000
when everything is on the line,

824
0:40:33.323,000 --> 0:40:37,000
just remember that political will is itself a renewable resource.

825
0:40:38.885,000 --> 0:40:39,000
(Laughter)

826
0:40:39.91,000 --> 0:40:46,000
(Applause)

827
0:40:50.554,000 --> 0:40:51,000
CA: Thank you so much.

828
0:40:51.776,000 --> 0:40:53,000
Thank you so much, Al, for your leadership on this issue

829
0:40:54.442,000 --> 0:40:55,000
for so many years.

830
0:40:56.617,000 --> 0:40:57,000
None of this would be possible

831
0:40:58.433,000 --> 0:41:01,000
without an extraordinary and fast-growing list of partners.

832
0:41:02.18,000 --> 0:41:03,000
I'd like to acknowledge them.

833
0:41:04.791,000 --> 0:41:08,000
(Applause)

834
0:41:08.912,000 --> 0:41:09,000
If you're watching this,

835
0:41:10.134,000 --> 0:41:12,000
you believe your organization should be part of this,

836
0:41:12.849,000 --> 0:41:13,000
you can help in some way,

837
0:41:14.563,000 --> 0:41:16,000
join us, email me, chris@ted.com.

838
0:41:17.434,000 --> 0:41:19,000
This is going to take everyone.

839
0:41:19.887,000 --> 0:41:2,000
OK, before the Q and A,

840
0:41:21.831,000 --> 0:41:24,000
I just want to ask you a question personally, Christiana.

841
0:41:25.188,000 --> 0:41:26,000
Like, what do you really think?

842
0:41:27.554,000 --> 0:41:28,000
(Laughter)

843
0:41:28.601,000 --> 0:41:3,000
No, you've been in so many of these.

844
0:41:31.569,000 --> 0:41:33,000
Does this initiative have a chance?

845
0:41:35.394,000 --> 0:41:37,000
CF: Well, first of all,

846
0:41:38.061,000 --> 0:41:41,000
we are at the point where everything plays.

847
0:41:41.608,000 --> 0:41:42,000
Everything plays.

848
0:41:43.434,000 --> 0:41:45,000
And I'm really excited about this,

849
0:41:46.069,000 --> 0:41:51,000
because it has been very painful to me to see how over the past 12 to 18 months

850
0:41:51.751,000 --> 0:41:54,000
because of the tragically insufficient response

851
0:41:55.124,000 --> 0:41:56,000
that we have had to climate change,

852
0:41:56.903,000 --> 0:41:59,000
how that zeitgeist has been changing from where we were in Paris,

853
0:42:00.212,000 --> 0:42:02,000
which was pretty positive and optimistic,

854
0:42:02.522,000 --> 0:42:05,000
to, now, despair, helplessness, anger.

855
0:42:06.602,000 --> 0:42:08,000
That's what is out there, roaming on the streets.

856
0:42:08.92,000 --> 0:42:1,000
And I don't blame them, and I have the same feelings.

857
0:42:11.421,000 --> 0:42:12,000
But the point is,

858
0:42:12.681,000 --> 0:42:16,000
we have to be able to transform that into making the difference.

859
0:42:17.4,000 --> 0:42:21,000
And I think this is what this initiative is actually potentially ready to do,

860
0:42:22.392,000 --> 0:42:26,000
which is to give every single person who feels helpless --

861
0:42:26.696,000 --> 0:42:28,000
give them a tool to do something.

862
0:42:29.506,000 --> 0:42:31,000
Some will contribute small efforts,

863
0:42:31.832,000 --> 0:42:32,000
some will contribute large efforts --

864
0:42:33.638,000 --> 0:42:36,000
depends on what your influence area is.

865
0:42:37.108,000 --> 0:42:42,000
And to those who feel angry and despairing,

866
0:42:42.538,000 --> 0:42:46,000
well, give them also an opportunity to channel that energy --

867
0:42:47.371,000 --> 0:42:48,000
which is very powerful energy --

868
0:42:49.221,000 --> 0:42:51,000
into solutions.

869
0:42:51.815,000 --> 0:42:54,000
And finally, what is very exciting about this

870
0:42:54.879,000 --> 0:42:56,000
is the scale, Chris, right?

871
0:42:56.942,000 --> 0:42:59,000
I mean, just look at those partners that are going to be there.

872
0:43:00.807,000 --> 0:43:03,000
We have attempted many, many things to bring to scale.

873
0:43:04.199,000 --> 0:43:09,000
But this, I think, is the most promising initiative that I have seen,

874
0:43:09.23,000 --> 0:43:11,000
to be able to bring people to scale,

875
0:43:11.461,000 --> 0:43:13,000
to bring efforts and solutions to scale.

876
0:43:13.879,000 --> 0:43:14,000
And speed.

877
0:43:15.577,000 --> 0:43:19,000
Because if there's one thing that we cannot, cannot fail on,

878
0:43:20.498,000 --> 0:43:21,000
is addressing climate change,

879
0:43:22.022,000 --> 0:43:23,000
but not only that,

880
0:43:23.204,000 --> 0:43:24,000
to do so in a timely way.

881
0:43:25.625,000 --> 0:43:27,000
CA: Thank you, that is eloquent.

882
0:43:27.839,000 --> 0:43:28,000
And thank you.

883
0:43:29.022,000 --> 0:43:3,000
That's it.

884
0:43:30.199,000 --> 0:43:37,000
(Applause)

885
0:43:37.561,000 --> 0:43:42,000
OK, we have many members of the world's leading media here.

886
0:43:43.466,000 --> 0:43:44,000
We're going to have a Q and A,

887
0:43:44.935,000 --> 0:43:46,000
they should probably have priority on questions.

888
0:43:47.26,000 --> 0:43:5,000
If it all goes deathly silent, someone else can ask a question.

889
0:43:50.299,000 --> 0:43:52,000
If you're a member of the media here,

890
0:43:52.58,000 --> 0:43:55,000
please feel free to put your hand up -- we'll throw a mic to you,

891
0:43:56.138,000 --> 0:43:57,000
and we'll do the best we can.

892
0:43:59.022,000 --> 0:44:01,000
Rachel Crane: Hi, Rachel Crane from CNN.

893
0:44:01.363,000 --> 0:44:04,000
My question for you is about more specific action

894
0:44:04.403,000 --> 0:44:05,000
that will come out of Countdown.

895
0:44:05.99,000 --> 0:44:06,000
We heard a lot today

896
0:44:07.165,000 --> 0:44:09,000
about how this is mobilizing the globe on this issue,

897
0:44:09.681,000 --> 0:44:12,000
breaking people out of their silos, companies out of their silos,

898
0:44:12.799,000 --> 0:44:14,000
but I'm curious to know, paint a picture for us,

899
0:44:15.094,000 --> 0:44:18,000
of what the action that will come out of this initiative

900
0:44:18.443,000 --> 0:44:19,000
could potentially look like.

901
0:44:19.809,000 --> 0:44:2,000
I'm sure it's all in early phases,

902
0:44:21.618,000 --> 0:44:23,000
we won't hold you specifically to this.

903
0:44:23.713,000 --> 0:44:27,000
CA: There's an intense process going on between now and October,

904
0:44:27.854,000 --> 0:44:28,000
where we're trying to engage

905
0:44:29.251,000 --> 0:44:32,000
all of the world's best thinking on climate

906
0:44:32.751,000 --> 0:44:33,000
around those five big areas.

907
0:44:34.664,000 --> 0:44:37,000
What we're hoping to have there is multiple proposals in there

908
0:44:38.081,000 --> 0:44:42,000
that collectively take a huge bite out of those issues.

909
0:44:42.749,000 --> 0:44:45,000
Some of them, there may be one big one that dominates.

910
0:44:46.448,000 --> 0:44:48,000
You know, so transport, for example.

911
0:44:49.455,000 --> 0:44:51,000
Could we accelerate the end

912
0:44:51.631,000 --> 0:44:53,000
of the internal combustion engine, somehow?

913
0:44:53.747,000 --> 0:44:54,000
What would that take?

914
0:44:54.956,000 --> 0:44:56,000
That would be a classic problem made for this approach,

915
0:44:57.627,000 --> 0:44:59,000
because what governments decide right now

916
0:45:00.548,000 --> 0:45:03,000
depends on what they see happening elsewhere.

917
0:45:04.259,000 --> 0:45:06,000
Would the decisions of auto executives be shifted

918
0:45:06.751,000 --> 0:45:08,000
if they saw millions of people on social media saying,

919
0:45:09.612,000 --> 0:45:11,000
"I will never buy a combustion engine"?

920
0:45:11.663,000 --> 0:45:14,000
Would they be shifted by the market signal of a few hundred mayors, saying,

921
0:45:15.385,000 --> 0:45:19,000
"We are creating a carbon-zero zone in our city,

922
0:45:19.512,000 --> 0:45:2,000
and we're going to expand it,

923
0:45:21.33,000 --> 0:45:22,000
and we're doing that soon"?

924
0:45:22.665,000 --> 0:45:25,000
Would they be shifted by a visionary auto CEO taking the risk

925
0:45:26.657,000 --> 0:45:27,000
and coming forward and saying,

926
0:45:28.094,000 --> 0:45:31,000
"You know when we said we were going to continue this till 2050?

927
0:45:31.139,000 --> 0:45:32,000
No. We can see the writing on the wall,

928
0:45:33.027,000 --> 0:45:35,000
we want to be on the right side of history,

929
0:45:35.099,000 --> 0:45:36,000
we're doing this in 2030."

930
0:45:36.376,000 --> 0:45:38,000
We think there might be a pathway to that.

931
0:45:38.447,000 --> 0:45:39,000
So on some of these issues,

932
0:45:39.807,000 --> 0:45:44,000
it's going to depend on a massive amount of discussion, bringing people together,

933
0:45:44.871,000 --> 0:45:47,000
showing -- this is what you're so masterful at --

934
0:45:48.42,000 --> 0:45:5,000
is showing that other people don't have the attitudes

935
0:45:50.942,000 --> 0:45:51,000
that you think they have.

936
0:45:52.268,000 --> 0:45:54,000
They're actually shifting, you better shift.

937
0:45:54.347,000 --> 0:45:58,000
And so it's mutually raising everyone's ambition level.

938
0:45:58.863,000 --> 0:46:,000
And that is a cycle that happens,

939
0:46:01.339,000 --> 0:46:02,000
and we've already seen it happening.

940
0:46:03.149,000 --> 0:46:05,000
And so, on each of these issues, that's what we're looking for.

941
0:46:06.165,000 --> 0:46:07,000
The biggest, boldest things.

942
0:46:07.807,000 --> 0:46:08,000
Dream bigger than we normally do,

943
0:46:09.72,000 --> 0:46:12,000
because there are more people at the table than there normally are,

944
0:46:13.426,000 --> 0:46:16,000
i.e. millions of citizens engaged in this.

945
0:46:16.53,000 --> 0:46:18,000
That's the process, and while that is happening,

946
0:46:19.141,000 --> 0:46:22,000
there'll be multiple other engagements in companies and cities around the world.

947
0:46:23.085,000 --> 0:46:27,000
We hope that it all comes together in a thrilling manner in October

948
0:46:27.133,000 --> 0:46:28,000
and we have something to celebrate.

949
0:46:28.836,000 --> 0:46:3,000
Dominique Drakeford: My name is Dominique Drakeford

950
0:46:31.297,000 --> 0:46:34,000
with MelaninASS, or social media as a form of media.

951
0:46:36.836,000 --> 0:46:38,000
In understanding the inherent correlation

952
0:46:39.847,000 --> 0:46:44,000
between the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere

953
0:46:45.109,000 --> 0:46:47,000
and the cumulative exploitation

954
0:46:47.699,000 --> 0:46:51,000
and extraction, extractivism economy,

955
0:46:52.482,000 --> 0:46:56,000
which creates sacrifice zones for black and indigenous communities,

956
0:46:56.76,000 --> 0:46:58,000
how do we plan to,

957
0:46:59.053,000 --> 0:47:04,000
or how do you guys plan to mitigate those systems of oppression

958
0:47:04.633,000 --> 0:47:09,000
as part of your strategies within those five various components,

959
0:47:09.734,000 --> 0:47:12,000
so that we can really begin to reduce emissions?

960
0:47:13.829,000 --> 0:47:15,000
CF: If the transformation in our economy and our society

961
0:47:16.61,000 --> 0:47:21,000
does not include inequality closing and social justice issues,

962
0:47:22.275,000 --> 0:47:23,000
then we're doing nothing.

963
0:47:24.115,000 --> 0:47:26,000
Because all of those things will come back to bite us.

964
0:47:26.687,000 --> 0:47:29,000
So we have to put our arms around the entire package.

965
0:47:30.275,000 --> 0:47:32,000
That is not easy, but it is entirely possible.

966
0:47:32.561,000 --> 0:47:35,000
And that's one of the things that I am so excited about climate change,

967
0:47:35.95,000 --> 0:47:39,000
because it is at the front of this transformation,

968
0:47:40.053,000 --> 0:47:43,000
but it will bring many of the other issues

969
0:47:43.879,000 --> 0:47:49,000
that have been relegated to nonattention.

970
0:47:49.971,000 --> 0:47:51,000
It will bring those issues to the fore as well.

971
0:47:52.273,000 --> 0:47:56,000
So the transformation has to be an integrative transformation.

972
0:47:56.694,000 --> 0:47:57,000
Ellen Maloney: Hi, Chris, hi, Christina.

973
0:47:58.641,000 --> 0:48:,000
My question is, are individual efforts,

974
0:48:01.387,000 --> 0:48:05,000
like ditching plastic straws or going vegan,

975
0:48:05.712,000 --> 0:48:06,000
making a difference

976
0:48:06.99,000 --> 0:48:09,000
or are they just tokenistic drops in the ocean?

977
0:48:10.173,000 --> 0:48:11,000
CF: Good question.

978
0:48:11.379,000 --> 0:48:12,000
CA: It's a good question.

979
0:48:12.831,000 --> 0:48:14,000
CF: They are totally important.

980
0:48:15.173,000 --> 0:48:16,000
Absolutely important.

981
0:48:16.721,000 --> 0:48:19,000
Because it's not just about the one straw that I use.

982
0:48:19.975,000 --> 0:48:21,000
It's about me not using that straw,

983
0:48:22.571,000 --> 0:48:24,000
going to a restaurant and telling the waitress,

984
0:48:24.824,000 --> 0:48:26,000
"Excuse me, I don't want a plastic straw, because --"

985
0:48:27.395,000 --> 0:48:28,000
and giving her a little lesson,

986
0:48:28.942,000 --> 0:48:31,000
then she goes up to the manager, the manager comes to the table and says,

987
0:48:32.456,000 --> 0:48:34,000
"Excuse me, could you explain that to me?"

988
0:48:34.575,000 --> 0:48:35,000
Then you go through the lesson.

989
0:48:36.112,000 --> 0:48:37,000
And sooner than you think,

990
0:48:37.425,000 --> 0:48:39,000
you have that restaurant, plus the other ones.

991
0:48:39.692,000 --> 0:48:41,000
Actually, information is contagious.

992
0:48:42.736,000 --> 0:48:45,000
And wanting to do the right thing is also contagious.

993
0:48:46.419,000 --> 0:48:5,000
So don't look at it as just simply, you know, "What is a straw?

994
0:48:50.466,000 --> 0:48:55,000
Am I using the straw or am I not using plastic bags,

995
0:48:56.042,000 --> 0:49:02,000
I have my plant-based bags to go shopping," etc., etc.

996
0:49:03.575,000 --> 0:49:04,000
All of that counts.

997
0:49:05.244,000 --> 0:49:06,000
It counts for you, first of all,

998
0:49:06.98,000 --> 0:49:11,000
because it is a personal reminder of who you are and what you stand for,

999
0:49:12.078,000 --> 0:49:16,000
but it is also a very important tool

1000
0:49:16.134,000 --> 0:49:18,000
to educate everyone around you.

1001
0:49:18.721,000 --> 0:49:2,000
CA: Right, and I think the core of our initiative is,

1002
0:49:21.285,000 --> 0:49:23,000
all that stuff matters -- what you eat,

1003
0:49:23.456,000 --> 0:49:25,000
how you transport yourself, etc., it matters a lot.

1004
0:49:25.885,000 --> 0:49:28,000
But there is another piece of power that individuals have

1005
0:49:29.841,000 --> 0:49:32,000
that they don't think about as much, perhaps,

1006
0:49:33.315,000 --> 0:49:35,000
and that we think that they should, we invite them to,

1007
0:49:35.919,000 --> 0:49:37,000
which is what they can do as an employee

1008
0:49:38.085,000 --> 0:49:4,000
and what they can do as a member of a city.

1009
0:49:40.125,000 --> 0:49:41,000
There's a coming together here,

1010
0:49:41.871,000 --> 0:49:44,000
where by getting organized, by connecting with others,

1011
0:49:44.895,000 --> 0:49:47,000
we think there is a direct route to changing decisions

1012
0:49:48.567,000 --> 0:49:51,000
that will have an even bigger impact on the problem.

1013
0:49:51.761,000 --> 0:49:54,000
So it's yes, all of that, but more as well.

1014
0:49:55.391,000 --> 0:49:56,000
(Laughter)

1015
0:49:56.598,000 --> 0:50:,000
CF: There is an online [question], from a classroom of children.

1016
0:50:00.923,000 --> 0:50:01,000
CA: From a classroom of children?

1017
0:50:02.576,000 --> 0:50:03,000
CF: "What can students do?"

1018
0:50:03.931,000 --> 0:50:05,000
Yay, I love that question, totally love that question.

1019
0:50:06.736,000 --> 0:50:07,000
So first of all,

1020
0:50:08.45,000 --> 0:50:1,000
Fridays, 11 o'clock, go strike.

1021
0:50:11.668,000 --> 0:50:12,000
I mean, honestly, right?

1022
0:50:13.315,000 --> 0:50:14,000
(Applause)

1023
0:50:14.704,000 --> 0:50:15,000
Let's go, let's go.

1024
0:50:16.085,000 --> 0:50:18,000
And that pressure has to be maintained.

1025
0:50:18.673,000 --> 0:50:2,000
I'm totally delighted that there's some people here

1026
0:50:21.22,000 --> 0:50:23,000
who've been here doing it for 52 weeks.

1027
0:50:24.133,000 --> 0:50:25,000
The problem with this is, folks,

1028
0:50:25.912,000 --> 0:50:27,000
this is not a sprint, it's a marathon.

1029
0:50:28.65,000 --> 0:50:32,000
So you better get ready for many more 52 weeks, right?

1030
0:50:32.88,000 --> 0:50:33,000
And get more people involved,

1031
0:50:34.435,000 --> 0:50:36,000
because this is not easy.

1032
0:50:36.673,000 --> 0:50:37,000
If it were easy, we would have done it.

1033
0:50:38.577,000 --> 0:50:4,000
This is going to be a long-term effort.

1034
0:50:40.927,000 --> 0:50:42,000
But fantastic to be out there in the streets,

1035
0:50:43.585,000 --> 0:50:45,000
you are getting so much more attention from the media,

1036
0:50:46.149,000 --> 0:50:49,000
from us stupid adults who have not done our job --

1037
0:50:49.268,000 --> 0:50:5,000
it is fantastic.

1038
0:50:50.442,000 --> 0:50:52,000
So, you know, get your voices out there.

1039
0:50:52.823,000 --> 0:50:53,000
Also, in school,

1040
0:50:54.458,000 --> 0:50:57,000
you can definitely go and improve --

1041
0:50:57.736,000 --> 0:50:59,000
The question that you just asked to TED,

1042
0:50:59.95,000 --> 0:51:02,000
that's the question every student should be asking their school:

1043
0:51:02.998,000 --> 0:51:03,000
"Where's my energy coming from?"

1044
0:51:04.614,000 --> 0:51:05,000
Let's get with it, right?

1045
0:51:05.875,000 --> 0:51:06,000
Students in colleges --

1046
0:51:07.301,000 --> 0:51:1,000
how is it possible that we still have colleges and universities

1047
0:51:10.328,000 --> 0:51:13,000
that are not 100 percent clean energy

1048
0:51:13.517,000 --> 0:51:17,000
and that haven't shifted their capital and their endowment

1049
0:51:17.605,000 --> 0:51:19,000
over to low carbon?

1050
0:51:19.653,000 --> 0:51:2,000
I mean, it's just incredible.

1051
0:51:21.18,000 --> 0:51:22,000
(Applause)

1052
0:51:23.125,000 --> 0:51:27,000
And finally, the most important thing that young people can do

1053
0:51:27.387,000 --> 0:51:29,000
is ask your parents,

1054
0:51:30.141,000 --> 0:51:32,000
"What the hell are you doing about my future?"

1055
0:51:33.3,000 --> 0:51:36,000
Because here is an amazing thing.

1056
0:51:37.241,000 --> 0:51:39,000
I have spoken in -- I was thinking how many --

1057
0:51:39.749,000 --> 0:51:44,000
I've spoken to at least three if not four CEOs from the oil and gas industry.

1058
0:51:45.209,000 --> 0:51:49,000
I've spoken to three or four major investors,

1059
0:51:49.567,000 --> 0:51:51,000
heads of their investment firms,

1060
0:51:51.694,000 --> 0:51:54,000
who come up to me, usually in private,

1061
0:51:54.956,000 --> 0:51:59,000
and say, "Christiana, the reason why I'm changing what I do in my business

1062
0:52:00.679,000 --> 0:52:03,000
is because my daughter, or my son,

1063
0:52:03.973,000 --> 0:52:08,000
asks me at night, 'What the hell are you doing about my future?' "

1064
0:52:10.209,000 --> 0:52:12,000
That is a very powerful question,

1065
0:52:13.146,000 --> 0:52:15,000
and only young people can ask that question.

1066
0:52:16.09,000 --> 0:52:18,000
Use that tool --

1067
0:52:18.377,000 --> 0:52:21,000
ask your parents what are they doing about your future.

1068
0:52:22.141,000 --> 0:52:23,000
Sorry about the h-word.

1069
0:52:24.322,000 --> 0:52:3,000
(Applause)

1070
0:52:31.107,000 --> 0:52:33,000
Jo Confino: Hi, I'm Jo Confino, the HuffPost.

1071
0:52:33.464,000 --> 0:52:35,000
Christiana, a question for you,

1072
0:52:35.607,000 --> 0:52:38,000
which is one of the things that didn't come out so much

1073
0:52:38.818,000 --> 0:52:4,000
and this is about the spiritual traditions

1074
0:52:41.307,000 --> 0:52:43,000
and the role they play,

1075
0:52:43.609,000 --> 0:52:44,000
because what we're seeing

1076
0:52:45.24,000 --> 0:52:47,000
is that, actually, old wisdom is coming out

1077
0:52:47.563,000 --> 0:52:48,000
in terms of interdependence

1078
0:52:49.106,000 --> 0:52:51,000
and nothing is separate from anything else.

1079
0:52:51.143,000 --> 0:52:53,000
What is the spiritual tradition we can bring to this

1080
0:52:53.675,000 --> 0:52:54,000
that will make, also, a difference?

1081
0:52:55.417,000 --> 0:52:58,000
CF: What I think is very powerful about understanding,

1082
0:52:58.755,000 --> 0:53:01,000
whether you happen to be a spiritual person

1083
0:53:02.315,000 --> 0:53:05,000
that pursues meditation and mindfulness

1084
0:53:06.131,000 --> 0:53:08,000
or whether you're a religious person or not,

1085
0:53:08.694,000 --> 0:53:1,000
what I think is very powerful

1086
0:53:10.797,000 --> 0:53:14,000
about the spiritual understanding of the human presence on this earth,

1087
0:53:15.736,000 --> 0:53:19,000
is to understand that we are not separate.

1088
0:53:20.371,000 --> 0:53:23,000
It's not like, "Over there is planet Earth,

1089
0:53:23.505,000 --> 0:53:25,000
and then humans are over here."

1090
0:53:25.696,000 --> 0:53:27,000
And we are totally interconnected with all other species

1091
0:53:28.63,000 --> 0:53:29,000
and with all other living beings,

1092
0:53:30.411,000 --> 0:53:33,000
and doing the responsible thing by them,

1093
0:53:34.101,000 --> 0:53:36,000
does the responsible thing by us.

1094
0:53:36.196,000 --> 0:53:37,000
And vice versa.

1095
0:53:37.546,000 --> 0:53:38,000
And so that interconnectedness

1096
0:53:39.387,000 --> 0:53:41,000
is one that comes from the spiritual traditions,

1097
0:53:41.871,000 --> 0:53:44,000
but you don't have to be religious or spiritual to understand that.

1098
0:53:45.101,000 --> 0:53:46,000
You know, the fact is,

1099
0:53:46.498,000 --> 0:53:49,000
every single drop of water that we drink comes from nature.

1100
0:53:50.132,000 --> 0:53:52,000
Every single morsel of food that we eat

1101
0:53:52.569,000 --> 0:53:53,000
comes from nature.

1102
0:53:53.744,000 --> 0:53:55,000
And we've got to heal that connection.

1103
0:53:56.133,000 --> 0:53:57,000
CA: We would welcome engagement.

1104
0:53:57.704,000 --> 0:54:,000
(Applause)

1105
0:54:01.815,000 --> 0:54:04,000
Kaley Roshitsh: Hi, Kaley Roshitsh from Women's Wear Daily.

1106
0:54:04.95,000 --> 0:54:06,000
Obviously, the fashion industry is responsible for a lot

1107
0:54:07.721,000 --> 0:54:08,000
of the carbon output,

1108
0:54:09.258,000 --> 0:54:12,000
so I wondered what is your perspective on conscious consumption?

1109
0:54:13.496,000 --> 0:54:17,000
CA: The key goal here is to align, at the same time,

1110
0:54:18.027,000 --> 0:54:2,000
to change opinion on what companies do,

1111
0:54:20.29,000 --> 0:54:22,000
what employees do, what consumers do.

1112
0:54:22.988,000 --> 0:54:26,000
It's the shifts all happening at the same time that can make change.

1113
0:54:27.686,000 --> 0:54:29,000
Right now, someone else is always the problem.

1114
0:54:29.893,000 --> 0:54:31,000
"Our investors wouldn't allow us to do that."

1115
0:54:32.051,000 --> 0:54:35,000
"There is no market for this better, more sustainable product."

1116
0:54:35.965,000 --> 0:54:38,000
And so, all the pieces need to happen at the same time.

1117
0:54:39.06,000 --> 0:54:4,000
That's our hope.

1118
0:54:40.806,000 --> 0:54:42,000
And so the lead on this is not us,

1119
0:54:42.998,000 --> 0:54:45,000
it's employees and CEOs and leadership teams

1120
0:54:46.41,000 --> 0:54:48,000
working in that industry.

1121
0:54:49.657,000 --> 0:54:51,000
Get together, make something happen.

1122
0:54:52.242,000 --> 0:54:56,000
And ride the tide of the zeitgeist shift that is happening --

1123
0:54:57.006,000 --> 0:54:59,000
it's going to work out from the business point of view as well.

1124
0:55:00.002,000 --> 0:55:01,000
CF: Can I jump on that as well?

1125
0:55:01.682,000 --> 0:55:04,000
Because for years, for centuries,

1126
0:55:05.317,000 --> 0:55:1,000
we have been on a consumer extract-and-consume mentality.

1127
0:55:10.365,000 --> 0:55:11,000
They way we go about our life

1128
0:55:12.292,000 --> 0:55:14,000
and the way that businesses are created

1129
0:55:14.403,000 --> 0:55:17,000
is extract, use, discard, extract, use, discard.

1130
0:55:18.101,000 --> 0:55:21,000
That's a simplification, but honestly, it's about as simple as that.

1131
0:55:21.375,000 --> 0:55:25,000
And to understand that that linear extraction to discard

1132
0:55:26.002,000 --> 0:55:29,000
can no longer be the case, that it needs to be circular now,

1133
0:55:29.041,000 --> 0:55:32,000
we have to go into a circular economy

1134
0:55:32.588,000 --> 0:55:34,000
that uses every single resource that we extract --

1135
0:55:35.504,000 --> 0:55:36,000
because we will continue to extract --

1136
0:55:37.354,000 --> 0:55:4,000
that uses it not once but two, three, four, five, 10 times,

1137
0:55:40.477,000 --> 0:55:41,000
around and around in circles.

1138
0:55:42.016,000 --> 0:55:43,000
That's a circular economy.

1139
0:55:43.411,000 --> 0:55:45,000
And we have to get to that point,

1140
0:55:45.514,000 --> 0:55:49,000
because frankly, we're running out of resources to continue to extract.

1141
0:55:50.109,000 --> 0:55:52,000
Jodi Xu Klein: Hi, my name is Jodi Xu Klein.

1142
0:55:52.395,000 --> 0:55:57,000
I'm with the South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong publication here in the US.

1143
0:55:57.466,000 --> 0:56:,000
So, we've been reporting on trade war for more than a year,

1144
0:56:00.992,000 --> 0:56:02,000
and we're actually living in a world

1145
0:56:03.623,000 --> 0:56:05,000
where countries are decoupling from each other.

1146
0:56:06.531,000 --> 0:56:11,000
How do you overcome that trend and bring everyone together?

1147
0:56:11.889,000 --> 0:56:12,000
CA: We don't know,

1148
0:56:13.111,000 --> 0:56:14,000
these are really challenging issues.

1149
0:56:14.857,000 --> 0:56:16,000
What we do know is that we have to bring everyone to the table

1150
0:56:17.793,000 --> 0:56:18,000
and have the discussion.

1151
0:56:19.055,000 --> 0:56:2,000
There are so many people in China,

1152
0:56:20.738,000 --> 0:56:21,000
including, on many occasions,

1153
0:56:22.151,000 --> 0:56:25,000
the Chinese government has made bold steps

1154
0:56:25.571,000 --> 0:56:26,000
to tackle this issue.

1155
0:56:27.476,000 --> 0:56:3,000
There's a lot that the West can learn from what's happening in China.

1156
0:56:31.085,000 --> 0:56:32,000
CF: I would say,

1157
0:56:32.26,000 --> 0:56:37,000
in a world in which we're seeing a wave of nationalism and populism,

1158
0:56:37.498,000 --> 0:56:4,000
the way we go at this is actually to expand

1159
0:56:41.361,000 --> 0:56:43,000
the breadth of engagement,

1160
0:56:44.338,000 --> 0:56:48,000
so not to let the responsibility of engaging on climate

1161
0:56:49.16,000 --> 0:56:51,000
be in national government hands only.

1162
0:56:51.566,000 --> 0:56:52,000
Yes, they have an important role,

1163
0:56:53.242,000 --> 0:56:55,000
but we can bring it down as well

1164
0:56:55.822,000 --> 0:56:59,000
to a different level of engagement which is every single human being.

1165
0:57:00.242,000 --> 0:57:03,000
And once we understand that we're all human beings

1166
0:57:03.381,000 --> 0:57:04,000
and that we all have a common future,

1167
0:57:05.175,000 --> 0:57:07,000
there's no such thing as all of us being in a boat

1168
0:57:07.619,000 --> 0:57:1,000
and only the one closest to the hole in the boat are going to sink.

1169
0:57:10.865,000 --> 0:57:11,000
No.

1170
0:57:12.04,000 --> 0:57:14,000
Either we all sink or we all float together.

1171
0:57:14.135,000 --> 0:57:16,000
Justine Calma: My name is Justine Calma, I'm with The Verge,

1172
0:57:16.984,000 --> 0:57:17,000
thanks so much for this.

1173
0:57:18.617,000 --> 0:57:23,000
My question is about TED and YouTube's own carbon footprint.

1174
0:57:24.276,000 --> 0:57:28,000
Streaming video eats up a huge amount of energy,

1175
0:57:28.371,000 --> 0:57:33,000
and I'm curious what TED and YouTube

1176
0:57:33.721,000 --> 0:57:36,000
might be doing to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions

1177
0:57:37.363,000 --> 0:57:38,000
connected to that.

1178
0:57:40.323,000 --> 0:57:42,000
CA: I can't speak for YouTube, obviously.

1179
0:57:42.868,000 --> 0:57:45,000
I will say that, to quote a line from George Monbiot,

1180
0:57:46.78,000 --> 0:57:48,000
all of us are hypocrites in this movement.

1181
0:57:49.161,000 --> 0:57:5,000
If you've ever bought something

1182
0:57:51.098,000 --> 0:57:54,000
or you're wearing clothes, or you're eating food,

1183
0:57:54.635,000 --> 0:57:56,000
you're a hypocrite, you're creating emissions.

1184
0:57:57.032,000 --> 0:57:58,000
It's part of life.

1185
0:57:58.77,000 --> 0:58:02,000
And I think perfection is --

1186
0:58:03.182,000 --> 0:58:04,000
There's a risk that perfection,

1187
0:58:04.95,000 --> 0:58:07,000
that an overpursuit and focus on that

1188
0:58:08.776,000 --> 0:58:11,000
and the judging that comes with it can slow everyone down.

1189
0:58:12.178,000 --> 0:58:15,000
We want this to be a coalition of the willing who accept

1190
0:58:15.71,000 --> 0:58:17,000
that they're not perfect but are willing to act.

1191
0:58:18.123,000 --> 0:58:22,000
Now, this whole process has sparked a huge conversation in TED

1192
0:58:22.345,000 --> 0:58:24,000
about how we act more responsibly,

1193
0:58:25.165,000 --> 0:58:26,000
and that will continue.

1194
0:58:26.511,000 --> 0:58:29,000
We're certainly not going to stop streaming videos.

1195
0:58:30.325,000 --> 0:58:31,000
At some point you have to do math,

1196
0:58:31.992,000 --> 0:58:34,000
it's like that -- give to the planet more than you take from it,

1197
0:58:35.079,000 --> 0:58:39,000
I think is the golden rule that I personally really believe in.

1198
0:58:39.174,000 --> 0:58:43,000
And so if an idea, powered by a little bit of electricity,

1199
0:58:43.69,000 --> 0:58:45,000
can ignite in someone's brain,

1200
0:58:45.832,000 --> 0:58:48,000
I would bet on the idea over saving the electricity.

1201
0:58:49.229,000 --> 0:58:5,000
But there's no perfection in this.

1202
0:58:50.879,000 --> 0:58:52,000
And we definitely have a lot that we need to improve on.

1203
0:58:53.545,000 --> 0:58:54,000
Let's go here and then back.

1204
0:58:54.942,000 --> 0:58:57,000
Lane Florsheim: Hi, I'm Lane Florsheim from the Wall Street Journal Magazine

1205
0:58:58.567,000 --> 0:59:,000
and Chris, I really liked what you were saying

1206
0:59:00.797,000 --> 0:59:02,000
about the fashion industry and what they can do to change

1207
0:59:03.535,000 --> 0:59:05,000
and how it requires employees and CEOs to meet together

1208
0:59:06.142,000 --> 0:59:09,000
because who understands an industry better than the people in it

1209
0:59:09.198,000 --> 0:59:1,000
and their processes and infrastructure,

1210
0:59:11.127,000 --> 0:59:14,000
but I'm wondering, what about companies with huge footprints,

1211
0:59:14.649,000 --> 0:59:17,000
and two that come to mind first are Amazon and Zara,

1212
0:59:18.498,000 --> 0:59:19,000
where, by all accounts,

1213
0:59:19.887,000 --> 0:59:21,000
the workers, the employees there don't have very much power

1214
0:59:22.8,000 --> 0:59:26,000
and the CEOs don't have very much incentive to change right now.

1215
0:59:27.18,000 --> 0:59:3,000
What would you say about those kinds of companies?

1216
0:59:31.307,000 --> 0:59:34,000
CA: So this is going to be such an important conversation going forward,

1217
0:59:34.726,000 --> 0:59:36,000
because we're in the ironic position

1218
0:59:37.006,000 --> 0:59:4,000
where the people who can do the most to solve this problem

1219
0:59:40.673,000 --> 0:59:42,000
are the people who are currently the worst offenders.

1220
0:59:43.443,000 --> 0:59:44,000
So what do we do?

1221
0:59:44.63,000 --> 0:59:46,000
Do we make them part of the conversation or not?

1222
0:59:47.252,000 --> 0:59:49,000
I say we make them part of the conversation,

1223
0:59:49.339,000 --> 0:59:51,000
so long as we see serious engagement.

1224
0:59:52.434,000 --> 0:59:53,000
So take Amazon.

1225
0:59:53.609,000 --> 0:59:57,000
Jeff Bezos has actually listened to what many of his employees have said --

1226
0:59:58.556,000 --> 1:00:,000
they've been very vigorous, the employee base there,

1227
1:00:01.014,000 --> 1:00:02,000
about carbon footprint --

1228
1:00:02.307,000 --> 1:00:05,000
has listened, has engaged with you and with others.

1229
1:00:05.696,000 --> 1:00:09,000
And they have announced, I think it's correct to say announced --

1230
1:00:09.875,000 --> 1:00:1,000
CF: Yes, they have.

1231
1:00:11.065,000 --> 1:00:13,000
CA: ... an acceleration of their own commitment

1232
1:00:13.737,000 --> 1:00:18,000
to go to, basically, a net zero track by 2040, if I have it right.

1233
1:00:19.357,000 --> 1:00:24,000
It's the companies with the thousands, the tens of thousands of trucks

1234
1:00:24.635,000 --> 1:00:25,000
and the packaging and all the rest of it.

1235
1:00:26.635,000 --> 1:00:28,000
That is how this problem will get solved.

1236
1:00:29.173,000 --> 1:00:34,000
So I say we invite these CEOs to be part of this,

1237
1:00:34.625,000 --> 1:00:37,000
and urge them to take it seriously

1238
1:00:37.927,000 --> 1:00:41,000
and to go fast and maybe even faster than they're completely comfortable doing.

1239
1:00:42.085,000 --> 1:00:43,000
But that's, I think, what we have to do.

1240
1:00:44.042,000 --> 1:00:48,000
Not to defame, denounce,

1241
1:00:48.218,000 --> 1:00:51,000
before we've at least had a serious conversation about,

1242
1:00:51.955,000 --> 1:00:52,000
"It's time,

1243
1:00:53.439,000 --> 1:00:54,000
your employees want to do this,

1244
1:00:54.963,000 --> 1:00:55,000
your customers want to do this,

1245
1:00:56.641,000 --> 1:00:59,000
your investors increasingly want to do this, let's do this."

1246
1:01:00.807,000 --> 1:01:01,000
That's our hope.

1247
1:01:01.982,000 --> 1:01:03,000
CF: And the wonderful thing about companies the size of Amazon,

1248
1:01:04.982,000 --> 1:01:05,000
or Walmart when they did it,

1249
1:01:06.494,000 --> 1:01:08,000
is that they have a huge trickle-up effect.

1250
1:01:09.26,000 --> 1:01:11,000
Because when Jeff Bezos came out and said,

1251
1:01:11.323,000 --> 1:01:13,000
"I'm going to make Amazon climate-neutral by 2040 -- "

1252
1:01:14.224,000 --> 1:01:15,000
Paris Agreement says 2050,

1253
1:01:15.498,000 --> 1:01:17,000
of course he wants to do everything better than that,

1254
1:01:18.028,000 --> 1:01:19,000
so 2040 is for Amazon.

1255
1:01:19.609,000 --> 1:01:21,000
Well good, we're going to keep him to it.

1256
1:01:21.657,000 --> 1:01:23,000
Now, the amazing thing about that

1257
1:01:23.888,000 --> 1:01:27,000
is that in order for Amazon to be climate-neutral by 2040,

1258
1:01:28.046,000 --> 1:01:31,000
they have to work with all their supply chain going up.

1259
1:01:31.18,000 --> 1:01:33,000
They have to work with all of those companies

1260
1:01:33.49,000 --> 1:01:35,000
that deliver services and goods to them

1261
1:01:35.807,000 --> 1:01:37,000
for them to also be climate neutral ASAP.

1262
1:01:38.354,000 --> 1:01:4,000
Because otherwise, they can't meet their own commitment.

1263
1:01:41.038,000 --> 1:01:45,000
So large companies are actually very, very key and instrumental to this,

1264
1:01:46.037,000 --> 1:01:48,000
because it's not just about their footprint,

1265
1:01:48.879,000 --> 1:01:53,000
it's about the embedded footprint that they inherit in their supply chain.

1266
1:01:54.141,000 --> 1:01:57,000
And the transformation of that is really huge.

1267
1:01:57.888,000 --> 1:01:58,000
CA: Last question.

1268
1:01:59.674,000 --> 1:02:01,000
Jackie Padilla: My name is Jackie with NowThis News,

1269
1:02:02.187,000 --> 1:02:04,000
and every day, I work with young climate activists

1270
1:02:04.652,000 --> 1:02:05,000
like the ones we've heard today,

1271
1:02:06.231,000 --> 1:02:07,000
but when we do stories on them,

1272
1:02:08.149,000 --> 1:02:09,000
you know, including Greta Thunberg,

1273
1:02:09.863,000 --> 1:02:11,000
I see fierce criticism that they face

1274
1:02:12.673,000 --> 1:02:14,000
and largely, it's because of a generational gap.

1275
1:02:15.395,000 --> 1:02:17,000
I don't know if you're familiar with the phrase "OK Boomer,"

1276
1:02:18.315,000 --> 1:02:23,000
but it seems like there's a lot of guilt or accountability

1277
1:02:23.389,000 --> 1:02:24,000
that some are looking for,

1278
1:02:24.688,000 --> 1:02:26,000
and on the other end, we're looking at a lack of education

1279
1:02:27.427,000 --> 1:02:28,000
or just ignorance on the issue.

1280
1:02:28.99,000 --> 1:02:32,000
So what is your advice to young people to respond to that criticism

1281
1:02:33.558,000 --> 1:02:35,000
to foster constructive conversations?

1282
1:02:36.424,000 --> 1:02:38,000
CF: We should probably ask them.

1283
1:02:38.511,000 --> 1:02:4,000
XB: Hi, thank you for your question.

1284
1:02:40.871,000 --> 1:02:41,000
CA: Come here.

1285
1:02:42.562,000 --> 1:02:43,000
(Applause)

1286
1:02:46.506,000 --> 1:02:48,000
XB: It is true that we increasingly face criticism,

1287
1:02:49.165,000 --> 1:02:52,000
and it's not only when we speak to people, with climate deniers

1288
1:02:52.307,000 --> 1:02:53,000
or things like that,

1289
1:02:53.482,000 --> 1:02:54,000
but also on social media.

1290
1:02:55.379,000 --> 1:02:58,000
It is as much a tool to spread information

1291
1:02:58.784,000 --> 1:02:59,000
and organize our strikes

1292
1:03:00.114,000 --> 1:03:01,000
and get the information out there,

1293
1:03:02.053,000 --> 1:03:05,000
but it's also a tool for people who want to undermine us,

1294
1:03:05.196,000 --> 1:03:07,000
to personally attack us.

1295
1:03:07.593,000 --> 1:03:1,000
And the way in which we stay resilient

1296
1:03:11.268,000 --> 1:03:14,000
is when we build community with each other,

1297
1:03:15.014,000 --> 1:03:16,000
when we organize,

1298
1:03:16.387,000 --> 1:03:18,000
we mimic the world we want to see.

1299
1:03:18.744,000 --> 1:03:2,000
There is no hierarchy in our organizing,

1300
1:03:21.395,000 --> 1:03:24,000
we are all working towards the same goal constructively,

1301
1:03:25.157,000 --> 1:03:3,000
choosing our passions towards making the strike the best it can be.

1302
1:03:30.523,000 --> 1:03:33,000
We got 300,000 people striking in New York,

1303
1:03:34.23,000 --> 1:03:36,000
we put together a whole concert,

1304
1:03:36.624,000 --> 1:03:38,000
people called it "Climchella," it was great.

1305
1:03:39.505,000 --> 1:03:4,000
(Laughter)

1306
1:03:41.322,000 --> 1:03:44,000
But the point is that it's not going to stop us.

1307
1:03:45.243,000 --> 1:03:46,000
The criticism is not going to stop us.

1308
1:03:47.156,000 --> 1:03:49,000
And even though we know that we are kids,

1309
1:03:49.839,000 --> 1:03:52,000
and we are not here to tell you all the solutions

1310
1:03:52.892,000 --> 1:03:54,000
that already are out there.

1311
1:03:56.125,000 --> 1:03:58,000
We are going to do it,

1312
1:03:58.512,000 --> 1:04:,000
because every kid who cares about the climate crisis

1313
1:04:00.974,000 --> 1:04:04,000
is going to grow up to study through an environmental lens

1314
1:04:05.649,000 --> 1:04:07,000
and to change the world through that.

1315
1:04:08.752,000 --> 1:04:11,000
So we are here to tell you,

1316
1:04:12.23,000 --> 1:04:16,000
personally, climate activists that I know don't use "OK Boomer,"

1317
1:04:16.623,000 --> 1:04:2,000
because we strive for intergenerational cooperation.

1318
1:04:21.84,000 --> 1:04:25,000
And I think that blaming and dividing each other

1319
1:04:26.245,000 --> 1:04:28,000
is not going to get us anywhere,

1320
1:04:28.594,000 --> 1:04:29,000
which is why we don't use it,

1321
1:04:30.229,000 --> 1:04:31,000
and I don't think it should be used,

1322
1:04:31.968,000 --> 1:04:35,000
and I actually want to thank everybody who is doing something,

1323
1:04:36.617,000 --> 1:04:39,000
because action inspires action.

1324
1:04:40.033,000 --> 1:04:42,000
And you inspire us,

1325
1:04:42.685,000 --> 1:04:44,000
and we're glad that we inspire you as well.

1326
1:04:45.508,000 --> 1:04:51,000
(Cheers and applause)

1327
1:04:52.291,000 --> 1:04:55,000
(Applause)

1328
1:04:55.402,000 --> 1:04:56,000
CA: Wow.

1329
1:04:56.577,000 --> 1:04:57,000
(Applause)

1330
1:04:57.654,000 --> 1:04:58,000
CF: There you have it.

1331
1:04:59.188,000 --> 1:05:02,000
(Applause and cheers)

1332
1:05:02.775,000 --> 1:05:07,000
(Applause)

1333
1:05:08.309,000 --> 1:05:12,000
CA: There is no better note on which to end this.

1334
1:05:13.214,000 --> 1:05:14,000
Thank you.

1335
1:05:14.389,000 --> 1:05:2,000

2
0:00:12.714,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hey guys.

3
0:00:14.041,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's funny, someone just mentioned MacGyver,

4
0:00:15.811,000 --> 0:00:16,000
because that was, like, I loved it,

5
0:00:17.751,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and when I was seven, I taped a fork to a drill

6
0:00:23.071,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I was like, "Hey, Mom, I'm going to Olive Garden."

7
0:00:25.792,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And -- (Drilling noise) (Laughter)

8
0:00:29.943,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And it worked really well there.

9
0:00:32.875,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And you know, it had a profound effect on me.

10
0:00:36.696,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It sounds silly, but I thought, okay,

11
0:00:38.924,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the way the world works can be changed,

12
0:00:41.796,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and it can be changed by me in these small ways.

13
0:00:43.947,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And my relationship to

14
0:00:45.661,000 --> 0:00:46,000
especially human-made objects

15
0:00:47.153,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which someone else said they work like this,

16
0:00:49.038,000 --> 0:00:52,000
well, I can say they work a different way, a little bit.

17
0:00:52.188,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And so, about 20 years later,

18
0:00:54.686,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I didn't realize the full effect of this,

19
0:00:56.194,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but I went to Costa Rica

20
0:00:57.971,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I stayed with these Guaymí natives there,

21
0:01:00.138,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them,

22
0:01:03.64,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and they could make beds out of trees,

23
0:01:06.809,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and they could -- I watched this woman for three days.

24
0:01:09.043,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart,

25
0:01:12.29,000 --> 0:01:15,000
these little threads off of it, and she'd roll the threads together

26
0:01:15.427,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and make little thicker threads, like strings,

27
0:01:18.145,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and she would weave the strings together,

28
0:01:20.966,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and as the materiality of this exact very bag

29
0:01:24.446,000 --> 0:01:26,000
formed before my eyes over those three days,

30
0:01:27.334,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the materiality of the way the world works,

31
0:01:30.641,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of reality, kind of started to unravel in my mind,

32
0:01:33.115,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because I realized that this bag and these clothes

33
0:01:36.463,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener,

34
0:01:38.847,000 --> 0:01:42,000
everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock

35
0:01:42.98,000 --> 0:01:44,000
or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to,

36
0:01:45.324,000 --> 0:01:48,000
maybe a more complicated one, but still, everything was made that way.

37
0:01:49.235,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And so I had to start studying,

38
0:01:51.427,000 --> 0:01:52,000
who is it that's making these decisions?

39
0:01:53.137,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Who's making these things? How did they make them?

40
0:01:54.946,000 --> 0:01:55,000
What stops us from making them?

41
0:01:56.44,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Because this is how reality is created.

42
0:01:59.345,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab,

43
0:02:01.932,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I was studying the maker movement

44
0:02:04.481,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and makers and creativity.

45
0:02:06.031,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I started in nature, because I saw these Guaymís

46
0:02:08.158,000 --> 0:02:11,000
doing it in nature, and there just seems to be less barriers.

47
0:02:11.203,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp,

48
0:02:14.548,000 --> 0:02:17,000
where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out

49
0:02:17.8,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and willing to try anything.

50
0:02:19.287,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So I said, "Let's go into the woods near this stream

51
0:02:21.58,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and just put stuff together, you know, make something,

52
0:02:23.609,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I don't care, geometrical shapes, just grab some junk from around you.

53
0:02:26.196,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We won't bring anything with us.

54
0:02:27.845,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And, like, within minutes, this is very easy for adults

55
0:02:30.364,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and teens to do.

56
0:02:31.452,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream,

57
0:02:34.587,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the shape of an oak leaf being made

58
0:02:37.171,000 --> 0:02:4,000
by other small oak leaves being put together.

59
0:02:40.365,000 --> 0:02:42,000
A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass.

60
0:02:43.102,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom

61
0:02:45.798,000 --> 0:02:48,000
being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it.

62
0:02:49.17,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And after about 45 minutes, you get really intricate projects

63
0:02:52.735,000 --> 0:02:55,000
like leaves sorted by hue, so you get a color fade

64
0:02:55.962,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and put in a circle like a wreath.

65
0:02:57.806,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the creator of this, he said,

66
0:03:00.422,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"This is fire. I call this fire."

67
0:03:02.092,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And someone asked him, "How do you get those sticks

68
0:03:04.319,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to stay on that tree?"

69
0:03:06.08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And he's like, "I don't know, but I can show you."

70
0:03:09.19,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I'm like, "Wow, that's really amazing.

71
0:03:10.822,000 --> 0:03:11,000
He doesn't know, but he can show you."

72
0:03:12.205,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So his hands know and his intuition knows,

73
0:03:14.785,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but sometimes what we know gets in the way

74
0:03:17.641,000 --> 0:03:19,000
of what could be, especially

75
0:03:19.678,000 --> 0:03:21,000
when it comes to the human-made, human-built world.

76
0:03:22.605,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We think we already know how something works,

77
0:03:24.902,000 --> 0:03:26,000
so we can't imagine how it could work.

78
0:03:27.045,000 --> 0:03:28,000
We know how it's supposed to work,

79
0:03:28.391,000 --> 0:03:31,000
so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible.

80
0:03:31.798,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So kids don't have as hard of a time with this,

81
0:03:35.645,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and I saw in my own son, I gave him this book.

82
0:03:38.93,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm a good hippie dad, so I'm like,

83
0:03:41.138,000 --> 0:03:43,000
"Okay, you're going to learn to love the moon.

84
0:03:43.315,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I'm going to give you some building blocks

85
0:03:45.648,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks,

86
0:03:48.798,000 --> 0:03:49,000
so it's totally legit."

87
0:03:50.612,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But he doesn't really know what to do with these.

88
0:03:52.886,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I didn't show him.

89
0:03:54.458,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so he's like, "Okay, I'll just mess around with this."

90
0:03:55.966,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest.

91
0:03:59.869,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Just going to try to put them in shapes

92
0:04:02.341,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and push on them and stuff.

93
0:04:04.117,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And before long, he's kind of got this mechanism

94
0:04:06.781,000 --> 0:04:09,000
where you can almost launch and catapult objects around,

95
0:04:10.451,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and he enlists us in helping him.

96
0:04:12.716,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And at this point, I'm starting to wonder,

97
0:04:14.651,000 --> 0:04:16,000
what kind of tools can we give people,

98
0:04:17.452,000 --> 0:04:19,000
especially adults, who know too much,

99
0:04:20.406,000 --> 0:04:22,000
so that they can see the world as malleable,

100
0:04:22.697,000 --> 0:04:23,000
so they see themselves as agents of change

101
0:04:24.174,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in their everyday lives.

102
0:04:25.636,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Because the most advanced scientists are really

103
0:04:28.122,000 --> 0:04:3,000
just kind of pushing the way the world itself works,

104
0:04:30.854,000 --> 0:04:31,000
pushing what matter can do,

105
0:04:32.031,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium,

106
0:04:34.812,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and any sufficiently complicated task,

107
0:04:36.758,000 --> 0:04:38,000
whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child --

108
0:04:39.683,000 --> 0:04:4,000
anything that's complicated --

109
0:04:41.369,000 --> 0:04:43,000
comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it,

110
0:04:43.896,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say,

111
0:04:47.222,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Okay, well we're just going to have to refigure this.

112
0:04:49.35,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing.

113
0:04:52.029,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'm going to use them a different way."

114
0:04:54.214,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So let me show you a little demo.

115
0:04:59.013,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is a little piano circuit right in here,

116
0:05:03.575,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and this is an ordinary paintbrush

117
0:05:05.666,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that I smashed it together with. (Beeping)

118
0:05:08.661,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And so, with some ketchup,

119
0:05:10.524,000 --> 0:05:13,000
— (musical notes) —

120
0:05:13.998,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and then I can kind of

121
0:05:15.287,000 --> 0:05:21,000
— (musical notes) —

122
0:05:21.782,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

123
0:05:23.741,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And that's awesome, right?

124
0:05:26.464,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But this is not what's awesome.

125
0:05:27.774,000 --> 0:05:28,000
What's awesome is what happens

126
0:05:29.336,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when you give the piano circuit to people.

127
0:05:32.755,000 --> 0:05:33,000
A pencil is not just a pencil.

128
0:05:34.138,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Look what it has in the middle of it.

129
0:05:35.806,000 --> 0:05:37,000
That's a wire running down the middle,

130
0:05:38.558,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and not only is it a wire,

131
0:05:39.999,000 --> 0:05:41,000
if you take that piano circuit, you can thumbtack

132
0:05:42.359,000 --> 0:05:43,000
into the middle of a pencil,

133
0:05:44.298,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and you can lay out wire on the page, too,

134
0:05:47.218,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and get electrical current to run through it.

135
0:05:49.639,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And so you can kind of hack a pencil,

136
0:05:51.521,000 --> 0:05:56,000
just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit.

137
0:05:57.042,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And the electricity runs through your body too.

138
0:05:58.982,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil.

139
0:06:02.328,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You can make one of these brushes just on the fly.

140
0:06:05.782,000 --> 0:06:06,000
All you do is connect to the bristles,

141
0:06:07.589,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and the bristles are wet, so they conduct,

142
0:06:09.581,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and the person's body conducts,

143
0:06:12.15,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and leather is great to paint on,

144
0:06:14.149,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and then you can start hooking to everything,

145
0:06:16.854,000 --> 0:06:16,000
even the kitchen sink.

146
0:06:17.849,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The metal in the sink is conductive.

147
0:06:19.768,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin.

148
0:06:23.321,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Musical notes)

149
0:06:28.303,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And you can even hook to the trees.

150
0:06:29.557,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive,

151
0:06:32.953,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and you can use those together.

152
0:06:34.727,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So — (Laughter) —

153
0:06:36.183,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I took this to those same teens, because those teens are

154
0:06:39.338,000 --> 0:06:41,000
really awesome, and they'll try things that I won't try.

155
0:06:41.795,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to.

156
0:06:44.778,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And this young woman, she made what she called a hula-looper,

157
0:06:48.799,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and as the hula hoop traveled around her body,

158
0:06:51.212,000 --> 0:06:53,000
she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there.

159
0:06:53.983,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You can see her pointing to it in the picture.

160
0:06:56.024,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body,

161
0:06:58.44,000 --> 0:07:,000
it would connect two little pieces of copper tape,

162
0:07:00.623,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and it would make a sound, and the next sound,

163
0:07:02.359,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and it would loop the same sounds over and over again.

164
0:07:04.895,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I ran these workshops everywhere.

165
0:07:06.824,000 --> 0:07:09,000
In Taiwan, at an art museum, this 12-year-old girl

166
0:07:09.834,000 --> 0:07:12,000
made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan

167
0:07:13.496,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and some electrical tape and hot glue.

168
0:07:15.28,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And professional designers were making artifacts

169
0:07:17.361,000 --> 0:07:18,000
with this thing strapped onto it.

170
0:07:19.14,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And big companies like Intel

171
0:07:21.354,000 --> 0:07:24,000
or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump,

172
0:07:25.007,000 --> 0:07:26,000
were inviting me to give workshops,

173
0:07:26.559,000 --> 0:07:28,000
just to practice this idea of smashing electronics

174
0:07:28.954,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and everyday objects together.

175
0:07:30.786,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And then we came up with this idea

176
0:07:33.447,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to not just use electronics,

177
0:07:35.235,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but let's just smash computers with everyday objects

178
0:07:38.207,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and see how that goes over.

179
0:07:40.767,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And so I just want to do a quick demo.

180
0:07:44.366,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit,

181
0:07:46.991,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you.

182
0:07:49.89,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So I'll just plug it in, and now it's on by USB.

183
0:07:53.923,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I'll just hook up the forward arrow.

184
0:07:56.56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You guys are facing that way, so I'll hook it to this one.

185
0:08:00.001,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it.

186
0:08:03.647,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And now, if I touch this piece of pizza,

187
0:08:06.171,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the slides that I showed you before should go forward.

188
0:08:09.235,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it

189
0:08:12.667,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to the left arrow, I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up,

190
0:08:15.939,000 --> 0:08:18,000
now I have a left arrow and a right arrow,

191
0:08:18.96,000 --> 0:08:2,000
so I should be able to go forwards and backwards

192
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and forwards and backwards. Awesome.

193
0:08:24.264,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And so we're like, "We gotta put a video out about this."

194
0:08:26.808,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Because no one really believed that this was important

195
0:08:29.376,000 --> 0:08:31,000
or meaningful except me and, like, one other guy.

196
0:08:32.355,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So we made a video to prove that

197
0:08:34.04,000 --> 0:08:35,000
there's lots of stuff you can do.

198
0:08:35.58,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You can kind of sketch with Play-Doh

199
0:08:37.612,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and just Google for game controllers.

200
0:08:41.546,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Just ordinary Play-Doh, nothing special.

201
0:08:44.233,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And you can literally draw joysticks

202
0:08:45.934,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up. (Video game noises)

203
0:08:53.057,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target?

204
0:08:56.56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Well, if you take those out, they hold water great,

205
0:08:58.768,000 --> 0:09:,000
but you can totally cut your toes,

206
0:09:00.904,000 --> 0:09:02,000
so yeah, just be careful.

207
0:09:03.592,000 --> 0:09:05,000
You know the Happiness Project, where the experts

208
0:09:06.464,000 --> 0:09:08,000
are setting up the piano stairs, and how cool that is?

209
0:09:09.222,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Well, I think it's cool,

210
0:09:10.432,000 --> 0:09:12,000
but we should be doing that stuff ourselves.

211
0:09:12.775,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works.

212
0:09:15.858,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We should all be participating

213
0:09:17.833,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in changing the way the world works together.

214
0:09:19.753,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat.

215
0:09:21.94,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS.

216
0:09:25.124,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Hover the mouse over the "take a photo" button,

217
0:09:27.184,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and you've got a little cat photo booth.

218
0:09:28.759,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this.

219
0:09:31.448,000 --> 0:09:34,000
If hundreds of people didn't buy this, we couldn't put it on the market.

220
0:09:34.536,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And so we put it up on Kickstarter,

221
0:09:37.437,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and hundreds of people bought it in the first day.

222
0:09:40.432,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And then 30 days later,

223
0:09:41.458,000 --> 0:09:44,000
11,000 people had backed the project.

224
0:09:44.725,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And then what the best part is, we started getting

225
0:09:46.84,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it.

226
0:09:50.912,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So this is "The Star-Spangled Banner" by eating lunch,

227
0:09:53.574,000 --> 0:09:55,000
including drinking Listerine.

228
0:09:55.648,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And we actually sent this guy materials.

229
0:09:57.114,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We're like, "We're sponsoring you, man.

230
0:09:58.595,000 --> 0:10:,000
You're, like, a pro maker."

231
0:10:00.705,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Okay, just wait for this one. This is good.

232
0:10:04.32,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

233
0:10:06.139,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Applause)

234
0:10:09.624,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And these guys at the exploratorium are

235
0:10:11.501,000 --> 0:10:13,000
playing house plants as if they were drums.

236
0:10:16.723,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways.

237
0:10:20.297,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And then this brother -- look at this diagram.

238
0:10:22.649,000 --> 0:10:23,000
See where it says "sister"?

239
0:10:23.937,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I love when people put humans on the diagram.

240
0:10:26.393,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I always add humans to any technical --

241
0:10:28.861,000 --> 0:10:3,000
if you're drawing a technical diagram, put a human in it.

242
0:10:30.993,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister

243
0:10:35.463,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so that on her birthday, she could be the star of the show,

244
0:10:37.536,000 --> 0:10:39,000
jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides.

245
0:10:40.281,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano.

246
0:10:46.134,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And this is fun,

247
0:10:48.579,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun?

248
0:10:51.466,000 --> 0:10:53,000
But it's also very serious because

249
0:10:53.986,000 --> 0:10:55,000
all this accessibility stuff started coming up,

250
0:10:56.154,000 --> 0:10:58,000
where people can't use computers, necessarily.

251
0:10:59.11,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Like this dad who wrote us, his son has cerebral palsy

252
0:11:01.802,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and he can't use a normal keyboard.

253
0:11:03.674,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford

254
0:11:07.245,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to buy all these custom controllers.

255
0:11:09.087,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And so, with the MaKey MaKey, he planned to make

256
0:11:10.713,000 --> 0:11:12,000
these gloves to allow him to navigate the web.

257
0:11:13.607,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And a huge eruption of discussion

258
0:11:15.767,000 --> 0:11:17,000
around accessibility came, and we're really excited about that.

259
0:11:18.722,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We didn't plan for that at all.

260
0:11:20.623,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And then all these professional musicians started using it,

261
0:11:23.431,000 --> 0:11:25,000
like at Coachella, just this weekend

262
0:11:25.559,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Jurassic 5 was using this onstage,

263
0:11:28.711,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn, right around here,

264
0:11:32.412,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and he put this up last month.

265
0:11:34.423,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And I love the carrot on the turntable.

266
0:11:36.527,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Music: Massive Attack — "Teardrop")

267
0:11:43.355,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Most people cannot play them that way. (Laughter)

268
0:11:46.101,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And when this started to get serious,

269
0:11:47.523,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I thought, I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in,

270
0:11:50.95,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because otherwise people are going to be getting this

271
0:11:52.652,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change,

272
0:11:54.891,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and governments will be crumbling,

273
0:11:56.183,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and I wouldn't have told people, so I thought I'd better warn them.

274
0:11:58.542,000 --> 0:12:,000
And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid

275
0:12:00.871,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of the box, it says, "The world is a construction kit."

276
0:12:03.731,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And as you start to mess around this way,

277
0:12:05.578,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I think that, in some small ways, you do start to see

278
0:12:08.677,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the landscape of your everyday life

279
0:12:10.729,000 --> 0:12:12,000
a little bit more like something you could express yourself with,

280
0:12:13.622,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and a little bit more like you could participate

281
0:12:15.861,000 --> 0:12:17,000
in designing the future of the way the world works.

282
0:12:18.325,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And so next time you're on an escalator

283
0:12:22.113,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and you drop an M&M by accident,

284
0:12:23.789,000 --> 0:12:26,000
you know, maybe that's an M&M surfboard, not an escalator,

285
0:12:26.949,000 --> 0:12:27,000
so don't pick it up right away.

286
0:12:28.156,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets

287
0:12:30.344,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and throw it down, and maybe some chapstick, whatever.

288
0:12:33.653,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I used to want to design a utopian society

289
0:12:38.615,000 --> 0:12:4,000
or a perfect world or something like that.

290
0:12:40.987,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But as I'm kind of getting older

291
0:12:42.441,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and kind of messing with all this stuff,

292
0:12:44.017,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world

293
0:12:46.785,000 --> 0:12:48,000
really can't be designed by one person

294
0:12:48.801,000 --> 0:12:49,000
or even by a million experts.

295
0:12:50.357,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands,

296
0:12:53.525,000 --> 0:12:55,000
each following their own passions,

297
0:12:55.933,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and each kind of like a mosaic coming up

298
0:12:58.121,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and creating this world in their backyards

299
0:12:59.622,000 --> 0:13:,000
and in their kitchens.

300
0:13:01.13,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And that's the world I really want to live in.

301
0:13:03.696,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Thank you.

302
0:13:05.08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.914,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My best friend recently had a baby.

2
0:00:17.237,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And when I met him,

3
0:00:18.987,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was in awe of witnessing this tiny, beautiful being enter into our lives.

4
0:00:25.934,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I also had this realization that he wasn't just entering our lives,

5
0:00:30.95,000 --> 0:00:31,000
he was entering the world --

6
0:00:33.382,000 --> 0:00:37,000
this crazy world that, especially now, feels so incredibly challenging.

7
0:00:39.537,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I spend a lot time in my work talking to people about who we are,

8
0:00:44.05,000 --> 0:00:45,000
who we must be

9
0:00:45.54,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and what our healing looks like.

10
0:00:48.327,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So the first time I held him,

11
0:00:50.78,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I had my pep talk ready.

12
0:00:52.918,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You know, I wanted him to know that the way we find our strength

13
0:00:56.852,000 --> 0:00:57,000
is through our challenges.

14
0:00:58.43,000 --> 0:01:,000
I wanted him to know that we can all do something big

15
0:01:01.104,000 --> 0:01:02,000
when we start small.

16
0:01:02.319,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I wanted him to know that each of us is more resilient

17
0:01:05.786,000 --> 0:01:06,000
than we could ever imagine.

18
0:01:08.242,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So here I am holding little Thelonious.

19
0:01:11.233,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I look down at him,

20
0:01:13.574,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and it hits me:

21
0:01:15.944,000 --> 0:01:16,000
he's a baby.

22
0:01:17.119,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:18.144,000 --> 0:01:2,000
He's not going to understand a single word I say to him.

24
0:01:22.114,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So instead, I thought it would probably be a better idea

25
0:01:24.834,000 --> 0:01:25,000
if I went home and wrote.

26
0:01:26.113,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So, this is for grownups,

27
0:01:28.593,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but it's also for Thelonious,

28
0:01:32.014,000 --> 0:01:33,000
when he's old enough to read it:

29
0:01:36.768,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The world will say to you,

30
0:01:39.546,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"Be a better person."

31
0:01:42.537,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Do not be afraid to say, "Yes."

32
0:01:45.777,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Start by being a better listener.

33
0:01:49.214,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Start by being better at walking down the street.

34
0:01:52.547,000 --> 0:01:53,000
See people.

35
0:01:53.946,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Say, "Hello."

36
0:01:55.446,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Ask how they are doing and listen to what they say.

37
0:01:59.333,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Start by being a better friend,

38
0:02:01.583,000 --> 0:02:03,000
a better parent, a better child to your parents;

39
0:02:04.467,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a better sibling, a better lover, a better partner.

40
0:02:07.922,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Start by being a better neighbor.

41
0:02:10.813,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Meet someone you do not know, and get to know them.

42
0:02:15.242,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The world will say to you,

43
0:02:17.474,000 --> 0:02:18,000
"What are you going to do?"

44
0:02:19.914,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Do not be afraid to say,

45
0:02:21.963,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"I know I can't do everything,

46
0:02:24.75,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but I can do something."

47
0:02:27.485,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Walk into more rooms saying,

48
0:02:29.721,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"I'm here to help."

49
0:02:31.69,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Become intimate with generosity.

50
0:02:34.286,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Give what you can give, and do what you can do.

51
0:02:37.819,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Give dollars, give cents, give your time,

52
0:02:40.413,000 --> 0:02:41,000
give your love,

53
0:02:41.995,000 --> 0:02:42,000
give your heart, give your spirit.

54
0:02:45.09,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The world will say to you,

55
0:02:48.516,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"We need peace."

56
0:02:51.904,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Find your peace within,

57
0:02:54.304,000 --> 0:02:55,000
hold it sacred,

58
0:02:56.022,000 --> 0:02:58,000
bring it with you everywhere you go.

59
0:02:59.029,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Peace cannot be shared or created with others

60
0:03:03.013,000 --> 0:03:05,000
if we cannot first generate it within.

61
0:03:06.218,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The world will say to you,

62
0:03:07.854,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"They are the enemy."

63
0:03:10.357,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Love enough to know

64
0:03:11.724,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that just because someone disagrees with you,

65
0:03:14.757,000 --> 0:03:15,000
it does not make them your enemy.

66
0:03:17.009,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You may not win an argument,

67
0:03:18.883,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you may not change a mind,

68
0:03:20.922,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but if you choose to,

69
0:03:22.847,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you can always achieve the triumph of radical empathy --

70
0:03:27.783,000 --> 0:03:29,000
an understanding of the heart.

71
0:03:31.324,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The world will say to you,

72
0:03:33.965,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"We need justice."

73
0:03:36.954,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Investigate.

74
0:03:38.803,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Find truth beyond the stories you are told.

75
0:03:42.012,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Find truth beyond the way things seem.

76
0:03:45.01,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Ask, "Why?"

77
0:03:46.756,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Ask, "Is this fair?"

78
0:03:48.794,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Ask, "How did we get here?"

79
0:03:51.488,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Do this with compassion.

80
0:03:53.909,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Do this with forgiveness.

81
0:03:56.183,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Learn to forgive others.

82
0:03:59.031,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Start by truly learning how to forgive yourself.

83
0:04:03.071,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We are all more than our mistakes.

84
0:04:06.187,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We are all more than who we were yesterday.

85
0:04:09.55,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We are all deserving of our dignity.

86
0:04:13.022,000 --> 0:04:14,000
See yourself in others.

87
0:04:15.285,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Recognize that your justice is my justice,

88
0:04:18.293,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and mine is yours.

89
0:04:19.909,000 --> 0:04:23,000
There can be no liberation for one of us if the other is not free.

90
0:04:25.38,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

91
0:04:28.214,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The world will say to you,

92
0:04:30.806,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"I am violent."

93
0:04:33.014,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Respond by saying,

94
0:04:34.874,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"I am not.

95
0:04:36.548,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Not with my words and not with my actions."

96
0:04:41.189,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The world will say to you,

97
0:04:42.463,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"We need to heal the planet."

98
0:04:44.995,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Start by saying, "No, thank you. I don't need a plastic bag."

99
0:04:48.304,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Recycle, reuse.

100
0:04:50.372,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Start by picking up one piece of trash on your block.

101
0:04:55.356,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The world will say to you,

102
0:04:57.581,000 --> 0:04:59,000
"There are too many problems."

103
0:05:00.415,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Do not be afraid to be a part of the solutions.

104
0:05:03.865,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Start by discussing the issues.

105
0:05:06.364,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We cannot overcome what we ignore.

106
0:05:10.541,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The more we talk about things,

107
0:05:12.525,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the more we see that the issues are connected

108
0:05:15.795,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because we are connected.

109
0:05:18.546,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The world will say to you,

110
0:05:20.281,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"We need to end racism."

111
0:05:22.587,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Start by healing it in your own family.

112
0:05:26.168,000 --> 0:05:27,000
The world will say to you,

113
0:05:27.852,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"How do we speak to bias and bigotry?"

114
0:05:30.933,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Start by having the first conversation at your own kitchen table.

115
0:05:36.869,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The world will say to you,

116
0:05:39.044,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"There is so much hate."

117
0:05:41.568,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Devote yourself to love.

118
0:05:44.022,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Love yourself so much that you can love others

119
0:05:48.133,000 --> 0:05:5,000
without barriers and without judgment.

120
0:05:51.901,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When the world asks us big questions that require big answers,

121
0:05:56.196,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we have two options.

122
0:05:58.013,000 --> 0:06:02,000
One: to feel so overwhelmed or unqualified, we do nothing.

123
0:06:02.917,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Two: to start with one small act and qualify ourselves.

124
0:06:08.095,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I am the director of national security,

125
0:06:11.76,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and so are you.

126
0:06:14.147,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Maybe no one appointed us and there were no senate confirmations,

127
0:06:18.316,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but we can secure a nation.

128
0:06:20.673,000 --> 0:06:23,000
When you help just one person to be more secure,

129
0:06:24.172,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a nation is more secure.

130
0:06:26.219,000 --> 0:06:29,000
With just one outstretched hand that says, "Are you OK?

131
0:06:30.066,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I am here for you,"

132
0:06:31.933,000 --> 0:06:34,000
we can transform insecurity into security.

133
0:06:36.328,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We find ourselves saying to the world,

134
0:06:39.075,000 --> 0:06:41,000
"What should I do?" "What should we do?"

135
0:06:41.846,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The better question might be:

136
0:06:43.627,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"How am I showing up?"

137
0:06:45.393,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I ask the world for peace,

138
0:06:48.284,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but do I show up with peace when I see my family and friends?

139
0:06:51.977,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I ask the world to end hatred,

140
0:06:54.853,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but do I show up with love not only for those I know,

141
0:06:59.112,000 --> 0:07:,000
but those I don't know?

142
0:07:00.541,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Do I show up with love for those whose ideas conflict with my own?

143
0:07:06.074,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I ask the world to end suffering,

144
0:07:08.447,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but do I show up for those who are suffering on my street corner?

145
0:07:12.549,000 --> 0:07:13,000
We say to the world,

146
0:07:13.75,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"Please change; we need change."

147
0:07:16.356,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But how do we show up to change our own lives?

148
0:07:19.402,000 --> 0:07:23,000
How do we show up to change the lives of the people in our communities?

149
0:07:24.689,000 --> 0:07:29,000
James Baldwin said, "Everything now, we must assume is in our own hands;

150
0:07:30.553,000 --> 0:07:32,000
we have no right to assume otherwise."

151
0:07:33.921,000 --> 0:07:34,000
This has always been true.

152
0:07:35.987,000 --> 0:07:38,000
No one nominated Harriet Tubman to her purpose,

153
0:07:39.351,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to her mission, to her courage.

154
0:07:41.836,000 --> 0:07:43,000
She did not say, "I'm not a congressman

155
0:07:43.923,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or the president of the United States,

156
0:07:45.788,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so how could I possibly participate in the fight to abolish

157
0:07:50.237,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a system as big as slavery?"

158
0:07:52.493,000 --> 0:07:55,000
She instead spent 10 years making 19 trips,

159
0:07:56.493,000 --> 0:07:57,000
freeing 300 people,

160
0:07:58.394,000 --> 0:07:59,000
one group of people at a time.

161
0:08:00.922,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Think about the children of those 300 people,

162
0:08:03.348,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the grandchildren, the great-grandchildren and beyond.

163
0:08:07.279,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Our righteous acts create immeasurable ripples

164
0:08:11.093,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in the endless river of justice.

165
0:08:15.052,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Whether it's Hurricane Katrina, Harvey, Irma or Maria, people did not say,

166
0:08:21.973,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"There is so much damage. What should I do?"

167
0:08:24.72,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They got to work on what they could do.

168
0:08:27.044,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Those with boats got in their boats

169
0:08:28.736,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and started loading in every woman, man and child they came across.

170
0:08:32.282,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Near and far, people gave their dollars,

171
0:08:35.061,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they gave their cents,

172
0:08:36.827,000 --> 0:08:37,000
they gave their hearts,

173
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
they gave their spirit.

174
0:08:41.139,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We spend so much time

175
0:08:43.992,000 --> 0:08:45,000
thinking we don't have the power to change the world.

176
0:08:47.391,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We forget that the power to change someone's life is always in our hands.

177
0:08:51.994,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Change-making does not belong to one group of people;

178
0:08:56.748,000 --> 0:08:58,000
it belongs to all of us.

179
0:08:59.448,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You don't have to wait on anyone to tell you

180
0:09:03.582,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that you are in this.

181
0:09:05.695,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Begin.

182
0:09:07.375,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Start by doing what you can with what you've got,

183
0:09:11.741,000 --> 0:09:12,000
where you are

184
0:09:13.15,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and in your own way.

185
0:09:15.952,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We don't have to be heroes,

186
0:09:18.464,000 --> 0:09:19,000
wear a uniform,

187
0:09:19.795,000 --> 0:09:2,000
call ourselves activists

188
0:09:21.442,000 --> 0:09:22,000
or get elected to participate.

189
0:09:23.87,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We just have to be brave enough to care.

190
0:09:28.994,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Now, around the time Thelonious was born,

191
0:09:33.071,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I went to the birthday party of a man named Gene Moretti.

192
0:09:38.064,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It was his 100th birthday,

193
0:09:41.955,000 --> 0:09:44,000
which means he lived in the United States through the Depression, World War II,

194
0:09:45.762,000 --> 0:09:46,000
the struggle for workers' rights,

195
0:09:47.391,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the achievement of a woman's right to vote,

196
0:09:49.451,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the Civil Rights Movement,

197
0:09:50.759,000 --> 0:09:51,000
a man on the moon, the Vietnam War

198
0:09:52.477,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and the election of the first black president.

199
0:09:55.175,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I sat with him, and I said,

200
0:09:56.977,000 --> 0:10:,000
"Gene, you have lived in America for 100 years.

201
0:10:02.696,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Do you have any advice during these current times?"

202
0:10:06.731,000 --> 0:10:08,000
He smiled and said to me simply, "Yes.

203
0:10:09.981,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Be good to as many people as possible."

204
0:10:14.252,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And as he danced with my mother,

205
0:10:16.112,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who is, by the way, half his age,

206
0:10:18.385,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in a room full of generations of his family and hundreds of people,

207
0:10:23.57,000 --> 0:10:27,000
many of whom traveled thousands of miles to be there to celebrate him,

208
0:10:28.599,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I realized that he had not just given me advice,

209
0:10:32.281,000 --> 0:10:34,000
he had given me the first step

210
0:10:34.608,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that every single one of us is capable of making

211
0:10:37.942,000 --> 0:10:4,000
if we want to create a real, wholehearted impact

212
0:10:41.785,000 --> 0:10:43,000
on the world around us, right now.

213
0:10:45.147,000 --> 0:10:49,000
"Be good to as many people as possible."

214
0:10:50.158,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Thank you.

215
0:10:51.333,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Applause)

[His Holiness Pope Francis Filmed in Vatican City

3
0:00:14.625,000 --> 0:00:15,000
First shown at TED2017]

4
0:00:16.72,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Good evening – or, good morning, I am not sure what time it is there.

5
0:00:24.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Regardless of the hour, I am thrilled to be participating in your conference.

6
0:00:32.516,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I very much like its title – "The Future You" –

7
0:00:37.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because, while looking at tomorrow, it invites us to open a dialogue today,

8
0:00:45.32,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to look at the future through a "you."

9
0:00:51.104,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"The Future You:"

10
0:00:53.64,000 --> 0:01:,000
the future is made of yous, it is made of encounters,

11
0:01:01.48,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because life flows through our relations with others.

12
0:01:06.28,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Quite a few years of life

13
0:01:08.2,000 --> 0:01:11,000
have strengthened my conviction

14
0:01:11.72,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that each and everyone's existence is deeply tied to that of others:

15
0:01:19.539,000 --> 0:01:25,000
life is not time merely passing by, life is about interactions.

16
0:01:28.2,000 --> 0:01:32,000
As I meet, or lend an ear to those who are sick,

17
0:01:33.44,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to the migrants who face terrible hardships

18
0:01:38.2,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in search of a brighter future,

19
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to prison inmates who carry a hell of pain inside their hearts,

20
0:01:45.64,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and to those, many of them young, who cannot find a job,

21
0:01:50.76,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I often find myself wondering:

22
0:01:55.28,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"Why them and not me?"

23
0:02:00.875,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I, myself, was born in a family of migrants;

24
0:02:06.36,000 --> 0:02:11,000
my father, my grandparents, like many other Italians,

25
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
left for Argentina

26
0:02:13.88,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and met the fate of those who are left with nothing.

27
0:02:20.04,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I could have very well ended up among today's "discarded" people.

28
0:02:25.72,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And that's why I always ask myself, deep in my heart:

29
0:02:30.461,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"Why them and not me?"

30
0:02:36.04,000 --> 0:02:4,000
First and foremost, I would love it if this meeting could help to remind us

31
0:02:40.56,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that we all need each other,

32
0:02:45.238,000 --> 0:02:47,000
none of us is an island,

33
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
an autonomous and independent "I," separated from the other,

34
0:02:53.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we can only build the future by standing together, including everyone.

35
0:03:01.96,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We don’t think about it often, but everything is connected,

36
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and we need to restore our connections to a healthy state.

37
0:03:13.545,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart

38
0:03:16.546,000 --> 0:03:19,000
against my brother or my sister,

39
0:03:19.64,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the open wound that was never cured, the offense that was never forgiven,

40
0:03:23.72,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the rancor that is only going to hurt me,

41
0:03:26.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
are all instances of a fight that I carry within me,

42
0:03:30.086,000 --> 0:03:32,000
a flare deep in my heart that needs to be extinguished

43
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:36,000
before it goes up in flames, leaving only ashes behind.

44
0:03:39.04,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Many of us, nowadays,

45
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:46,000
seem to believe that a happy future is something impossible to achieve.

46
0:03:47.56,000 --> 0:03:49,000
While such concerns must be taken very seriously,

47
0:03:51.12,000 --> 0:03:52,000
they are not invincible.

48
0:03:54.44,000 --> 0:04:,000
They can be overcome when we don't lock our door to the outside world.

49
0:04:01.6,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Happiness can only be discovered

50
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:08,000
as a gift of harmony between the whole and each single component.

51
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Even science – and you know it better than I do –

52
0:04:14.52,000 --> 0:04:19,000
points to an understanding of reality

53
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:26,000
as a place where every element connects and interacts with everything else.

54
0:04:28.64,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And this brings me to my second message.

55
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:35,000
How wonderful would it be

56
0:04:37.679,000 --> 0:04:41,000
if the growth of scientific and technological innovation

57
0:04:43.4,000 --> 0:04:49,000
would come along with more equality and social inclusion.

58
0:04:50.6,000 --> 0:04:55,000
How wonderful would it be, while we discover faraway planets,

59
0:04:56.76,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to rediscover the needs of the brothers and sisters orbiting around us.

60
0:05:04.08,000 --> 0:05:07,000
How wonderful would it be if solidarity,

61
0:05:07.32,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this beautiful and, at times, inconvenient word,

62
0:05:11.76,000 --> 0:05:14,000
were not simply reduced to social work,

63
0:05:15.76,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and became, instead, the default attitude

64
0:05:19.44,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in political, economic and scientific choices,

65
0:05:25.04,000 --> 0:05:31,000
as well as in the relationships among individuals, peoples and countries.

66
0:05:31.08,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Only by educating people to a true solidarity

67
0:05:35.112,000 --> 0:05:38,000
will we be able to overcome

68
0:05:38.812,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the "culture of waste,"

69
0:05:43.43,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which doesn't concern only food and goods

70
0:05:49.24,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but, first and foremost, the people

71
0:05:51.92,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who are cast aside by our techno-economic systems

72
0:05:57.76,000 --> 0:06:,000
which, without even realizing it,

73
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
are now putting products at their core, instead of people.

74
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Solidarity is a term that many wish to erase from the dictionary.

75
0:06:17.2,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Solidarity, however, is not an automatic mechanism.

76
0:06:22.2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It cannot be programmed or controlled.

77
0:06:25.48,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It is a free response born from the heart of each and everyone.

78
0:06:30.52,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Yes, a free response!

79
0:06:34.04,000 --> 0:06:35,000
When one realizes

80
0:06:35.28,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that life, even in the middle of so many contradictions, is a gift,

81
0:06:40.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that love is the source and the meaning of life,

82
0:06:44.52,000 --> 0:06:49,000
how can they withhold their urge to do good to another fellow being?

83
0:06:50.88,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In order to do good,

84
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we need memory, we need courage and we need creativity.

85
0:07:00.12,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And I know that TED gathers many creative minds.

86
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Yes, love does require a creative, concrete

87
0:07:16.012,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and ingenious attitude.

88
0:07:19.57,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Good intentions and conventional formulas,

89
0:07:24.685,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so often used to appease our conscience, are not enough.

90
0:07:30.856,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Let us help each other, all together, to remember

91
0:07:34.72,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that the other is not a statistic or a number.

92
0:07:39.817,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The other has a face.

93
0:07:42.166,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The "you" is always a real presence,

94
0:07:46.413,000 --> 0:07:49,000
a person to take care of.

95
0:07:53.274,000 --> 0:07:58,000
There is a parable Jesus told to help us understand the difference

96
0:07:58.68,000 --> 0:08:04,000
between those who'd rather not be bothered and those who take care of the other.

97
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I am sure you have heard it before. It is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.

98
0:08:13.92,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When Jesus was asked: "Who is my neighbor?" -

99
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
namely, "Who should I take care of?" -

100
0:08:22.84,000 --> 0:08:26,000
he told this story, the story of a man

101
0:08:26.881,000 --> 0:08:31,000
who had been assaulted, robbed, beaten and abandoned along a dirt road.

102
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite, two very influential people of the time,

103
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:44,000
walked past him without stopping to help.

104
0:08:45.4,000 --> 0:08:51,000
After a while, a Samaritan, a very much despised ethnicity at the time, walked by.

105
0:08:52.593,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Seeing the injured man lying on the ground,

106
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
he did not ignore him as if he weren't even there.

107
0:09:03.392,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Instead, he felt compassion for this man,

108
0:09:07.595,000 --> 0:09:13,000
which compelled him to act in a very concrete manner.

109
0:09:16.04,000 --> 0:09:19,000
He poured oil and wine on the wounds of the helpless man,

110
0:09:20.872,000 --> 0:09:21,000
brought him to a hostel

111
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and paid out of his pocket for him to be assisted.

112
0:09:27.72,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The story of the Good Samaritan is the story of today’s humanity.

113
0:09:32.56,000 --> 0:09:36,000
People's paths are riddled with suffering,

114
0:09:37.52,000 --> 0:09:43,000
as everything is centered around money, and things, instead of people.

115
0:09:44.76,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And often there is this habit, by people who call themselves "respectable,"

116
0:09:50.48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
of not taking care of the others,

117
0:09:53.702,000 --> 0:09:59,000
thus leaving behind thousands of human beings, or entire populations,

118
0:10:00.892,000 --> 0:10:01,000
on the side of the road.

119
0:10:05.44,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Fortunately, there are also those who are creating a new world

120
0:10:10.092,000 --> 0:10:15,000
by taking care of the other, even out of their own pockets.

121
0:10:16.28,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Mother Teresa actually said:

122
0:10:20.265,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"One cannot love, unless it is at their own expense."

123
0:10:26.96,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We have so much to do, and we must do it together.

124
0:10:32.92,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But how can we do that with all the evil we breathe every day?

125
0:10:38.777,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Thank God,

126
0:10:40.252,000 --> 0:10:44,000
no system can nullify our desire to open up to the good,

127
0:10:44.61,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to compassion and to our capacity to react against evil,

128
0:10:48.653,000 --> 0:10:5,000
all of which stem from deep within our hearts.

129
0:10:51.113,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Now you might tell me,

130
0:10:52.561,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"Sure, these are beautiful words,

131
0:10:54.28,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but I am not the Good Samaritan, nor Mother Teresa of Calcutta."

132
0:10:59.653,000 --> 0:11:03,000
On the contrary: we are precious, each and every one of us.

133
0:11:04.481,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Each and every one of us is irreplaceable in the eyes of God.

134
0:11:10.8,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Through the darkness of today's conflicts,

135
0:11:15.08,000 --> 0:11:19,000
each and every one of us can become a bright candle,

136
0:11:19.64,000 --> 0:11:23,000
a reminder that light will overcome darkness,

137
0:11:24.72,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and never the other way around.

138
0:11:28.377,000 --> 0:11:32,000
To Christians, the future does have a name,

139
0:11:33.697,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and its name is Hope.

140
0:11:37.04,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Feeling hopeful does not mean to be optimistically naïve

141
0:11:42.92,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.

142
0:11:49.76,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Hope is the virtue of a heart

143
0:11:52.76,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that doesn't lock itself into darkness, that doesn't dwell on the past,

144
0:11:57.84,000 --> 0:12:02,000
does not simply get by in the present, but is able to see a tomorrow.

145
0:12:04.32,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Hope is the door that opens onto the future.

146
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life

147
0:12:12.28,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that, with time, will develop into a large tree.

148
0:12:17.6,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It is like some invisible yeast that allows the whole dough to grow,

149
0:12:23.8,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that brings flavor to all aspects of life.

150
0:12:27.04,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And it can do so much,

151
0:12:29.76,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because a tiny flicker of light that feeds on hope

152
0:12:37.351,000 --> 0:12:4,000
is enough to shatter the shield of darkness.

153
0:12:42.537,000 --> 0:12:46,000
A single individual is enough for hope to exist,

154
0:12:47.24,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and that individual can be you.

155
0:12:51.8,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And then there will be another "you," and another "you,"

156
0:12:58.102,000 --> 0:13:,000
and it turns into an "us."

157
0:13:01.058,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And so, does hope begin when we have an "us?"

158
0:13:05.339,000 --> 0:13:06,000
No.

159
0:13:06.507,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Hope began with one "you."

160
0:13:09.4,000 --> 0:13:13,000
When there is an "us," there begins a revolution.

161
0:13:17.06,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The third message I would like to share today

162
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:25,000
is, indeed, about revolution: the revolution of tenderness.

163
0:13:27.04,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And what is tenderness?

164
0:13:29.8,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It is the love that comes close and becomes real.

165
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It is a movement that starts from our heart

166
0:13:35.2,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and reaches the eyes, the ears and the hands.

167
0:13:39.4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Tenderness means to use our eyes to see the other,

168
0:13:44.36,000 --> 0:13:46,000
our ears to hear the other,

169
0:13:47.165,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to listen to the children, the poor, those who are afraid of the future.

170
0:13:53.473,000 --> 0:13:58,000
To listen also to the silent cry of our common home,

171
0:13:59.24,000 --> 0:14:01,000
of our sick and polluted earth.

172
0:14:02.56,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Tenderness means to use our hands and our heart

173
0:14:08.28,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to comfort the other,

174
0:14:11.08,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to take care of those in need.

175
0:14:14.72,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Tenderness is the language of the young children,

176
0:14:19.931,000 --> 0:14:21,000
of those who need the other.

177
0:14:23.436,000 --> 0:14:28,000
A child’s love for mom and dad

178
0:14:28.8,000 --> 0:14:33,000
grows through their touch, their gaze, their voice, their tenderness.

179
0:14:36.56,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I like when I hear parents

180
0:14:38.88,000 --> 0:14:42,000
talk to their babies, adapting to the little child,

181
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
sharing the same level of communication.

182
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
This is tenderness: being on the same level as the other.

183
0:14:59.92,000 --> 0:15:05,000
God himself descended into Jesus to be on our level.

184
0:15:07.36,000 --> 0:15:09,000
This is the same path the Good Samaritan took.

185
0:15:11.08,000 --> 0:15:13,000
This is the path that Jesus himself took.

186
0:15:14.92,000 --> 0:15:15,000
He lowered himself,

187
0:15:16.64,000 --> 0:15:18,000
he lived his entire human existence

188
0:15:19.2,000 --> 0:15:21,000
practicing the real, concrete language of love.

189
0:15:24.12,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Yes, tenderness is the path of choice

190
0:15:27.6,000 --> 0:15:32,000
for the strongest, most courageous men and women.

191
0:15:34.8,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Tenderness is not weakness; it is fortitude.

192
0:15:38.92,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It is the path of solidarity, the path of humility.

193
0:15:44.72,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Please, allow me to say it loud and clear:

194
0:15:47.84,000 --> 0:15:49,000
the more powerful you are,

195
0:15:50.52,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the more your actions will have an impact on people,

196
0:15:55.28,000 --> 0:15:57,000
the more responsible you are to act humbly.

197
0:16:00.2,000 --> 0:16:06,000
If you don’t, your power will ruin you, and you will ruin the other.

198
0:16:09.68,000 --> 0:16:11,000
There is a saying in Argentina:

199
0:16:11.927,000 --> 0:16:15,000
"Power is like drinking gin on an empty stomach."

200
0:16:19.56,000 --> 0:16:25,000
You feel dizzy, you get drunk, you lose your balance,

201
0:16:26.72,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and you will end up hurting yourself and those around you,

202
0:16:32.2,000 --> 0:16:36,000
if you don’t connect your power with humility and tenderness.

203
0:16:39.4,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Through humility and concrete love, on the other hand,

204
0:16:44.112,000 --> 0:16:5,000
power – the highest, the strongest one – becomes a service, a force for good.

205
0:16:53.56,000 --> 0:16:58,000
The future of humankind isn't exclusively in the hands of politicians,

206
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
of great leaders, of big companies.

207
0:17:03.28,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Yes, they do hold an enormous responsibility.

208
0:17:06.08,000 --> 0:17:1,000
But the future is, most of all, in the hands of those people

209
0:17:10.92,000 --> 0:17:13,000
who recognize the other as a "you"

210
0:17:14.906,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and themselves as part of an "us."

211
0:17:19.839,000 --> 0:17:21,000
We all need each other.

212
0:17:22.839,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And so, please, think of me as well with tenderness,

213
0:17:27.973,000 --> 0:17:3,000
so that I can fulfill the task I have been given

214
0:17:31.371,000 --> 0:17:33,000
for the good of the other,

215
0:17:33.818,000 --> 0:17:36,000
of each and every one, of all of you,

216
0:17:37.559,000 --> 0:17:38,000
of all of us.

217
0:17:39.9,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Thank you.

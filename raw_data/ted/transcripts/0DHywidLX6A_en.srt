1
0:00:12.972,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Do you ever stop and think, during a romantic dinner,

2
0:00:17.882,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"I've just left my fingerprints all over my wine glass."

3
0:00:20.798,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.823,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Or do you ever worry, when you visit a friend,

5
0:00:24.692,000 --> 0:00:28,000
about leaving a little piece of you behind on every surface that you touch?

6
0:00:30.009,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And even this evening,

7
0:00:31.367,000 --> 0:00:34,000
have you paid any attention to sit without touching anything?

8
0:00:36.148,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Well, you're not alone.

9
0:00:37.759,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Thankfully, criminals underestimate the power of fingerprints, too.

10
0:00:42.792,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I'm not just talking about the twisted parting of lines

11
0:00:46.145,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that make our fingerprint unique.

12
0:00:49.277,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'm talking about an entire world of information

13
0:00:53.596,000 --> 0:00:56,000
hiding in a small, often invisible thing.

14
0:00:57.718,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In fact, fingerprints are made up of molecules

15
0:01:00.428,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that belong to three classes:

16
0:01:02.195,000 --> 0:01:06,000
sweat molecules that we all produce in very different amounts ...

17
0:01:07.021,000 --> 0:01:11,000
molecules that we introduce into our body and then we sweat out

18
0:01:11.476,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and molecules that we may contaminate our fingertips with

19
0:01:15.064,000 --> 0:01:18,000
when we come across substances like blood, paint, grease,

20
0:01:18.779,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but also invisible substances.

21
0:01:21.326,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And molecules are the storytellers of who we are

22
0:01:26.263,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and what we've been up to.

23
0:01:28.492,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We just need to have the right technology to make them talk.

24
0:01:34.006,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So let me take you on a journey of unthinkable capabilities.

25
0:01:42.528,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Katie has been raped

26
0:01:45.762,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and her lifeless body has been found in the woods three days later,

27
0:01:50.362,000 --> 0:01:51,000
after her disappearance.

28
0:01:52.577,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The police is targeting three suspects,

29
0:01:55.111,000 --> 0:01:58,000
having narrowed down the search from over 20 men

30
0:01:59.038,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who had been seen in that area on the same day.

31
0:02:02.914,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The only piece of evidence

32
0:02:04.745,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is two very faint, overlapping fingerprints

33
0:02:09.399,000 --> 0:02:12,000
on the tape that was found wrapped around Katie's neck.

34
0:02:13.912,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Often, faint and overlapping fingerprints cannot help the police

35
0:02:18.572,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to make an identification.

36
0:02:20.539,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And until recently, this might have been the end of the road,

37
0:02:25.886,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but this is where we can make the difference.

38
0:02:29.109,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The tape is sent to our labs,

39
0:02:31.888,000 --> 0:02:33,000
where we're asked to use our cutting-edge technology

40
0:02:34.872,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to help with the investigation.

41
0:02:38.032,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And here, we use an existing form

42
0:02:40.643,000 --> 0:02:44,000
of mass spectrometry imaging technology

43
0:02:45.327,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that we have further developed and adapted

44
0:02:47.914,000 --> 0:02:52,000
specifically for the molecular and imaging analysis of fingerprints.

45
0:02:53.936,000 --> 0:02:56,000
In essence, we fire a UV laser at the print,

46
0:02:57.945,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we cause the desorption of the molecules from the print,

47
0:03:01.826,000 --> 0:03:03,000
ready to be captured by the mass spectrometer.

48
0:03:05.708,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Mass spectrometry measures the weight of the molecules --

49
0:03:09.033,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or as we say, the mass --

50
0:03:11.351,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and those numbers that you see there, they indicate that mass.

51
0:03:15.893,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But more crucially,

52
0:03:17.555,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they indicate who those molecules are --

53
0:03:22.034,000 --> 0:03:24,000
whether I'm seeing paracetamol

54
0:03:24.175,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or something more sinister, forensically speaking.

55
0:03:28.734,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We applied this technology to the evidence that we have

56
0:03:31.774,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and we found the presence of condom lubricants.

57
0:03:36.337,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In fact, we've developed protocols that enable us to even suggest

58
0:03:40.989,000 --> 0:03:43,000
what brand of condom might have been used.

59
0:03:45.097,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So we pass this information to the police,

60
0:03:47.208,000 --> 0:03:5,000
who, meanwhile, have obtained a search warrant

61
0:03:50.638,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and they found the same brand of condom in Dalton's premises.

62
0:03:57.199,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And with Dalton and Thomson also having records for sexual assaults,

63
0:04:02.651,000 --> 0:04:06,000
then it is Chapman that may become the less likely suspect.

64
0:04:08.028,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But is this information enough to make an arrest?

65
0:04:11.533,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Of course not,

66
0:04:12.708,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and we are asked to delve deeper with our investigation.

67
0:04:16.225,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So we found out, also, the presence of other two very interesting molecules.

68
0:04:21.609,000 --> 0:04:23,000
One is an antidepressant,

69
0:04:24.077,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and one is a very special molecule.

70
0:04:26.123,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It only forms in your body

71
0:04:28.272,000 --> 0:04:32,000
if you drink alcohol and consume cocaine at the same time.

72
0:04:32.719,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And alcohol is known to potentiate the effects of cocaine,

73
0:04:36.593,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so here, we now have a hint on the state of mind

74
0:04:41.381,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of the individual whilst perpetrating the crime.

75
0:04:45.198,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We passed this information to the police,

76
0:04:48.2,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and they found out that, actually, Thomson is a drug addict,

77
0:04:52.508,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and he also has a medical record for psychotic episodes,

78
0:04:56.762,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for which presumably the antidepressant was prescribed.

79
0:05:01.016,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So now Thomson becomes the more likely suspect.

80
0:05:07.463,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But the reality is that I still don't know where these molecules are coming from,

81
0:05:12.98,000 --> 0:05:13,000
from which fingerprint,

82
0:05:14.75,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and who those two fingerprints belong to.

83
0:05:18.346,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Fear not.

84
0:05:19.641,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Mass spectrometry imaging can help us further.

85
0:05:22.763,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In fact, the technology is so powerful

86
0:05:26.032,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that we can see where these molecules are on a fingerprint.

87
0:05:31.821,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Like you see in this video,

88
0:05:33.896,000 --> 0:05:36,000
every single one of those peaks corresponds to a mass,

89
0:05:37.798,000 --> 0:05:39,000
every mass to a molecule,

90
0:05:39.894,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and we can interrogate the software, by selecting each of those molecules,

91
0:05:44.859,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as to where they are present on a fingermark.

92
0:05:49.385,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And some images are not very revealing,

93
0:05:52.482,000 --> 0:05:53,000
some are better,

94
0:05:53.973,000 --> 0:05:55,000
some are really good.

95
0:05:56.459,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we can create multiple images of the same mark --

96
0:06:01.475,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in theory, hundreds of images of the same fingerprint --

97
0:06:05.586,000 --> 0:06:08,000
for as many of the molecules that we have detected.

98
0:06:09.547,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So step one ...

99
0:06:12.262,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for overlapping fingerprints, chances are,

100
0:06:16.271,000 --> 0:06:18,000
especially if they come from different individuals,

101
0:06:18.816,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that the molecular composition is not identical,

102
0:06:22.259,000 --> 0:06:27,000
so let's ask the software to visualize those unique molecules

103
0:06:27.366,000 --> 0:06:3,000
just present in one fingermark and not in the other one.

104
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:32,000
By doing so,

105
0:06:33.584,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that's how we can separate the two ridge patterns.

106
0:06:38.49,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And this is really important

107
0:06:40.489,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because the police now are able to identify one of the two fingerprints,

108
0:06:46.538,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which actually corresponds to Katie.

109
0:06:49.368,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And they've been able to say so

110
0:06:50.885,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because they've compared the two separate images

111
0:06:53.512,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with one taken posthumously from Katie.

112
0:06:56.902,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So now, we can concentrate on one fingerprint only --

113
0:07:02.119,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that of the killer's.

114
0:07:04.477,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So then, step two ...

115
0:07:06.968,000 --> 0:07:08,000
where are these three molecules that I've seen?

116
0:07:10.25,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Well, let's interrogate the software -- show me where they are.

117
0:07:13.522,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And by doing this,

118
0:07:15.206,000 --> 0:07:21,000
only portions of the image of the killer's fingerprint show up.

119
0:07:21.511,000 --> 0:07:22,000
In other words,

120
0:07:22.939,000 --> 0:07:27,000
those substances are only present in the killer's print.

121
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So now our molecular findings start matching very nicely

122
0:07:34.364,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the police intelligence about Thomson,

123
0:07:37.089,000 --> 0:07:39,000
should that fingerprint belong to him.

124
0:07:40.65,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But the reality is that that print is still not good enough

125
0:07:44.321,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to make an identification.

126
0:07:46.393,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Step three:

127
0:07:47.818,000 --> 0:07:53,000
since we can generate hundreds of images of the same fingerprint,

128
0:07:54.506,000 --> 0:07:56,000
why don't we superimpose them,

129
0:07:57.453,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and by doing so,

130
0:07:58.63,000 --> 0:08:01,000
try to improve the rich pattern of continuity and clarity?

131
0:08:02.067,000 --> 0:08:03,000
That's the result.

132
0:08:04.303,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Striking.

133
0:08:05.729,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We now have a very clear image of the fingerprint

134
0:08:09.695,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and the police can run it through the database.

135
0:08:12.469,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The match comes out to Thomson.

136
0:08:15.839,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Thomson is our killer.

137
0:08:17.364,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Applause)

138
0:08:21.356,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Katie, the suspects and the circumstances of the crime aren't real,

139
0:08:28.127,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but the story contains elements

140
0:08:31.7,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of the real police casework we've been confronted with,

141
0:08:36.071,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and is a composite of the intelligence that we can provide --

142
0:08:39.261,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that we have been able to provide the police.

143
0:08:43.089,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And I'm really, really thrilled that after nine years of intense research,

144
0:08:47.751,000 --> 0:08:48,000
as of 2017,

145
0:08:49.736,000 --> 0:08:52,000
we are able to contribute to police investigations.

146
0:08:53.462,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Mine is no longer a dream;

147
0:08:56.11,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it's a goal.

148
0:08:57.958,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We're going to do this wider and wider,

149
0:09:00.806,000 --> 0:09:01,000
bigger and bigger,

150
0:09:02.127,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and we're going to know more about the suspect,

151
0:09:05.232,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and we're going to build an identikit.

152
0:09:08.121,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I believe this is also a new era for criminal profiling.

153
0:09:12.884,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The work of the criminologist

154
0:09:14.298,000 --> 0:09:18,000
draws on the expert recognition of behavioral patterns

155
0:09:18.407,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that have been observed before to belong to a certain type,

156
0:09:22.056,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to a certain profile.

157
0:09:23.869,000 --> 0:09:27,000
As opposed to this expert but subjective evaluation,

158
0:09:28.34,000 --> 0:09:3,000
we're trying to do the same thing,

159
0:09:30.695,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but from the molecular makeup of the fingerprint,

160
0:09:34.283,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and the two can work together.

161
0:09:36.812,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I did say that molecules are storytellers,

162
0:09:39.702,000 --> 0:09:41,000
so information on your health,

163
0:09:42.265,000 --> 0:09:46,000
your actions, your lifestyle, your routines,

164
0:09:46.446,000 --> 0:09:47,000
they're all there,

165
0:09:48.258,000 --> 0:09:5,000
accessible in a fingerprint.

166
0:09:51.403,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And molecules are the storytellers of our secrets

167
0:09:56.813,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in just a touch.

168
0:09:58.706,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Thank you.

169
0:09:59.881,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Audience) Wow.

170
0:10:01.063,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Applause)

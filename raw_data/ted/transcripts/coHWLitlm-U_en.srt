1
0:00:12.667,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A few years ago, about seven years ago,

2
0:00:14.786,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I found myself hiding in a festival toilet,

3
0:00:18.559,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a music festival toilet,

4
0:00:20.382,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and if anyone's been to a music festival,

5
0:00:23.533,000 --> 0:00:26,000
yeah, you'll know that by the third day,

6
0:00:27.478,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it's pretty nasty.

7
0:00:29.191,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I was standing in the toilet because I couldn't even sit down,

8
0:00:32.501,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because the toilet roll had run out,

9
0:00:35.208,000 --> 0:00:36,000
there was mud everywhere,

10
0:00:36.676,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and it smelled pretty bad.

11
0:00:38.125,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I stood there thinking,

12
0:00:39.926,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"What am I doing? I don't even need the toilet."

13
0:00:42.958,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But the reason I went

14
0:00:44.34,000 --> 0:00:48,000
was because I was volunteering for a large charity on climate justice,

15
0:00:48.8,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it was seven years ago,

16
0:00:50.732,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when lots of people didn't believe in climate change,

17
0:00:53.247,000 --> 0:00:54,000
people were very cynical about activism,

18
0:00:55.176,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and my role, with all of my teammates,

19
0:00:57.058,000 --> 0:01:,000
was to get people to sign petitions on climate justice

20
0:01:00.083,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and educate them a bit more about the issue.

21
0:01:02.661,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I cared deeply about climate change and lots of inequality,

22
0:01:06.582,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so I'd go and I'd talk to lots of people,

23
0:01:08.559,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which made me nervous and drained me of energy,

24
0:01:11.813,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but I did it because I cared,

25
0:01:13.662,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but I would hide in the toilets, because I'd be exhausted,

26
0:01:17.591,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I didn't want my teammates doubting my commitment to the cause,

27
0:01:21.56,000 --> 0:01:22,000
thinking that I was slacking.

28
0:01:23.465,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And we'd go and meet at the end of our shift,

29
0:01:25.632,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and we'd count how many petitions had been signed,

30
0:01:28.021,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and often I'd win the amount of petitions signed

31
0:01:30.712,000 --> 0:01:32,000
even though I had my little breaks in the toilet.

32
0:01:33.275,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But I was always very jealous of the other activists,

33
0:01:36.046,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because either they had the same amount of energy

34
0:01:38.434,000 --> 0:01:42,000
as they had when they began the shift of getting people to sign petitions,

35
0:01:43.133,000 --> 0:01:44,000
or often they had more energy,

36
0:01:45.101,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and they'd be really excited about going to watch the bands in the evening

37
0:01:48.626,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and having a dance.

38
0:01:49.824,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And even if I loved the bands,

39
0:01:51.959,000 --> 0:01:54,000
all I wanted to do was to go back to my tent and have a sleep,

40
0:01:55.118,000 --> 0:01:57,000
because I'd just feel completely wiped out,

41
0:01:57.809,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I was really jealous of people that had the energy

42
0:02:00.39,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to go and party hard at the festivals.

43
0:02:03.703,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But it also made me really angry, as well, inside.

44
0:02:06.639,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I thought, "This isn't fair, I'm an introvert,

45
0:02:09.585,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and all of the offline campaigning seems to be favoring extroverts."

46
0:02:15.034,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I would go on marches which drained me.

47
0:02:17.256,000 --> 0:02:18,000
That was the other option.

48
0:02:18.542,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Or I'd go and join campaigns outside embassies or shops.

49
0:02:22.967,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The only thing that was on offer was around lots of people,

50
0:02:25.936,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it was very loud activism,

51
0:02:27.912,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it always involved lots of people, it was performing.

52
0:02:30.959,000 --> 0:02:32,000
None of it was for introverts,

53
0:02:33.214,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and I not only thought that that wasn't fair,

54
0:02:35.881,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because a third to a half of the world's population are introverts,

55
0:02:40.731,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which isn't fair on them, because we burn out,

56
0:02:43.77,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or we'd be put off by activism and not do it,

57
0:02:46.351,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and everyone needs to be an activist in this world.

58
0:02:50.414,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And also, I didn't think it was particularly clever,

59
0:02:53.08,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but I could see that a lot of the activism that worked

60
0:02:56.835,000 --> 0:02:58,000
wasn't only extrovert activism.

61
0:02:59.106,000 --> 0:03:,000
It wasn't only the loud stuff.

62
0:03:00.875,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It wasn't about people performing all the time.

63
0:03:03.788,000 --> 0:03:05,000
A lot of the work that was needed was in the background,

64
0:03:06.433,000 --> 0:03:07,000
was hidden, wasn't seen.

65
0:03:09.031,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And when I ended up just being a campaigner,

66
0:03:11.443,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because it's the only job I can do, really --

67
0:03:13.586,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I was campaigning at university,

68
0:03:15.325,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and for the last 10 years, I've been a professional campaigner

69
0:03:18.381,000 --> 0:03:19,000
for large charities,

70
0:03:19.572,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and now I'm a creative campaigner consultant for different charities

71
0:03:23.445,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as well as other work I do --

72
0:03:25.733,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but I knew that there were other forms of activism that were needed.

73
0:03:29.607,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I started tinkering about seven years ago

74
0:03:32.187,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to see what quieter forms of activism I could engage with

75
0:03:35.965,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so I didn't burn out as an activist,

76
0:03:38.266,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but also to look at some of the issues I was concerned about in campaigning.

77
0:03:43.052,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I was very lucky that, when I worked for Oxfam and other big charities,

78
0:03:46.506,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I could read lots of big reports

79
0:03:48.728,000 --> 0:03:51,000
on what influenced politicians and businesses

80
0:03:52.006,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the general public,

81
0:03:53.721,000 --> 0:03:55,000
what campaigns worked really well, which ones didn't.

82
0:03:56.223,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And I'm a bit of a geek, so I look at all of that stuff,

83
0:03:59.182,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I wanted to tinker around

84
0:04:00.588,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to see how I could engage people in social change in a different way,

85
0:04:04.477,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because I think if we want the world to be more beautiful, kind and just,

86
0:04:09.096,000 --> 0:04:12,000
then our activism should be beautiful, kind and just,

87
0:04:12.913,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and often it's not.

88
0:04:14.723,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And today, I just want to talk about three ways

89
0:04:17.087,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that I think activism needs introverts.

90
0:04:19.597,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I think there's lot of other ways, but I'm just going to talk about three.

91
0:04:23.731,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And the first one is: activism is often very quick,

92
0:04:27.771,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and it's about doing,

93
0:04:29.105,000 --> 0:04:32,000
so extroverts, often their immediate response to injustice is,

94
0:04:32.384,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we've got to do stuff now,

95
0:04:33.868,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we've got to react really quickly --

96
0:04:35.702,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and yes, we do need to react,

97
0:04:37.341,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but we need to be strategic in our campaigning,

98
0:04:39.961,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and if we just act on anger,

99
0:04:41.611,000 --> 0:04:42,000
often we do the wrong things.

100
0:04:44.177,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I use craft, like needlework --

101
0:04:46.829,000 --> 0:04:48,000
like this guy behind me is doing --

102
0:04:48.932,000 --> 0:04:51,000
as a way to not only slow down those extrovert doers,

103
0:04:52.79,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but also to bring in nervous, quiet introverts into activism.

104
0:04:59.216,000 --> 0:05:01,000
By doing repetitive actions,

105
0:05:01.751,000 --> 0:05:04,000
like handicraft, you can't do it fast, you have to do it slowly.

106
0:05:04.789,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And those repetitive stitches

107
0:05:06.524,000 --> 0:05:1,000
help you meditate on the big, complex, messy social change issues

108
0:05:10.612,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and figure out what we can do

109
0:05:12.984,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as a citizen, as a consumer, as a constituent,

110
0:05:18.413,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and all of those different things.

111
0:05:20.421,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It helps you think critically while you're stitching away,

112
0:05:23.842,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and it helps you be more mindful of what are your motives.

113
0:05:26.582,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Are you that Barbie aid worker that was mentioned before?

114
0:05:29.954,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Are you about joining people in solidarity,

115
0:05:32.629,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or do you want to be the savior, which often isn't very ethical?

116
0:05:35.829,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But doing needle work together, as well,

117
0:05:38.201,000 --> 0:05:41,000
extroverts and introverts and ambivert --

118
0:05:41.892,000 --> 0:05:43,000
everyone's on the scale in different places --

119
0:05:44.139,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because it's a quiet, slow form of activism,

120
0:05:48.917,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it really helps introverts be heard

121
0:05:51.711,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in other areas, where they are often not heard.

122
0:05:55.603,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It sounds odd,

123
0:05:58.277,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but while you're stitching, you don't need eye contact with people.

124
0:06:01.929,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So, for nervous introverts,

125
0:06:04.065,000 --> 0:06:08,000
it means that you can stitch away next to someone or a group of people

126
0:06:08.279,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and ask questions that you're thinking

127
0:06:10.502,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that often you don't get time to ask people,

128
0:06:13.589,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or you're too nervous to ask if you give them eye contact.

129
0:06:16.51,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So you can get introverts, who are those big, deep thinkers,

130
0:06:19.486,000 --> 0:06:22,000
saying, "That's really interesting that you want to do

131
0:06:22.677,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that extrovert form of activism that's about shaming people

132
0:06:25.917,000 --> 0:06:26,000
or quickly going out somewhere,

133
0:06:27.632,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but who are you trying to target and how,

134
0:06:29.83,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and is that the best way to do it?"

135
0:06:31.783,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So it means you could have these discussions in a very slow way,

136
0:06:34.854,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which is great for the extrovert to slow down and think deeply,

137
0:06:37.855,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but it's really good for the introvert as well,

138
0:06:40.086,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to be heard and to feel part of that movement for change,

139
0:06:43.665,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in a good way.

140
0:06:44.84,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Some ways we do it is stitch cards

141
0:06:47.246,000 --> 0:06:5,000
about what values we thread through our activism,

142
0:06:50.333,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and making sure that we don't just react in unethical ways.

143
0:06:53.865,000 --> 0:06:55,000
One, sometimes we work with art institutions

144
0:06:56.699,000 --> 0:06:59,000
where we will get over 150 people at the V&A

145
0:06:59.795,000 --> 0:07:,000
who can come for hours,

146
0:07:01.269,000 --> 0:07:03,000
sit and stitch together on a particular issue,

147
0:07:03.73,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and then tweet what they're thinking or how it went, like this one.

148
0:07:07.727,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Also, I always think that activism needs introverts

149
0:07:10.974,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because we're really good at intimate activism.

150
0:07:14.013,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So we're good at slow activism,

151
0:07:15.664,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and we're really good at intimate activism,

152
0:07:17.974,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and if this year has told us anything,

153
0:07:19.84,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's told us that we need to, when we're engaging power holders,

154
0:07:23.705,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we need to engage them by listening to people we disagree with,

155
0:07:27.039,000 --> 0:07:29,000
by building bridges not walls --

156
0:07:29.169,000 --> 0:07:31,000
walls or wars --

157
0:07:31.975,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and by being critical friends, not aggressive enemies.

158
0:07:35.371,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And one example that I do a lot with introverts,

159
0:07:38.269,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but with lots of people,

160
0:07:39.444,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is make gifts for people in power,

161
0:07:41.554,000 --> 0:07:43,000
so not be outside screaming at them,

162
0:07:44.182,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but to give them something like a bespoke handkerchief

163
0:07:47.11,000 --> 0:07:48,000
saying, "Don't blow it.

164
0:07:48.469,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Use your power for good.

165
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We know you've got a difficult job in your position of power.

166
0:07:53.175,000 --> 0:07:54,000
How can we help you?"

167
0:07:54.937,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And what's great is, for the introverts,

168
0:07:57.676,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we can write letters while we're making these gifts,

169
0:08:00.136,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so for us, Marks and Spencer,

170
0:08:02.533,000 --> 0:08:06,000
we tried to campaign to get them to implement the living wage.

171
0:08:06.978,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So we made all the 14 board members bespoke handkerchiefs.

172
0:08:11.044,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We wrote them letters, we boxed them up,

173
0:08:13.36,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and we went to the AGM to hand-deliver our gifts

174
0:08:16.417,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and to have that form of intimate activism

175
0:08:18.937,000 --> 0:08:19,000
where we had discussions with them.

176
0:08:21.107,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And what was brilliant was that the chair of the board

177
0:08:24.314,000 --> 0:08:25,000
told us how amazing our campaign was,

178
0:08:26.29,000 --> 0:08:27,000
how heartfelt it was.

179
0:08:28.153,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The board members, like Martha Lane Fox,

180
0:08:30.281,000 --> 0:08:32,000
who has hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter,

181
0:08:33.209,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and highly influential in business,

182
0:08:35.511,000 --> 0:08:37,000
tweeted how impressed she was,

183
0:08:37.559,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and within 10 months,

184
0:08:39.17,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we'd had meetings with Marks and Spencer

185
0:08:41.75,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to say, "We know this is difficult to be a living wage employer,

186
0:08:45.314,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but if you can be one,

187
0:08:46.687,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the rest of the sector will look at it,

188
0:08:48.57,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and it's not right that some of your amazing workers are working full time

189
0:08:53.196,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and still can't pay their bills.

190
0:08:54.759,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And we love Marks and Spencer.

191
0:08:56.283,000 --> 0:08:58,000
How can you be the role model that we want you to be?"

192
0:08:59.829,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So that was that intimate form of activism.

193
0:09:01.862,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We had lots of meetings with them.

194
0:09:04.187,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We then gave them Christmas cards and Valentine's cards to say,

195
0:09:08.71,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"We really want to encourage you to implement the living wage,

196
0:09:12.037,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and within 10 months, they'd announced to the media

197
0:09:14.869,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that they were going to pay the independent living wage, and now --

198
0:09:18.759,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Applause)

199
0:09:20.592,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Thank you.

200
0:09:21.767,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And now we're trying to work with them to be accredited,

201
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
which is really important,

202
0:09:26.633,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and we went back to the last AGM this June

203
0:09:29.109,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and we had these amazing one-to-one discussions with the board members,

204
0:09:32.729,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who told us how much they loved their hankies

205
0:09:34.85,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and how it really moved them, what we were doing,

206
0:09:37.748,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they all told us that if we were standing outside screaming at them

207
0:09:41.236,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and not being gentle in our protest,

208
0:09:43.38,000 --> 0:09:44,000
they wouldn't have even listened to us,

209
0:09:45.281,000 --> 0:09:47,000
never mind had those discussions with us.

210
0:09:47.332,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And I think introverts are really good at intimate activism

211
0:09:50.714,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because we like to listen,

212
0:09:52.079,000 --> 0:09:53,000
we like one-to-ones,

213
0:09:53.46,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we don't like small talks,

214
0:09:54.831,000 --> 0:09:57,000
we like those big, juicy issues to discuss with people,

215
0:09:58.381,000 --> 0:09:59,000
we don't like conflict,

216
0:09:59.921,000 --> 0:10:,000
so we avoid it at all costs,

217
0:10:01.712,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is really important when we're trying to engage power holders,

218
0:10:05.025,000 --> 0:10:08,000
not to be conflicting with them all the time.

219
0:10:08.632,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The third way I think activists are really missing out

220
0:10:13.35,000 --> 0:10:14,000
if they don't engage introverts

221
0:10:15.244,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is that introverts, like I said, can be half of the world's population,

222
0:10:20.299,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and most of us won't say that we're introvert,

223
0:10:23.427,000 --> 0:10:26,000
or we get embarrassed by saying what overwhelms us.

224
0:10:26.645,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So for me, a few years ago,

225
0:10:28.67,000 --> 0:10:31,000
my mom used to send me texts in capital letters --

226
0:10:31.787,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and she can now do emojis and everything, she's fine --

227
0:10:34.961,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but as soon as I'd see this text,

228
0:10:36.764,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I'd wince and think, "Ooh, it's capital letters, it's too much."

229
0:10:40.408,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And I'd have to ignore it to read the lovely text she sent me.

230
0:10:43.614,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And that's a bit embarrassing,

231
0:10:45.121,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to tell people that capital letters overwhelm you,

232
0:10:48.257,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but we really need introverts to help us do intriguing activism

233
0:10:53.29,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that attracts them rather than puts them off.

234
0:10:55.877,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We're put off by big and brash giant posters

235
0:10:59.354,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and capital letters and explanation marks

236
0:11:01.886,000 --> 0:11:04,000
telling us what to do and vying for our attention.

237
0:11:05.332,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So some of the things I do with people around the world who take part

238
0:11:09.154,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is make small bits of provocative street art

239
0:11:11.52,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which are hung off eye level, very small,

240
0:11:14.186,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and they're provocative messages.

241
0:11:15.988,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They're not preaching at people or telling them what to do.

242
0:11:19.297,000 --> 0:11:21,000
They're just getting people to engage in different ways,

243
0:11:21.955,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and think for themselves,

244
0:11:23.17,000 --> 0:11:25,000
because we don't like to be told what to do.

245
0:11:25.921,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It might be wearing a green heart on your sleeve

246
0:11:28.398,000 --> 0:11:3,000
saying what you love and how climate change will affect it,

247
0:11:31.319,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and we'll wear it,

248
0:11:32.501,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and if people say,

249
0:11:33.707,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"Why are you wearing a green heart with the word 'chocolate' on?"

250
0:11:37.065,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and we can have those one-to-one intimate conversations and say,

251
0:11:40.255,000 --> 0:11:41,000
"I love chocolate.

252
0:11:41.47,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Climate change is going to affect it,

253
0:11:43.736,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and I think there's lot of other things that climate change will affect,

254
0:11:47.207,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and I really want to make sure I'm part of the solution, not the problem."

255
0:11:50.774,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And then we deflect, because we don't like to be the center of attention,

256
0:11:54.377,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and say, "What do you love and how will climate change affect it?"

257
0:11:58.071,000 --> 0:12:,000
Or it might be shop-dropping instead of shop-lifting,

258
0:12:00.858,000 --> 0:12:03,000
where we'll make little mini-scrolls with lovely stories on

259
0:12:04.739,000 --> 0:12:06,000
about what's the story behind your clothes.

260
0:12:07.121,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Is it a joyful story of how it's made, or is it a torturous one?

261
0:12:11.121,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And we'll just drop them in little pockets in shops,

262
0:12:13.942,000 --> 0:12:15,000
all lowercase, all handwritten,

263
0:12:16.201,000 --> 0:12:19,000
with kisses and smiley faces in ribbon,

264
0:12:19.575,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and then people are excited that they found it.

265
0:12:22.197,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And we often drop them in unethical shops

266
0:12:24.583,000 --> 0:12:26,000
or in front pockets,

267
0:12:26.701,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and it's a way that we can do offline campaigning

268
0:12:29.97,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that engages us and doesn't burn us out,

269
0:12:32.455,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but also engages other people in an intriguing way online and offline.

270
0:12:39.061,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So I've got two calls to action,

271
0:12:42.233,000 --> 0:12:44,000
for the introverts and for the extroverts.

272
0:12:45.242,000 --> 0:12:46,000
For the ambivert,

273
0:12:46.765,000 --> 0:12:47,000
you're involved in all of it.

274
0:12:49.055,000 --> 0:12:53,000
For the extroverts, I want to say that when you're planning a campaign,

275
0:12:54.025,000 --> 0:12:55,000
think about introverts.

276
0:12:55.565,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Think about how valuable our skills are, just as much as extroverts'.

277
0:13:00.017,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We're good at slowing down and thinking deeply,

278
0:13:02.8,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and the detail of issues, we're really good at bringing them out.

279
0:13:06.673,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We're good at intimate activism, so use us in that way.

280
0:13:10.752,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And we're good at intriguing people

281
0:13:13.069,000 --> 0:13:17,000
by doing strange little things that help create conversations and thought.

282
0:13:17.803,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Introverts, my call to action for you is,

283
0:13:21.023,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I know you like being on your own,

284
0:13:22.825,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I know you like being in your head,

285
0:13:24.7,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but activism needs you,

286
0:13:26.621,000 --> 0:13:28,000
so sometimes you've got to get out there.

287
0:13:28.677,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It doesn't mean that you've got to turn into an extrovert and burn out,

288
0:13:32.035,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because that's no use for anyone,

289
0:13:33.631,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but what it does mean

290
0:13:34.852,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is that you should value the skills and the traits that you have

291
0:13:38.82,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that activism needs.

292
0:13:40.835,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So for everyone in this room,

293
0:13:42.423,000 --> 0:13:45,000
whether you're an extrovert or an introvert or an ambivert,

294
0:13:46.256,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the world needs you now more than ever,

295
0:13:49.161,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and you've got no excuse not to get involved.

296
0:13:51.922,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Thanks.

297
0:13:53.097,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

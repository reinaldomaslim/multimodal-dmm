1
0:00:15.141,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I grew up with my identical twin,

2
0:00:18.461,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who was an incredibly loving brother.

3
0:00:21.477,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now, one thing about being a twin is,

4
0:00:24.573,000 --> 0:00:27,000
it makes you an expert at spotting favoritism.

5
0:00:28.642,000 --> 0:00:32,000
If his cookie was even slightly bigger than my cookie,

6
0:00:33.723,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I had questions.

7
0:00:35.099,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And clearly, I wasn't starving.

8
0:00:38.3,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:40.873,000 --> 0:00:44,000
When I became a psychologist, I began to notice favoritism

10
0:00:45.02,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of a different kind;

11
0:00:46.758,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that is, how much more we value the body than we do the mind.

12
0:00:52.187,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I spent nine years at university earning my doctorate in psychology,

13
0:00:58.245,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and I can't tell you how many people look at my business card and say,

14
0:01:02.523,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Oh -- a psychologist. So, not a real doctor,"

15
0:01:08.209,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as if it should say that on my card.

16
0:01:10.031,000 --> 0:01:12,000
[Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist (Not a Real Doctor)]

17
0:01:12.84,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:14.952,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This favoritism we show the body over the mind --

19
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I see it everywhere.

20
0:01:21.718,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I recently was at a friend's house,

21
0:01:23.409,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and their five-year-old was getting ready for bed.

22
0:01:25.955,000 --> 0:01:28,000
He was standing on a stool by the sink, brushing his teeth,

23
0:01:29.584,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when he slipped and scratched his leg on the stool when he fell.

24
0:01:33.996,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He cried for a minute, but then he got back up,

25
0:01:36.992,000 --> 0:01:39,000
got back on the stool, and reached out for a box of Band-Aids

26
0:01:40.53,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to put one on his cut.

27
0:01:43.05,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now, this kid could barely tie his shoelaces,

28
0:01:47.011,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but he knew you have to cover a cut so it doesn't become infected,

29
0:01:51.462,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and you have to care for your teeth by brushing twice a day.

30
0:01:55.425,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We all know how to maintain our physical health

31
0:01:58.369,000 --> 0:02:,000
and how to practice dental hygiene, right?

32
0:02:00.908,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We've known it since we were five years old.

33
0:02:04.442,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But what do we know about maintaining our psychological health?

34
0:02:10.07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Well, nothing.

35
0:02:11.778,000 --> 0:02:14,000
What do we teach our children about emotional hygiene?

36
0:02:16.74,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Nothing.

37
0:02:18.767,000 --> 0:02:22,000
How is it that we spend more time taking care of our teeth

38
0:02:23.595,000 --> 0:02:24,000
than we do our minds?

39
0:02:26.202,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Why is it that our physical health is so much more important to us

40
0:02:31.036,000 --> 0:02:32,000
than our psychological health?

41
0:02:33.393,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We sustain psychological injuries even more often than we do physical ones,

42
0:02:38.807,000 --> 0:02:42,000
injuries like failure or rejection or loneliness.

43
0:02:43.037,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And they can also get worse if we ignore them,

44
0:02:45.832,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and they can impact our lives in dramatic ways.

45
0:02:49.285,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And yet, even though there are scientifically proven techniques

46
0:02:53.489,000 --> 0:02:56,000
we could use to treat these kinds of psychological injuries,

47
0:02:57.803,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we don't.

48
0:02:59.374,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It doesn't even occur to us that we should.

49
0:03:02.434,000 --> 0:03:06,000
"Oh, you're feeling depressed? Just shake it off; it's all in your head."

50
0:03:07.19,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Can you imagine saying that to somebody with a broken leg:

51
0:03:10.091,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Oh, just walk it off; it's all in your leg."

52
0:03:12.907,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:15.249,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It is time we closed the gap

54
0:03:18.131,000 --> 0:03:21,000
between our physical and our psychological health.

55
0:03:21.243,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's time we made them more equal,

56
0:03:24.385,000 --> 0:03:25,000
more like twins.

57
0:03:27.148,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Speaking of which, my brother is also a psychologist.

58
0:03:30.945,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So he's not a real doctor, either.

59
0:03:33.4,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:35.708,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We didn't study together, though.

61
0:03:37.704,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In fact, the hardest thing I've ever done in my life

62
0:03:42.119,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is move across the Atlantic to New York City

63
0:03:44.889,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to get my doctorate in psychology.

64
0:03:47.698,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We were apart then for the first time in our lives,

65
0:03:50.685,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the separation was brutal for both of us.

66
0:03:54.295,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But while he remained among family and friends,

67
0:03:57.566,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I was alone in a new country.

68
0:04:00.251,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We missed each other terribly,

69
0:04:01.995,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but international phone calls were really expensive then,

70
0:04:05.172,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and we could only afford to speak for five minutes a week.

71
0:04:10.459,000 --> 0:04:11,000
When our birthday rolled around,

72
0:04:12.009,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it was the first we wouldn't be spending together.

73
0:04:14.585,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We decided to splurge,

74
0:04:15.938,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and that week, we would talk for 10 minutes.

75
0:04:18.128,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:19.445,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I spent the morning pacing around my room, waiting for him to call --

77
0:04:24.154,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and waiting ...

78
0:04:26.103,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and waiting.

79
0:04:27.817,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But the phone didn't ring.

80
0:04:30.125,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Given the time difference, I assumed,

81
0:04:32.167,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"OK, he's out with friends, he'll call later."

82
0:04:34.489,000 --> 0:04:35,000
There were no cell phones then.

83
0:04:36.805,000 --> 0:04:37,000
But he didn't.

84
0:04:39.171,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I began to realize that after being away for over 10 months,

85
0:04:44.253,000 --> 0:04:46,000
he no longer missed me the way I missed him.

86
0:04:48.028,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I knew he would call in the morning,

87
0:04:50.555,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life.

88
0:04:56.717,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I woke up the next morning.

89
0:04:58.688,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I glanced down at the phone,

90
0:05:00.359,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I realized I had kicked it off the hook

91
0:05:03.137,000 --> 0:05:04,000
when pacing the day before.

92
0:05:06.612,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I stumbled out of bed,

93
0:05:08.287,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I put the phone back on the receiver, and it rang a second later.

94
0:05:11.764,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And it was my brother,

95
0:05:13.448,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and boy, was he pissed.

96
0:05:15.14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:17.368,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It was the saddest and longest night of his life as well.

98
0:05:21.126,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now, I tried to explain what happened, but he said,

99
0:05:23.561,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"I don't understand.

100
0:05:24.804,000 --> 0:05:25,000
If you saw I wasn't calling you,

101
0:05:26.743,000 --> 0:05:28,000
why didn't you just pick up the phone and call me?"

102
0:05:31.057,000 --> 0:05:32,000
He was right.

103
0:05:32.841,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Why didn't I call him?

104
0:05:35.187,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I didn't have an answer then.

105
0:05:37.608,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But I do today,

106
0:05:39.083,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it's a simple one:

107
0:05:41.688,000 --> 0:05:42,000
loneliness.

108
0:05:43.948,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Loneliness creates a deep psychological wound,

109
0:05:48.021,000 --> 0:05:51,000
one that distorts our perceptions and scrambles our thinking.

110
0:05:52.228,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It makes us believe that those around us care much less than they actually do.

111
0:05:58.034,000 --> 0:06:,000
It make us really afraid to reach out,

112
0:06:00.352,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because why set yourself up for rejection and heartache

113
0:06:04.466,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when your heart is already aching more than you can stand?

114
0:06:08.432,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I was in the grips of real loneliness back then,

115
0:06:11.539,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but I was surrounded by people all day, so it never occurred to me.

116
0:06:16.273,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But loneliness is defined purely subjectively.

117
0:06:20.415,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It depends solely on whether you feel emotionally or socially disconnected

118
0:06:26.203,000 --> 0:06:27,000
from those around you.

119
0:06:27.385,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And I did.

120
0:06:29.249,000 --> 0:06:34,000
There is a lot of research on loneliness, and all of it is horrifying.

121
0:06:35.499,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Loneliness won't just make you miserable;

122
0:06:38.307,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it will kill you.

123
0:06:39.79,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I'm not kidding.

124
0:06:40.984,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Chronic loneliness increases your likelihood of an early death

125
0:06:44.599,000 --> 0:06:45,000
by 14 percent.

126
0:06:46.902,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Fourteen percent!

127
0:06:48.78,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Loneliness causes high blood pressure,

128
0:06:51.619,000 --> 0:06:52,000
high cholesterol.

129
0:06:52.808,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It even suppress the functioning of your immune system,

130
0:06:56.557,000 --> 0:07:,000
making you vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses and diseases.

131
0:07:00.613,000 --> 0:07:03,000
In fact, scientists have concluded that taken together,

132
0:07:04.175,000 --> 0:07:07,000
chronic loneliness poses as significant a risk

133
0:07:07.855,000 --> 0:07:09,000
for your long-term health and longevity

134
0:07:10.648,000 --> 0:07:11,000
as cigarette smoking.

135
0:07:12.464,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, cigarette packs come with warnings saying, "This could kill you."

136
0:07:17.033,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But loneliness doesn't.

137
0:07:19.405,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And that's why it's so important

138
0:07:21.284,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that we prioritize our psychological health,

139
0:07:24.371,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that we practice emotional hygiene.

140
0:07:27.525,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Because you can't treat a psychological wound

141
0:07:30.382,000 --> 0:07:32,000
if you don't even know you're injured.

142
0:07:34.076,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Loneliness isn't the only psychological wound

143
0:07:36.944,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that distorts our perceptions and misleads us.

144
0:07:40.54,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Failure does that as well.

145
0:07:43.818,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I once visited a day care center,

146
0:07:46.105,000 --> 0:07:5,000
where I saw three toddlers play with identical plastic toys.

147
0:07:51.14,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You had to slide the red button, and a cute doggie would pop out.

148
0:07:55.817,000 --> 0:07:59,000
One little girl tried pulling the purple button, then pushing it,

149
0:08:00.412,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and then she just sat back and looked at the box

150
0:08:03.23,000 --> 0:08:04,000
with her lower lip trembling.

151
0:08:05.029,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The little boy next to her watched this happen,

152
0:08:08.104,000 --> 0:08:11,000
then turned to his box and burst into tears without even touching it.

153
0:08:13.141,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Meanwhile, another little girl tried everything she could think of

154
0:08:16.607,000 --> 0:08:17,000
until she slid the red button,

155
0:08:18.415,000 --> 0:08:21,000
the cute doggie popped out, and she squealed with delight.

156
0:08:22.421,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So: three toddlers with identical plastic toys,

157
0:08:26.233,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but with very different reactions to failure.

158
0:08:29.893,000 --> 0:08:32,000
The first two toddlers were perfectly capable of sliding a red button.

159
0:08:34.455,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The only thing that prevented them from succeeding

160
0:08:37.59,000 --> 0:08:4,000
was that their mind tricked them into believing they could not.

161
0:08:41.92,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now, adults get tricked this way as well, all the time.

162
0:08:46.028,000 --> 0:08:51,000
In fact, we all have a default set of feelings and beliefs

163
0:08:51.205,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that gets triggered whenever we encounter frustrations and setbacks.

164
0:08:55.324,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Are you aware of how your mind reacts to failure?

165
0:08:58.783,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You need to be.

166
0:09:00.033,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Because if your mind tries to convince you you're incapable of something,

167
0:09:04.43,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and you believe it,

168
0:09:05.963,000 --> 0:09:08,000
then like those two toddlers, you'll begin to feel helpless

169
0:09:09.261,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and you'll stop trying too soon, or you won't even try at all.

170
0:09:12.859,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And then you'll be even more convinced you can't succeed.

171
0:09:15.967,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You see, that's why so many people function below their actual potential.

172
0:09:20.951,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Because somewhere along the way, sometimes a single failure

173
0:09:24.259,000 --> 0:09:27,000
convinced them that they couldn't succeed, and they believed it.

174
0:09:28.9,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Once we become convinced of something, it's very difficult to change our mind.

175
0:09:33.831,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I learned that lesson the hard way when I was a teenager with my brother.

176
0:09:38.031,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We were driving with friends down a dark road at night,

177
0:09:41.39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
when a police car stopped us.

178
0:09:43.094,000 --> 0:09:46,000
There had been a robbery in the area and they were looking for suspects.

179
0:09:46.681,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The officer approached the car, and shined his flashlight on the driver,

180
0:09:50.839,000 --> 0:09:52,000
then on my brother in the front seat,

181
0:09:53.285,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and then on me.

182
0:09:54.475,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And his eyes opened wide and he said,

183
0:09:57.283,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"Where have I seen your face before?"

184
0:09:59.148,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

185
0:10:02.075,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And I said,

186
0:10:03.683,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"In the front seat."

187
0:10:05.382,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

188
0:10:08.405,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But that made no sense to him whatsoever,

189
0:10:10.549,000 --> 0:10:11,000
so now he thought I was on drugs.

190
0:10:12.512,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

191
0:10:14.096,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So he drags me out of the car, he searches me,

192
0:10:16.691,000 --> 0:10:17,000
he marches me over to the police car,

193
0:10:18.542,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and only when he verified I didn't have a police record,

194
0:10:22.066,000 --> 0:10:25,000
could I show him I had a twin in the front seat.

195
0:10:26.417,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But even as we were driving away,

196
0:10:28.213,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you could see by the look on his face he was convinced

197
0:10:31.225,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that I was getting away with something.

198
0:10:33.293,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Laughter)

199
0:10:35.293,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Our mind is hard to change once we become convinced.

200
0:10:38.669,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So it might be very natural to feel demoralized

201
0:10:42.133,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and defeated after you fail.

202
0:10:43.844,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But you cannot allow yourself to become convinced you can't succeed.

203
0:10:48.242,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You have to fight feelings of helplessness.

204
0:10:51.114,000 --> 0:10:54,000
You have to gain control over the situation.

205
0:10:54.393,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And you have to break this kind of negative cycle

206
0:10:57.009,000 --> 0:10:58,000
before it begins.

[Stop Emotional Bleeding]

208
0:11:00.191,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Our minds and our feelings --

209
0:11:02.626,000 --> 0:11:05,000
they're not the trustworthy friends we thought they were.

210
0:11:05.991,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They're more like a really moody friend,

211
0:11:08.857,000 --> 0:11:12,000
who can be totally supportive one minute, and really unpleasant the next.

212
0:11:14.175,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I once worked with this woman who, after 20 years marriage

213
0:11:17.882,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and an extremely ugly divorce,

214
0:11:20.311,000 --> 0:11:22,000
was finally ready for her first date.

215
0:11:22.572,000 --> 0:11:24,000
She had met this guy online,

216
0:11:24.619,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and he seemed nice and he seemed successful,

217
0:11:27.073,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and most importantly, he seemed really into her.

218
0:11:30.629,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So she was very excited, she bought a new dress,

219
0:11:33.411,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and they met at an upscale New York City bar for a drink.

220
0:11:37.667,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Ten minutes into the date, the man stands up and says,

221
0:11:41.471,000 --> 0:11:42,000
"I'm not interested," and walks out.

222
0:11:45.798,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Rejection is extremely painful.

223
0:11:49.5,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The woman was so hurt she couldn't move.

224
0:11:52.037,000 --> 0:11:53,000
All she could do was call a friend.

225
0:11:54.198,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Here's what the friend said: "Well, what do you expect?

226
0:11:58.816,000 --> 0:12:01,000
You have big hips, you have nothing interesting to say.

227
0:12:02.493,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Why would a handsome, successful man like that

228
0:12:05.051,000 --> 0:12:07,000
ever go out with a loser like you?"

229
0:12:09.092,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Shocking, right, that a friend could be so cruel?

230
0:12:12.531,000 --> 0:12:14,000
But it would be much less shocking

231
0:12:15.157,000 --> 0:12:17,000
if I told you it wasn't the friend who said that.

232
0:12:17.957,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's what the woman said to herself.

233
0:12:20.893,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And that's something we all do,

234
0:12:23.334,000 --> 0:12:24,000
especially after a rejection.

235
0:12:25.251,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We all start thinking of all our faults and all our shortcomings,

236
0:12:28.72,000 --> 0:12:3,000
what we wish we were, what we wish we weren't.

237
0:12:30.91,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We call ourselves names.

238
0:12:32.289,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it.

239
0:12:35.274,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And it's interesting that we do,

240
0:12:36.92,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because our self-esteem is already hurting.

241
0:12:40.189,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Why would we want to go and damage it even further?

242
0:12:43.236,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We wouldn't make a physical injury worse on purpose.

243
0:12:45.882,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You wouldn't get a cut on your arm and decide, "Oh! I know --

244
0:12:48.808,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I'm going to take a knife and see how much deeper I can make it."

245
0:12:52.368,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But we do that with psychological injuries all the time.

246
0:12:55.973,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene.

247
0:12:59.442,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Because we don't prioritize our psychological health.

248
0:13:02.862,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We know from dozens of studies that when your self-esteem is lower,

249
0:13:06.446,000 --> 0:13:09,000
you are more vulnerable to stress and to anxiety;

250
0:13:09.931,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that failures and rejections hurt more,

251
0:13:12.629,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and it takes longer to recover from them.

252
0:13:15.507,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So when you get rejected, the first thing you should be doing

253
0:13:18.783,000 --> 0:13:2,000
is to revive your self-esteem,

254
0:13:20.868,000 --> 0:13:22,000
not join Fight Club and beat it into a pulp.

255

When you're in emotional pain,

256
0:13:27.459,000 --> 0:13:3,000
treat yourself with the same compassion

257
0:13:30.521,000 --> 0:13:32,000
you would expect from a truly good friend.

[Protect Your Self-Esteem]

259
0:13:35.273,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We have to catch our unhealthy psychological habits and change them.

260
0:13:39.598,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And one of unhealthiest and most common is called rumination.

261
0:13:44.228,000 --> 0:13:46,000
To ruminate means to chew over.

262
0:13:46.752,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It's when your boss yells at you

263
0:13:48.965,000 --> 0:13:5,000
or your professor makes you feel stupid in class,

264
0:13:51.61,000 --> 0:13:53,000
or you have big fight with a friend

265
0:13:53.883,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and you just can't stop replaying the scene in your head for days,

266
0:13:57.968,000 --> 0:13:59,000
sometimes for weeks on end.

267
0:14:00.494,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Now, ruminating about upsetting events in this way can easily become a habit,

268
0:14:05.517,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and it's a very costly one,

269
0:14:07.431,000 --> 0:14:11,000
because by spending so much time focused on upsetting and negative thoughts,

270
0:14:12.175,000 --> 0:14:14,000
you are actually putting yourself at significant risk

271

for developing clinical depression,

and even cardiovascular disease.

275
0:14:22.682,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The problem is,

276
0:14:23.898,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the urge to ruminate can feel really strong and really important,

277
0:14:27.863,000 --> 0:14:29,000
so it's a difficult habit to stop.

278
0:14:30.804,000 --> 0:14:31,000
I know this for a fact,

279
0:14:32.451,000 --> 0:14:35,000
because a little over a year ago, I developed the habit myself.

280
0:14:36.54,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You see, my twin brother was diagnosed with stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

281
0:14:42.965,000 --> 0:14:44,000
His cancer was extremely aggressive.

282
0:14:45.133,000 --> 0:14:48,000
He had visible tumors all over his body.

283
0:14:48.904,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And he had to start a harsh course of chemotherapy.

284
0:14:53.627,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And I couldn't stop thinking about what he was going through.

285
0:14:58.586,000 --> 0:15:,000
I couldn't stop thinking about how much he was suffering,

286
0:15:02.322,000 --> 0:15:05,000
even though he never complained, not once.

287
0:15:06.07,000 --> 0:15:08,000
He had this incredibly positive attitude.

288
0:15:09.021,000 --> 0:15:11,000
His psychological health was amazing.

289
0:15:12.212,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I was physically healthy, but psychologically, I was a mess.

290
0:15:17.303,000 --> 0:15:18,000
But I knew what to do.

291
0:15:18.568,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Studies tell us that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient

292
0:15:23.243,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to break the urge to ruminate in that moment.

293
0:15:26.11,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And so each time I had a worrying, upsetting, negative thought,

294
0:15:29.782,000 --> 0:15:33,000
I forced myself to concentrate on something else until the urge passed.

295
0:15:34.161,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And within one week, my whole outlook changed

296
0:15:38.65,000 --> 0:15:4,000

Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy, my brother had a CAT scan,

299
0:15:48.167,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and I was by his side when he got the results.

300

All the tumors were gone.

301

He still had three more rounds of chemotherapy to go,

0:16:33.542,000 --> 0:16:34,000
in just a matter of decades.

314
0:16:35.947,000 --> 0:16:39,000
I believe our quality of life could rise just as dramatically

315
0:16:40.06,000 --> 0:16:43,000
if we all began practicing emotional hygiene.

316
0:16:44.194,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Can you imagine what the world would be like

317
0:16:46.281,000 --> 0:16:48,000
if everyone was psychologically healthier?

318
0:16:48.841,000 --> 0:16:5,000
If there were less loneliness and less depression?

319
0:16:52.24,000 --> 0:16:54,000
If people knew how to overcome failure?

320
0:16:55.224,000 --> 0:16:58,000
If they felt better about themselves and more empowered?

321
0:16:58.513,000 --> 0:17:,000
If they were happier and more fulfilled?

322
0:17:01.76,000 --> 0:17:04,000
I can, because that's the world I want to live in.

323
0:17:06.021,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And that's the world my brother wants to live in as well.

324
0:17:10.371,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And if you just become informed and change a few simple habits, well --

325
0:17:16.001,000 --> 0:17:18,000
that's the world we can all live in.

326
0:17:19.373,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Thank you very much.

327
0:17:20.563,000 --> 0:17:22,000

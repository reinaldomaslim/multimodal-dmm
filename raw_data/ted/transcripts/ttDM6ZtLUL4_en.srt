1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Ben Roche: So I'm Ben, by the way.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Homaro Cantu: And I'm Homaro.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
BR: And we're chefs. So when Moto

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
opened in 2004, people didn't really know

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
what to expect. A lot of people thought

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that it was a Japanese restaurant, and

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
maybe it was the name, maybe it was

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the logo, which was like a Japanese

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
character, but anyway, we had all these

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
requests for Japanese food, which is

11
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
really not what we did. And after about

12
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the ten thousandth request for a maki roll,

13
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we decided to give the people

14
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
what they wanted. So this picture is

15
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
an example of printed food, and this was

16
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the first foray into what we like to call

17
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
flavor transformation. So this is all

18
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the ingredients, all the flavor of, you know,

19
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
a standard maki roll, printed onto

20
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a little piece of paper.

21
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
HC: So our diners started to get bored

22
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
with this idea, and we decided to give them

23
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the same course twice, so here we actually

24
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
took an element from the maki roll and

25
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and took a picture of a dish and then

26
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
basically served that picture with the dish.

27
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So this dish in particular is basically

28
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
champagne with seafood.

29
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The champagne grapes that you see are

30
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
actually carbonated grapes. A little bit of

31
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
seafood and some crème fraiche and the

32
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
picture actually tastes exactly like the dish. (Laughter)

33
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
BR: But it's not all just edible pictures.

34
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We decided to do something

35
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a little bit different and transform flavors

36
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that were very familiar -- so in this case,

37
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we have carrot cake.

38
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So we take a carrot cake, put it

39
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in a blender, and we have kind of like

40
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a carrot cake juice, and then that went into

41
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create

42
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
this hollow shell of carrot cake

43
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
ice cream, I guess, and it comes off

44
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
looking like, you know,

45
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Jupiter's floating around your plate.

46
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So yeah, we're transforming things into

47
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
something that you have absolutely

48
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
no reference for.

49
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
HC: And here's something we have no

50
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
reference to eat. This is a cigar, and

51
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
basically it's a Cuban cigar made out of

52
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a Cuban pork sandwich, so we take these

53
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
spices that go into the pork shoulder,

54
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we fashion that into ash. We take

55
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the sandwich and wrap it up in

56
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a collard green, put an edible label

57
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that bears no similarity to

58
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a Cohiba cigar label, and we put it

59
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in a dollar ninety-nine ashtray and charge

60
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
you about twenty bucks for it. (Laughter)

61
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
HC: Delicious.

62
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
BR: That's not it, though.

63
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Instead of making foods that

64
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
look like things that you wouldn't eat,

65
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we decided to make ingredients

66
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
look like dishes that you know.

67
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So this is a plate of nachos.

68
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The difference between our nachos

69
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and the other guy's nachos,

70
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is that this is actually a dessert.

71
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So the chips are candied,

72
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the ground beef is made from chocolate,

73
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and the cheese is made from a shredded

74
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
mango sorbet that gets shredded

75
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
into liquid nitrogen to look like cheese.

76
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And after doing all of this

77
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
dematerialization and reconfiguring

78
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of this, of these ingredients, we realized

79
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that it was pretty cool,

80
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because as we served it, we learned that

81
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the dish actually behaves like the real thing,

82
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
where the cheese begins to melt.

83
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So when you're looking at this thing

84
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in the dining room, you have this sensation

85
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that this is actually a plate of nachos,

86
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and it's not really until you begin tasting it

87
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that you realize this is a dessert, and

88
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it's just kind of like a mind-ripper.

89
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
HC: So we had been creating

91
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
all of these dishes out of a

92
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
kitchen that was more like

93
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a mechanic's shop than a kitchen, and

94
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the next logical step for us was to install

95
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
a state-of-the-art laboratory,

96
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and that's what we have here.

97
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So we put this in the basement, and we

98
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
got really serious about food, like

99
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
serious experimentation.

100
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
BR: One of the really cool things about

101
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the lab, besides that we have a new

102
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
science lab in the kitchen, is that,

103
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you know, with this new equipment, and

104
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
this new approach, all these

105
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
different doors to creativity that we never

106
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
knew were there began to open, and so the

107
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
experiments and the food and the dishes

108
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that we created, they just kept going

109
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
further and further out there.

110
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
HC: Let's talk about flavor transformation,

111
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and let's actually make some cool stuff.

112
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You see a cow with its tongue hanging out.

113
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
What I see is a cow about to eat something

114
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
delicious. What is that cow eating?

115
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And why is it delicious?

116
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So the cow, basically, eats three basic

117
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
things in their feed: corn, beets, and barley,

118
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and so what I do is I actually

119
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
challenge my staff with these crazy,

120
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
wild ideas. Can we take what the cow

121
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
eats, remove the cow, and then make

122
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
some hamburgers out of that?

123
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And basically the reaction tends to be

124
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
kind of like this. (Laughter)

125
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
BR: Yeah, that's our chef de cuisine,

126
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Chris Jones. This is not the only guy

127
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that just flips out when we assign

128
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
a ridiculous task, but a lot of these ideas,

129
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
they're hard to understand.

130
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They're hard to just get automatically.

131
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
There's a lot of research and a lot of

132
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
failure, trial and error -- I guess, more error --

133
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that goes into each and every dish,

134
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
so we don't always get it right, and it takes

135
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
a while for us to be able to explain that

136
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to people.

137
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
HC: So, after about a day of Chris and I

138
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
staring at each other, we came up with

139
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
something that was pretty close

140
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to the hamburger patty, and as you can

141
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
see it basically forms like hamburger meat.

142
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
This is made from three ingredients:

143
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
beets, barley, corn, and so it

144
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
actually cooks up like hamburger meat,

145
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
looks and tastes like hamburger meat,

146
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and not only that, but it's basically

147
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
removing the cow from the equation.

148
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So replicating food, taking it into that

149
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
next level is where we're going.

150
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Applause)

151
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
BR: And it's definitely the world's first

152
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
bleeding veggie burger,

153
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which is a cool side effect.

154
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And a miracle berry, if you're not familiar

155
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
with it, is a natural ingredient, and it

156
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
contains a special property.

157
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's a glycoprotein called miraculin,

158
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a naturally occurring thing. It still freaks

159
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
me out every time I eat it, but it has a

160
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
unique ability to mask certain taste

161
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
receptors on your tongue, so that primarily

162
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
sour taste receptors, so normally things

163
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that would taste very sour or tart,

164
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
somehow begin to taste very sweet.

165
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
HC: You're about to eat a lemon,

166
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and now it tastes like lemonade.

167
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Let's just stop and think about the

168
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
economic benefits of something like that.

169
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We could eliminate sugar across the board

170
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
for all confectionary products and sodas,

171
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and we can replace it with

172
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
all-natural fresh fruit.

173
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
BR: So you see us here cutting up

174
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
some watermelon. The idea with this

175
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is that we're going to eliminate tons of

176
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
food miles, wasted energy,

177
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and overfishing of tuna by creating tuna,

178
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or any exotic produce or item

179
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
from a very far-away place,

180
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with local, organic produce;

181
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so we have a watermelon from Wisconsin.

182
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
HC: So if miracle berries take sour things

183
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and turn them into sweet things,

184
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we have this other pixie dust

185
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that we put on the watermelon, and it

186
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
makes it go from sweet to savory.

187
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So after we do that, we put it into

188
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
a vacuum bag, add a little bit of seaweed,

189
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
some spices, and we roll it, and this

190
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
starts taking on the appearance of tuna.

191
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So the key now is to make it

192
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
behave like tuna.

193
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
BR: And then after a quick dip into some

194
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
liquid nitrogen to get that perfect sear,

195
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we really have something that looks,

196
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
tastes and behaves like the real thing.

197
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
HC: So the key thing to remember here is,

198
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we don't really care

199
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
what this tuna really is.

200
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
As long as it's good for you and good for

201
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the environment, it doesn't matter.

202
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But where is this going?

203
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
How can we take this idea of tricking your

204
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
tastebuds and leapfrog it into something

205
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that we can do today that could be

206
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
a disruptive food technology?

207
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So here's the next challenge.

208
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I told the staff, let's just take a bunch

209
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of wild plants, think of them as

210
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
food ingredients. As long as they're

211
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
non-poisonous to the human body,

212
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
go out around Chicago sidewalks,

213
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
take it, blend it, cook it and then

214
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
have everybody flavor-trip on it at Moto.

215
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Let's charge them a boatload of cash for this

216
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and see what they think. (Laughter)

217
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
BR: Yeah, so you can imagine, a task

218
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
like this -- this is another one of those

219
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
assignments that the kitchen staff

220
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
hated us for. But we really had to almost

221
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
relearn how to cook in general,

222
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because these are ingredients, you know,

223
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
plant life that we're, one, unfamiliar with,

224
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and two, we have no reference for how

225
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to cook these things because

226
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
people don't eat them.

227
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So we really had to think about new, creative ways

228
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to flavor, new ways to cook

229
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and to change texture -- and that was

230
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the main issue with this challenge.

231
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
HC: So this is where we step into the future

232
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and we leapfrog ahead.

233
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So developing nations

234
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and first-world nations,

235
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
imagine if you could take these wild plants

236
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and consume them, food miles would

237
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
basically turn into food feet.

238
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This disruptive mentality of what food is

239
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
would essentially open up the encyclopedia

240
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
of what raw ingredients are, even if we just

241
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
swapped out, say, one of these for flour,

242
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
that would eliminate so much energy

243
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and so much waste.

244
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And to give you a simple example here as to

245
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
what we actually fed these customers,

246
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
there's a bale of hay there

247
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and some crab apples.

248
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And basically we took hay and crab apples

249
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and made barbecue sauce out of those two ingredients.

250
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
People swore they were eating

251
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
barbecue sauce, and this is free food.

252
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
BR: Thanks, guys.

253
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:17,000
An 18-year-old, African-American male joined the United States Air Force

2
0:00:18.331,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and was assigned to Mountain Home Air Force Base

3
0:00:21.585,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and was a part of the air police squadron.

4
0:00:24.472,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Upon first arriving there, the first goal that I had

5
0:00:28.121,000 --> 0:00:3,000
was for me to identify an apartment,

6
0:00:30.897,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so I could bring my wife and my new baby, Melanie,

7
0:00:34.717,000 --> 0:00:35,000
out to join me in Idaho.

8
0:00:36.707,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I immediately went to the personnel office,

9
0:00:39.219,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and talking with the guys in personnel,

10
0:00:41.153,000 --> 0:00:46,000
they said, "Hey, no problem finding an apartment in Mountain Home, Idaho.

11
0:00:46.319,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The people down there love us because they know if they have an airman

12
0:00:51.509,000 --> 0:00:53,000
who is coming in to rent one of their apartments,

13
0:00:53.872,000 --> 0:00:55,000
they'll always get their money."

14
0:00:56.235,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And that was a really important thing.

15
0:00:58.108,000 --> 0:01:,000
He said, "So here is a list of people that you can call,

16
0:01:00.927,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and then they will then allow you to select the apartment that you want."

17
0:01:04.942,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So I got the list; I made the call.

18
0:01:07.806,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The lady answered on the other end and I told her what I wanted.

19
0:01:10.824,000 --> 0:01:12,000
She said, "Oh, great you called.

20
0:01:13.126,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We have four or five apartments available right now."

21
0:01:17.078,000 --> 0:01:19,000
She said, "Do you want a one-bedroom or two-bedroom?"

22
0:01:20.072,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Then she said, "Let's not talk about that.

23
0:01:22.125,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Just come on down, select the apartment that you want.

24
0:01:24.946,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We'll sign the contract

25
0:01:26.834,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and you'll have keys in your hand to get your family out here right away."

26
0:01:30.741,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So I was excited.

27
0:01:32.27,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I jumped in my car. I went downtown and knocked on the door.

28
0:01:35.666,000 --> 0:01:37,000
When I knocked on the door, the woman came to the door,

29
0:01:38.327,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and she looked at me, and she said, "Can I help you?"

30
0:01:41.261,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I said, "Yes, I'm the person who called about the apartments.

31
0:01:45.102,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I was just coming down to make my selection."

32
0:01:47.516,000 --> 0:01:49,000
She said, "You know what? I'm really sorry,

33
0:01:50.052,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but my husband rented those apartments and didn't tell me about them."

34
0:01:54.14,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I said, "You mean he rented all five of them in one hour?"

35
0:01:59.075,000 --> 0:02:02,000
She didn't give me a response, and what she said was this:

36
0:02:02.46,000 --> 0:02:04,000
She said, "Why don't you leave your number,

37
0:02:04.685,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and if we have some openings, I'll give you a call?"

38
0:02:07.722,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Needless to say, I did not get a call from her.

39
0:02:11.004,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Nor did I get any responses from the other people

40
0:02:14.28,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that they gave me on the list where I could get apartments.

41
0:02:17.801,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So as a result of that, and feeling rejected,

42
0:02:20.092,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I went back to the base, and I talked to the squadron commander.

43
0:02:23.978,000 --> 0:02:25,000
His name was McDow, Major McDow.

44
0:02:26.244,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I said, "Major McDow, I need your help."

45
0:02:28.436,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I told him what happened, and here's what he said to me:

46
0:02:31.111,000 --> 0:02:33,000
He said, "James, I would love to help you.

47
0:02:33.453,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But you know the problem:

48
0:02:35.182,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We can't make people rent to folks that they don't want to rent to.

49
0:02:39.416,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And besides, we have a great relationship with people in the community

50
0:02:43.914,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and we really don't want to damage that."

51
0:02:45.956,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He said, "So maybe this is what you should do.

52
0:02:48.226,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Why don't you let your family stay home,

53
0:02:50.864,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because you do know that you get a 30-day leave.

54
0:02:53.818,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So once a year,

55
0:02:55.213,000 --> 0:02:59,000
you can go home to your family, spend 30 days and then come on back."

56
0:02:59.818,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Needless to say, that didn't resonate for me.

57
0:03:01.988,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So after leaving him, I went back to personnel,

58
0:03:04.914,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and talking to the clerk,

59
0:03:06.414,000 --> 0:03:08,000
he said, "Jim, I think I have a solution for you.

60
0:03:09.215,000 --> 0:03:13,000
There's an airman who is leaving and he has a trailer.

61
0:03:13.507,000 --> 0:03:14,000
If you noticed, in Mountain Home,

62
0:03:15.343,000 --> 0:03:17,000
there are trailer parks and trailers all over the place.

63
0:03:17.991,000 --> 0:03:2,000
You can buy his trailer, and you'd probably get a really good deal

64
0:03:21.534,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because he wants to get out of town as soon as possible.

65
0:03:24.208,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And that would take care of your problem,

66
0:03:26.19,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and that would provide the solution for you."

67
0:03:28.342,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So I immediately jumped in my car, went downtown, saw the trailer --

68
0:03:31.578,000 --> 0:03:32,000
it was a small trailer,

69
0:03:33.422,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but under the circumstances,

70
0:03:35.032,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I figured that was the best thing that I could do.

71
0:03:37.447,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So I bought the trailer.

72
0:03:39.008,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And then I asked him, "Can I just leave the trailer here,

73
0:03:42.279,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and that would take care of all my problems,

74
0:03:44.513,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I wouldn't have to find another trailer park?"

75
0:03:46.682,000 --> 0:03:49,000
He said, "Before I say yes to that, I need to check with management."

76
0:03:50.536,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So I get back to the base,

77
0:03:51.968,000 --> 0:03:53,000
he called me back and management said,

78
0:03:54.125,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"No, you can't leave the trailer here

79
0:03:56.569,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because we had promised that slot to some other people."

80
0:04:00.133,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And that was strange to me

81
0:04:01.944,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because there were several other slots that were open,

82
0:04:04.515,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but it just so happened that he had promised that slot to someone else.

83
0:04:08.202,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So, what I did --

84
0:04:09.504,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and he said, "You shouldn't worry, Jim, because there are a lot of trailer parks."

85
0:04:13.571,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So I put out another exhaustive list of going to trailer parks.

86
0:04:17.42,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I went to one after another, after another.

87
0:04:19.49,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I got the same kind of rejection there

88
0:04:22.092,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that I received when I was looking for the apartment.

89
0:04:26.221,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And as a result, the kind of comments that they made to me,

90
0:04:30.55,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in addition to saying that they didn't have any slots open,

91
0:04:34.753,000 --> 0:04:38,000
one person said, "Jim, the reason why we can't rent to you,

92
0:04:39.008,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we already have a Negro family in the trailer park."

93
0:04:43.188,000 --> 0:04:47,000
He said, "And it's not me, because I like you people."

94
0:04:47.224,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughs)

95
0:04:48.526,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And that's what I did, too. I chuckled, too.

96
0:04:52.257,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He said, "But here's the problem:

97
0:04:54.233,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If I let you in, the other tenants will move out

98
0:04:58.542,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I can't afford to take that kind of a hit."

99
0:05:01.725,000 --> 0:05:03,000
He said, "I just can't rent to you."

100
0:05:04.052,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Even though that was discouraging, it didn't stop me.

101
0:05:06.603,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I kept looking,

102
0:05:07.933,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I looked at the far end of the town in Mountain Home,

103
0:05:12.233,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and there was a small trailer park.

104
0:05:14.327,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I mean, a really small trailer park.

105
0:05:16.414,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It didn't have any paved roads in it,

106
0:05:18.462,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it didn't have the concrete slabs,

107
0:05:20.47,000 --> 0:05:21,000
it didn't have fencing

108
0:05:22.019,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to portion off your trailer slot from other trailer slots.

109
0:05:25.111,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It didn't have a laundry facility.

110
0:05:26.923,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But the conclusion I reached at that moment

111
0:05:29.116,000 --> 0:05:31,000
was that I didn't have a lot of other options.

112
0:05:31.398,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So I called my wife, and I said, "We're going to make this one work."

113
0:05:34.854,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And we moved into it

114
0:05:36.399,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and we became homeowners in Mountain Home, Idaho.

115
0:05:40.117,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And of course, eventually things settled down.

116
0:05:44.758,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Four years after that, I received papers to move from Mountain Home, Idaho

117
0:05:50.236,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to a place called Goose Bay, Labrador.

118
0:05:53.27,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We won't even talk about that. It was another great location. (Laughter)

119
0:05:57.18,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So my challenge then was to get my family from Mountain Home, Idaho

120
0:06:01.888,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to Sharon, Pennsylvania.

121
0:06:03.639,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That wasn't a problem because we had just purchased a brand-new automobile.

122
0:06:07.169,000 --> 0:06:09,000
My mother called and said she'll fly out.

123
0:06:09.569,000 --> 0:06:13,000
She'll be with us as we drive, she'll help us manage the children.

124
0:06:13.951,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So she came out, her and Alice put a lot of food together for the trip.

125
0:06:17.881,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That morning, we left at about 5 a.m.

126
0:06:20.964,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Great trip, having a great time, good conversation.

127
0:06:24.11,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Somewhere around 6:30, 7 o'clock, we got a little bit tired,

128
0:06:27.944,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we said, "Why don't we get a motel so that we can rest

129
0:06:30.783,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and then have an early start in the morning?"

130
0:06:33.164,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So we were looking at a number of the motels as we drove down the road,

131
0:06:36.544,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and we saw one, it was a great big, bright flashing light that said,

132
0:06:40.021,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacanies."

133
0:06:42.325,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So we stopped in.

134
0:06:43.622,000 --> 0:06:45,000
They were in the parking lot, I went inside.

135
0:06:45.807,000 --> 0:06:46,000
When I walked inside,

136
0:06:47.134,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the lady was just finishing up one contract with some folks,

137
0:06:50.311,000 --> 0:06:52,000
some other people were coming in behind me.

138
0:06:52.4,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And so I walked to the counter,

139
0:06:54.133,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and she said, "How can I help you?"

140
0:06:56.296,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I said, "I would like to get a motel for the evening for my family."

141
0:06:59.556,000 --> 0:07:03,000
She said, "You know, I'm really sorry, I just rented the last one.

142
0:07:04.058,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We will not have any more until the morning."

143
0:07:06.704,000 --> 0:07:09,000
She said, "But if you go down the road about an hour, 45 minutes,

144
0:07:10.685,000 --> 0:07:12,000
there's another trailer park down there."

145
0:07:13.03,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I said, "Yeah, but you still have the 'Vacancies' light on, and it's flashing."

146
0:07:16.811,000 --> 0:07:17,000
She said, "Oh, I forgot."

147
0:07:18.287,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And she reached over and turned the light off.

148
0:07:20.663,000 --> 0:07:22,000
She looked at me and I looked at her.

149
0:07:22.904,000 --> 0:07:23,000
There were other people in the room.

150
0:07:24.662,000 --> 0:07:26,000
She kind of looked at them. No one said anything.

151
0:07:27.068,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So I just got the hint and I left, and went outside to the parking lot.

152
0:07:30.424,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I told my mother and I told my wife and also Melanie, and I said,

153
0:07:34.574,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"It looks like we're going to have to drive a little bit further down the road

154
0:07:38.37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to be able to sleep tonight."

155
0:07:40.726,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And we did drive down the road,

156
0:07:42.899,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but just before we took off and pulled out of the parking lot,

157
0:07:46.421,000 --> 0:07:47,000
guess what happened?

158
0:07:47.914,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The light came back on.

159
0:07:49.733,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And it said, "Vacancies, Vacancies, Vacancies."

160
0:07:52.593,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We were able to find a nice place.

161
0:07:54.979,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It wasn't our preference, but it was secure and it was clean.

162
0:07:59.715,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And so we had a great sleep that night.

163
0:08:02.537,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The piece that's important about that

164
0:08:04.356,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is that we had similar kinds of experiences

165
0:08:07.468,000 --> 0:08:1,000
from Idaho all the way through to Pennsylvania,

166
0:08:10.65,000 --> 0:08:14,000
where we were rejected from hotels, motels and restaurants.

167
0:08:14.951,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But we made it to Pennsylvania.

168
0:08:17.151,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We got the family settled. Everyone was glad to see the kids.

169
0:08:21.711,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I jumped on a plane and shot off to Goose Bay, Labrador,

170
0:08:26.286,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which is another story, right?

171
0:08:27.947,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:30.234,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Here it is, 53 years later,

173
0:08:34.657,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I now have nine grandchildren, two great-grandchildren.

174
0:08:39.086,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Five of the grandchildren are boys.

175
0:08:41.863,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I have master's, Ph.D., undergrad, one in medical school.

176
0:08:47.076,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I have a couple that are trending.

177
0:08:49.69,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They're almost there but not quite. (Laughter)

178
0:08:52.455,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I have one who has been in college now for eight years.

179
0:08:55.555,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:56.975,000 --> 0:08:59,000
He doesn't have a degree yet, but he wants to be a comedian.

181
0:09:00.346,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So we're just trying to get him to stay in school.

182
0:09:03.464,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Because you never know,

183
0:09:04.994,000 --> 0:09:07,000
just because you're funny at home, does not make you a comedian, right?

184
0:09:08.894,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:10.646,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But the thing about it, they're all good kids --

186
0:09:13.078,000 --> 0:09:17,000
no drugs, no babies in high school, no crime.

187
0:09:17.338,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So with that being the backdrop,

188
0:09:19.896,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I was sitting in my TV room watching TV,

189
0:09:22.117,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and they were talking about Ferguson and all the hullabaloo that was going on.

190
0:09:26.67,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And all of a sudden, one of the news commentators got on the air and she said,

191
0:09:32.141,000 --> 0:09:34,000
"In the last three months,

192
0:09:34.939,000 --> 0:09:37,000
eight unarmed African-American males

193
0:09:38.808,000 --> 0:09:45,000
have been killed by police, white homeowners, or white citizens."

194
0:09:46.777,000 --> 0:09:48,000
For some reason, at that moment it just all hit me.

195
0:09:49.495,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I said, "What is it? It is so insane.

196
0:09:53.487,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What is the hatred that's causing people to do these kinds of things?"

197
0:09:58.625,000 --> 0:10:,000
Just then, one of my grandsons called.

198
0:10:01.073,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He said, "Granddad, did you hear what they said on TV?"

199
0:10:04.312,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I said, "Yes, I did."

200
0:10:05.77,000 --> 0:10:06,000
He said, "I'm just so confused.

201
0:10:07.524,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We do everything we do, but it seems that driving while black,

202
0:10:12.094,000 --> 0:10:16,000
walking while black, talking while black, it's just dangerous.

203
0:10:16.494,000 --> 0:10:2,000
What can we do? We do everything that you told us to do.

204
0:10:21.373,000 --> 0:10:22,000
When stopped by the police,

205
0:10:23.163,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we place both hands on the steering wheel at the 12 o'clock position.

206
0:10:27.14,000 --> 0:10:29,000
If asked to get identification,

207
0:10:29.767,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we tell them, 'I am slowly reaching over into the glove compartment to get my I.D.'

208
0:10:35.675,000 --> 0:10:37,000
When pulled out of the car to be searched,

209
0:10:38.44,000 --> 0:10:4,000
when laid on the ground to be searched,

210
0:10:40.589,000 --> 0:10:42,000
when our trunks are opened to be searched,

211
0:10:42.731,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we don't push back, we don't challenge because we know, you've told us,

212
0:10:46.991,000 --> 0:10:48,000
'Don't you challenge the police.

213
0:10:49.03,000 --> 0:10:52,000
After it's over, call us and we'll be the ones to challenge."

214
0:10:52.638,000 --> 0:10:54,000
He said, "And this is the piece that really bugs me:

215
0:10:55.37,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Our white friends, our buddies, we kind of hang together.

216
0:10:58.988,000 --> 0:11:01,000
When they hear about these kinds of things happening to us, they say,

217
0:11:02.225,000 --> 0:11:04,000
'Why do you take it?

218
0:11:04.413,000 --> 0:11:06,000
You need to push back. You need to challenge.

219
0:11:07.392,000 --> 0:11:09,000
You need to ask them for their identification.'"

220
0:11:10.154,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And here's what the boys have been taught to tell them:

221
0:11:12.761,000 --> 0:11:15,000
"We know that you can do that, but please do not do that

222
0:11:15.987,000 --> 0:11:17,000
while we're in the car

223
0:11:18.026,000 --> 0:11:21,000
because the consequences for you are significantly different

224
0:11:21.813,000 --> 0:11:23,000
than the consequences for us."

225
0:11:23.862,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And so as a grandparent, what do I tell my grandsons?

226
0:11:27.36,000 --> 0:11:3,000
How do I keep them safe? How do I keep them alive?

227
0:11:30.706,000 --> 0:11:32,000
As a result of this, people have come to me and said,

228
0:11:33.227,000 --> 0:11:35,000
"Jim, are you angry?"

229
0:11:37.498,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And my response to that is this:

230
0:11:40.619,000 --> 0:11:45,000
"I don't have the luxury of being angry,

231
0:11:46.065,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and I also know the consequences of being enraged."

232
0:11:51.075,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So therefore, the only thing that I can do

233
0:11:53.168,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is take my collective intellect and my energy and my ideas and my experiences

234
0:11:59.456,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and dedicate myself to challenge, at any point in time,

235
0:12:03.445,000 --> 0:12:05,000
anything that looks like it might be racist.

236
0:12:06.326,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So the first thing I have to do is to educate,

237
0:12:09.059,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the second thing I have to do is to unveil racism,

238
0:12:12.327,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and the last thing I need to do is do everything within my power

239
0:12:15.727,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to eradicate racism in my lifetime by any means necessary.

240
0:12:22.864,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The second thing I do is this:

241
0:12:25.29,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I want to appeal to Americans.

242
0:12:28.976,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I want to appeal to their humanity, to their dignity,

243
0:12:33.42,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to their civic pride and ownership

244
0:12:37.887,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to be able to not react to these heinous crimes in an adverse manner.

245
0:12:45.952,000 --> 0:12:51,000
But instead, to elevate your level of societal knowledge,

246
0:12:52.061,000 --> 0:12:56,000
your level of societal awareness and societal consciousness

247
0:12:56.465,000 --> 0:13:,000
to then collectively come together, all of us come together,

248
0:13:00.484,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to make sure that we speak out against and we challenge any kind of insanity,

249
0:13:07.552,000 --> 0:13:14,000
any kind of insanity that makes it okay to kill unarmed people,

250
0:13:14.753,000 --> 0:13:16,000
regardless of their ethnicity,

251
0:13:17.335,000 --> 0:13:19,000
regardless of their race,

252
0:13:19.438,000 --> 0:13:21,000
regardless of their diversity makeup.

253
0:13:21.925,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We have to challenge that. It doesn't make any sense.

254
0:13:25.185,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The only way I think we can do that is through a collective.

255
0:13:29.014,000 --> 0:13:32,000
We need to have black and white and Asian and Hispanic

256
0:13:32.914,000 --> 0:13:33,000
just to step forward and say,

257
0:13:34.614,000 --> 0:14:01,000
"We are not going to accept that kind of behavior anymore."

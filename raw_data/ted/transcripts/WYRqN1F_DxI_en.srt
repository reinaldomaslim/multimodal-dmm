1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The north coast of California has rainforests --

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.

3
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.

4
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens.

5
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.

6
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.

7
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That's 38 stories tall.

8
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.

9
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are

10
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because nobody has ever drilled into any of them

11
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to count their annual growth rings, and, in any case,

12
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.

13
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon --

15
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees

16
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that are older than that.

17
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You can see the range of the Coast Redwoods. It's here, in red.

18
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The largest individuals of this species,

19
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California,

20
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
where the rain is really intense.

21
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest

22
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
was cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging,

23
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s.

24
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Even so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact,

25
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
wild and now protected -- entirely protected --

26
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls

27
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
along the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park.

28
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But curiously, Redwood rainforests, the fragments that we have left,

29
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to this day remain under-explored.

30
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through,

31
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and even today, individual trees are being discovered

32
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that have never been seen before, including, in the summer of 2006,

33
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.

34
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm going to do a little Gedanken experiment.

35
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism.

36
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And, Chris, if I could have you up here? I have a tape measure.

37
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's a kind loaner from TED.

38
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And Chris, if you could take the end of that tape measure?

39
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We're going to show you what the diameter

40
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
at breast height of a big Redwood is.

41
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Unfortunately, this tape isn't long enough -- it's only a 25-foot tape.

42
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Chris, could you extend your arm out that way? There we go. OK.

43
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood.

44
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, let your imagination go upward into space.

45
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Think about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet,

46
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms

47
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
upward into space over long periods of time.

48
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The Redwood species seems to exist in another kind of time:

49
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
not human time, but what we might call Redwood time.

50
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.

51
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still,

52
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion,

53
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
moving upward into space, articulating themselves

54
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.

55
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Plant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this:

56
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the Lost Monarch.

57
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast,

58
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and was discovered in 1998.

59
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And yet, when you look at the base of a Redwood tree,

60
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you're not seeing the organism.

61
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant,

62
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and most of the organism is overhead, unseen.

63
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I became very interested, and I wrote about a couple.

64
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers

65
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world-class athletes,

66
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.

67
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Steve Sillett, when he was a 19-year-old college student

68
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
at Reed College, had heard that the Redwood forest canopy

69
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
is considered to be a so-called Redwood desert.

70
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
That is to say, at that time it was believed

71
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.

72
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood

73
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there.

74
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood,

75
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands,

76
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze.

77
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And then, from there, he climbed directly up the bark

78
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
until he got to the top of the tree.

79
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
His friend, a guy named Marwood Harris, was following behind.

80
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Neither one of them had noticed that there was

81
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball

82
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.

83
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps

84
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go.

85
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
He would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.

86
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But they made it to the top, and what they found

87
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
was not a Redwood desert, but a lost world --

88
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life.

89
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now, I had been working on other topics:

90
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the emergence of infectious diseases,

91
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth,

92
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
make a trans-species jump, and get into humans.

93
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
After three books on this, it got to be a bit much, in a way.

94
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
My wife and I adore our children.

95
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them,

96
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
using the so-called arborist climbing technique,

97
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.

98
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees.

99
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
That's my son, Oliver.

100
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do.

101
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

102
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
If ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, then children

103
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest.

104
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of

105
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that are afraid of heights.

106
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
All other primates, when they're scared,

107
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
they run up a tree, where they feel safe.

108
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We camped overnight in the trees, in tree boats.

109
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat.

110
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
She's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall.

111
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong

112
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
coming in three dimensions around us.

113
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels,

114
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are

115
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because they've never seen them in the canopy before.

116
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking,

117
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
where you can move from tree to tree through space,

118
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
rather like Spiderman.

119
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It became a writing project.

120
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
When Steve Sillett gets up into a big Redwood, he fires an arrow,

121
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which trails a fishing line, which gets over a branch in the tree,

122
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.

123
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You ascend 30 stories.

124
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
There are two people climbing this tree, Gaya,

125
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are.

126
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
They are only one-seventh of the way up that tree.

127
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You do feel a sense of exposure.

128
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
There is a small person right down there on the ground.

129
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood.

130
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But then you enter the Redwood canopy,

131
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and it's like coming through a layer of clouds.

132
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground,

133
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and you also lose sight of the sky,

134
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air

135
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil,

136
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
which is populated with all kinds of small organisms.

137
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There are epiphytes, plants that grow on trees.

138
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
These are huckleberry bushes.

139
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Many species of mosses, and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree.

140
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
When you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall --

141
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in fact, it's difficult to move.

142
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You're worming your way through branches which are crowded

143
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
with living things that don't occur near the ground.

144
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's like scuba diving into a coral reef,

145
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
except you're going upward instead of downward.

146
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.

147
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Maria's sitting on one of them.

148
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
These limbs could be five to six hundred years old.

149
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops.

150
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
They also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes

151
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees

152
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that are technically known as huckleberry afros,

153
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting.

154
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Redwoods have an enormous surface area that extends upward into space

155
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.

156
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs,

157
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the limbs burst into small trees, copies of the Redwood.

158
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now, here we see a reiteration in Chronos, one of the older Redwoods.

159
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
This reiteration is a huge flying buttress

160
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that comes out the tree itself.

161
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
This buttress is less than halfway up the tree.

162
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.

163
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base

164
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and extends upward for 150 feet.

165
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River,

166
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos.

167
0:10:09.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This three-dimensional map of the crown structure of a Redwood named Iluvatar,

168
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
made by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.

169
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development

170
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal,

171
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks.

172
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.

173
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:44,000
There's the person, right there. The person is waving to us.

174
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert

175
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
a synthetic chromosome into a human

176
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.

177
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand

178
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
would be people who looked like us,

179
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and they would have people on their hands and so on.

180
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And if we had Redwood-like biology,

181
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were.

182
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone

183
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and have all our reiterations wave at the same time.

184
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Laughter)

185
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
To reiterate the point, let's go closer into Iluvatar.

186
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We're looking at that yellow box.

187
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And this hallucinatory drawing shows you --

188
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.

189
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
These are millennial structures -- portions of the tree

190
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.

191
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
There are four humans in this shot -- one, two, three, four.

192
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And there's also something that I want to show you.

193
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is a flying buttress.

194
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space,

195
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk,

196
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
going back into the main trunk and fusing with it.

197
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Flying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree

198
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and help the tree exist longer through time.

199
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees.

200
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
They've wired them like patients in an ICU.

201
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They're finding out that Redwoods can move moisture out of the air

202
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and down into their trunks,

203
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
possibly all the way into their root systems.

204
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.

205
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting,

206
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the Redwood will send roots into its own form

207
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.

208
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
If we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm

209
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
then we could just, you know,

210
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.

211
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep,

212
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
hundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil

213
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that have, as yet, no names.

214
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
This is an unnamed species of copepod. A copepod is a crustacean.

215
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans,

216
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales.

217
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil

218
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
hundreds of feet above the ocean, or how they got there,

219
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is completely unknown.

220
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
There are some interesting theories

221
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that, if I had time, I would tell you about.

222
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But as you go and you look closer at a tree,

223
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
what you see is, you see increasing complexity.

224
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We're looking at the very top of Gaya, which is thought to be the oldest Redwood.

225
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old,

226
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
no one really knows, but its top has broken off

227
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and it's been rotting back now.

228
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This little Japanese garden-like creation probably took 700 years

229
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to form in its complexity that we see right now.

230
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
As you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.

231
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I have to show you something unfortunately very sad

232
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
at the conclusion of this talk.

233
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East.

234
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And we're moving in a full circle now.

235
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
In the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia,

236
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
called the Hemlock woolly adelgid.

237
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia,

238
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia.

239
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree,

240
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it.

241
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways

242
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River.

243
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I hadn't even known that there were rainforests in the east,

244
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park

245
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.

246
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
And in the last two to three summers, these invasive organisms,

247
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
this kind of Ebola of the trees, as it were,

248
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east,

249
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer.

250
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park,

251
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see.

252
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And what we're seeing is not just the potential death

253
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
of the Eastern Hemlock species --

254
0:15:25.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite --

255
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem

256
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
for which these trees are merely the substrate

257
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns.

258
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
It's absolutely heartbreaking to see.

259
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it --

260
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all,

261
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.

262
0:16:02.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves?

263
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Well, I think they can tell us something about human time.

264
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
The flickering, transitory quality of human time

265
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love.

266
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us

267
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
something about ourselves in the differences that we have.

268
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We are human, and we have the capacity to love,

269
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of

270
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness

271
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that so suits us as primates, I think.

272
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And at least for me, personally, the trees have taught me

273
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
an entirely new way of loving my children.

274
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Exploring with them the forest canopy

275
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.

276
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that

277
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
with my children I've been able to introduce them

278
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough,

279
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
or possibly stupid enough, to still climb trees.

280
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Thank you very much.

281
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

282
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Chris Anderson: I think at a previous TED,

283
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that

284
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older,

285
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species

286
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
that are not found anywhere on the Earth

287
0:17:35.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
except on that one tree. Is that correct?

288
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Richard Preston: Yes, that is correct. I mentioned Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.

289
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.

290
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted

291
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
an unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk.

292
0:17:58.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees, curiously enough,

293
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and we wondered whether this ant, this species of ant,

294
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
was only endemic to that one tree, or possibly to that grove.

295
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again,

296
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and so no specimens have ever been collected.

297
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
We don't know what it is -- we just know it's there.

298
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
CA: So, you have to wonder when, you know,

299
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:25,000
if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth,

300
0:18:25.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
you know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.

301
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening,

302
0:18:35.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.

It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me,

304
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is.

305
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
RP: It is fragile, and you know, I think about emerging human diseases --

306
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:5,000
parasites that move into the human species.

307
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
But that's just a very small facet

308
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide,

309
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
all through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself --

310
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
CA: Partly caused by us, inadvertently.

311
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
RP: Caused by humans. Caused by the movement of humans.

312
0:19:05.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace,

313
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
and the continents are rooms in the palace,

314
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:15,000
and the islands are small rooms.

315
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
But lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open,

316
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and the walls are coming down.

317
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
CA: Richard Preston, thank you very much, I think.

318
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:26,000
RP: Thank you.

1
0:00:12.515,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The universe is teeming with planets.

2
0:00:16.118,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want us, in the next decade,

3
0:00:17.994,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to build a space telescope that'll be able to image

4
0:00:20.387,000 --> 0:00:22,000
an Earth about another star

5
0:00:22.488,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and figure out whether it can harbor life.

6
0:00:25.232,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My colleagues at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

7
0:00:27.392,000 --> 0:00:29,000
at Princeton and I are working on technology

8
0:00:30.253,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that will be able to do just that in the coming years.

9
0:00:33.791,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Astronomers now believe that every star

10
0:00:35.776,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the galaxy has a planet,

11
0:00:37.716,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and they speculate that up to one fifth of them

12
0:00:39.992,000 --> 0:00:4,000
have an Earth-like planet

13
0:00:41.068,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that might be able to harbor life,

14
0:00:42.76,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but we haven't seen any of them.

15
0:00:44.522,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We've only detected them indirectly.

16
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This is NASA's famous picture of the pale blue dot.

17
0:00:50.493,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It was taken by the Voyager spacecraft in 1990,

18
0:00:53.29,000 --> 0:00:55,000
when they turned it around as it was exiting the solar system

19
0:00:56.048,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to take a picture of the Earth

20
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:00:59,000
from six billion kilometers away.

21
0:01:00.082,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I want to take that

22
0:01:01.65,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of an Earth-like planet about another star.

23
0:01:04.232,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Why haven't we done that? Why is that hard?

24
0:01:06.632,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Well to see, let's imagine we take

25
0:01:08.054,000 --> 0:01:09,000
the Hubble Space Telescope

26
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and we turn it around and we move it out

27
0:01:11.698,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to the orbit of Mars.

28
0:01:13.232,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We'll see something like that,

29
0:01:14.44,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a slightly blurry picture of the Earth,

30
0:01:16.508,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because we're a fairly small telescope

31
0:01:18.829,000 --> 0:01:19,000
out at the orbit of Mars.

32
0:01:20.368,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now let's move ten times further away.

33
0:01:22.384,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Here we are at the orbit of Uranus.

34
0:01:24.32,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's gotten smaller, it's got less detail, less resolve.

35
0:01:26.806,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We can still see the little moon,

36
0:01:28.591,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but let's go ten times further away again.

37
0:01:30.704,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Here we are at the edge of the solar system,

38
0:01:32.435,000 --> 0:01:33,000
out at the Kuiper Belt.

39
0:01:33.733,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now it's not resolved at all.

40
0:01:35.439,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's that pale blue dot of Carl Sagan's.

41
0:01:38.103,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But let's move yet again ten times further away.

42
0:01:40.303,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Here we are out at the Oort Cloud,

43
0:01:41.927,000 --> 0:01:42,000
outside the solar system,

44
0:01:43.487,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and we're starting to see the sun

45
0:01:45.103,000 --> 0:01:46,000
move into the field of view

46
0:01:46.415,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and get into where the planet is.

47
0:01:47.879,000 --> 0:01:49,000
One more time, ten times further away.

48
0:01:50.01,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now we're at Alpha Centauri,

49
0:01:51.663,000 --> 0:01:52,000
our nearest neighbor star,

50
0:01:52.903,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and the planet is gone.

51
0:01:54.252,000 --> 0:01:56,000
All we're seeing is the big beaming image of the star

52
0:01:56.86,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that's ten billion times brighter than the planet,

53
0:01:59.817,000 --> 0:02:,000
which should be in that little red circle.

54
0:02:01.623,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's what we want to see. That's why it's hard.

55
0:02:03.823,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The light from the star is diffracting.

56
0:02:06.143,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's scattering inside the telescope,

57
0:02:07.884,000 --> 0:02:08,000
creating that very bright image

58
0:02:09.388,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that washes out the planet.

59
0:02:11.14,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So to see the planet,

60
0:02:12.411,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we have to do something about all of that light.

61
0:02:14.671,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We have to get rid of it.

62
0:02:15.902,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I have a lot of colleagues working on

63
0:02:17.347,000 --> 0:02:19,000
really amazing technologies to do that,

64
0:02:19.362,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but I want to tell you about one today

65
0:02:21.177,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that I think is the coolest,

66
0:02:22.674,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and probably the most likely to get us an Earth

67
0:02:24.874,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in the next decade.

68
0:02:26.41,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It was first suggested by Lyman Spitzer,

69
0:02:28.482,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the father of the space telescope, in 1962,

70
0:02:31.642,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and he took his inspiration from an eclipse.

71
0:02:33.758,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You've all seen that. That's a solar eclipse.

72
0:02:35.941,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The moon has moved in front of the sun.

73
0:02:37.981,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It blocks out most of the light

74
0:02:39.741,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so we can see that dim corona around it.

75
0:02:42.117,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It would be the same thing if I put my thumb up

76
0:02:43.78,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and blocked that spotlight that's getting right in my eye,

77
0:02:46.365,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I can see you in the back row.

78
0:02:48.277,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Well, what's going on?

79
0:02:49.579,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Well the moon

80
0:02:51.524,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is casting a shadow down on the Earth.

81
0:02:53.939,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We put a telescope or a camera in that shadow,

82
0:02:57.174,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we look back at the sun,

83
0:02:58.685,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and most of the light's been removed

84
0:03:00.325,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and we can see that dim, fine structure

85
0:03:02.415,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in the corona.

86
0:03:03.69,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Spitzer's suggestion was we do this in space.

87
0:03:06.357,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We build a big screen, we fly it in space,

88
0:03:09.134,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we put it up in front of the star,

89
0:03:11.181,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we block out most of the light,

90
0:03:12.965,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we fly a space telescope in that shadow that's created,

91
0:03:15.981,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and boom, we get to see planets.

92
0:03:17.758,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Well that would look something like this.

93
0:03:20.421,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So there's that big screen,

94
0:03:22.01,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and there's no planets,

95
0:03:22.885,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because unfortunately it doesn't actually work very well,

96
0:03:25.389,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because the light waves of the light and waves

97
0:03:28.309,000 --> 0:03:29,000
diffracts around that screen

98
0:03:29.989,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the same way it did in the telescope.

99
0:03:31.773,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's like water bending around a rock in a stream,

100
0:03:34.91,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and all that light just destroys the shadow.

101
0:03:36.7,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's a terrible shadow. And we can't see planets.

102
0:03:39.373,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But Spitzer actually knew the answer.

103
0:03:41.14,000 --> 0:03:43,000
If we can feather the edges, soften those edges

104
0:03:43.645,000 --> 0:03:44,000
so we can control diffraction,

105
0:03:45.411,000 --> 0:03:46,000
well then we can see a planet,

106
0:03:47.126,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and in the last 10 years or so we've come up

107
0:03:48.925,000 --> 0:03:5,000
with optimal solutions for doing that.

108
0:03:50.969,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It looks something like that.

109
0:03:54.501,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We call that our flower petal starshade.

110
0:03:56.846,000 --> 0:03:58,000
If we make the edges of those petals exactly right,

111
0:03:59.806,000 --> 0:04:,000
if we control their shape,

112
0:04:01.23,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we can control diffraction,

113
0:04:02.788,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and now we have a great shadow.

114
0:04:04.234,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's about 10 billion times dimmer than it was before,

115
0:04:06.878,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and we can see the planets beam out just like that.

116
0:04:10.324,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That, of course, has to be bigger than my thumb.

117
0:04:12.182,000 --> 0:04:13,000
That starshade is about

118
0:04:13.64,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the size of half a football field

119
0:04:15.216,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and it has to fly 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope

120
0:04:18.806,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that has to be held right in its shadow,

121
0:04:20.866,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and then we can see those planets.

122
0:04:22.83,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This sounds formidable,

123
0:04:24.238,000 --> 0:04:27,000
but brilliant engineers, colleagues of mine at JPL,

124
0:04:27.246,000 --> 0:04:29,000
came up with a fabulous design for how to do that

125
0:04:30.126,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and it looks like this.

126
0:04:31.2,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It starts wrapped around a hub.

127
0:04:32.988,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It separates from the telescope.

128
0:04:34.967,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The petals unfurl, they open up,

129
0:04:37.238,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the telescope turns around.

130
0:04:38.998,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Then you'll see it flip and fly out

131
0:04:41.142,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that 50,000 kilometers away from the telescope.

132
0:04:44.357,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's going to move in front of the star

133
0:04:46.827,000 --> 0:04:49,000
just like that, creates a wonderful shadow.

134
0:04:50.11,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Boom, we get planets orbiting about it.

135
0:04:53.914,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause)

136
0:04:55.638,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Thank you.

137
0:04:57.997,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's not science fiction.

138
0:04:59.95,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We've been working on this for the last five or six years.

139
0:05:02.513,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Last summer, we did a really cool test

140
0:05:05.116,000 --> 0:05:07,000
out in California at Northrop Grumman.

141
0:05:07.555,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So those are four petals.

142
0:05:09.138,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is a sub-scale star shade.

143
0:05:10.85,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's about half the size of the one you just saw.

144
0:05:13.347,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You'll see the petals unfurl.

145
0:05:14.807,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Those four petals were built by four undergraduates

146
0:05:16.874,000 --> 0:05:18,000
doing a summer internship at JPL.

147
0:05:19.289,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Now you're seeing it deploy.

148
0:05:20.535,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Those petals have to rotate into place.

149
0:05:22.517,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The base of those petals

150
0:05:23.687,000 --> 0:05:25,000
has to go to the same place every time

151
0:05:26.06,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to within a tenth of a millimeter.

152
0:05:27.683,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We ran this test 16 times,

153
0:05:29.443,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and 16 times it went into the exact same place

154
0:05:32.282,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to a tenth of a millimeter.

155
0:05:33.723,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This has to be done very precisely,

156
0:05:35.655,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but if we can do this, if we can build this technology,

157
0:05:38.163,000 --> 0:05:39,000
if we can get it into space,

158
0:05:39.647,000 --> 0:05:4,000
you might see something like this.

159
0:05:41.448,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That's a picture of one our nearest neighbor stars

160
0:05:43.72,000 --> 0:05:45,000
taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.

161
0:05:46.314,000 --> 0:05:48,000
If we can take a similar space telescope,

162
0:05:48.698,000 --> 0:05:49,000
slightly larger,

163
0:05:49.956,000 --> 0:05:5,000
put it out there,

164
0:05:51.378,000 --> 0:05:52,000
fly an occulter in front of it,

165
0:05:52.764,000 --> 0:05:54,000
what we might see is something like that --

166
0:05:54.954,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that's a family portrait of our solar system -- but not ours.

167
0:05:57.89,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We're hoping it'll be someone else's solar system

168
0:06:00.412,000 --> 0:06:01,000
as seen through an occulter,

169
0:06:02.044,000 --> 0:06:03,000
through a starshade like that.

170
0:06:03.114,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You can see Jupiter, you can see Saturn,

171
0:06:05.139,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Uranus, Neptune, and right there in the center,

172
0:06:07.762,000 --> 0:06:08,000
next to the residual light

173
0:06:09.102,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is that pale blue dot. That's Earth.

174
0:06:11.007,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We want to see that, see if there's water,

175
0:06:13.381,000 --> 0:06:14,000
oxygen, ozone,

176
0:06:14.786,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the things that might tell us that it could harbor life.

177
0:06:17.309,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I think this is the coolest possible science.

178
0:06:19.718,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That's why I got into doing this,

179
0:06:21.371,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because I think that will change the world.

180
0:06:23.341,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That will change everything when we see that.

181
0:06:25.779,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Thank you.

182
0:06:27.365,000 --> 0:06:31,000

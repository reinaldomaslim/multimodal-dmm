1
0:00:12.785,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So on my way here,

2
0:00:15.84,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the passenger next to me and I had a very interesting conversation

3
0:00:19.542,000 --> 0:00:21,000
during my flight.

4
0:00:21.585,000 --> 0:00:25,000
He told me, "It seems like the United States has run out of jobs,

5
0:00:26.113,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because they're just making some up:

6
0:00:28.481,000 --> 0:00:34,000
cat psychologist, dog whisperer, tornado chaser."

7
0:00:34.743,000 --> 0:00:36,000
A couple of seconds later, he asked me,

8
0:00:37.56,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"So what do you do?"

9
0:00:39.812,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I was like, "Peacebuilder?"

10
0:00:42.505,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:46.925,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Every day, I work to amplify the voices of women

12
0:00:51.352,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and to highlight their experiences

13
0:00:54.45,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and their participation in peace processes and conflict resolution,

14
0:00:59.509,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and because of my work,

15
0:01:02.288,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I recognize that the only way to ensure the full participation of women globally

16
0:01:08.464,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is by reclaiming religion.

17
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now, this matter is vitally important to me.

18
0:01:15.394,000 --> 0:01:19,000
As a young Muslim woman, I am very proud of my faith.

19
0:01:19.805,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It gives me the strength and conviction to do my work every day.

20
0:01:24.54,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's the reason I can be here in front of you.

21
0:01:27.909,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But I can't overlook the damage that has been done in the name of religion,

22
0:01:33.133,000 --> 0:01:37,000
not just my own, but all of the world's major faiths.

23
0:01:37.661,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The misrepresentation and misuse and manipulation of religious scripture

24
0:01:42.165,000 --> 0:01:45,000
has influenced our social and cultural norms,

25
0:01:45.694,000 --> 0:01:47,000
our laws, our daily lives,

26
0:01:48.62,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to a point where we sometimes don't recognize it.

27
0:01:52.804,000 --> 0:01:56,000
My parents moved from Libya, North Africa, to Canada

28
0:01:57.49,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in the early 1980s,

29
0:01:59.254,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I am the middle child of 11 children.

30
0:02:03.1,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Yes, 11.

31
0:02:05.431,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But growing up, I saw my parents,

32
0:02:07.589,000 --> 0:02:1,000
both religiously devout and spiritual people,

33
0:02:11.165,000 --> 0:02:13,000
pray and praise God for their blessings,

34
0:02:13.905,000 --> 0:02:17,000
namely me of course, but among others. (Laughter)

35
0:02:18.664,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They were kind and funny and patient,

36
0:02:21.822,000 --> 0:02:27,000
limitlessly patient, the kind of patience that having 11 kids forces you to have.

37
0:02:28.161,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And they were fair.

38
0:02:30.181,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I was never subjected to religion through a cultural lens.

39
0:02:34.895,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I was treated the same,

40
0:02:36.961,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the same was expected of me.

41
0:02:39.74,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I was never taught that God judged differently based on gender.

42
0:02:44.647,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And my parents' understanding of God as a merciful and beneficial friend

43
0:02:50.289,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and provider shaped the way I looked at the world.

44
0:02:54.143,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now, of course, my upbringing had additional benefits.

45
0:02:58.97,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Being one of 11 children is Diplomacy 101. (Laughter)

46
0:03:04.592,000 --> 0:03:06,000
To this day, I am asked where I went to school,

47
0:03:07.169,000 --> 0:03:09,000
like, "Did you go to Kennedy School of Government?"

48
0:03:09.652,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I look at them and I'm like, "No,

49
0:03:11.558,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I went to the Murabit School of International Affairs."

50
0:03:14.367,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It's extremely exclusive. You would have to talk to my mom to get in.

51
0:03:20.195,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Lucky for you, she's here.

52
0:03:23.879,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But being one of 11 children and having 10 siblings

53
0:03:28.368,000 --> 0:03:32,000
teaches you a lot about power structures and alliances.

54
0:03:32.6,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It teaches you focus; you have to talk fast or say less,

55
0:03:35.403,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because you will always get cut off.

56
0:03:37.911,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It teaches you the importance of messaging.

57
0:03:40.767,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You have to ask questions in the right way to get the answers you know you want,

58
0:03:44.993,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and you have to say no in the right way to keep the peace.

59
0:03:49.172,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But the most important lesson I learned growing up

60
0:03:53.444,000 --> 0:03:56,000
was the importance of being at the table.

61
0:03:56.974,000 --> 0:03:59,000
When my mom's favorite lamp broke, I had to be there when she was trying

62
0:04:00.805,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to find out how and by who, because I had to defend myself,

63
0:04:05.334,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because if you're not, then the finger is pointed at you,

64
0:04:09.117,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and before you know it, you will be grounded.

65
0:04:11.741,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I am not speaking from experience, of course.

66
0:04:16.338,000 --> 0:04:21,000
When I was 15 in 2005, I completed high school and I moved

67
0:04:21.75,000 --> 0:04:23,000
from Canada -- Saskatoon --

68
0:04:24.24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to Zawiya, my parents' hometown in Libya,

69
0:04:28.319,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a very traditional city.

70
0:04:30.711,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Mind you, I had only ever been to Libya before on vacation,

71
0:04:35.53,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and as a seven-year-old girl, it was magic.

72
0:04:39.906,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It was ice cream and trips to the beach and really excited relatives.

73
0:04:45.468,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Turns out it's not the same as a 15-year-old young lady.

74
0:04:50.47,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I very quickly became introduced to the cultural aspect of religion.

75
0:04:56.438,000 --> 0:05:,000
The words "haram" -- meaning religiously prohibited --

76
0:05:00.896,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and "aib" -- meaning culturally inappropriate --

77
0:05:04.402,000 --> 0:05:06,000
were exchanged carelessly,

78
0:05:07.118,000 --> 0:05:11,000
as if they meant the same thing and had the same consequences.

79
0:05:11.437,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I found myself in conversation after conversation with classmates

80
0:05:16.174,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and colleagues, professors, friends, even relatives,

81
0:05:19.61,000 --> 0:05:23,000
beginning to question my own role and my own aspirations.

82
0:05:24.393,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And even with the foundation my parents had provided for me,

83
0:05:27.923,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I found myself questioning the role of women in my faith.

84
0:05:32.218,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So at the Murabit School of International Affairs,

85
0:05:36.397,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we go very heavy on the debate,

86
0:05:39.137,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and rule number one is do your research, so that's what I did,

87
0:05:44.64,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and it surprised me how easy it was

88
0:05:48.425,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to find women in my faith who were leaders,

89
0:05:52.442,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who were innovative, who were strong --

90
0:05:55.994,000 --> 0:05:58,000
politically, economically, even militarily.

91
0:05:59.36,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Khadija financed the Islamic movement

92
0:06:02.751,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in its infancy.

93
0:06:04.562,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We wouldn't be here if it weren't for her.

94
0:06:07.627,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So why weren't we learning about her?

95
0:06:10.274,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Why weren't we learning about these women?

96
0:06:13.195,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Why were women being relegated to positions which predated

97
0:06:15.986,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the teachings of our faith?

98
0:06:18.656,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And why, if we are equal in the eyes of God,

99
0:06:20.931,000 --> 0:06:23,000
are we not equal in the eyes of men?

100
0:06:24.623,000 --> 0:06:29,000
To me, it all came back to the lessons I had learned as a child.

101
0:06:30.35,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The decision maker, the person who gets to control the message,

102
0:06:34.022,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is sitting at the table,

103
0:06:36.604,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and unfortunately, in every single world faith,

104
0:06:41.504,000 --> 0:06:43,000
they are not women.

105
0:06:44.15,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Religious institutions are dominated by men

106
0:06:47.192,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and driven by male leadership,

107
0:06:49.143,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and they create policies in their likeness,

108
0:06:52.579,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and until we can change the system entirely,

109
0:06:56.672,000 --> 0:06:59,000
then we can't realistically expect to have full economic

110
0:06:59.939,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and political participation of women.

111
0:07:03.515,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Our foundation is broken.

112
0:07:07.786,000 --> 0:07:11,000
My mom actually says, you can't build a straight house on a crooked foundation.

113
0:07:14.521,000 --> 0:07:2,000
In 2011, the Libyan revolution broke out, and my family was on the front lines.

114
0:07:21.58,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And there's this amazing thing that happens in war,

115
0:07:24.644,000 --> 0:07:27,000
a cultural shift almost, very temporary.

116
0:07:27.773,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And it was the first time that I felt it was not only acceptable

117
0:07:30.844,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for me to be involved, but it was encouraged.

118
0:07:33.816,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It was demanded.

119
0:07:36.161,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Myself and other women had a seat at the table.

120
0:07:39.17,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We weren't holding hands or a medium.

121
0:07:42.569,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We were part of decision making.

122
0:07:44.427,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We were information sharing. We were crucial.

123
0:07:47.84,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And I wanted and needed for that change to be permanent.

124
0:07:54.342,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Turns out, that's not that easy.

125
0:07:57.128,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It only took a few weeks before the women that I had previously worked with

126
0:08:01.5,000 --> 0:08:03,000
were returning back to their previous roles,

127
0:08:04.47,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and most of them were driven by words of encouragement

128
0:08:07.275,000 --> 0:08:09,000
from religious and political leaders,

129
0:08:10.177,000 --> 0:08:13,000
most of whom cited religious scripture as their defense.

130
0:08:14.449,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's how they gained popular support for their opinions.

131
0:08:19.08,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So initially, I focused on the economic and political empowerment of women.

132
0:08:24.317,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I thought that would lead to cultural and social change.

133
0:08:27.823,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It turns out, it does a little, but not a lot.

134
0:08:32.165,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I decided to use their defense as my offense,

135
0:08:36.53,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and I began to cite and highlight Islamic scripture as well.

136
0:08:41.174,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In 2012 and 2013, my organization led the single largest

137
0:08:45.736,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and most widespread campaign in Libya.

138
0:08:48.221,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We entered homes and schools and universities, even mosques.

139
0:08:52.997,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We spoke to 50,000 people directly,

140
0:08:55.279,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and hundreds of thousands more through billboards and television commercials,

141
0:08:59.343,000 --> 0:09:01,000
radio commercials and posters.

142
0:09:02.13,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And you're probably wondering how a women's rights organization

143
0:09:05.194,000 --> 0:09:07,000
was able to do this in communities which had previously opposed

144
0:09:08.166,000 --> 0:09:1,000
our sheer existence.

145
0:09:11.701,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I used scripture.

146
0:09:14.17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I used verses from the Quran and sayings of the Prophet,

147
0:09:19.56,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Hadiths, his sayings which are, for example,

148
0:09:23.525,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"The best of you is the best to their family."

149
0:09:26.961,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"Do not let your brother oppress another."

150
0:09:30.978,000 --> 0:09:35,000
For the first time, Friday sermons led by local community imams

151
0:09:35.993,000 --> 0:09:37,000
promoted the rights of women.

152
0:09:38.478,000 --> 0:09:41,000
They discussed taboo issues, like domestic violence.

153
0:09:42.656,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Policies were changed.

154
0:09:46.08,000 --> 0:09:49,000
In certain communities, we actually had to go as far

155
0:09:49.205,000 --> 0:09:52,000
as saying the International Human Rights Declaration,

156
0:09:53.106,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which you opposed because it wasn't written by religious scholars,

157
0:09:57.192,000 --> 0:10:01,000
well, those same principles are in our book.

158
0:10:01.975,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So really, the United Nations just copied us.

159
0:10:07.931,000 --> 0:10:09,000
By changing the message, we were able to provide

160
0:10:10.774,000 --> 0:10:14,000
an alternative narrative which promoted the rights of women in Libya.

161
0:10:15.349,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's something that has now been replicated internationally,

162
0:10:20.201,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and while I am not saying it's easy -- believe me, it's not.

163
0:10:24.59,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Liberals will say you're using religion and call you a bad conservative.

164
0:10:28.421,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Conservatives will call you a lot of colorful things.

165
0:10:31.904,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I've heard everything from, "Your parents must be extremely ashamed of you" --

166
0:10:35.99,000 --> 0:10:37,000
false; they're my biggest fans --

167
0:10:38.1,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to "You will not make it to your next birthday" --

168
0:10:40.611,000 --> 0:10:43,000
again wrong, because I did.

169
0:10:44.674,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And I remain

170
0:10:46.81,000 --> 0:10:52,000
a very strong believer that women's rights and religion are not mutually exclusive.

171
0:10:54.291,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But we have to be at the table.

172
0:10:57.723,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We have to stop giving up our position, because by remaining silent,

173
0:11:01.856,000 --> 0:11:06,000
we allow for the continued persecution and abuse of women worldwide.

174
0:11:07.837,000 --> 0:11:1,000
By saying that we're going to fight for women's rights

175
0:11:10.842,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and fight extremism with bombs and warfare,

176
0:11:14.627,000 --> 0:11:18,000
we completely cripple local societies which need to address these issues

177
0:11:18.876,000 --> 0:11:2,000
so that they're sustainable.

178
0:11:23.496,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It is not easy, challenging distorted religious messaging.

179
0:11:28.93,000 --> 0:11:32,000
You will have your fair share of insults and ridicule and threats.

180
0:11:34.38,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But we have to do it.

181
0:11:36.216,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We have no other option than to reclaim the message of human rights,

182
0:11:40.957,000 --> 0:11:42,000
the principles of our faith,

183
0:11:43.604,000 --> 0:11:45,000
not for us, not for the women in your families,

184
0:11:46.367,000 --> 0:11:47,000
not for the women in this room,

185
0:11:48.317,000 --> 0:11:51,000
not even for the women out there,

186
0:11:51.491,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but for societies that would be transformed

187
0:11:54.997,000 --> 0:11:56,000
with the participation of women.

188
0:11:57.884,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And the only way we can do that,

189
0:12:00.391,000 --> 0:12:01,000
our only option,

190
0:12:02.179,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is to be, and remain, at the table.

191
0:12:05.709,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Thank you.

192
0:12:08.332,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Applause)

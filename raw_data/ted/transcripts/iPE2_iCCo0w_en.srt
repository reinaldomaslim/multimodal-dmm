1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.

2
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
You can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy --

3
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and not without reason.

4
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I had a very charming routine at the time,

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which was to wait until late in the evening

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
doing their crossword puzzles, watching television.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
rip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
scream at the top of my lungs and run out

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
because I was the Incredible Hulk.

12
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Obviously, you see the resemblance.

14
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And this routine went on for some time.

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
When I was seven I went to summer camp.

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.

17
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And at noon each day

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the campers would go to a pond,

19
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
where they had floating docks.

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
You could jump off the end into the deep end.

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I was born premature. I was always very small.

22
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
My left lung had collapsed when I was born.

23
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I've always had buoyancy problems.

24
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So water was something that scared me to begin with.

25
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But I would go in on occasion.

26
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And on one particular day,

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the campers were jumping through inner tubes,

28
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.

29
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So I dove through the inner tube,

30
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.

31
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I tried to come up for air,

32
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.

33
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.

34
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.

35
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming.

36
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That is something that I did not get over.

37
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
My inability to swim has been

38
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.

39
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk.

40
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But there is a happy ending to this story.

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
At age 31 -- that's my age now --

42
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,

43
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.

44
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And went from swimming one lap --

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey,

46
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
at about 200 beats per minute heart rate --

47
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I measured it --

48
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to going to Montauk on Long Island,

49
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
close to where I grew up,

50
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,

51
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
getting out and feeling better than when I went in.

52
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And I came out,

53
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in my Speedos, European style,

54
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
feeling like the Incredible Hulk.

55
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And that's what I want everyone in here to feel like,

56
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.

57
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable

58
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,

59
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
a world-class language learner,

60
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and a tango champion.

61
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And I would like to share my art.

62
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things

63
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that really scare the living hell out of me.

64
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So, moving onward.

65
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Swimming, first principles.

66
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
First principles, this is very important.

67
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I find that the best results in life

68
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.

69
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And the turnaround in swimming came

70
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --

71
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy --

72
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."

73
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So the clock started ticking.

74
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I started seeking out triathletes

75
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.

76
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I tried kickboards.

77
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
My feet would slice through the water like razors,

78
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.

79
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Hand paddles, everything.

80
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.

81
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,

82
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,

83
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
said, "I have the answer to your prayers."

84
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And he introduced me to

85
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the work of a man named Terry Laughlin

86
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.

87
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.

88
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So here are the new rules of swimming,

89
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.

90
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.

91
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.

92
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem

93
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent

94
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of their energy expenditure into forward motion.

95
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The problem is hydrodynamics.

96
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So what you want to focus on instead

97
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,

98
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.

99
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.

100
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The only way you can do that

101
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is to not swim on top of the water.

102
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,

103
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
at least, submerged naturally.

104
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So you end up, number three,

105
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
not swimming, in the case of freestyle,

106
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.

107
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But actually rotating from streamlined right

108
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to streamlined left,

109
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.

110
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.

111
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And you can see that he's extending his right arm

112
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
below his head and far in front.

113
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And so his entire body really is underwater.

114
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The arm is extended below the head.

115
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The head is held in line with the spine,

116
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --

117
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
very important, especially for people with lower body fat.

118
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Here is an example of the stroke.

119
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.

120
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
You can see this is the left extension.

121
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Then you see his left leg.

122
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Small flick, and the only purpose of that

123
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.

124
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this,

125
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
he's not reaching in front and catching the water.

126
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Rather, he is entering the water

127
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
at a 45-degree angle with his forearm,

128
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.

129
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Incorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.

130
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Not their fault, honestly.

131
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.

132
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Below is what most swimmers

133
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
will find enables them to do what I did,

134
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length

135
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to 11 strokes

136
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.

137
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.

138
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.

139
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Last thing, breathing. A problem a lot of us have, certainly, when you're swimming.

140
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is

141
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to turn with body roll,

142
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.

143
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And that will get you very far.

144
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
That's it. That's really all you need to know.

145
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Languages. Material versus method.

146
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I, like many people, came to the conclusion

147
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that I was terrible at languages.

148
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,

149
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the sum total of my knowledge

150
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"

151
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.

152
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and

153
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.

154
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.

155
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.

156
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.

157
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.

158
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.

159
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.

160
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I arrived in Tokyo. Amazing.

161
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.

162
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I met my host family. Things went quite well I think,

163
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
all things considered.

164
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
My first evening, before my first day of school,

165
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I said to my mother, very politely,

166
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
"Please wake me up at eight a.m."

167
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So, (Japanese)

168
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.

169
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."

170
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.

172
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

173
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I walked in to school.

174
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.

175
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been --

176
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
because it was Kanji,

177
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.

178
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Asked him what this said.

179
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,

180
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,

181
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Traditional Japanese." And so on.

182
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And so it came to me in waves.

183
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
There had been something lost in translation.

184
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.

185
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students --

186
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.

187
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And that's pretty much my response.

188
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And that set me on this panic driven search for the perfect language method.

190
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.

191
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I tried every possible book, every possible CD.

192
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Nothing worked until I found this.

193
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,

194
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
or a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters

195
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
as determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.

196
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,

197
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to facilitate literacy -- some are required to.

198
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.

199
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
As soon as I focused on this material,

200
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I took off.

201
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,

202
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later --

203
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.

204
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,

205
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and have continued to apply this material

206
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
over method approach to close to a dozen languages now.

207
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Someone who was terrible at languages,

208
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.

209
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This brings us to the point,

210
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which is, it's oftentimes what you do,

211
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
not how you do it, that is the determining factor.

212
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things --

213
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important.

214
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You can also do this with grammar.

215
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.

216
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,

217
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
by translating these sentences into past, present, future,

218
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
will show you subject, object, verb,

219
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.

220
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
From that point, you can then, if you want to,

221
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.

222
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We can talk about that if anyone in interested.

223
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And now I love languages.

224
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So ballroom dancing, implicit versus explicit --

225
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
very important.

226
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."

227
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But no, you'd be wrong

228
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because my body is very poorly designed for most things --

229
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.

230
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.

231
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And so I ended up walking like this.

232
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.

233
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Not very good for ballroom dancing.

234
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I found myself in Argentina in 2005,

235
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating.

236
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Went in, paid my ten pesos,

237
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.

238
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The instructor says, "You are participating."

239
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Immediately: death sweat.

240
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

241
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Fight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college --

242
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.

243
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,

244
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that it exploded in my face,

245
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
never to return to the ballroom dancing club.

246
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
She comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.

247
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
"Okay, come on, grab me."

248
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Gorgeous assistant instructor.

249
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.

250
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.

251
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And she pulled back, threw down her arms,

252
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
put them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,

253
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,

254
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,"

255
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

256
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
which I found encouraging.

257
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Laughter)

258
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.

259
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."

260
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,

261
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
"Of Mice and Men" style.

262
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And she looked up and said,

263
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
"Now that's better."

264
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So I bought a month's worth of classes.

265
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter)

266
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And proceeded to look at --

267
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline --

268
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Parkinson's Law,

269
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.

270
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So I had a very short deadline for a competition.

271
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I got a female instructor first,

272
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to teach me the female role, the follow,

273
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities

274
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.

275
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And then I took an inventory of the characteristics,

276
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
along with her, of the

277
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.

278
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.

279
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I compared the two lists,

280
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and what you find is that there is explicitly,

281
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
expertise they recommended, certain training methods.

282
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Then there were implicit commonalities

283
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that none of them seemed to be practicing.

284
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,

285
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.

286
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Long steps. So a lot of milongueros --

287
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the tango dancers will use very short steps.

288
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I found that longer steps were much more elegant.

289
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So you can have --

290
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and you can do it in a very small space in fact.

291
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Secondly, different types of pivots.

292
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Thirdly, variation in tempo.

293
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete

294
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years.

295
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
That photo is of the

296
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.

297
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Then one month later, went to the world championships,

298
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
made it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,

299
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
two weeks later.

300
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I want you to see part of what I practiced.

301
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I'm going to jump forward here.

302
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.

303
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
His name is Gabriel Misse.

304
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation,

305
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
known for his long steps, and his tempo changes

306
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and his pivots.

307
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.

308
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.

309
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Now what I like about this video

310
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together

311
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because of his lead. He had a strong lead.

312
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
He didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.

313
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,

314
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
the strength in my feet, to do that.

315
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
So he uses a lead that focuses on

316
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
his shoulder girdle and his arm.

317
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So he can lift the woman to break her, for example.

318
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
That's just one benefit of that.

319
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So then we broke it down.

320
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
This would be an example of one pivot.

321
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
This is a back step pivot.

322
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
There are many different types.

323
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I have hundreds of hours of footage --

324
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
all categorized, much like George Carlin

325
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
categorized his comedy.

326
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So using my arch-nemesis,

327
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Spanish, no less, to learn tango.

328
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So fear is your friend. Fear is an indicator.

329
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.

330
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.

331
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And the best results that I've had in life,

332
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
the most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:

333
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
what's the worst that can happen?

334
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child.

335
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Take the analytical frameworks,

336
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.

337
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Apply them to very big dreams.

338
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And when I think of what I fear now, it's very simple.

339
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
When I imagine my life,

340
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
what my life would have been like

341
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
without the educational opportunities that I had,

342
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
it makes me wonder.

343
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct

344
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
the American public school system,

345
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
to either fix it or replace it.

346
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far --

347
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,

348
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
my readers, at this point.

349
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And if any of you are interested in that,

350
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I would love to speak with you.

351
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I know nothing. I'm a beginner.

352
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.

353
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you very much.

354
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Applause)

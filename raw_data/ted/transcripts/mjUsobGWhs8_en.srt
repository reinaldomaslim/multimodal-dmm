1
0:00:12.872,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is a man-made forest.

2
0:00:15.88,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It can spread over acres and acres of area,

3
0:00:19.121,000 --> 0:00:21,000
or it could fit in a small space --

4
0:00:22.387,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as small as your house garden.

5
0:00:27.327,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Age of this forest is just two years old.

6
0:00:31.298,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I have a forest in the backyard of my own house.

7
0:00:35.036,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It attracts a lot of biodiversity.

8
0:00:37.582,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Bird call)

9
0:00:42.229,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I wake up to this every morning,

10
0:00:43.798,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like a Disney princess.

11
0:00:45.321,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:47.164,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I am an entrepreneur

13
0:00:48.394,000 --> 0:00:52,000
who facilitates the making of these forests professionally.

14
0:00:52.798,000 --> 0:00:53,000
We have helped factories,

15
0:00:54.746,000 --> 0:00:55,000
farms,

16
0:00:55.927,000 --> 0:00:56,000
schools,

17
0:00:58.287,000 --> 0:00:59,000
homes,

18
0:01:00.306,000 --> 0:01:01,000
resorts,

19
0:01:02.273,000 --> 0:01:03,000
apartment buildings,

20
0:01:04.891,000 --> 0:01:05,000
public parks

21
0:01:06.854,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and even a zoo

22
0:01:08.221,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to have one of such forests.

23
0:01:10.715,000 --> 0:01:14,000
A forest is not an isolated piece of land where animals live together.

24
0:01:16.035,000 --> 0:01:21,000
A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.

25
0:01:22.212,000 --> 0:01:23,000
A forest, for me,

26
0:01:23.57,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.

27
0:01:27.54,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It doesn't matter how big or small they are.

28
0:01:31.046,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Most of the world we live in today was forest.

29
0:01:34.453,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This was before human intervention.

30
0:01:36.865,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Then we built up our cities on those forests,

31
0:01:39.177,000 --> 0:01:4,000
like São Paulo,

32
0:01:40.701,000 --> 0:01:42,000
forgetting that we belong to nature as well,

33
0:01:43.494,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as much as 8.4 million other species on the planet.

34
0:01:48.215,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Our habitat stopped being our natural habitat.

35
0:01:52.19,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But not anymore for some of us.

36
0:01:54.647,000 --> 0:01:57,000
A few others and I today make these forests professionally --

37
0:01:58.266,000 --> 0:01:59,000
anywhere and everywhere.

38
0:02:01.368,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'm an industrial engineer.

39
0:02:03.258,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I specialize in making cars.

40
0:02:06.078,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In my previous job at Toyota,

41
0:02:08.278,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I learned how to convert natural resources into products.

42
0:02:13.125,000 --> 0:02:14,000
To give you an example,

43
0:02:14.331,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we would drip the sap out of a rubber tree,

44
0:02:17.006,000 --> 0:02:18,000
convert it into raw rubber

45
0:02:18.689,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and make a tire out of it -- the product.

46
0:02:21.418,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But these products can never become a natural resource again.

47
0:02:25.272,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We separate the elements from nature

48
0:02:28.269,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and convert them into an irreversible state.

49
0:02:31.529,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That's industrial production.

50
0:02:34.025,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Nature, on the other hand, works in a totally opposite way.

51
0:02:37.91,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The natural system produces by bringing elements together,

52
0:02:41.919,000 --> 0:02:42,000
atom by atom.

53
0:02:44.336,000 --> 0:02:48,000
All the natural products become a natural resource again.

54
0:02:50.343,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This is something which I learned

55
0:02:53.309,000 --> 0:02:56,000
when I made a forest in the backyard of my own house.

56
0:02:56.371,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And this was the first time I worked with nature,

57
0:02:59.671,000 --> 0:03:,000
rather than against it.

58
0:03:01.894,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Since then,

59
0:03:03.094,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we have made 75 such forests in 25 cities across the world.

60
0:03:09.678,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Every time we work at a new place,

61
0:03:11.824,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we find that every single element needed to make a forest

62
0:03:16.592,000 --> 0:03:18,000
is available right around us.

63
0:03:18.666,000 --> 0:03:2,000
All we have to do is to bring these elements together

64
0:03:21.371,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and let nature take over.

65
0:03:25.1,000 --> 0:03:28,000
To make a forest we start with soil.

66
0:03:28.125,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We touch, feel and even taste it

67
0:03:30.589,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to identify what properties it lacks.

68
0:03:33.68,000 --> 0:03:36,000
If the soil is made up of small particles it becomes compact --

69
0:03:36.746,000 --> 0:03:38,000
so compact, that water cannot seep in.

70
0:03:40.188,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We mix some local biomass available around,

71
0:03:44.66,000 --> 0:03:46,000
which can help soil become more porous.

72
0:03:49.04,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Water can now seep in.

73
0:03:51.359,000 --> 0:03:55,000
If the soil doesn't have the capacity to hold water,

74
0:03:55.882,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we will mix some more biomass --

75
0:03:57.581,000 --> 0:04:,000
some water-absorbent material like peat or bagasse,

76
0:04:00.879,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so soil can hold this water and it stays moist.

77
0:04:05.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
To grow, plants need water, sunlight and nutrition.

78
0:04:11.047,000 --> 0:04:13,000
What if the soil doesn't have any nutrition in it?

79
0:04:14.383,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We don't just add nutrition directly to the soil.

80
0:04:16.733,000 --> 0:04:17,000
That would be the industrial way.

81
0:04:18.369,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It goes against nature.

82
0:04:19.819,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We instead add microorganisms to the soil.

83
0:04:22.927,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They produce the nutrients in the soil naturally.

84
0:04:26.886,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They feed on the biomass we have mixed in the soil,

85
0:04:29.499,000 --> 0:04:31,000
so all they have to do is eat and multiply.

86
0:04:32.222,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And as their number grows,

87
0:04:34.197,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the soil starts breathing again.

88
0:04:35.769,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It becomes alive.

89
0:04:38.215,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We survey the native tree species of the place.

90
0:04:40.866,000 --> 0:04:42,000
How do we decide what's native or not?

91
0:04:43.473,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Well, whatever existed before human intervention is native.

92
0:04:47.955,000 --> 0:04:48,000
That's the simple rule.

93
0:04:49.949,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We survey a national park

94
0:04:54.47,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to find the last remains of a natural forest.

95
0:04:58.689,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We survey the sacred groves,

96
0:05:01.714,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or sacred forests around old temples.

97
0:05:04.973,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And if we don't find anything at all,

98
0:05:07.276,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we go to museums

99
0:05:08.824,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to see the seeds or wood of trees existing there a long time ago.

100
0:05:14.547,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We research old paintings, poems and literature from the place,

101
0:05:20.068,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to identify the tree species belonging there.

102
0:05:23.217,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Once we know our trees,

103
0:05:24.587,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we divide them in four different layers:

104
0:05:26.529,000 --> 0:05:29,000
shrub layer, sub-tree layer, tree layer and canopy layer.

105
0:05:30.475,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We fix the ratios of each layer,

106
0:05:33.016,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and then we decide the percentage of each tree species in the mix.

107
0:05:38.506,000 --> 0:05:39,000
If we are making a fruit forest,

108
0:05:40.363,000 --> 0:05:43,000
we increase the percentage of fruit-bearing trees.

109
0:05:43.446,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It could be a flowering forest,

110
0:05:46.145,000 --> 0:05:49,000
a forest that attracts a lot of birds or bees,

111
0:05:50.026,000 --> 0:05:54,000
or it could simply be a native, wild evergreen forest.

112
0:05:55.56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We collect the seeds and germinate saplings out of them.

113
0:05:59.011,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We make sure that trees belonging to the same layer

114
0:06:01.999,000 --> 0:06:02,000
are not planted next to each other,

115
0:06:03.873,000 --> 0:06:06,000
or they will fight for the same vertical space when they grow tall.

116
0:06:07.224,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We plant the saplings close to each other.

117
0:06:10.548,000 --> 0:06:13,000
On the surface, we spread a thick layer of mulch,

118
0:06:13.637,000 --> 0:06:15,000
so when it's hot outside the soil stays moist.

119
0:06:16.605,000 --> 0:06:17,000
When it's cold,

120
0:06:18.341,000 --> 0:06:21,000
frost formation happens only on the mulch,

121
0:06:21.582,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so soil can still breathe while it's freezing outside.

122
0:06:25.497,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The soil is very soft --

123
0:06:28.69,000 --> 0:06:31,000
so soft, that roots can penetrate into it easily,

124
0:06:32.208,000 --> 0:06:33,000
rapidly.

125
0:06:34.064,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Initially, the forest doesn't seem like it's growing,

126
0:06:36.573,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but it's growing under the surface.

127
0:06:38.746,000 --> 0:06:39,000
In the first three months,

128
0:06:40.231,000 --> 0:06:41,000
roots reach a depth of one meter.

129
0:06:42.736,000 --> 0:06:43,000
These roots form a mesh,

130
0:06:44.644,000 --> 0:06:45,000
tightly holding the soil.

131
0:06:46.397,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Microbes and fungi live throughout this network of roots.

132
0:06:50.706,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So if some nutrition is not available in the vicinity of a tree,

133
0:06:54.317,000 --> 0:06:56,000
these microbes are going to get the nutrition to the tree.

134
0:06:57.754,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Whenever it rains,

135
0:06:59.502,000 --> 0:07:,000
magically,

136
0:07:00.686,000 --> 0:07:01,000
mushrooms appear overnight.

137
0:07:02.573,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And this means the soil below has a healthy fungal network.

138
0:07:06.663,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Once these roots are established,

139
0:07:08.954,000 --> 0:07:1,000
forest starts growing on the surface.

140
0:07:11.835,000 --> 0:07:15,000
As the forest grows we keep watering it --

141
0:07:16.226,000 --> 0:07:19,000
for the next two to three years, we water the forest.

142
0:07:20.752,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We want to keep all the water and soil nutrition only for our trees,

143
0:07:25.832,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so we remove the weeds growing on the ground.

144
0:07:28.971,000 --> 0:07:31,000
As this forest grows, it blocks the sunlight.

145
0:07:32.801,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Eventually, the forest becomes so dense

146
0:07:35.271,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that sunlight can't reach the ground anymore.

147
0:07:37.902,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Weeds cannot grow now, because they need sunlight as well.

148
0:07:42.044,000 --> 0:07:43,000
At this stage,

149
0:07:43.347,000 --> 0:07:46,000
every single drop of water that falls into the forest

150
0:07:46.568,000 --> 0:07:48,000
doesn't evaporate back into the atmosphere.

151
0:07:49.327,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This dense forest condenses the moist air

152
0:07:52.439,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and retains its moisture.

153
0:07:54.712,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We gradually reduce and eventually stop watering the forest.

154
0:07:59.34,000 --> 0:08:,000
And even without watering,

155
0:08:00.882,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the forest floor stays moist and sometimes even dark.

156
0:08:05.97,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now, when a single leaf falls on this forest floor,

157
0:08:09.394,000 --> 0:08:11,000
it immediately starts decaying.

158
0:08:12.317,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This decayed biomass forms humus,

159
0:08:15.527,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which is food for the forest.

160
0:08:17.53,000 --> 0:08:18,000
As the forest grows,

161
0:08:19.233,000 --> 0:08:2,000
more leaves fall on the surface --

162
0:08:20.927,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it means more humus is produced,

163
0:08:22.983,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it means more food so the forest can grow still bigger.

164
0:08:26.245,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And this forest keeps growing exponentially.

165
0:08:30.053,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Once established,

166
0:08:31.493,000 --> 0:08:35,000
these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again --

167
0:08:35.707,000 --> 0:08:36,000
probably forever.

168
0:08:38.209,000 --> 0:08:4,000
In a natural forest like this,

169
0:08:40.679,000 --> 0:08:42,000
no management is the best management.

170
0:08:44.493,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's a tiny jungle party.

171
0:08:46.308,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:48.663,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This forest grows as a collective.

173
0:08:51.627,000 --> 0:08:52,000
If the same trees --

174
0:08:52.969,000 --> 0:08:53,000
same species --

175
0:08:54.27,000 --> 0:08:56,000
would have been planted independently,

176
0:08:56.532,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it wouldn't grow so fast.

177
0:08:58.503,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And this is how we create a 100-year-old forest

178
0:09:02.711,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in just 10 years.

179
0:09:04.044,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Thank you very much.

180
0:09:05.222,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Applause)

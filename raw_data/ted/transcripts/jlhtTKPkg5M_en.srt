1
0:00:12.803,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Have you every had to break your family's rules?

2
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Today, I'm breaking mine,

3
0:00:18.818,000 --> 0:00:21,000
around money, secrecy and shame.

4
0:00:23.922,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In 2006, on my brother Keith's 40th birthday, he called.

5
0:00:29.017,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"Tam, I'm in dire straits.

6
0:00:32.514,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I wouldn't ask unless I had to.

7
0:00:36.381,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Can I borrow 7,500 dollars?"

8
0:00:40.611,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This wasn't the first time he needed quick cash,

9
0:00:43.389,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but this time, his voice frightened me.

10
0:00:47.664,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I had never heard him so beaten down and shameful,

11
0:00:54.321,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and it was on his 40th birthday.

12
0:01:01.723,000 --> 0:01:03,000
After a few basic questions that we would all ask,

13
0:01:05.737,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I agreed to loan him the money, but under one condition:

14
0:01:10.421,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that as the financial professional in the family,

15
0:01:12.889,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I wanted to meet with him and his wife

16
0:01:14.867,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to see what was really happening.

17
0:01:17.983,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Weeks later, we met at the local Starbucks,

18
0:01:21.23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I started right in with the tough-love budget conversation.

19
0:01:26.336,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"You should sell the house, downsize to something you can afford,

20
0:01:30.639,000 --> 0:01:31,000
sell the toys.

21
0:01:32.629,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And Starbucks?

22
0:01:34.139,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Give up the five-dollar-a-day coffee."

23
0:01:37.343,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You know, all the trappings that we do to keep up with the Joneses.

24
0:01:42.811,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Quickly, my brother and his wife went into a fearsome blame game,

25
0:01:47.348,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and it got messy.

26
0:01:49.709,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I vacillated between therapist and pissed-off sister.

27
0:01:56.029,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I wanted them to be better than this.

28
0:01:58.5,000 --> 0:02:,000
"Come on, you two. Get your shit together.

29
0:02:02.025,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You're parents.

30
0:02:03.555,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Grow up and buck up."

31
0:02:08.28,000 --> 0:02:1,000
After we left, I called my mom,

32
0:02:12.484,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but Keith beat me to it,

33
0:02:14.438,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and he told her that I wasn't helpful.

34
0:02:17.955,000 --> 0:02:2,000
In fact, he was hurt and felt ganged-up on.

35
0:02:24.2,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Of course he did. I shamed him with my tough-love budget conversation.

36
0:02:33.091,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Two months went by when I received a call.

37
0:02:36.669,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Tam? I have bad news.

38
0:02:40.646,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Keith committed suicide last night."

39
0:02:47.747,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Days later, at his home, I went looking for answers,

40
0:02:52.626,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in his "office" -- the garage.

41
0:02:56.416,000 --> 0:03:,000
There, I found a stack of overdue credit card bills

42
0:03:00.671,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and a foreclosure notice served to him on the day that he died.

43
0:03:24.959,000 --> 0:03:28,000
My brother left behind his beautiful 10-year-old daughter,

44
0:03:29.512,000 --> 0:03:34,000
his brilliant 18-year-old son, weeks before his high school graduation,

45
0:03:34.877,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and his wife of 20 years.

46
0:03:38.18,000 --> 0:03:39,000
How did this happen?

47
0:03:42.276,000 --> 0:03:46,000
My brother was caught in our family's money-shame cycle,

48
0:03:46.88,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and he was far from alone in this.

49
0:03:50.087,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Suicide rates among adults ages 40 to 64

50
0:03:55.541,000 --> 0:03:58,000
have risen nearly 40 percent since 1999.

51
0:04:00.141,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Job loss, bankruptcy and foreclosures

52
0:04:03.697,000 --> 0:04:06,000
were present in nearly 40 percent of the deaths,

53
0:04:06.934,000 --> 0:04:11,000
with white middle-aged men accounting for seven out of 10 suicides.

54
0:04:13.823,000 --> 0:04:15,000
What I've learned

55
0:04:16.038,000 --> 0:04:22,000
is that our self-destructive and self-defeating financial behaviors

56
0:04:22.684,000 --> 0:04:25,000
are not driven by our rational, logical minds.

57
0:04:27.434,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Instead, they are a product of our subconscious belief systems

58
0:04:33.752,000 --> 0:04:35,000
rooted in our childhoods

59
0:04:35.967,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and so deeply ingrained in us,

60
0:04:38.475,000 --> 0:04:42,000
they shape the way that we deal with money our entire adult lives,

61
0:04:43.38,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and so many of you are left believing that you're lazy,

62
0:04:49.633,000 --> 0:04:53,000
crazy or stupid -- or just bad with money.

63
0:04:55.027,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is what I call money shame.

64
0:04:59.216,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Dr. Brené Brown, a well-known shame researcher,

65
0:05:02.927,000 --> 0:05:08,000
defines shame as "the intensely painful feeling or experience

66
0:05:09.253,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of believing that we are flawed,

67
0:05:12.602,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and therefore unworthy of love and belonging."

68
0:05:17.746,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Based on this definition, here's how I'm defining money shame:

69
0:05:23.499,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"the intensely painful feeling or experience

70
0:05:26.206,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of believing that we are flawed,

71
0:05:29.026,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and therefore unworthy of love and belonging,

72
0:05:32.215,000 --> 0:05:34,000
based on our bank account balances,

73
0:05:35.546,000 --> 0:05:39,000
our debts, our homes, our cars

74
0:05:40.118,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and our job titles."

75
0:05:43.833,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Let me give you a couple of examples of what I mean.

76
0:05:47.756,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I believe that we all have money shame,

77
0:05:50.407,000 --> 0:05:53,000
whether you earn 10,000 dollars a year or 10 million,

78
0:05:54.326,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and it's because we give money all of our power.

79
0:05:59.737,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Here's what it would look like if someone that you love, or you,

80
0:06:03.952,000 --> 0:06:05,000
might have money shame.

81
0:06:06.1,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They play the big shot, always picking up the check,

82
0:06:09.454,000 --> 0:06:11,000
financially rescuing family and friends.

83
0:06:12.327,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They are financially secure,

84
0:06:14.605,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but they live in a state of chronic not-enoughness.

85
0:06:20.433,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They drive a Mercedes, but their budget really only can afford a Honda.

86
0:06:28.234,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And they're looking good at every cost.

87
0:06:32.539,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I know that we can break free from the grips of money shame,

88
0:06:36.865,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because I did.

89
0:06:39.267,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Shortly after my brother's death, the Recession hit.

90
0:06:43.976,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I lost my business and faced bankruptcy.

91
0:06:48.447,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Secretly, I was terrified.

92
0:06:53.409,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I stayed in my home for a year, thinking I did something wrong,

93
0:06:59.1,000 --> 0:07:02,000
told myself, "What did you do? What happened?"

94
0:07:03.852,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I stayed silent, while all along, I went outside and smiled.

95
0:07:09.767,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Nobody knew.

96
0:07:11.692,000 --> 0:07:12,000
That's money shame.

97
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So what I had to do was let go of the grip that I had

98
0:07:20.022,000 --> 0:07:21,000
on knowing all the answers.

99
0:07:22.045,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I was the know-it-all in my family,

100
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and I had to give up the idea that a new financial plan

101
0:07:30.196,000 --> 0:07:31,000
was the solution.

102
0:07:33.188,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And so just like everything in my life, for me,

103
0:07:38.483,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I was sent a human to help,

104
0:07:42.896,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and I accepted the help,

105
0:07:46.038,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but I had to do major self-inquiry

106
0:07:49.357,000 --> 0:07:52,000
about my family's money history

107
0:07:52.618,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and my money beliefs.

108
0:07:56.777,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We have to start having this conversation.

109
0:08:00.77,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Money can no longer be a taboo topic.

110
0:08:04.202,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We have to get honest with each other that we're suffering with money issues,

111
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and let's get real -- we have to stop numbing out our pain.

112
0:08:16.484,000 --> 0:08:19,000
In order to uncover the painful parts

113
0:08:19.557,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of your money story and your money history,

114
0:08:23.481,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you can't be numb.

115
0:08:25.998,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We have to let go of our past in order to be free.

116
0:08:32.823,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Letting go of the past happens through surrender,

117
0:08:36.538,000 --> 0:08:37,000
faith and forgiveness.

118
0:08:39.334,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Debt is the tangible manifestation of not forgiving.

119
0:08:44.893,000 --> 0:08:48,000
If you have debt, you've not completely forgiven your past,

120
0:08:49.124,000 --> 0:08:52,000
so it's our work to forgive ourselves and others

121
0:08:52.908,000 --> 0:08:53,000
so that we can live freely.

122
0:08:54.694,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Otherwise, our history will continue to repeat.

123
0:08:59.648,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This is not a quick fix, and I know we all want one,

124
0:09:03.736,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but it's a slow wake-up.

125
0:09:05.688,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This is another level of work.

126
0:09:08.413,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We have to go higher to get it,

127
0:09:11.728,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to get at it.

128
0:09:14.014,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So try this: follow your dollars.

129
0:09:17.302,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Your money will show you right away what you value.

130
0:09:21.491,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Where's it going?

131
0:09:22.992,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And then ask yourself: Do I really value all this stuff?

132
0:09:27.99,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And get curious about what you're feeling when you're spending.

133
0:09:31.433,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Are you lonely?

134
0:09:33.054,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Are you bored?

135
0:09:34.868,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Or are you just excited?

136
0:09:39.424,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But there's deeper work that needs to happen.

137
0:09:42.063,000 --> 0:09:44,000
How did you get all these money beliefs to begin with?

138
0:09:46.623,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I call this your money autobiography,

139
0:09:49.407,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and as a money coach, this is the first step I take with my clients.

140
0:09:54.773,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Think back to your earliest childhood money memory.

141
0:09:58.685,000 --> 0:10:,000
What did it feel like when you got money?

142
0:10:01.235,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Were you excited, proud or confused?

143
0:10:06.051,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And what did you do with the money?

144
0:10:08.172,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Did you run with the candy store, or did you run to the bank?

145
0:10:12.899,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And what did you hear your parents say,

146
0:10:15.387,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and what did you see your parents do with the money?

147
0:10:19.548,000 --> 0:10:21,000
My brother and I heard,

148
0:10:21.792,000 --> 0:10:22,000
"More money will make us happy."

149
0:10:24.506,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Every day.

150
0:10:25.721,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"More money will make us happy."

151
0:10:27.954,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And we internalized that into the money belief

152
0:10:31.405,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that our self worth was equal to our net worth

153
0:10:35.217,000 --> 0:10:4,000
as we watched our mom live in a state of chronic not-enoughness.

154
0:10:41.064,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And she numbed the pain with sugar and shopping.

155
0:10:46.441,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So what did we do?

156
0:10:48.941,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Keith played out my mother's life.

157
0:10:51.514,000 --> 0:10:54,000
He was an underearner, longed to be financially rescued,

158
0:10:55.529,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and he numbed out the pain with alcohol.

159
0:10:59.058,000 --> 0:11:,000
I did the opposite.

160
0:11:01.36,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I became a high earner,

161
0:11:03.537,000 --> 0:11:06,000
rescuer,

162
0:11:06.895,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and I numbed the pain out with self-help books.

163
0:11:11.699,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But what we had in common was our money belief.

164
0:11:14.549,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We both believed that our bank account balance

165
0:11:17.19,000 --> 0:11:18,000
was equal to our self worth.

166
0:11:20.904,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Looking back at the Starbucks meeting with my brother ...

167
0:11:25.603,000 --> 0:11:28,000
he didn't need a budget and my judgment.

168
0:11:29.692,000 --> 0:11:32,000
He needed a breakthrough from his suffering,

169
0:11:32.812,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and he needed my compassion.

170
0:11:36.037,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Keith was not able to be the one to speak up

171
0:11:38.928,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and break our family money shame cycle,

172
0:11:41.442,000 --> 0:11:44,000
so he left me to do the work and share his legacy.

173
0:11:46.759,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Change is difficult,

174
0:11:49.792,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but in my family, not changing is fatal.

175
0:11:54.67,000 --> 0:11:55,000
So I did the work,

176
0:11:56.348,000 --> 0:12:,000
and I have experienced deep and profound forgiveness,

177
0:12:03.096,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and as I stand here today,

178
0:12:05.501,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I am living on purpose,

179
0:12:09.473,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I serve, and money serves me.

180
0:12:13.85,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It only takes one person in your family

181
0:12:18.032,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to break through the money-shame cycle.

182
0:12:21.416,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I want you to be the one.

183
0:12:24.608,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Thank you.

184
0:12:25.783,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Applause)

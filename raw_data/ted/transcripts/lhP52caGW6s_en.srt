1
0:00:12.46,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Clouds.

2
0:00:14.77,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Have you ever noticed how much people moan about them?

3
0:00:17.392,000 --> 0:00:19,000
They get a bad rap.

4
0:00:19.639,000 --> 0:00:21,000
If you think about it, the English language

5
0:00:22.186,000 --> 0:00:26,000
has written into it negative associations towards the clouds.

6
0:00:26.479,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Someone who's down or depressed,

7
0:00:28.946,000 --> 0:00:29,000
they're under a cloud.

8
0:00:30.637,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And when there's bad news in store,

9
0:00:32.328,000 --> 0:00:34,000
there's a cloud on the horizon.

10
0:00:35.176,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I saw an article the other day.

11
0:00:37.208,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It was about problems with computer processing

12
0:00:40.394,000 --> 0:00:41,000
over the Internet.

13
0:00:42.216,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"A cloud over the cloud," was the headline.

14
0:00:47.14,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It seems like they're everyone's default

15
0:00:49.123,000 --> 0:00:51,000
doom-and-gloom metaphor.

16
0:00:51.397,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But I think they're beautiful, don't you?

17
0:00:53.55,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's just that their beauty is missed

18
0:00:56.663,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because they're so omnipresent,

19
0:00:58.663,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so, I don't know, commonplace,

20
0:01:02.012,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that people don't notice them.

21
0:01:03.465,000 --> 0:01:06,000
They don't notice the beauty, but they don't even notice the clouds

22
0:01:06.68,000 --> 0:01:08,000
unless they get in the way of the sun.

23
0:01:08.957,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And so people think of clouds as

24
0:01:11.262,000 --> 0:01:13,000
things that get in the way.

25
0:01:13.342,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They think of them as the annoying, frustrating obstructions,

26
0:01:18.413,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking.

27
0:01:21.333,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:23.718,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But most people, when you stop to ask them,

29
0:01:25.941,000 --> 0:01:29,000
will admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds.

30
0:01:30.791,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It's like a nostalgic fondness,

31
0:01:33.45,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and they make them think of their youth.

32
0:01:36.584,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Who here can't remember thinking, well,

33
0:01:39.82,000 --> 0:01:41,000
looking and finding shapes in the clouds

34
0:01:42.422,000 --> 0:01:43,000
when they were kids?

35
0:01:43.765,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You know, when you were masters of daydreaming?

36
0:01:50.496,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Aristophanes, the ancient Greek playwright,

37
0:01:53.263,000 --> 0:01:56,000
he described the clouds as the patron godesses

38
0:01:56.614,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of idle fellows

39
0:01:58.398,000 --> 0:01:59,000
two and a half thousand years ago,

40
0:02:00.042,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and you can see what he means.

41
0:02:01.495,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's just that these days, us adults seem reluctant

42
0:02:05.952,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to allow ourselves the indulgence

43
0:02:09.312,000 --> 0:02:11,000
of just allowing our imaginations

44
0:02:11.944,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to drift along in the breeze, and I think that's a pity.

45
0:02:15.614,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it.

46
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I think we should be a bit more willing, perhaps,

47
0:02:21.02,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out

48
0:02:24.963,000 --> 0:02:27,000
from behind the clouds and go, "Wait a minute,

49
0:02:28.429,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that's two cats dancing the salsa!"

50
0:02:30.768,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

51
0:02:32.165,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Or seeing the big, white, puffy one up there

52
0:02:37.931,000 --> 0:02:38,000
over the shopping center looks like

53
0:02:39.853,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the Abominable Snowman going to rob a bank.

54
0:02:43.486,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:46.682,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They're like nature's version of those inkblot images,

56
0:02:50.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you know, that shrinks used to show their patients

57
0:02:53.005,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in the '60s,

58
0:02:54.272,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and I think if you consider the shapes you see in the clouds,

59
0:02:57.997,000 --> 0:03:,000
you'll save money on psychoanalysis bills.

60
0:03:01.887,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Let's say you're in love. All right?

61
0:03:03.766,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And you look up and what do you see?

62
0:03:05.963,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Right? Or maybe the opposite.

63
0:03:08.589,000 --> 0:03:1,000
You've just been dumped by your partner,

64
0:03:10.633,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and everywhere you look, it's kissing couples.

65
0:03:13.742,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:15.694,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Perhaps you're having a moment of existential angst.

67
0:03:19.45,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You know, you're thinking about your own mortality.

68
0:03:21.903,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And there, on the horizon, it's the Grim Reaper.

69
0:03:24.899,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:27.858,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Or maybe you see a topless sunbather.

71
0:03:31.303,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:32.932,000 --> 0:03:35,000
What would that mean?

73
0:03:36.004,000 --> 0:03:41,000
What would that mean? I have no idea.

74
0:03:41.535,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But one thing I do know is this:

75
0:03:43.765,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The bad press that clouds get is totally unfair.

76
0:03:47.14,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I think we should stand up for them,

77
0:03:48.879,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which is why, a few years ago,

78
0:03:50.332,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I started the Cloud Appreciation Society.

79
0:03:53.018,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Tens of thousands of members now

80
0:03:55.59,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in almost 100 countries around the world.

81
0:03:57.616,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And all these photographs that I'm showing,

82
0:04:00.617,000 --> 0:04:02,000
they were sent in by members.

83
0:04:02.973,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And the society exists to remind people of this:

84
0:04:06.437,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Clouds are not something to moan about.

85
0:04:09.484,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Far from it. They are, in fact,

86
0:04:11.867,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature.

87
0:04:19.577,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I think, if you live with your head in the clouds

88
0:04:22.844,000 --> 0:04:24,000
every now and then, it helps you keep your feet on the ground.

89
0:04:25.821,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And I want to show you why, with the help of

90
0:04:27.443,000 --> 0:04:29,000
some of my favorite types of clouds.

91
0:04:29.523,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Let's start with this one. It's the cirrus cloud,

92
0:04:31.88,000 --> 0:04:33,000
named after the Latin for a lock of hair.

93
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's composed entirely of ice crystals

94
0:04:36.421,000 --> 0:04:38,000
cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere,

95
0:04:38.937,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and as these ice crystals fall,

96
0:04:40.438,000 --> 0:04:42,000
they pass through different layers with different winds

97
0:04:43.082,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and they speed up and slow down,

98
0:04:44.766,000 --> 0:04:47,000
giving the cloud these brush-stroked appearances,

99
0:04:47.825,000 --> 0:04:49,000
these brush-stroke forms known as fall streaks.

100
0:04:50.76,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And these winds up there can be very, very fierce.

101
0:04:52.771,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They can be 200 miles an hour, 300 miles an hour.

102
0:04:55.352,000 --> 0:04:56,000
These clouds are bombing along,

103
0:04:56.853,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but from all the way down here,

104
0:04:58.636,000 --> 0:05:01,000
they appear to be moving gracefully, slowly,

105
0:05:01.784,000 --> 0:05:03,000
like most clouds.

106
0:05:03.993,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And so to tune into the clouds is to slow down,

107
0:05:07.216,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to calm down.

108
0:05:09.161,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's like a bit of everyday meditation.

109
0:05:11.994,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Those are common clouds.

110
0:05:13.154,000 --> 0:05:15,000
What about rarer ones, like the lenticularis,

111
0:05:15.956,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the UFO-shaped lenticularis cloud?

112
0:05:18.307,000 --> 0:05:2,000
These clouds form in the region of mountains.

113
0:05:20.827,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When the wind passes, rises to pass over the mountain,

114
0:05:23.712,000 --> 0:05:26,000
it can take on a wave-like path in the lee of the peak,

115
0:05:26.951,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with these clouds hovering at the crest

116
0:05:29.678,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of these invisible standing waves of air,

117
0:05:32.338,000 --> 0:05:34,000
these flying saucer-like forms,

118
0:05:34.6,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and some of the early black-and-white UFO photos

119
0:05:37.264,000 --> 0:05:39,000
are in fact lenticularis clouds. It's true.

120
0:05:40.18,000 --> 0:05:43,000
A little rarer are the fallstreak holes. All right?

121
0:05:44.019,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is when a layer is made up of very, very cold

122
0:05:46.424,000 --> 0:05:48,000
water droplets, and in one region they start to freeze,

123
0:05:49.271,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and this freezing sets off a chain reaction which spreads outwards

124
0:05:52.438,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with the ice crystals cascading and falling down below,

125
0:05:55.142,000 --> 0:05:59,000
giving the appearance of jellyfish tendrils down below.

126
0:05:59.981,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Rarer still, the Kelvin–Helmholtz cloud.

127
0:06:04.061,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Not a very snappy name. Needs a rebrand.

128
0:06:07.503,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This looks like a series of breaking waves,

129
0:06:11.263,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and it's caused by shearing winds -- the wind

130
0:06:13.957,000 --> 0:06:15,000
above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer

131
0:06:16.22,000 --> 0:06:18,000
differ significantly, and in the middle, in between,

132
0:06:18.775,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you get this undulating of the air,

133
0:06:20.658,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and if the difference in those speeds is just right,

134
0:06:23.159,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the tops of the undulations curl over

135
0:06:25.061,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices.

136
0:06:28.623,000 --> 0:06:3,000
All right. Those are rarer clouds than the cirrus,

137
0:06:31.028,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but they're not that rare.

138
0:06:32.735,000 --> 0:06:34,000
If you look up, and you pay attention to the sky,

139
0:06:35.583,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you'll see them sooner or later,

140
0:06:37.456,000 --> 0:06:39,000
maybe not quite as dramatic as these, but you'll see them.

141
0:06:40.242,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And you'll see them around where you live.

142
0:06:42.296,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Clouds are the most egalitarian

143
0:06:44.857,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of nature's displays, because we all have a good,

144
0:06:47.531,000 --> 0:06:49,000
fantastic view of the sky.

145
0:06:50.162,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And these clouds, these rarer clouds,

146
0:06:52.002,000 --> 0:06:56,000
remind us that the exotic can be found in the everyday.

147
0:06:56.722,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Nothing is more nourishing, more stimulating

148
0:06:59.481,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to an active, inquiring mind than being surprised,

149
0:07:02.948,000 --> 0:07:05,000
being amazed. It's why we're all here at TED, right?

150
0:07:06.644,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But you don't need to rush off

151
0:07:09.589,000 --> 0:07:11,000
away from the familiar, across the world

152
0:07:11.949,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to be surprised.

153
0:07:13.411,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You just need to step outside,

154
0:07:16.186,000 --> 0:07:18,000
pay attention to what's so commonplace, so everyday,

155
0:07:18.762,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so mundane that everybody else misses it.

156
0:07:22.749,000 --> 0:07:24,000
One cloud that people rarely miss is this one:

157
0:07:25.163,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the cumulonimbus storm cloud.

158
0:07:28.131,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's what's produces thunder and lightning and hail.

159
0:07:30.632,000 --> 0:07:33,000
These clouds spread out at the top in this enormous

160
0:07:33.74,000 --> 0:07:35,000
anvil fashion stretching 10 miles up into the atmosphere.

161
0:07:36.562,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They are an expression of the majestic architecture

162
0:07:39.981,000 --> 0:07:4,000
of our atmosphere.

163
0:07:41.866,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But from down below, they are the embodiment

164
0:07:45.252,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of the powerful, elemental force and power

165
0:07:49.383,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that drives our atmosphere.

166
0:07:51.277,000 --> 0:07:55,000
To be there is to be connected in the driving rain

167
0:07:55.391,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and the hail, to feel connected to our atmosphere.

168
0:07:58.693,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's to be reminded that we are creatures

169
0:08:00.991,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that inhabit this ocean of air.

170
0:08:02.7,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We don't live beneath the sky. We live within it.

171
0:08:06.097,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And that connection, that visceral connection to our atmosphere

172
0:08:10.18,000 --> 0:08:12,000
feels to me like an antidote.

173
0:08:12.616,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's an antidote to the growing tendency we have

174
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to feel that we can really ever experience life

175
0:08:19.595,000 --> 0:08:21,000
by watching it on a computer screen, you know,

176
0:08:21.81,000 --> 0:08:23,000
when we're in a wi-fi zone.

177
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But the one cloud that best expresses

178
0:08:26.544,000 --> 0:08:28,000
why cloudspotting is more valuable today than ever

179
0:08:29.469,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is this one, the cumulus cloud.

180
0:08:32.66,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Right? It forms on a sunny day.

181
0:08:34.739,000 --> 0:08:36,000
If you close your eyes and think of a cloud,

182
0:08:36.859,000 --> 0:08:38,000
it's probably one of these that comes to mind.

183
0:08:39.208,000 --> 0:08:41,000
All those cloud shapes at the beginning,

184
0:08:41.832,000 --> 0:08:43,000
those were cumulus clouds.

185
0:08:43.975,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The sharp, crisp outlines of this formation

186
0:08:47.599,000 --> 0:08:5,000
make it the best one for finding shapes in.

187
0:08:50.755,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And it reminds us

188
0:08:52.727,000 --> 0:08:55,000
of the aimless nature of cloudspotting,

189
0:08:56.671,000 --> 0:08:58,000
what an aimless activity it is.

190
0:08:58.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You're not going to change the world

191
0:09:00.659,000 --> 0:09:04,000
by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky, are you?

192
0:09:04.711,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's pointless. It's a pointless activity,

193
0:09:06.934,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which is precisely why it's so important.

194
0:09:11.79,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The digital world conspires to make us feel

195
0:09:15.819,000 --> 0:09:17,000
eternally busy, perpetually busy.

196
0:09:18.59,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You know, when you're not dealing with

197
0:09:20.424,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the traditional pressures of earning a living

198
0:09:23.102,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and putting food on the table, raising a family,

199
0:09:25.756,000 --> 0:09:27,000
writing thank you letters,

200
0:09:27.83,000 --> 0:09:29,000
you have to now contend with

201
0:09:30.542,000 --> 0:09:33,000
answering a mountain of unanswered emails,

202
0:09:34.108,000 --> 0:09:35,000
updating a Facebook page,

203
0:09:35.966,000 --> 0:09:37,000
feeding your Twitter feed.

204
0:09:38.514,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And cloudspotting legitimizes doing nothing.

205
0:09:42.3,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

206
0:09:44.205,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And sometimes we need —

207
0:09:46.857,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Applause)

208
0:09:52.465,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Sometimes we need excuses to do nothing.

209
0:09:56.548,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We need to be reminded by these

210
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
patron goddesses of idle fellows

211
0:10:02.862,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that slowing down

212
0:10:05.837,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and being in the present, not thinking about

213
0:10:09.64,000 --> 0:10:11,000
what you've got to do and what you should have done,

214
0:10:12.494,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but just being here, letting your imagination

215
0:10:15.229,000 --> 0:10:17,000
lift from the everyday concerns down here

216
0:10:17.991,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and just being in the present, it's good for you,

217
0:10:20.823,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and it's good for the way you feel.

218
0:10:22.961,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity.

219
0:10:26.529,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's good for your soul.

220
0:10:29.879,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So keep looking up,

221
0:10:32.106,000 --> 0:10:35,000
marvel at the ephemeral beauty,

222
0:10:35.159,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and always remember to live life with your head in the clouds.

223
0:10:38.583,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Thank you very much.

224
0:10:39.77,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I call myself a body architect.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I trained in classical ballet

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and have a background in architecture and fashion.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
As a body architect, I fascinate with the human body

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and explore how I can transform it.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I worked at Philips Electronics

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in the far-future design research lab,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
looking 20 years into the future.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I explored the human skin, and how technology can transform the body.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I worked on concepts like an electronic tattoo,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which is augmented by touch,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
or dresses that blushed and shivered with light.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I started my own experiments.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
These were the low-tech approaches to the high-tech conversations I was having.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
These are Q-tips stuck to my roommate with wig glue.

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I started a collaboration with a friend of mine, Bart Hess --

18
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
he doesn't normally look like this --

19
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and we used ourselves as models.

20
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We transformed our apartments into our laboratories,

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and worked in a very spontaneous and immediate way.

22
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We were creating

23
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
visual imagery provoking human evolution.

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Whilst I was at Philips, we discussed this idea of a maybe technology,

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
something that wasn't either switched on or off, but in between.

26
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
A maybe that could take the form of a gas or a liquid.

27
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I became obsessed with this idea of blurring the perimeter of the body,

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so you couldn't see where the skin ended and the near environment started.

29
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I set up my studio in the red-light district

30
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and obsessively wrapped myself in plumbing tubing,

31
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and found a way to redefine the skin

32
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and create this dynamic textile.

33
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I was introduced to Robyn, the Swedish pop star,

34
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and she was also exploring

35
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
how technology coexists with raw human emotion.

36
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And she talked about how technology with these new feathers,

37
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
this new face paint, this punk, the way that we identify with the world,

38
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and we made this music video.

39
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'm fascinated with the idea

40
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
of what happens when you merge biology with technology,

41
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram

42
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
biology, in the future, away from disease and aging.

43
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And I thought about this concept of,

44
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
imagine if we could reprogram

45
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
our own body odor, modify and biologically enhance it,

46
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and how would that change the way that we communicate with each other?

47
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Or the way that we attract sexual partners?

48
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And would we revert back to being more like animals,

49
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
more primal modes of communication?

50
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I worked with a synthetic biologist,

51
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and I created a swallowable perfume,

52
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
which is a cosmetic pill that you eat

53
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and the fragrance comes out through the skin's surface when you perspire.

54
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It completely blows apart the way that perfume is,

55
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and provides a whole new format.

56
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It's perfume coming from the inside out.

57
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It redefines the role of skin, and our bodies become an atomizer.

58
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I've learned that there's no boundaries,

59
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and if I look at the evolution of my work

60
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
i can see threads and connections that make sense.

61
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But when I look towards the future,

62
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the next project is completely unknown and wide open.

63
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I feel like I have all these ideas existing embedded inside of me,

64
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and it's these conversations and these experiences

65
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that connect these ideas, and they kind of instinctively come out.

66
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
As a body architect,

67
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I've created this limitless and boundless platform

68
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
for me to discover whatever I want.

69
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And I feel like I've just got started.

70
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So here's to another day at the office.

71
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

72
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Thank you!

73
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Thank you!

2
0:00:15.781,000 --> 0:00:19,000
We most certainly do talk to terrorists, no question about it.

3
0:00:20.616,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We are at war with a new form of terrorism.

4
0:00:26.502,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's sort of the good old, traditional form of terrorism,

5
0:00:30.004,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but it's sort of been packaged for the 21st century.

6
0:00:33.466,000 --> 0:00:37,000
One of the big things about countering terrorism

7
0:00:37.914,000 --> 0:00:4,000
is, how do you perceive it?

8
0:00:41.246,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Because perception leads to your response to it.

9
0:00:44.742,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism,

10
0:00:48.97,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it would be that it's one of criminality, one of war.

11
0:00:52.918,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So how are you going to respond to it?

12
0:00:54.531,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Naturally, it would follow that you meet kind with kind.

13
0:00:58.165,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach,

14
0:01:01.996,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and your perception of terrorism is almost cause-and-effect,

15
0:01:06.252,000 --> 0:01:09,000
then naturally from that, the responses that come out of it

16
0:01:10.215,000 --> 0:01:13,000
are much more asymmetrical.

17
0:01:13.863,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We live in a modern, global world.

18
0:01:17.97,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Terrorists have actually adapted to it.

19
0:01:21.452,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's something we have to, too, and that means the people

20
0:01:25.201,000 --> 0:01:28,000
who are working on counterterrorism responses

21
0:01:28.341,000 --> 0:01:3,000
have to start, in effect, putting on

22
0:01:31.165,000 --> 0:01:35,000
their Google-tinted glasses, or whatever.

23
0:01:35.419,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For my part, what I wanted us to do was just to look at

24
0:01:40.212,000 --> 0:01:43,000
terrorism as though it was a global brand,

25
0:01:43.716,000 --> 0:01:44,000
say, Coca-Cola.

26
0:01:45.345,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Both are fairly bad for your health. (Laughter)

27
0:01:51.362,000 --> 0:01:55,000
If you look at it as a brand in those ways,

28
0:01:55.392,000 --> 0:01:58,000
what you'll come to realize is, it's a pretty flawed product.

29
0:01:58.656,000 --> 0:02:01,000
As we've said, it's pretty bad for your health,

30
0:02:01.749,000 --> 0:02:03,000
it's bad for those who it affects,

31
0:02:03.755,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either.

32
0:02:06.788,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin.

33
0:02:10.404,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You're not really going to get 72 virgins in heaven.

34
0:02:15.396,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's not going to happen, I don't think.

35
0:02:17.866,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And you're not really going to, in the '80s, end capitalism

36
0:02:21.844,000 --> 0:02:23,000
by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense.

37
0:02:24.765,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But what you realize, it's got an Achilles' heel.

38
0:02:28.043,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The brand has an Achilles' heel.

39
0:02:30.796,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We've mentioned the health,

40
0:02:32.563,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but it needs consumers to buy into it.

41
0:02:36.243,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency.

42
0:02:40.323,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They're the people who buy into the brand, support them,

43
0:02:43.024,000 --> 0:02:46,000
facilitate them, and they're the people

44
0:02:46.332,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we've got to reach out to.

45
0:02:48.847,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We've got to attack that brand in front of them.

46
0:02:51.707,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There's two essential ways of doing that, if we carry on this brand theme.

47
0:02:55.96,000 --> 0:02:58,000
One is reducing their market. What I mean is,

48
0:02:59.238,000 --> 0:03:03,000
it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete.

49
0:03:04.014,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We've got to show we're a better product.

50
0:03:06.266,000 --> 0:03:09,000
If I'm trying to show we're a better product,

51
0:03:09.423,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay.

52
0:03:14.354,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need

53
0:03:18.019,000 --> 0:03:21,000
for the product itself. You could be looking there at

54
0:03:21.667,000 --> 0:03:24,000
poverty, injustice, all those sorts of things

55
0:03:25.252,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which feed terrorism.

56
0:03:26.781,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The other thing to do is to knock the product,

57
0:03:30.513,000 --> 0:03:32,000
attack the brand myth, as we've said.

58
0:03:32.708,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You know, there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid.

59
0:03:36.067,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across.

60
0:03:40.763,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We've got to reveal the dangers in the product.

61
0:03:43.857,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Our target audience, it's not just the producers of terrorism,

62
0:03:47.506,000 --> 0:03:48,000
as I've said, the terrorists.

63
0:03:48.707,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It's not just the marketeers of terrorism,

64
0:03:51.094,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which is those who finance, those who facilitate it,

65
0:03:55.901,000 --> 0:03:56,000
but it's the consumers of terrorism.

66
0:03:57.814,000 --> 0:04:,000
We've got to get in to those homelands.

67
0:04:01.048,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength.

68
0:04:04.517,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That's where their consumers come from.

69
0:04:06.869,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And we have to get our messaging in there.

70
0:04:10.781,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So the essentials are, we've got to have interaction

71
0:04:14.63,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in those areas, with the terrorists, the facilitators, etc.

72
0:04:17.973,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We've got to engage, we've got to educate,

73
0:04:21.108,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and we've got to have dialogue.

74
0:04:23.911,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now, staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds,

75
0:04:28.062,000 --> 0:04:31,000
think about delivery mechanisms.

76
0:04:31.314,000 --> 0:04:32,000
How are we going to do these attacks?

77
0:04:32.947,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Well, reducing the market is really one for governments

78
0:04:35.956,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and civil society. We've got to show we're better.

79
0:04:39.474,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We've got to show our values.

80
0:04:43.316,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We've got to practice what we preach.

81
0:04:45.618,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But when it comes to knocking the brand,

82
0:04:47.831,000 --> 0:04:51,000
if the terrorists are Coca-Cola and we're Pepsi,

83
0:04:52.303,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I don't think, being Pepsi, anything we say about Coca-Cola,

84
0:04:56.317,000 --> 0:04:57,000
anyone's going to believe us.

85
0:04:58.199,000 --> 0:05:,000
So we've got to find a different mechanism,

86
0:05:00.524,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across

87
0:05:02.916,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is the victims of terrorism.

88
0:05:05.573,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They are somebody who can actually stand there and say,

89
0:05:08.486,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days.

90
0:05:12.914,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It burnt my hand, whatever." You believe them.

91
0:05:16.36,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You can see their scars. You trust them.

92
0:05:19.003,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But whether it's victims, whether it's governments,

93
0:05:24.268,000 --> 0:05:29,000
NGOs, or even the Queen yesterday, in Northern Ireland,

94
0:05:29.973,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we have to interact and engage with those different

95
0:05:34.075,000 --> 0:05:38,000
layers of terrorism, and, in effect,

96
0:05:38.67,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we do have to have a little dance with the devil.

97
0:05:42.717,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is my favorite part of my speech.

98
0:05:45.7,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point,

99
0:05:48.956,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but — (Laughter) —

100
0:05:52.678,000 --> 0:05:54,000
TED, for health and safety reasons, have told me

101
0:05:55.466,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I've got to do a countdown, so

102
0:05:56.972,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist,

103
0:06:00.27,000 --> 0:06:05,000
sort of a health and safety terrorist, and I — (Laughter) —

104
0:06:05.684,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I've got to count 3, 2, 1, and

105
0:06:08.993,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's a bit alarming, so thinking of what my motto would be,

106
0:06:12.32,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and it would be, "Body parts, not heart attacks."

107
0:06:15.078,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So 3, 2, 1. (Explosion sound)

108
0:06:20.569,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Very good. (Laughter)

109
0:06:25.516,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now, lady in 15J was a suicide bomber amongst us all.

110
0:06:33.325,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We're all victims of terrorism.

111
0:06:35.45,000 --> 0:06:39,000
There's 625 of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life.

112
0:06:40.351,000 --> 0:06:44,000
There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there.

113
0:06:44.426,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The son's dead. The father lives.

114
0:06:46.91,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The father will probably kick himself for years to come

115
0:06:52.831,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid.

116
0:06:57.07,000 --> 0:06:59,000
He's going to take to alcohol, and he's probably

117
0:06:59.083,000 --> 0:07:03,000
going to kill himself in three years. That's the stats.

118
0:07:03.443,000 --> 0:07:06,000
There's a very young, attractive lady over here,

119
0:07:07.187,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and she has something which I think's the worst form

120
0:07:10.215,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of psychological, physical injury I've ever seen

121
0:07:13.011,000 --> 0:07:16,000
out of a suicide bombing: It's human shrapnel.

122
0:07:16.707,000 --> 0:07:18,000
What it means is, when she sat in a restaurant

123
0:07:18.86,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in years to come, 10 years to come, 15 years to come,

124
0:07:21.865,000 --> 0:07:23,000
or she's on the beach, every so often she's going to start

125
0:07:24.347,000 --> 0:07:26,000
rubbing her skin, and out of there will come

126
0:07:27.32,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a piece of that shrapnel.

127
0:07:29.554,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And that is a hard thing for the head to take.

128
0:07:34.786,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There's a lady over there as well who lost her legs

129
0:07:37.714,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in this bombing.

130
0:07:41.226,000 --> 0:07:45,000
She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount

131
0:07:45.31,000 --> 0:07:49,000
of money off our government

132
0:07:49.417,000 --> 0:07:52,000
for looking after what's happened to her.

133
0:07:52.709,000 --> 0:07:54,000
She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best

134
0:07:54.849,000 --> 0:07:56,000
universities. She's going to give up university

135
0:07:57.55,000 --> 0:08:,000
to look after Mum.

136
0:08:01.279,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We're all here, and all of those who watch it

137
0:08:03.811,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are going to be traumatized by this event,

138
0:08:06.45,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but all of you here who are victims are going to learn

139
0:08:09.598,000 --> 0:08:1,000
some hard truths.

140
0:08:11.18,000 --> 0:08:15,000
That is, our society, we sympathize, but after a while,

141
0:08:15.901,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society.

142
0:08:19.789,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We do not look after our victims, and we do not enable them,

143
0:08:23.366,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and what I'm going to try and show is that actually,

144
0:08:26.374,000 --> 0:08:28,000
victims are the best weapon we have

145
0:08:29.158,000 --> 0:08:32,000
against more terrorism.

146
0:08:32.334,000 --> 0:08:36,000
How would the government at the turn of the millennium

147
0:08:36.55,000 --> 0:08:38,000
approach today? Well, we all know.

148
0:08:38.775,000 --> 0:08:4,000
What they'd have done then is an invasion.

149
0:08:41.379,000 --> 0:08:44,000
If the suicide bomber was from Wales,

150
0:08:44.557,000 --> 0:08:46,000
good luck to Wales, I'd say.

151
0:08:46.902,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Knee-jerk legislation, emergency provision legislation --

152
0:08:50.654,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which hits at the very basis of our society, as we all know --

153
0:08:54.353,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it's a mistake.

154
0:08:57.526,000 --> 0:09:,000
We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh,

155
0:09:00.981,000 --> 0:09:04,000
throughout the U.K., for Welsh people.

156
0:09:05.411,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Today's approach, governments have learned from their mistakes.

157
0:09:11.056,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They are looking at what I've started off on,

158
0:09:13.294,000 --> 0:09:16,000
on these more asymmetrical approaches to it,

159
0:09:16.848,000 --> 0:09:18,000
more modernist views, cause and effect.

160
0:09:19.55,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But mistakes of the past are inevitable.

161
0:09:22.327,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's human nature.

162
0:09:23.827,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The fear and the pressure to do something on them

163
0:09:27.563,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes.

164
0:09:29.843,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They're not just going to be smart.

165
0:09:33.488,000 --> 0:09:36,000
There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up

166
0:09:36.802,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the point very beautifully. He said,

167
0:09:39.857,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"The thing is, about the British government, is, is that it's got

168
0:09:41.969,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to be lucky all the time, and we only have to be lucky once."

169
0:09:46.433,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So what we need to do is we have to effect it.

170
0:09:49.673,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We've got to start thinking about being more proactive.

171
0:09:52.429,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons

172
0:09:57.117,000 --> 0:09:58,000
in this war on terrorism.

173
0:09:58.738,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But of course, it's ideas -- is not something that governments do very well.

174
0:10:07.186,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I want to go back just to before the bang, to this idea of

175
0:10:11.365,000 --> 0:10:15,000
brand, and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi, etc.

176
0:10:15.559,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war.

177
0:10:19.47,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They'll see it as freedom fighters and truth

178
0:10:21.491,000 --> 0:10:28,000
against injustice, imperialism, etc.

179
0:10:28.714,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield.

180
0:10:32.705,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It's not just [our] flesh and blood they want.

181
0:10:35.879,000 --> 0:10:37,000
They actually want our cultural souls, and that's why

182
0:10:38.752,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this.

183
0:10:42.763,000 --> 0:10:46,000
If we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially

184
0:10:47.343,000 --> 0:10:51,000
a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere

185
0:10:51.883,000 --> 0:10:53,000
which not many people had heard of.

186
0:10:54.022,000 --> 0:10:58,000
9/11 launched it. It was its big marketing day,

187
0:10:58.186,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and it was packaged for the 21st century. They knew what they were doing.

188
0:11:03.055,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They were effectively [doing] something in this brand image

189
0:11:06.983,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of creating a brand which can be franchised around

190
0:11:10.167,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the world, where there's poverty, ignorance and injustice.

191
0:11:15.827,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We, as I've said, have got to hit that market,

192
0:11:19.89,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but we've got to use our heads rather than our might.

193
0:11:23.349,000 --> 0:11:26,000
If we perceive it in this way as a brand, or other ways of thinking at it like this,

194
0:11:27.123,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we will not resolve or counter terrorism.

195
0:11:31.562,000 --> 0:11:34,000
What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples

196
0:11:34.922,000 --> 0:11:39,000
from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently.

197
0:11:40.353,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The first one has been dubbed "lawfare,"

198
0:11:44.042,000 --> 0:11:46,000
for want of a better word.

199
0:11:46.484,000 --> 0:11:5,000
When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists,

200
0:11:50.684,000 --> 0:11:52,000
everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks

201
0:11:53.05,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it.

202
0:11:56.814,000 --> 0:11:57,000
There's a bomb, people start suing.

203
0:11:58.427,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing.

204
0:12:02.118,000 --> 0:12:05,000
A civil action was brought from 1998.

205
0:12:05.857,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In Omagh, bomb went off, Real IRA,

206
0:12:09.265,000 --> 0:12:11,000
middle of a peace process.

207
0:12:11.48,000 --> 0:12:15,000
That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted

208
0:12:15.623,000 --> 0:12:18,000
for lots of reasons, mostly to do with the peace process

209
0:12:18.871,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and what was going on, the greater good.

210
0:12:21.088,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It also meant, then, if you can imagine this,

211
0:12:23.583,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that the people who bombed your children

212
0:12:25.886,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and your husbands were walking around the supermarket

213
0:12:31.243,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that you lived in.

214
0:12:32.927,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Some of those victims said enough is enough.

215
0:12:36.689,000 --> 0:12:39,000
We brought a private action, and thank God, 10 years later,

216
0:12:40.123,000 --> 0:12:42,000
we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on

217
0:12:42.718,000 --> 0:12:43,000
at the moment so I have to be a bit careful,

218
0:12:44.533,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but I'm fairly confident.

219
0:12:46.65,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Why was it effective?

220
0:12:48.269,000 --> 0:12:5,000
It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done

221
0:12:50.906,000 --> 0:12:51,000
where there was a huge void.

222
0:12:52.645,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups,

223
0:12:57.271,000 --> 0:12:59,000
their whole strength is from the fact that they are

224
0:12:59.35,000 --> 0:13:03,000
an underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog

225
0:13:04.096,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and flipped it, they didn't know what to do.

226
0:13:07.236,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down.

227
0:13:11.487,000 --> 0:13:15,000
The bombs actually stopped -- fact -- because of this action.

228
0:13:15.775,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We became, or those victims became, more importantly,

229
0:13:19.48,000 --> 0:13:22,000
a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization.

230
0:13:23.456,000 --> 0:13:25,000
There's other examples. We have a case called Almog

231
0:13:26.255,000 --> 0:13:3,000
which is to do with a bank that was,

232
0:13:30.447,000 --> 0:13:33,000
allegedly, from our point of view,

233
0:13:33.453,000 --> 0:13:36,000
giving rewards to suicide bombers.

234
0:13:37.368,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Just by bringing the very action,

235
0:13:40.376,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that bank has stopped doing it, and indeed,

236
0:13:42.887,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the powers that be around the world, which for real politic

237
0:13:45.291,000 --> 0:13:48,000
reasons before, couldn't actually deal with this issue,

238
0:13:48.634,000 --> 0:13:49,000
because there was lots of competing interests,

239
0:13:50.164,000 --> 0:13:52,000
have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system.

240
0:13:53.148,000 --> 0:13:55,000
There's another case called the McDonald case,

241
0:13:55.863,000 --> 0:13:59,000
where some victims of Semtex, of the Provisional IRA bombings,

242
0:14:00.185,000 --> 0:14:06,000
which were supplied by Gaddafi, sued,

243
0:14:06.804,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya.

244
0:14:11.741,000 --> 0:14:13,000
New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims,

245
0:14:14.694,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and started taking it -- so it started a whole new dialogue there.

246
0:14:18.326,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But the problem is, we need more and more support

247
0:14:22.609,000 --> 0:14:24,000
for these ideas and cases.

248
0:14:25.411,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Civil affairs and civil society initiatives.

249
0:14:29.837,000 --> 0:14:31,000
A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy.

250
0:14:32.364,000 --> 0:14:33,000
If anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy

251
0:14:34.17,000 --> 0:14:36,000
like a war on terrorism and beat it, you're wrong.

252
0:14:36.796,000 --> 0:14:38,000
What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman.

253
0:14:39.783,000 --> 0:14:41,000
They used to be fisherman, of course,

254
0:14:42.007,000 --> 0:14:45,000
but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste

255
0:14:45.203,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in their water, so what we're trying to do is create

256
0:14:48.498,000 --> 0:14:5,000
security and employment by bringing a coastguard

257
0:14:50.984,000 --> 0:14:53,000
along with the fisheries industry, and I can guarantee you,

258
0:14:54.321,000 --> 0:14:56,000
as that builds, al Shabaab and such likes will not have

259
0:14:57.185,000 --> 0:15:,000
the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people.

260
0:15:01.009,000 --> 0:15:04,000
These initiatives cost less than a missile,

261
0:15:04.884,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and certainly less than any soldier's life,

262
0:15:07.851,000 --> 0:15:09,000
but more importantly, it takes the war to their homelands,

263
0:15:10.706,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and not onto our shore,

264
0:15:13.004,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and we're looking at the causes.

265
0:15:14.448,000 --> 0:15:17,000
The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue.

266
0:15:17.897,000 --> 0:15:19,000
The advantages of dialogue are obvious.

267
0:15:20.703,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It self-educates both sides, enables a better understanding,

268
0:15:25.005,000 --> 0:15:27,000
reveals the strengths and weaknesses,

269
0:15:27.227,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and yes, like some of the speakers before,

270
0:15:29.828,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the shared vulnerability does lead to trust, and

271
0:15:33.717,000 --> 0:15:35,000
it does then become, that process, part of normalization.

272
0:15:36.622,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But it's not an easy road. After the bomb,

273
0:15:41.295,000 --> 0:15:44,000
the victims are not into this.

274
0:15:44.424,000 --> 0:15:45,000
There's practical problems.

275
0:15:46.318,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It's politically risky for the protagonists

276
0:15:49.214,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and for the interlocutors. On one occasion

277
0:15:51.949,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I was doing it, every time I did a point that they didn't like,

278
0:15:54.39,000 --> 0:15:55,000
they actually threw stones at me,

279
0:15:56.251,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and when I did a point they liked,

280
0:15:58.238,000 --> 0:16:02,000
they starting shooting in the air, equally not great. (Laughter)

281
0:16:02.833,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Whatever the point, it gets to the heart of the problem,

282
0:16:06.035,000 --> 0:16:08,000
you're doing it, you're talking to them.

283
0:16:08.151,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Now, I just want to end with saying, if we follow reason,

284
0:16:11.894,000 --> 0:16:16,000
we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to

285
0:16:17.256,000 --> 0:16:19,000
have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure

286
0:16:19.938,000 --> 0:16:22,000
military perception of it.

287
0:16:23.706,000 --> 0:16:25,000
We need to foster more

288
0:16:26.163,000 --> 0:16:28,000
modern and asymmetrical responses to it.

289
0:16:28.948,000 --> 0:16:3,000
This isn't about being soft on terrorism.

290
0:16:31.503,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields.

291
0:16:35.223,000 --> 0:16:37,000
We must foster innovation, as I've said.

292
0:16:38.174,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Governments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors.

293
0:16:42.046,000 --> 0:16:44,000
The private sector has a role.

294
0:16:44.259,000 --> 0:16:46,000
The role we could do right now is going away

295
0:16:46.832,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and looking at how we can support victims around the world

296
0:16:50.557,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to bring initiatives.

297
0:16:52.029,000 --> 0:16:54,000
If I was to leave you with some big questions here which

298
0:16:54.832,000 --> 0:16:57,000
may change one's perception to it, and who knows what

299
0:16:58.307,000 --> 0:17:,000
thoughts and responses will come out of it,

300
0:17:00.686,000 --> 0:17:03,000
but did myself and my terrorist group actually need

301
0:17:04.641,000 --> 0:17:07,000
to blow you up to make our point?

302
0:17:07.877,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We have to ask ourselves these questions, however unpalatable.

303
0:17:12.259,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian

304
0:17:15.393,000 --> 0:17:17,000
struggle somewhere in the world?

305
0:17:18.158,000 --> 0:17:2,000
What if, actually, engagement on poverty and injustice

306
0:17:20.808,000 --> 0:17:22,000
is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do?

307
0:17:23.223,000 --> 0:17:26,000
What if the bombs are just simply wake-up calls for us?

308
0:17:26.328,000 --> 0:17:29,000
What happens if that bomb went off

309
0:17:29.527,000 --> 0:17:32,000
because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place

310
0:17:32.834,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction?

311
0:17:37.513,000 --> 0:17:4,000
What is definitely uncontroversial

312
0:17:40.68,000 --> 0:17:41,000
is that, as I've said, we've got to stop being reactive,

313
0:17:42.487,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and more proactive, and I just want to leave you

314
0:17:46.104,000 --> 0:17:49,000
with one idea, which is that

315
0:17:49.512,000 --> 0:17:52,000
it's a provocative question for you to think about,

316
0:17:52.672,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and the answer will require sympathy with the devil.

317
0:17:56.793,000 --> 0:17:58,000
It's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers

318
0:17:59.51,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and writers: What if society actually needs crisis to change?

319
0:18:04.427,000 --> 0:18:08,000
What if society actually needs terrorism

320
0:18:08.73,000 --> 0:18:09,000
to change and adapt for the better?

321
0:18:10.273,000 --> 0:18:14,000
It's those Bulgakov themes, it's that picture of Jesus

322
0:18:14.824,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane

323
0:18:18.028,000 --> 0:18:2,000
walking into the moonlight.

324
0:18:20.308,000 --> 0:18:22,000
What it would mean is that humans,

325
0:18:23.156,000 --> 0:18:25,000
in order to survive in development,

326
0:18:25.812,000 --> 0:18:27,000
quite Darwinian spirit here,

327
0:18:27.887,000 --> 0:18:31,000
inherently must dance with the devil.

328
0:18:32.217,000 --> 0:18:36,000
A lot of people say that communism was defeated

329
0:18:36.476,000 --> 0:18:39,000
by the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory.

330
0:18:40.47,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Maybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this.

331
0:18:43.306,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Thank you.

332
0:18:45.893,000 --> 0:18:53,000
(Music) (Applause)

333
0:18:54.763,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. (Applause)

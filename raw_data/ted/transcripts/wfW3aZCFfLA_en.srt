1
0:00:12.481,000 --> 0:00:13,000
As a matter of fact,

2
0:00:14.015,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I was trying to think about my career since I left the White House,

3
0:00:17.287,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and the best example I have is a cartoon in The New Yorker a couple of years ago.

4
0:00:21.583,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This little boy is looking up at his father,

5
0:00:23.742,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and he says, "Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president."

6
0:00:27.787,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.477,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Well, I have had a great blessing as a former president,

8
0:00:33.193,000 --> 0:00:35,000
because I have had an access

9
0:00:35.62,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that very few other people in the world have ever had

10
0:00:38.277,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to get to know so many people around this whole universe.

11
0:00:41.923,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Not only am I familiar with the 50 states in the United States,

12
0:00:45.545,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but also my wife and I have visited more than 145 countries in the world,

13
0:00:50.421,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the Carter Center has had full-time programs in 80 nations on Earth.

14
0:00:54.67,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And a lot of times, when we go into a country,

15
0:00:56.866,000 --> 0:00:58,000
we not only the meet the king or the president,

16
0:00:59.076,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but we also meet the villagers who live in the most remote areas of Africa.

17
0:01:03.424,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So our overall commitment at the Carter Center

18
0:01:06.93,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is to promote human rights,

19
0:01:08.927,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and knowing the world as I do, I can tell you without any equivocation

20
0:01:13.639,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that the number one abuse of human rights on Earth

21
0:01:17.53,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is, strangely, not addressed quite often, is the abuse of women and girls.

22
0:01:23.369,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Applause)

23
0:01:26.657,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There are a couple of reasons for this that I'll mention to begin with.

24
0:01:31.89,000 --> 0:01:36,000
First of all is the misinterpretation of religious scriptures, holy scriptures,

25
0:01:37.36,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, Quran and so forth,

26
0:01:40.983,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and these have been misinterpreted by men who are now in the ascendant positions

27
0:01:48.246,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in the synagogues and the churches and in the mosques.

28
0:01:50.875,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And they interpret these rules to make sure that women

29
0:01:54.706,000 --> 0:01:58,000
are ordinarily relegated to a secondary position

30
0:01:58.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
compared to men in the eyes of God.

31
0:02:02.558,000 --> 0:02:06,000
This is a very serious problem. It's ordinarily not addressed.

32
0:02:06.78,000 --> 0:02:08,000
A number of years ago, in the year 2000,

33
0:02:08.891,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I had been a Baptist, a Southern Baptist for 70 years --

34
0:02:12.454,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I tell you, I still teach Sunday school every Sunday;

35
0:02:14.936,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I'll be teaching this Sunday as well --

36
0:02:16.807,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but the Southern Baptist Convention in the year 2000 decided

37
0:02:21.222,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that women should play a secondary position,

38
0:02:23.823,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a subservient position to men.

39
0:02:25.889,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So they issued an edict, in effect,

40
0:02:28.606,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that prevents women from being priests, pastors, deacons in the church,

41
0:02:34.51,000 --> 0:02:36,000
or chaplains in the military,

42
0:02:36.802,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and if a woman teaches a classroom

43
0:02:39.96,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in a Southern Baptist seminary,

44
0:02:42.142,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they cannot teach if a boy is in the room,

45
0:02:45.555,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because you can find verses in the Bible,

46
0:02:47.576,000 --> 0:02:5,000
there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible,

47
0:02:50.6,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that say that a woman shouldn't teach a man, and so forth.

48
0:02:53.41,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But the basic thing is the scriptures are misinterpreted

49
0:02:56.445,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to keep men in an ascendant position.

50
0:02:58.906,000 --> 0:03:,000
That is an all-pervasive problem,

51
0:03:00.996,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because men can exert that power

52
0:03:05.872,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and if an abusive husband or an employer, for instance, wants to cheat women,

53
0:03:11.886,000 --> 0:03:14,000
they can say that if women are not equal in the eyes of God,

54
0:03:15.67,000 --> 0:03:17,000
why should I treat them as equals myself?

55
0:03:17.862,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Why should I pay them equal pay for doing the same kind of work?

56
0:03:22.32,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The other very serious blight

57
0:03:24.247,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that causes this problem is the excessive resort to violence,

58
0:03:28.264,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and that is increasing tremendously around the world.

59
0:03:32.858,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In the United States of America, for instance, we have had

60
0:03:35.787,000 --> 0:03:39,000
an enormous increase in abuse of poor people,

61
0:03:39.967,000 --> 0:03:44,000
mostly black people and minorities, by putting them in prison.

62
0:03:45.261,000 --> 0:03:47,000
When I was in office as governor of Georgia,

63
0:03:47.815,000 --> 0:03:5,000
one out of every 1,000 Americans were in prison.

64
0:03:51.181,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Nowadays, 7.3 people per 1,000 are in prison.

65
0:03:56.29,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That's a sevenfold increase.

66
0:03:58.31,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And since I left the White House,

67
0:03:59.958,000 --> 0:04:02,000
there's been an 800 percent increase in the number of women

68
0:04:03.279,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who are black who are in prison.

69
0:04:05.856,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We also have [one of the only countries] on Earth

70
0:04:08.38,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that still has the death penalty that is a developed country.

71
0:04:12.334,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And we rank right alongside the countries that are most abusive

72
0:04:15.701,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in all elements of human rights in encouraging the death penalty.

73
0:04:19.555,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We're in California now, and I figured out the other day

74
0:04:22.411,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that California has spent four billion dollars

75
0:04:25.406,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in convicting 13 people for the death penalty.

76
0:04:29.818,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If you add that up, that's 307 million dollars it costs California

77
0:04:34.653,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to send a person to be executed.

78
0:04:37.991,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty,

79
0:04:41.474,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because it costs so much. (Applause)

80
0:04:46.861,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people

81
0:04:51.087,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is another cause of the increase in abuse of women.

82
0:04:55.475,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Let me just go down a very few abuses of women that concern me most,

83
0:04:59.979,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I'll be fairly brief, because I have a limited amount of time, as you know.

84
0:05:03.88,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One is genital mutilation.

85
0:05:08.36,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Genital mutilation is horrible and not known by American women,

86
0:05:12.474,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but in some countries, many countries,

87
0:05:16.219,000 --> 0:05:2,000
when a child is born that's a girl, very soon in her life,

88
0:05:20.525,000 --> 0:05:26,000
her genitals are completely cut away by a so-called cutter

89
0:05:27.235,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who has a razor blade and, in a non-sterilized way,

90
0:05:31.227,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they remove the exterior parts of a woman's genitalia.

91
0:05:35.17,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And sometimes, in more extreme cases but not very rare cases,

92
0:05:39.591,000 --> 0:05:42,000
they sew the orifice up so the girl can just urinate or menstruate.

93
0:05:43.405,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And then later, when she gets married, the same cutter goes in

94
0:05:46.784,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and opens the orifice up so she can have sex.

95
0:05:49.4,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is not a rare thing, although it's against the law in most countries.

96
0:05:53.415,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In Egypt, for instance,

97
0:05:55.347,000 --> 0:05:58,000
91 percent of all the females that live in Egypt today

98
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
have been sexually mutilated in that way.

99
0:06:01.56,000 --> 0:06:04,000
In some countries, it's more than 98 percent

100
0:06:04.95,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of the women are cut that way before they reach maturity.

101
0:06:09.246,000 --> 0:06:11,000
This is a horrible affliction

102
0:06:11.846,000 --> 0:06:14,000
on all women that live in those countries.

103
0:06:15.515,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Another very serious thing is honor killings,

104
0:06:19.299,000 --> 0:06:22,000
where a family with misinterpretation, again, of a holy scripture --

105
0:06:22.625,000 --> 0:06:24,000
there's nothing in the Quran that mandates this --

106
0:06:25.313,000 --> 0:06:29,000
will execute a girl in their family

107
0:06:29.5,000 --> 0:06:3,000
if she is raped

108
0:06:31.377,000 --> 0:06:34,000
or if she marries a man that her father does not approve,

109
0:06:35.112,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or sometimes even if she wears inappropriate clothing.

110
0:06:38.223,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And this is done by members of her own family,

111
0:06:41.251,000 --> 0:06:43,000
so the family becomes murderers

112
0:06:43.456,000 --> 0:06:47,000
when the girl brings so-called disgrace to the family.

113
0:06:47.808,000 --> 0:06:5,000
An analysis was done in Egypt not so long ago by the United Nations

114
0:06:51.155,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and it showed that 75 percent of these murders of a girl

115
0:06:55.197,000 --> 0:07:,000
are perpetrated by the father, the uncle or the brother,

116
0:07:00.58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but 25 percent of the murders are conducted by women.

117
0:07:04.032,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Another problem that we have in the world

118
0:07:05.994,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that relates to women particularly is slavery,

119
0:07:08.732,000 --> 0:07:1,000
or human trafficking it's called nowadays.

120
0:07:11.147,000 --> 0:07:15,000
There were about 12.5 million people sold from Africa into slavery

121
0:07:15.565,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in the New World back in the 19th century and the 18th century.

122
0:07:19.784,000 --> 0:07:22,000
There are 30 million people now living in slavery.

123
0:07:23.639,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The United States Department of State now has a mandate from Congress

124
0:07:29.281,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to give a report every year,

125
0:07:31.603,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and the State Department reports that 800,000 people are sold

126
0:07:36.246,000 --> 0:07:39,000
across international borders every year into slavery,

127
0:07:39.893,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and that 80 percent of those sold are women,

128
0:07:42.841,000 --> 0:07:44,000
into sexual slavery.

129
0:07:44.977,000 --> 0:07:46,000
In the United States right this moment,

130
0:07:47.531,000 --> 0:07:5,000
60,000 people are living in human bondage, or slavery.

131
0:07:51.385,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Atlanta, Georgia, where the Carter Center is located

132
0:07:54.171,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and where I teach at Emory University,

133
0:07:56.772,000 --> 0:08:01,000
they have between 200 and 300 women, people sold into slavery every month.

134
0:08:02.672,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's the number one place in the nation because of that.

135
0:08:05.781,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Atlanta has the busiest airport in the world,

136
0:08:07.987,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and they also have a lot of passengers that come from the Southern Hemisphere.

137
0:08:13.234,000 --> 0:08:15,000
If a brothel owner

138
0:08:15.858,000 --> 0:08:18,000
wants to buy a girl that has brown or black skin,

139
0:08:18.877,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they can do it for 1,000 dollars.

140
0:08:21.523,000 --> 0:08:25,000
A white-skinned girl brings several times more than that,

141
0:08:25.61,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the average brothel owner in Atlanta and in the United States now

142
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
can earn about $35,000 per slave.

143
0:08:33.504,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds the total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia.

144
0:08:38.613,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So this is another very serious problem, and the basic problem is prostitution,

145
0:08:43.465,000 --> 0:08:46,000
because there's not a whorehouse in America

146
0:08:47.459,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that's not known by the local officials,

147
0:08:49.688,000 --> 0:08:52,000
the local policemen, or the chief of police or the mayor and so forth.

148
0:08:53.659,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And this leads to one of the worst problems,

149
0:08:56.386,000 --> 0:09:,000
and that is that women are bought increasingly and put into sexual slavery

150
0:09:00.635,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in all countries in the world.

151
0:09:02.586,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Sweden has got a good approach to it.

152
0:09:05.14,000 --> 0:09:08,000
About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden decided to change the law,

153
0:09:08.762,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and women are no longer prosecuted

154
0:09:11.316,000 --> 0:09:13,000
if they are in sexual slavery,

155
0:09:14.1,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but the brothel owners and the pimps and the male customers are prosecuted,

156
0:09:19.675,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and -- (Applause) -- prostitution has gone down.

157
0:09:24.463,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In the United States, we take just the opposite position.

158
0:09:27.477,000 --> 0:09:33,000
For every male arrested for illegal sex trade,

159
0:09:33.664,000 --> 0:09:38,000
25 women are arrested in the United States of America.

160
0:09:39.12,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden,

161
0:09:43.23,000 --> 0:09:46,000
France, and other countries are moving now towards this so-called Swedish model.

162
0:09:47.15,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That's another thing that can be done.

163
0:09:49.309,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We have two great institutions in this country that all of us admire:

164
0:09:52.68,000 --> 0:09:55,000
our military and our great university system.

165
0:09:56.511,000 --> 0:10:,000
In the military, they are now analyzing how many sexual assaults take place.

166
0:10:00.83,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The last report I got, there were 26,000 sexual assaults

167
0:10:05.219,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that took place in the military --

168
0:10:07.564,000 --> 0:10:08,000
26,000.

169
0:10:09.21,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent, are actually prosecuted,

170
0:10:14.42,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and the reason is that the commanding officer of any organization --

171
0:10:18.59,000 --> 0:10:22,000
a ship like my submarine, or a battalion in the Army

172
0:10:22.842,000 --> 0:10:24,000
or a company in the Marines --

173
0:10:24.978,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the commanding officer has the right under law to decide

174
0:10:29.103,000 --> 0:10:31,000
whether to prosecute a rapist or not,

175
0:10:31.688,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and of course, the last thing they want is for anybody to know

176
0:10:34.869,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that under their command, sexual assaults are taking place,

177
0:10:38.306,000 --> 0:10:39,000
so they do not do it.

178
0:10:40.21,000 --> 0:10:42,000
That law needs to be changed.

179
0:10:43.472,000 --> 0:10:46,000
About one out of four girls who enter American universities

180
0:10:46.664,000 --> 0:10:48,000
will be sexually assaulted before she graduates,

181
0:10:49.451,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and this is now getting a lot of publicity,

182
0:10:51.737,000 --> 0:10:53,000
partially because of my book, but other things,

183
0:10:53.943,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and so 89 universities in America are now condemned

184
0:10:58.131,000 --> 0:11:,000
by the Department of Education under Title IX

185
0:11:00.816,000 --> 0:11:04,000
because the officials of the universities are not taking care of the women

186
0:11:05.529,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to protect them from sexual assault.

187
0:11:07.48,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The Department of Justice says that more than half of the rapes

188
0:11:11.148,000 --> 0:11:14,000
on a college campus take place by serial rapists,

189
0:11:14.631,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because outside of the university system,

190
0:11:17.209,000 --> 0:11:2,000
if they rape somebody, they'll be prosecuted,

191
0:11:20.227,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but when they get on a university campus, they can rape with impunity.

192
0:11:24.255,000 --> 0:11:26,000
They're not prosecuted.

193
0:11:26.298,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Those are the kinds of things that go on in our society.

194
0:11:29.642,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Another thing that's very serious about the abuse of women and girls

195
0:11:35.214,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is the lack of equal pay for equal work,

196
0:11:40.207,000 --> 0:11:42,000
as you know. (Applause)

197
0:11:42.296,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And this is sometimes misinterpreted, but for full-time employment,

198
0:11:49.133,000 --> 0:11:52,000
a woman in the United States now gets 23 percent less than a man.

199
0:11:52.48,000 --> 0:11:54,000
When I became president, the difference was 39 percent.

200
0:11:55.369,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So we've made some progress, partially because I was president

201
0:11:59.246,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) --

202
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but in the last 15 years, there's been no progress made,

203
0:12:08.568,000 --> 0:12:1,000
so it's been just about 23 or 24 percent difference

204
0:12:11.424,000 --> 0:12:13,000
for the last 15 years.

205
0:12:13.699,000 --> 0:12:14,000
These are the kind of things that go on.

206
0:12:15.627,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If you take the Fortune 500 companies,

207
0:12:18.71,000 --> 0:12:21,000
23 of them have women CEOs,

208
0:12:21.849,000 --> 0:12:22,000
out of 500,

209
0:12:23.66,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and those CEOs, I need not tell you,

210
0:12:26.795,000 --> 0:12:27,000
make less on an average

211
0:12:28.792,000 --> 0:12:31,000
than the other CEOs.

212
0:12:31.91,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Well, that's what goes on in our country.

213
0:12:34.388,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Another problem with the United States

214
0:12:36.872,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is we are the most warlike nation on Earth.

215
0:12:40.564,000 --> 0:12:44,000
We have been to war with about 25 different countries

216
0:12:44.79,000 --> 0:12:46,000
since the Second World War.

217
0:12:47.251,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Sometimes, we've had soldiers on the ground fighting.

218
0:12:49.782,000 --> 0:12:51,000
The other times, we've been flying overhead

219
0:12:51.802,000 --> 0:12:52,000
dropping bombs on people.

220
0:12:53.775,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Other times, of course, now, we have drones that attack people and so forth.

221
0:12:57.537,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We've been at war with 25 different countries

222
0:13:00.21,000 --> 0:13:02,000
or more since the Second World War.

223
0:13:02.993,000 --> 0:13:04,000
There was four years, I won't say which ones,

224
0:13:05.37,000 --> 0:13:06,000
where we didn't --

225
0:13:06.964,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb, we didn't launch a missile,

226
0:13:12.722,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we didn't fire a bullet.

227
0:13:14.464,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But anyway, those kinds of things, the resort to violence

228
0:13:18.86,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and the misinterpretation of the holy scriptures

229
0:13:21.476,000 --> 0:13:26,000
are what causes, are the basic causes, of abuse of women and girls.

230
0:13:26.77,000 --> 0:13:29,000
There's one more basic cause that I need not mention,

231
0:13:30.369,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and that is that in general, men don't give a damn.

232
0:13:35.71,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Applause) That's true.

233
0:13:38.751,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The average man that might say, I'm against the abuse of women and girls

234
0:13:43.777,000 --> 0:13:47,000
quietly accepts the privileged position that we occupy,

235
0:13:48.13,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and this is very similar to what I knew when I was a child,

236
0:13:51.57,000 --> 0:13:53,000
when separate but equal had existed.

237
0:13:53.797,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Racial discrimination, legally, had existed for 100 years,

238
0:13:59.44,000 --> 0:14:02,000
from 1865 at the end of the War Between the States, the Civil War,

239
0:14:02.573,000 --> 0:14:04,000
all the way up to the 1960s,

240
0:14:05.417,000 --> 0:14:07,000
when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed

241
0:14:08.134,000 --> 0:14:09,000
for equal rights.

242
0:14:10.107,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But during that time, there were many white people

243
0:14:12.847,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that didn't think that racial discrimination was okay,

244
0:14:16.214,000 --> 0:14:18,000
but they stayed quiet,

245
0:14:18.373,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because they enjoyed the privileges of better jobs,

246
0:14:23.507,000 --> 0:14:26,000
unique access to jury duty,

247
0:14:26.918,000 --> 0:14:28,000
better schools, and everything else,

248
0:14:29.169,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and that's the same thing that exists today,

249
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because the average man really doesn't care.

250
0:14:34.975,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Even though they say, "I'm against discrimination against girls and women,"

251
0:14:41.32,000 --> 0:14:44,000
they enjoy a privileged position.

252
0:14:44.77,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And it's very difficult to get the majority of men

253
0:14:47.142,000 --> 0:14:5,000
who control the university system,

254
0:14:50.188,000 --> 0:14:52,000
the majority of men that control the military system,

255
0:14:52.852,000 --> 0:14:55,000
the majority of men that control the governments of the world,

256
0:14:56.35,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and the majority of men that control the great religions.

257
0:15:01.584,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So what is the basic thing that we need to do today?

258
0:15:04.997,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I would say the best thing that we could do today

259
0:15:07.528,000 --> 0:15:11,000
is for the women in the powerful nations

260
0:15:11.84,000 --> 0:15:13,000
like this one, and where you come from,

261
0:15:14.563,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Europe and so forth, who have influence and who have freedom to speak and to act,

262
0:15:19.532,000 --> 0:15:24,000
need to take the responsibility on yourselves

263
0:15:24.558,000 --> 0:15:27,000
to be more forceful in demanding

264
0:15:27.623,000 --> 0:15:31,000
an end to racial discrimination against girls and women

265
0:15:32.265,000 --> 0:15:33,000
all over the world.

266
0:15:33.626,000 --> 0:15:35,000
The average woman in Egypt

267
0:15:36.527,000 --> 0:15:38,000
doesn't have much to say about her daughters

268
0:15:38.693,000 --> 0:15:41,000
getting genitally mutilated and so forth.

269
0:15:42.101,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I didn't even go down to detail about that.

270
0:15:44.175,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But I hope that out of this conference,

271
0:15:46.234,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that every woman here will get your husbands to realize

272
0:15:50.748,000 --> 0:15:54,000
that these abuses on the college campuses and the military and so forth

273
0:15:54.872,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and in the future job market,

274
0:15:57.411,000 --> 0:16:01,000
need to protect your daughters and your granddaughters.

275
0:16:01.86,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I have 12 grandchildren, four children, and 10 great-grandchildren,

276
0:16:07.622,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and I think often about them

277
0:16:09.546,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and about the plight that they will face in America,

278
0:16:12.611,000 --> 0:16:15,000
not only if they lived in Egypt or a foreign country,

279
0:16:16.396,000 --> 0:16:18,000
in having equal rights,

280
0:16:18.602,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and I hope that all of you will join me

281
0:16:20.935,000 --> 0:16:23,000
in being a champion for women and girls around the world

282
0:16:24.662,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and protect their human rights.

283
0:16:26.217,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Thank you very much.

284
0:16:29.189,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Applause)

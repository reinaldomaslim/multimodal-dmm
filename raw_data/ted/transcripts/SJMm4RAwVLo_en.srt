1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I'm intensely grateful for the opportunity to speak to you today.

4
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I'm also rather surprised, because when I look back on my life

5
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion.

6
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
After I left my convent, I'd finished with religion, frankly.

7
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I thought that was it.

8
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor.

9
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly.

10
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes,

11
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
one after the other, and finally found myself in television. (Laughter)

12
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I said that to Bill Moyers, and he said, "Oh, we take anybody." (Laughter)

13
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I was doing some rather controversial religious programs.

14
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular.

15
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream.

16
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity.

17
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions:

18
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Judaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity.

19
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all --

20
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
despite my own intensely religious background,

21
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity,

22
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and I knew nothing about Islam at all.

23
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But in that city, that tortured city,

24
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together,

25
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
you also become aware of the profound connection between them.

26
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back

27
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me

28
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to look at my own faith in a different light.

29
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I found some astonishing things in the course of my study

30
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion,

31
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.

32
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
These doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.

33
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And to my astonishment, when I began seriously studying other traditions,

34
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today --

35
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is only a very recent religious enthusiasm

36
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that surfaced only in the West, in about the 17th century.

37
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.

38
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In the 17th century, it narrowed its focus,

39
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment,

40
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to include -- to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.

41
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."

42
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself."

43
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Indeed, some of the world traditions think very little of religious orthodoxy.

44
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
In the Quran, religious opinion -- religious orthodoxy -- is dismissed as "zanna:"

45
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
self-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other,

46
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. (Laughter)

47
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So if religion is not about believing things, what is it about?

48
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
What I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.

49
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something.

50
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You behave in a committed way,

51
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then you begin to understand the truths of religion.

52
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action;

53
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you only understand them when you put them into practice.

54
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now, pride of place in this practice is given to compassion.

55
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And it is an arresting fact that right across the board,

56
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in every single one of the major world faiths, compassion --

57
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening --

58
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us

59
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
into the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine."

60
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana.

61
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Why? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other,

62
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put

63
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
another person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine.

64
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And in particular, every single one of the major world traditions has highlighted -- has said --

65
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule.

66
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ:

67
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you."

68
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
That, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching

69
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.

70
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And it was -- the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren,"

71
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
human-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself.

72
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And this is absolutely crucial to the monotheisms, too.

73
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
There's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus.

74
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could

75
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg.

76
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Hillel stood on one leg and said, "That which is hateful to you,

77
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary.

78
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Go and study it." (Laughter)

79
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
And "go and study it" was what he meant.

80
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear

81
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule."

82
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which

83
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
led to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people --

84
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate.

85
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Saint Augustine made exactly the same point.

86
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Scripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave

87
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it."

88
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts

89
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life. (Applause)

90
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
But now look at our world. And we are living in a world that is --

91
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
where religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.

92
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Where instead of taking Jesus' words, "Love your enemies.

93
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people,

94
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people,

95
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others,

96
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and this is because of human ego, human greed.

97
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things.

98
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point, I think --

99
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
that you could not and must not confine your compassion

100
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists,

101
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai":

102
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.

103
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another.

104
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And this, again -- this universal outreach -- is getting subdued in the strident use of religion --

105
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains.

106
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who,

107
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion

108
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.

109
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The causes of our present woes are political.

110
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But, make no mistake about it, religion is a kind of fault line,

111
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region, religion can get sucked in

112
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent.

113
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Between 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict.

114
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime,

115
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
now causes riots where people even die.

116
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And it's not surprising that religion, too, has been affected by this violent ethos.

117
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
There's also a great deal, I think, of religious illiteracy around.

118
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
People seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things.

119
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
As though that -- we call religious people often believers,

120
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals

121
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
get pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule.

122
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes -- when I'm speaking to

123
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
congregations about compassion, I sometimes see

124
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because

125
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
a lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter)

126
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now -- but that's not the whole story.

127
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Since September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me

128
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
into public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world,

129
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change.

130
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures,

131
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice.

132
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And especially the young people were coming. And were asking me --

133
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the young people were saying, "What can we do? What can we do to change things?"

134
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And my hosts in Pakistan said, "Look, don't be too polite to us.

135
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."

136
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Because it seems to me that with -- our current situation is so serious

137
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding

138
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.

139
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States,

140
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown --

141
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism,

142
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.

143
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
But people want to be religious, and religion should be made

144
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be --

145
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
because of the Golden Rule.

146
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you":

147
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
an ethos that should now be applied globally.

148
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves.

149
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And these -- whatever our wretched beliefs -- is a religious matter, it's a spiritual matter.

150
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
It's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all.

151
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And as I say, there is a hunger for change out there.

152
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.

153
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th,

154
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
coming together locally to create networks of understanding.

155
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
With the mosque, with the synagogue, saying, "We must start to speak to one another."

156
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other.

157
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I'd -- there's one story I'd just like to mention.

158
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
This comes from "The Iliad." But it tells you what this spirituality should be.

159
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.

160
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
In one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war,

161
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle,

162
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
his beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed -- and killed in single combat

163
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
by one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge,

164
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and he mutilates the body. He kills Hector, he mutilates his body

165
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family,

166
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
which means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost.

167
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man,

168
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
comes into the Greek camp incognito, makes his way to Achilles' tent

169
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
to ask for the body of his son.

170
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And everybody is shocked when the old man takes off his head covering and shows himself.

171
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And Achilles looks at him and thinks of his father. And he starts to weep.

172
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And Priam looks at the man who has murdered so many of his sons,

173
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and he, too, starts to weep. And the sound of their weeping filled the house.

174
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The Greeks believed that weeping together created a bond between people.

175
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And then Achilles takes the body of Hector, he hands it very tenderly to the father,

176
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and the two men look at each other, and see each other as divine.

177
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
That is the ethos found, too, in all the religions.

178
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
It's what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies,

179
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and beginning to appreciate the other.

180
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
It's of great importance that the word for "holy" in Hebrew, applied to God, is "Kadosh": separate, other.

181
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And it is often, perhaps, the very otherness of our enemies which can

182
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
give us intimations of that utterly mysterious transcendence which is God.

183
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And now, here's my wish:

184
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I wish that you would help with the creation,

185
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:38,000
launch and propagation of a Charter for Compassion,

186
0:17:38.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
crafted by a group of inspirational thinkers from

187
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
the three Abrahamic traditions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam,

188
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and based on the fundamental principle of the Golden Rule.

189
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:18:01,000
We need to create a movement among all these people that I meet in my travels --

190
0:18:01.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
you probably meet, too -- who want to join up, in some way,

191
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and reclaim their faith, which they feel, as I say, has been hijacked.

192
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
We need to empower people to remember the compassionate ethos,

193
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and to give guidelines. This Charter would not be a massive document.

194
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
I'd like to see it -- to give guidelines as to how to interpret the Scriptures,

195
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
these texts that are being abused. Remember what the rabbis and what Augustine

196
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
said about how Scripture should be governed by the principle of charity.

197
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Let's get back to that. And the idea, too, of Jews, Christians and Muslims --

198
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to

199
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least,

200
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world.

201
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
And you are the people. I'm just a solitary scholar.

202
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Despite the idea that I love a good time, which I was rather amazed to see coming up on me

203
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
-- I actually spend a great deal of time alone, studying, and I'm not very --

204
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody,

205
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
everybody on the planet. I've had some preliminary talks,

206
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, for example,

207
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
is very happy to give his name to this, as is Imam Feisal Rauf, the Imam in New York City.

208
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:47,000
Also, I would be working with the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations.

209
0:19:47.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
I was part of that United Nations initiative called the Alliance of Civilizations,

210
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
which was asked by Kofi Annan to diagnose the causes of extremism,

211
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
and to give practical guidelines to member states about how to avoid the escalation of further extremism.

212
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
And the Alliance has told me that they are very happy to work with it.

213
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:2,000
The importance of this is that this is -- I can see some of you starting to look worried,

214
0:20:20.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
because you think it's a slow and cumbersome body --

215
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
but what the United Nations can do is give us some neutrality,

216
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
so that this isn't seen as a Western or a Christian initiative, but that it's coming,

217
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
as it were, from the United Nations, from the world --

218
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this.

219
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:47,000
And so I do urge you to join me in making -- in this charter --

220
0:20:47.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
to building this charter, launching it and propagating it so that it becomes --

221
0:20:55.16,000 --> 0:21:04,000
I'd like to see it in every college, every church, every mosque, every synagogue in the world,

222
0:21:04.16,000 --> 0:21:13,000
so that people can look at their tradition, reclaim it, and make religion a source of peace in the world,

223
0:21:13.16,000 --> 0:21:18,000
which it can and should be. Thank you very much. (Applause)

1
0:00:13.08,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"Listen.

2
0:00:14.6,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Do you hear that?"

3
0:00:16.56,000 --> 0:00:17,000
my grandmother asked me.

4
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"Listen.

5
0:00:20.56,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Listen to what the beetle is saying."

6
0:00:24.56,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I would spend hours and hours listening to the little beetle

7
0:00:29.32,000 --> 0:00:31,000
rolling a huge ball of dung,

8
0:00:31.84,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and while at it,

9
0:00:33.4,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I heard a variety of environmental sounds.

10
0:00:36.92,000 --> 0:00:41,000
With the keenest of ears, I would hear family chatter,

11
0:00:41.96,000 --> 0:00:42,000
laughter,

12
0:00:43.4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
the wind howling

13
0:00:44.96,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and even crickets chirping.

14
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
All these sounds crisscrossed into each other,

15
0:00:50.84,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I would hear rhythm in between.

16
0:00:53.24,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Then I would beat my plate with a spoon and my chest with my tiny hands

17
0:00:59.04,000 --> 0:01:01,000
trying to recreate what I was hearing.

18
0:01:01.8,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I have been beating the same plates,

19
0:01:04.52,000 --> 0:01:08,000
shakers, drums, pans and so much more ever since

20
0:01:09.48,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to become a professional drummer

21
0:01:11.84,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and percussionist.

22
0:01:13.4,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Applause)

23
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:19,000
As I grew up, subconsciously,

24
0:01:20.92,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I felt a strong urge to hide my newfound hobby.

25
0:01:25.24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Even without it being said out loud,

26
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I knew that somehow it was wrong to do what I was doing.

27
0:01:32.68,000 --> 0:01:33,000
In most of the ceremonies,

28
0:01:34.56,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I noticed that most of the women and girls were not in sight,

29
0:01:38.68,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but when they were,

30
0:01:40.24,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I noticed that they would wear their dancing skirts

31
0:01:42.8,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and shake their waists off,

32
0:01:45.24,000 --> 0:01:47,000
singing, clapping, ululating,

33
0:01:48.04,000 --> 0:01:51,000
while the men filled up the rhythm section.

34
0:01:52.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
A few years later, I came to understand

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
what tradition and culture meant,

36
0:01:58.08,000 --> 0:02:,000
and what was considered taboo

37
0:02:00.28,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or otherwise.

38
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In the majority of African cultures,

39
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:08,000
women have been forbidden to play drums and percussion

40
0:02:08.8,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for a very long time.

41
0:02:11.36,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I believe this taboo stems from the psychological and traditional belief

42
0:02:17.28,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that the woman is an inferior being.

43
0:02:20.639,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I grew up hearing that the place of the woman is in the kitchen

44
0:02:24.76,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or in the other room.

45
0:02:28.28,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Mhm?

46
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:32.11,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Women had been brainwashed and led on for so long

48
0:02:35.8,000 --> 0:02:39,000
until we had fallen victim and actually started believing in this ourselves.

49
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This, coupled with the lack of interest to educate women,

50
0:02:45.2,000 --> 0:02:46,000
played a major, major role

51
0:02:47.12,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in etching this into our minds.

52
0:02:50.08,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The sounds of the drum provoke emotion and movement.

53
0:02:53.2,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Essentially, the drum is a very sensual instrument.

54
0:02:57.76,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Once at a festival, a man asked me

55
0:02:59.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
how I dared put a drum in between my legs.

56
0:03:03.76,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I have been considered loose and dirty for playing an instrument.

57
0:03:09.24,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I have repeatedly been questioned

58
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
why I would choose to play drums

59
0:03:14.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
instead of practicing journalism,

60
0:03:16.52,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which I studied for my undergraduate,

61
0:03:19.44,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which has been termed "more decent."

62
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The sight of a woman playing drums enfeebles her,

63
0:03:27.64,000 --> 0:03:28,000
makes her less feminine,

64
0:03:30.32,000 --> 0:03:31,000
less desirable,

65
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but all this optimally puts her on a lower social stand.

66
0:03:38.36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Drumming has essentially represented the strong African heritage,

67
0:03:42.44,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and its importance can be seen

68
0:03:43.92,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in the many aspects of the African tradition.

69
0:03:46.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Many communities encompass drumming in their day-to-day activities,

70
0:03:51.24,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and still do up to date,

71
0:03:53.2,000 --> 0:03:57,000
from childbirths to initiation ceremonies,

72
0:03:57.32,000 --> 0:03:58,000
welcoming ceremonies,

73
0:03:59.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
marriages and even burials.

74
0:04:03.4,000 --> 0:04:05,000
However, this same drum

75
0:04:06.04,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is disappearing very fast from the music scene,

76
0:04:09.56,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and the traditional genre is losing its popularity

77
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:13,000
very quickly amongst the people.

78
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Inspired by the need to preserve this culture,

79
0:04:18.36,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I am teaching the significance and the importance of the drum

80
0:04:21.88,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to young boys, women and girls.

81
0:04:25.52,000 --> 0:04:26,000
In my journey as a percussion teacher,

82
0:04:27.48,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I have realized that very many women

83
0:04:30.56,000 --> 0:04:32,000
actually want to play the drum,

84
0:04:32.839,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but at the same time,

85
0:04:34.76,000 --> 0:04:35,000
they fear it.

86
0:04:36.36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Some fear how society will perceive them.

87
0:04:39.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Others fear the physical pain that comes with playing.

88
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Oh yes, it's not that easy.

89
0:04:46.76,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Some, because their spouses don't approve of them,

90
0:04:50.52,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and others generally fear the responsibility

91
0:04:53.08,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of being a bearer of culture.

92
0:04:56.32,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I believe, or I think that all these fears

93
0:04:59.48,000 --> 0:05:01,000
are etched in the collective feminine cautiousness

94
0:05:02.32,000 --> 0:05:06,000
because when we learn of the atrocities that have happened to women,

95
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
continentally especially,

96
0:05:09.52,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it serves as a constant reminder

97
0:05:11.28,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that one step out of our designated place

98
0:05:15.52,000 --> 0:05:17,000
may end up in very serious consequences.

99
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Well, I use my drum to tell my story and my people's stories.

100
0:05:28.48,000 --> 0:05:31,000
My roots shaped me and my culture is here to stay with me.

101
0:05:32.6,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Women can be custodians of culture, too.

102
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We are born to bring forth life,

103
0:05:38.48,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to nurture it.

104
0:05:40.08,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We can definitely preserve our traditions very, very excellently.

105
0:05:45.28,000 --> 0:05:46,000
My drum and I,

106
0:05:47.72,000 --> 0:05:48,000
we are here to stay.

107
0:05:49.68,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Applause)

108
0:05:54.36,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We are definitely here to stay.

109
0:05:58.68,000 --> 0:06:,000
If women have led countries,

110
0:06:01.32,000 --> 0:06:03,000
women have gone to space,

111
0:06:03.68,000 --> 0:06:05,000
women have won Grammys,

112
0:06:05.92,000 --> 0:06:08,000
then the same, same women can play the drum

113
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and play it -- to a five-star rating?

114
0:06:12.2,000 --> 0:06:15,000
No, to a million-star rating.

115
0:06:15.48,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Thank you.

116
0:06:16.72,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Applause)

117
0:06:29.2,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Chiming)

118
0:06:35.32,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Metallic drumming)

119
0:06:55.24,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Chiming)

120
0:07:03.2,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Rattling)

121
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Drumming)

122
0:12:23.56,000 --> 0:12:27,000
(Applause)

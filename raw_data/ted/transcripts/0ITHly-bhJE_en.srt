2
0:00:12.302,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I wanted to just start by asking everyone a question:

3
0:00:15.137,000 --> 0:00:17,000
How many of you are completely comfortable

4
0:00:17.207,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with calling yourselves a leader?

5
0:00:20.294,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I've asked that question all across the country,

6
0:00:22.582,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and everywhere I ask it, no matter where,

7
0:00:24.583,000 --> 0:00:27,000
there's a huge portion of the audience that won't put up their hand.

8
0:00:28.14,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I've come to realize that we have made leadership

9
0:00:30.66,000 --> 0:00:32,000
into something bigger than us; something beyond us.

10
0:00:33.094,000 --> 0:00:34,000
We've made it about changing the world.

11
0:00:34.991,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We've taken this title of "leader"

12
0:00:36.65,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and treat it as something that one day we're going to deserve.

13
0:00:39.602,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But to give it to ourselves right now

14
0:00:41.413,000 --> 0:00:44,000
means a level of arrogance or cockiness that we're not comfortable with.

15
0:00:44.872,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I worry sometimes that we spend so much time

16
0:00:47.419,000 --> 0:00:49,000
celebrating amazing things that hardly anybody can do,

17
0:00:50.276,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that we've convinced ourselves those are the only things worth celebrating.

18
0:00:53.85,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We start to devalue the things we can do every day,

19
0:00:56.281,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We take moments where we truly are a leader

20
0:00:58.461,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and we don't let ourselves take credit for it, or feel good about it.

21
0:01:01.992,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I've been lucky enough over the last 10 years

22
0:01:04.117,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to work with amazing people who've helped me redefine leadership

23
0:01:07.172,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in a way that I think has made me happier.

24
0:01:09.22,000 --> 0:01:1,000
With my short time today,

25
0:01:10.458,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible

26
0:01:14.153,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for that redefinition.

27
0:01:15.34,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I went to a little school

28
0:01:17.333,000 --> 0:01:19,000
called Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick.

29
0:01:20.171,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And on my last day there, a girl came up to me and said,

30
0:01:22.854,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"I remember the first time I met you."

31
0:01:25.02,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And she told me a story that had happened four years earlier.

32
0:01:28.17,000 --> 0:01:3,000
She said, "On the day before I started university,

33
0:01:30.529,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I was in the hotel room with my mom and dad,

34
0:01:32.617,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I was so scared and so convinced that I couldn't do this,

35
0:01:35.511,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that I wasn't ready for university, that I just burst into tears.

36
0:01:38.595,000 --> 0:01:39,000
My mom and dad were amazing.

37
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They were like, "We know you're scared, but let's just go tomorrow,

38
0:01:43.146,000 --> 0:01:46,000
go to the first day, and if at any point you feel as if you can't do this,

39
0:01:46.655,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that's fine; tell us, and we'll take you home.

40
0:01:48.838,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We love you no matter what.'"

41
0:01:50.259,000 --> 0:01:51,000
She says, "So I went the next day.

42
0:01:51.91,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I was in line for registration,

43
0:01:53.418,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and I looked around and just knew I couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.

44
0:01:56.746,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I knew I had to quit.

45
0:01:57.921,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I made that decision and as soon as I made it,

46
0:02:00.096,000 --> 0:02:02,000
an incredible feeling of peace came over me.

47
0:02:02.192,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I turned to my mom and dad to tell them we needed to go home,

48
0:02:05.294,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and at that moment, you came out of the student union building

49
0:02:08.231,000 --> 0:02:1,000
wearing the stupidest hat I've ever seen in my life."

50
0:02:10.746,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:11.771,000 --> 0:02:12,000
"It was awesome.

52
0:02:13.046,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And you had a big sign promoting Shinerama," --

53
0:02:15.275,000 --> 0:02:17,000
which is Students Fighting Cystic Fibrosis,

54
0:02:17.328,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a charity I've worked with for years --

55
0:02:19.217,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.

56
0:02:21.061,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You were handing the lollipops out to people in line,

57
0:02:23.588,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and talking about Shinerama.

58
0:02:24.955,000 --> 0:02:27,000
All of the sudden, you got to me, and you just stopped.

59
0:02:28.121,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And you stared. It was creepy."

60
0:02:30.286,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:31.761,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This girl knows what I'm talking about.

62
0:02:33.716,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:34.742,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"Then you looked at the guy next to me, smiled, reached into your bucket,

64
0:02:38.398,000 --> 0:02:4,000
pulled out a lollipop, held it out to him and said,

65
0:02:40.878,000 --> 0:02:43,000
'You need to give a lollipop to the beautiful woman next to you.'"

66
0:02:44.044,000 --> 0:02:47,000
She said, "I've never seen anyone get more embarrassed faster in my life.

67
0:02:48.008,000 --> 0:02:5,000
He turned beet red, he wouldn't even look at me.

68
0:02:50.282,000 --> 0:02:52,000
He just kind of held the lollipop out like this."

69
0:02:52.651,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

70
0:02:53.976,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"I felt so bad for this dude that I took the lollipop.

71
0:02:56.573,000 --> 0:02:59,000
As soon as I did, you got this incredibly severe look on your face,

72
0:02:59.788,000 --> 0:03:02,000
looked at my mom and dad and said, 'Look at that! Look at that!

73
0:03:03.096,000 --> 0:03:04,000
First day away from home,

74
0:03:04.518,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and already she's taking candy from a stranger?'"

75
0:03:07.049,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:09.216,000 --> 0:03:1,000
She said, "Everybody lost it.

77
0:03:10.641,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Twenty feet in every direction, everyone started to howl.

78
0:03:13.348,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I know this is cheesy, and I don't know why I'm telling you this,

79
0:03:16.487,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but in that moment when everyone was laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.

80
0:03:19.933,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I knew I was where I was supposed to be; I knew I was home.

81
0:03:22.789,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And I haven't spoken to you once in the four years since that day.

82
0:03:26.146,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But I heard that you were leaving, and I had to come and tell you

83
0:03:29.252,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you've been an incredibly important person in my life.

84
0:03:31.853,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I'm going to miss you. Good luck."

85
0:03:33.676,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And she walks away, and I'm flattened.

86
0:03:35.75,000 --> 0:03:37,000
She gets six feet away, turns around, smiles and goes,

87
0:03:38.355,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"You should probably know this, too:

88
0:03:40.122,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I'm still dating that guy, four years later."

89
0:03:42.329,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

90
0:03:43.498,000 --> 0:03:45,000
A year and a half after I moved to Toronto,

91
0:03:46.004,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I got an invitation to their wedding.

92
0:03:47.905,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

93
0:03:48.936,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Here's the kicker: I don't remember that.

94
0:03:51.96,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I have no recollection of that moment.

95
0:03:53.869,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I've searched my memory banks,

96
0:03:55.339,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because that is funny and I should remember doing it and I don't.

97
0:03:58.534,000 --> 0:04:,000
That was such an eye-opening, transformative moment for me,

98
0:04:01.341,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to think that maybe the biggest impact I'd ever had on anyone's life,

99
0:04:04.658,000 --> 0:04:07,000
a moment that had a woman walk up to a stranger four years later and say,

100
0:04:08.171,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"You've been an important person in my life,"

101
0:04:10.351,000 --> 0:04:12,000
was a moment that I didn't even remember.

102
0:04:12.401,000 --> 0:04:14,000
How many of you guys have a lollipop moment,

103
0:04:14.484,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a moment where someone said or did something

104
0:04:16.578,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that you feel fundamentally made your life better?

105
0:04:19.09,000 --> 0:04:21,000
All right. How many of you have told that person they did it?

106
0:04:22.493,000 --> 0:04:23,000
See, why not?

107
0:04:23.668,000 --> 0:04:24,000
We celebrate birthdays,

108
0:04:24.843,000 --> 0:04:26,000
where all you have to do is not die for 365 days --

109
0:04:27.538,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

110
0:04:28.719,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Yet we let people who have made our lives better

111
0:04:31.032,000 --> 0:04:32,000
walk around without knowing it.

112
0:04:32.54,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Every single one of you has been the catalyst

113
0:04:35.079,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for a lollipop moment.

114
0:04:36.254,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You've made someone's life better by something you said or did.

115
0:04:39.295,000 --> 0:04:4,000
If you think you haven't,

116
0:04:40.514,000 --> 0:04:42,000
think of all the hands that didn't go up when I asked.

117
0:04:43.07,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You're just one of the people who hasn't been told.

118
0:04:45.483,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's scary to think of ourselves as that powerful,

119
0:04:47.843,000 --> 0:04:49,000
frightening to think we can matter that much to other people.

120
0:04:50.755,000 --> 0:04:52,000
As long as we make leadership something bigger than us,

121
0:04:53.446,000 --> 0:04:54,000
as long as we keep leadership beyond us

122
0:04:55.386,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and make it about changing the world,

123
0:04:57.182,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we give ourselves an excuse not to expect it every day,

124
0:04:59.793,000 --> 0:05:,000
from ourselves and from each other.

125
0:05:01.726,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate.

126
0:05:05.333,000 --> 0:05:07,000
[It] is that we are powerful beyond measure.

127
0:05:07.424,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It is our light and not our darkness that frightens us."

128
0:05:10.101,000 --> 0:05:13,000
My call to action today is that we need to get over our fear

129
0:05:13.317,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of how extraordinarily powerful we can be in each other's lives.

130
0:05:16.343,000 --> 0:05:18,000
We need to get over it so we can move beyond it,

131
0:05:18.621,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and our little brothers and sisters and one day our kids --

132
0:05:21.415,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value

133
0:05:23.922,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the impact we can have on each other's lives,

134
0:05:26.096,000 --> 0:05:28,000
more than money and power and titles and influence.

135
0:05:28.706,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We need to redefine leadership as being about lollipop moments --

136
0:05:31.872,000 --> 0:05:33,000
how many of them we create, how many we acknowledge,

137
0:05:34.426,000 --> 0:05:37,000
how many of them we pay forward and how many we say thank you for.

138
0:05:37.637,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Because we've made leadership about changing the world,

139
0:05:40.281,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and there is no world.

140
0:05:41.465,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There's only six billion understandings of it.

141
0:05:43.648,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And if you change one person's understanding of it,

142
0:05:46.087,000 --> 0:05:48,000
understanding of what they're capable of,

143
0:05:48.14,000 --> 0:05:5,000
understanding of how much people care about them,

144
0:05:50.473,000 --> 0:05:52,000
understanding of how powerful an agent for change

145
0:05:53.099,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they can be in this world,

146
0:05:54.497,000 --> 0:05:55,000
you've changed the whole thing.

147
0:05:56.016,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And if we can understand leadership like that,

148
0:05:58.563,000 --> 0:06:,000
I think if we can redefine leadership like that,

149
0:06:01.098,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I think we can change everything.

150
0:06:02.971,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And it's a simple idea, but I don't think it's a small one.

151
0:06:05.765,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I want to thank you so much for letting me share it with you today.

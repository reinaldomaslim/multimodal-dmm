1
0:00:12.778,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Ever since I can remember,

2
0:00:14.698,000 --> 0:00:18,000
African elephants have filled me with a sense of complete awe.

3
0:00:19.532,000 --> 0:00:22,000
They are the largest land mammal alive today on planet Earth,

4
0:00:23.093,000 --> 0:00:25,000
weighing up to seven tons,

5
0:00:25.276,000 --> 0:00:28,000
standing three and a half meters tall at the shoulder.

6
0:00:28.538,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They can eat up to 400 kilos of food in a day,

7
0:00:32.006,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and they disperse vital plant seeds across thousands of kilometers

8
0:00:36.569,000 --> 0:00:38,000
during their 50-to-60-year life span.

9
0:00:39.53,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Central to their compassionate and complex society are the matriarchs.

10
0:00:44.252,000 --> 0:00:47,000
These female, strong leaders nurture the young

11
0:00:47.625,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and navigate their way through the challenges of the African bush

12
0:00:50.712,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to find food, water and security.

13
0:00:53.554,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Their societies are so complex,

14
0:00:55.419,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we're yet to still fully tease apart

15
0:00:57.745,000 --> 0:00:59,000
how they communicate, how they verbalize to each other,

16
0:01:00.356,000 --> 0:01:01,000
how their dialects work.

17
0:01:02.006,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And we don't really understand yet how they navigate the landscape,

18
0:01:06.101,000 --> 0:01:08,000
remembering the safest places to cross a river.

19
0:01:09.728,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I'm pretty sure that like me,

20
0:01:11.51,000 --> 0:01:14,000
most of you in this room have a similar positive emotional response

21
0:01:15.268,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to these most magnificent of all animals.

22
0:01:18.117,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's really hard not to have watched a documentary,

23
0:01:20.561,000 --> 0:01:21,000
learned about their intelligence

24
0:01:22.118,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or, if you've been lucky, to see them for yourselves

25
0:01:24.768,000 --> 0:01:25,000
on safari in the wild.

26
0:01:27.085,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But I wonder how many of you

27
0:01:28.553,000 --> 0:01:32,000
have been truly, utterly terrified by them.

28
0:01:34.482,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I was lucky to be brought up in Southern Africa

29
0:01:36.768,000 --> 0:01:37,000
by two teacher parents

30
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
who had long holidays but very short budgets.

31
0:01:41.898,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And so we used to take our old Ford Cortina Estate,

32
0:01:45.342,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and with my sister, we'd pile in the back,

33
0:01:47.398,000 --> 0:01:49,000
take our tents and go camping in the different game reserves

34
0:01:50.239,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in Southern Africa.

35
0:01:51.525,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It really was heaven for a young, budding zoologist like myself.

36
0:01:55.398,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But I remember even at that young age

37
0:01:57.771,000 --> 0:02:,000
that I found the tall electric fences blocking off the game parks

38
0:02:01.453,000 --> 0:02:02,000
quite divisive.

39
0:02:03.077,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Sure, they were keeping elephants out of the communities,

40
0:02:05.776,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but they also kept communities out of their wild spaces.

41
0:02:10.236,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It really was quite a challenge to me at that young age.

42
0:02:14.133,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It was only when I moved to Kenya at the age of 14,

43
0:02:17.379,000 --> 0:02:21,000
when I got to connect to the vast, wild open spaces of East Africa.

44
0:02:22.125,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And it is here now that I feel truly, instinctively,

45
0:02:25.903,000 --> 0:02:26,000
really at home.

46
0:02:27.902,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I spent many, many happy years studying elephant behavior in a tent,

47
0:02:31.609,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in Samburu National Reserve,

48
0:02:33.639,000 --> 0:02:37,000
under the guideship of professor Fritz Vollrath and Iain Douglas-Hamilton,

49
0:02:37.9,000 --> 0:02:41,000
studying for my PhD and understanding the complexities of elephant societies.

50
0:02:43.791,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But now, in my role as head of the human-elephant coexistence program

51
0:02:47.753,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for Save the Elephants,

52
0:02:49.102,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we're seeing so much change happening so fast

53
0:02:53.242,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that it's urged a change in some of our research programs.

54
0:02:57.464,000 --> 0:03:,000
No longer can we just sit and understand elephant societies

55
0:03:00.98,000 --> 0:03:02,000
or study just how to stop the ivory trade,

56
0:03:03.806,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which is horrific and still ongoing.

57
0:03:06.268,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We're having to change our resources more and more

58
0:03:09.046,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to look at this rising problem of human-elephant conflict,

59
0:03:13.212,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as people and pachyderms compete for space and resources.

60
0:03:17.536,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It was only as recently as the 1970s

61
0:03:19.609,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that we used to have 1.2 million elephants roaming across Africa.

62
0:03:23.926,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Today, we're edging closer to only having 400,000 left.

63
0:03:29.093,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And at the same time period, the human population has quadrupled,

64
0:03:33.387,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and the land is being fragmented at such a pace

65
0:03:35.728,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that it's really hard to keep up with.

66
0:03:38.673,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Too often, these migrating elephants end up stuck inside communities,

67
0:03:42.379,000 --> 0:03:43,000
looking for food and water

68
0:03:43.697,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but ending up breaking open water tanks,

69
0:03:46.276,000 --> 0:03:47,000
breaking pipes

70
0:03:47.457,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and, of course, breaking into food stores for food.

71
0:03:50.411,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It's really a huge challenge.

72
0:03:52.968,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Can you imagine the terror

73
0:03:54.515,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of an elephant literally ripping the roof off your mud hut

74
0:03:58.132,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in the middle of the night

75
0:03:59.452,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and having to hold your children away

76
0:04:01.54,000 --> 0:04:05,000
as the trunk reaches in, looking for food in the pitch dark?

77
0:04:06.585,000 --> 0:04:08,000
These elephants also trample and eat crops,

78
0:04:09.339,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and this is traditionally eroding away

79
0:04:11.629,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that tolerance that people used to have for elephants.

80
0:04:15.046,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And sadly, we're losing these animals by the day

81
0:04:18.871,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and, in some countries, by the hour --

82
0:04:21.879,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to not only ivory poaching

83
0:04:23.284,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but this rapid rise in human-elephant conflict

84
0:04:25.919,000 --> 0:04:27,000
as they compete for space and resources.

85
0:04:28.95,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's a massive challenge.

86
0:04:30.18,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I mean, how do you keep seven-ton pachyderms,

87
0:04:33.165,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that often come in groups of 10 or 12,

88
0:04:35.266,000 --> 0:04:37,000
out of these very small rural farms

89
0:04:37.744,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when you're dealing with people

90
0:04:39.276,000 --> 0:04:42,000
who are living on the very edge of poverty?

91
0:04:42.395,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They don't have big budgets.

92
0:04:43.82,000 --> 0:04:45,000
How do you resolve this issue?

93
0:04:47.157,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Well, one issue is, you can just start to build electric fences,

94
0:04:50.784,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and this is happening across Africa,

95
0:04:52.546,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we're seeing this more and more.

96
0:04:54.18,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But they are dividing up areas and blocking corridors.

97
0:04:57.846,000 --> 0:05:,000
And I'm telling you, these elephants don't think much of it either,

98
0:05:01.275,000 --> 0:05:03,000
particularly if they're blocking a really special water hole

99
0:05:04.188,000 --> 0:05:05,000
where they need water,

100
0:05:05.395,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or if there's a very attractive female on the other side.

101
0:05:08.127,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It doesn't take long to knock down one of these poles.

102
0:05:10.682,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And as soon as there's a gap in the fence,

103
0:05:12.762,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they go back, talk to their mates

104
0:05:14.452,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and suddenly they're all through,

105
0:05:16.359,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and now you have 12 elephants on the community side of the fence.

106
0:05:19.881,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And now you're really in trouble.

107
0:05:22.056,000 --> 0:05:25,000
People keep trying to come up with new designs for electric fences.

108
0:05:26.421,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Well, these elephants don't think much of those either.

109
0:05:29.761,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:34.296,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So rather than having these hard-line, straight, electric,

111
0:05:39.463,000 --> 0:05:42,000
really divisive migratory-blocking fences,

112
0:05:43.148,000 --> 0:05:45,000
there must be other ways to look at this challenge.

113
0:05:45.781,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I'm much more interested in holistic and natural methods

114
0:05:48.64,000 --> 0:05:5,000
to keep elephants and people apart where necessary.

115
0:05:52.18,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Simply talking to people,

116
0:05:53.847,000 --> 0:05:55,000
talking to rural pastoralists in northern Kenya

117
0:05:56.133,000 --> 0:05:58,000
who have so much knowledge about the bush,

118
0:05:58.704,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we discovered this story that they had that elephants would not feed on trees

119
0:06:02.704,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that had wild beehives in them.

120
0:06:04.594,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now this was an interesting story.

121
0:06:06.635,000 --> 0:06:08,000
As the elephants were foraging on the tree,

122
0:06:08.667,000 --> 0:06:11,000
they would break branches and perhaps break open a wild beehive.

123
0:06:12.294,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And those bees would fly out of their natural nests

124
0:06:15.675,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and sting the elephants.

125
0:06:17.371,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now if the elephants got stung,

126
0:06:18.982,000 --> 0:06:2,000
perhaps they would remember that this tree was dangerous

127
0:06:21.649,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and they wouldn't come back to that same site.

128
0:06:23.863,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It seems impossible that they could be stung through their thick skin --

129
0:06:27.34,000 --> 0:06:29,000
elephant skin is around two centimeters thick.

130
0:06:29.73,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But it seems that they sting them around the watery areas,

131
0:06:32.518,000 --> 0:06:35,000
around the eyes, behind the ears, in the mouth, up the trunk.

132
0:06:36.946,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You can imagine they would remember that very quickly.

133
0:06:40.207,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And it's not really one sting that they're scared of.

134
0:06:43.097,000 --> 0:06:45,000
African bees have a phenomenal ability:

135
0:06:46.089,000 --> 0:06:48,000
when they sting in one site, they release a pheromone

136
0:06:48.888,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that triggers the rest of the bees to come and sting the same site.

137
0:06:52.127,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So it's not one beesting that they're scared of --

138
0:06:54.492,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it's perhaps thousands of beestings,

139
0:06:56.388,000 --> 0:06:59,000
coming to sting in the same area -- that they're afraid of.

140
0:06:59.961,000 --> 0:07:,000
And of course, a good matriarch

141
0:07:01.62,000 --> 0:07:03,000
would always keep her young away from such a threat.

142
0:07:04.572,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Young calves have much thinner skins,

143
0:07:06.533,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and it's potential that they could be stung

144
0:07:08.596,000 --> 0:07:09,000
through their thinner skins.

145
0:07:10.95,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So for my PhD, I had this unusual challenge

146
0:07:14.466,000 --> 0:07:15,000
of trying to work out

147
0:07:15.872,000 --> 0:07:18,000
how African elephants and African bees would interact,

148
0:07:19.843,000 --> 0:07:21,000
when the theory was that they wouldn't interact at all.

149
0:07:22.74,000 --> 0:07:24,000
How was I going to study this?

150
0:07:24.796,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Well, what I did was I took the sound of disturbed African honey bees,

151
0:07:28.8,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and I played it back to elephants resting under trees

152
0:07:32.244,000 --> 0:07:33,000
through a wireless speaker system,

153
0:07:33.963,000 --> 0:07:37,000
so I could understand how they would react as if there were wild bees in the area.

154
0:07:38.466,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And it turns out that they react quite dramatically

155
0:07:41.577,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to the sound of African wild bees.

156
0:07:44.99,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Here we are, playing the bee sounds back to this amazing group of elephants.

157
0:07:48.641,000 --> 0:07:5,000
You can see the ears going up, going out,

158
0:07:51.386,000 --> 0:07:53,000
they're turning their heads from side to side,

159
0:07:53.863,000 --> 0:07:55,000
one elephant is flicking her trunk to try and smell.

160
0:07:57.05,000 --> 0:08:,000
There's another elephant that kicks one of calves on the ground

161
0:08:00.106,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to tell it to get up as if there is a threat.

162
0:08:03.21,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And one elephant triggers a retreat,

163
0:08:05.853,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and soon the whole family of elephants are running after her

164
0:08:09.927,000 --> 0:08:12,000
across the savannah in a cloud of dust.

165
0:08:13.15,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Sound of bees buzzing)

166
0:08:20.394,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Sound of bees ends)

167
0:08:21.703,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now I've done this experiment many, many times,

168
0:08:26.052,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and the elephants almost always flee.

169
0:08:28.727,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Not only do they run away,

170
0:08:30.503,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but they dust themselves as they're running,

171
0:08:32.614,000 --> 0:08:34,000
as if to knock bees out of the air.

172
0:08:35.511,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And we placed infrasonic microphones around the elephants

173
0:08:39.015,000 --> 0:08:4,000
as we did these experiments.

174
0:08:40.792,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And it turns out they're communicating to each other in infrasonic rumbles

175
0:08:44.467,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to warn each other of the threat of bees

176
0:08:46.427,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and to stay away from the area.

177
0:08:49.038,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So these behavioral discoveries

178
0:08:50.688,000 --> 0:08:52,000
really helped us understand how elephants would react

179
0:08:53.212,000 --> 0:08:55,000
should they hear or see bee sounds.

180
0:08:55.585,000 --> 0:08:59,000
This led me to invent a novel design for a beehive fence,

181
0:08:59.728,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which we are now building around small, one-to-two-acre farms

182
0:09:03.228,000 --> 0:09:05,000
on the most vulnerable frontline areas of Africa

183
0:09:05.965,000 --> 0:09:07,000
where humans and elephants are competing for space.

184
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
These beehive fences are very, very simple.

185
0:09:11.373,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We use 12 beehives and 12 dummy hives

186
0:09:14.649,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to protect one acre of farmland.

187
0:09:17.069,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now a dummy hive is simply a piece of plywood

188
0:09:19.387,000 --> 0:09:21,000
which we cut into squares, paint yellow

189
0:09:21.649,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and hang in between the hives.

190
0:09:23.331,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We're basically tricking the elephants

191
0:09:25.3,000 --> 0:09:27,000
into thinking there are more beehives than there really are.

192
0:09:28.149,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And of course, it literally halves the cost of the fence.

193
0:09:31.014,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So there's a hive and a dummy hive

194
0:09:32.695,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and a beehive and now dummy hive,

195
0:09:34.466,000 --> 0:09:36,000
every 10 meters around the outside boundary.

196
0:09:36.966,000 --> 0:09:37,000
They're held up by posts

197
0:09:38.625,000 --> 0:09:4,000
with a shade roof to protect the bees,

198
0:09:40.769,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and they're interconnected with a simple piece of plain wire,

199
0:09:43.945,000 --> 0:09:45,000
which goes all the way around, connecting the hives.

200
0:09:46.403,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So if an elephant tries to enter the farm,

201
0:09:48.883,000 --> 0:09:49,000
he will avoid the beehive at all cost,

202
0:09:50.753,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but he might try and push through between the hive and the dummy hive,

203
0:09:54.083,000 --> 0:09:57,000
causing all the beehives to swing as the wire hits his chest.

204
0:09:57.447,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And as we know from our research work,

205
0:09:59.432,000 --> 0:10:01,000
this will cause the elephants to flee and run away --

206
0:10:02.371,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and hopefully remember not to come back to that risky area.

207
0:10:06.132,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The bees swarm out of the hive,

208
0:10:07.887,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and they really scare the elephants away.

209
0:10:10.505,000 --> 0:10:13,000
These beehive fences we're studying using things like camera traps

210
0:10:13.998,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to help us understand how elephants are responding

211
0:10:16.379,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to them at night time,

212
0:10:17.608,000 --> 0:10:19,000
which is when most of the crop raiding occurs.

213
0:10:19.894,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And we found in our study farms

214
0:10:22.242,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that we're keeping up to 80 percent of elephants

215
0:10:24.982,000 --> 0:10:26,000
outside of the boundaries of these farms.

216
0:10:27.966,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And the bees and the beehive fences are also pollinating the fields.

217
0:10:32.744,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So we're having a great reduction both in elephant crop raids

218
0:10:36.434,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and a boost in yield through the pollination services

219
0:10:39.121,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that the bees are giving to the crops themselves.

220
0:10:42.585,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The strength of the beehive fences is really important --

221
0:10:45.282,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the colonies have to be very strong.

222
0:10:47.221,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So we're trying to help farmers grow pollinator-friendly crops

223
0:10:50.197,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to boost their hives,

224
0:10:52.245,000 --> 0:10:53,000
boost the strength of their bees

225
0:10:53.896,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and, of course, produce the most amazing honey.

226
0:10:56.791,000 --> 0:11:,000
This honey is so valuable as an extra livelihood income for the farmers.

227
0:11:01.244,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's a healthy alternative to sugar,

228
0:11:03.3,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and in our community,

229
0:11:05.038,000 --> 0:11:07,000
it's a very valuable present to give a mother-in-law,

230
0:11:07.577,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which makes it almost priceless.

231
0:11:09.489,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:11.942,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We now bottle up this honey,

233
0:11:13.631,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and we've called this wild beautiful honey Elephant-Friendly Honey.

234
0:11:17.758,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It is a fun name,

235
0:11:18.933,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but it also attracts attention to our project

236
0:11:21.147,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and helps people understand what we're trying to do

237
0:11:23.576,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to save elephants.

238
0:11:24.752,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We're working now with so many women

239
0:11:26.522,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in over 60 human-elephant conflict sites

240
0:11:29.127,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in 19 countries in Africa and Asia

241
0:11:31.658,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to build these beehive fences,

242
0:11:33.712,000 --> 0:11:35,000
working very, very closely with so many farmers

243
0:11:36.162,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but particularly now with women farmers,

244
0:11:38.466,000 --> 0:11:41,000
helping them to live better in harmony with elephants.

245
0:11:41.616,000 --> 0:11:44,000
One of the things we're trying to do is develop a toolbox of options

246
0:11:45.084,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to live in better harmony with these massive pachyderms.

247
0:11:48.252,000 --> 0:11:5,000
One of those issues is to try and get farmers,

248
0:11:50.427,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and women in particular,

249
0:11:51.673,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to think different about what they're planting

250
0:11:53.887,000 --> 0:11:54,000
inside their farms as well.

251
0:11:55.212,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So we're looking at planting crops

252
0:11:56.884,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that elephants don't particularly want to eat, like chillies,

253
0:11:59.788,000 --> 0:12:01,000
ginger, Moringa, sunflowers.

254
0:12:02.085,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And of course, the bees and the beehive fences love these crops too,

255
0:12:05.332,000 --> 0:12:06,000
because they have beautiful flowers.

256
0:12:07.141,000 --> 0:12:09,000
One of these plants is a spiky plant called sisal --

257
0:12:09.855,000 --> 0:12:1,000
you may know this here as jute.

258
0:12:12.075,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And this amazing plant can be stripped down

259
0:12:14.615,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and turned into a weaving product.

260
0:12:16.98,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We're working with these amazing women now

261
0:12:19.076,000 --> 0:12:21,000
who live daily with the challenges of elephants

262
0:12:21.766,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to use this plant to weave into baskets

263
0:12:24.759,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to provide an alternative income for them.

264
0:12:27.696,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We've just started construction only three weeks ago

265
0:12:30.204,000 --> 0:12:32,000
on a women's enterprise center

266
0:12:32.259,000 --> 0:12:34,000
where we're going to be working with these women

267
0:12:34.601,000 --> 0:12:35,000
not only as expert beekeepers

268
0:12:36.141,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but as amazing basket weavers;

269
0:12:37.823,000 --> 0:12:4,000
they're going to be processing chili oils, sunflower oils,

270
0:12:40.958,000 --> 0:12:41,000
making lip balms and honey,

271
0:12:42.927,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and we're somewhere on our way to helping these participating farmers

272
0:12:46.195,000 --> 0:12:5,000
live with better eco-generating projects that live and work better

273
0:12:50.616,000 --> 0:12:51,000
with living with elephants.

274
0:12:52.48,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So whether it's matriarchs

275
0:12:54.227,000 --> 0:12:57,000
or mothers or researchers like myself,

276
0:12:57.315,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I do see more women coming to the forefront now

277
0:12:59.929,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to think differently and more boldly about the challenges that we face.

278
0:13:04.481,000 --> 0:13:05,000
With more innovation,

279
0:13:06.061,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and perhaps with some more empathy towards each other,

280
0:13:09.529,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I do believe we can move from a state of conflict with elephants

281
0:13:12.966,000 --> 0:13:13,000
to true coexistence.

282
0:13:15.341,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Thank you.

283
0:13:16.524,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Applause)

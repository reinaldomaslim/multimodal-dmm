1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So what does the happiest man in the world look like?

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
He certainly doesn't look like me.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
He looks like this.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
His name is Matthieu Ricard.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Well it turns out

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And you do that by measuring the relative activation

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
versus the right prefrontal cortex.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And Matthieu's happiness measure

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is off the charts.

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
He's by far the happiest man

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
ever measured by science.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Which leads us to a question:

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
What was he thinking when he was being measured?

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Perhaps something very naughty.

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Actually, he was meditating

20
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
on compassion.

21
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Matthieu's own experience

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is that compassion is the happiest state ever.

23
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Reading about Matthieu

24
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was one of the pivotal moments of my life.

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My dream

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is to create the conditions

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for world peace in my lifetime --

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and to do that

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
by creating the conditions

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for inner peace

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and compassion

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
on a global scale.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And learning about Matthieu

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
gave me a new angle to look at my work.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Matthieu's brain scan shows

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that compassion is not a chore.

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Compassion is something that creates happiness.

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Compassion is fun.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And that mind-blowing insight

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
changes the entire game.

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Because if compassion was a chore,

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
nobody's going to do it,

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But if compassion was fun,

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
everybody's going to do it.

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Therefore,

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to create the conditions for global compassion,

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
all we have to do

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is to reframe compassion

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as something that is fun.

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But fun is not enough.

52
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What if compassion

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is also profitable?

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
What if compassion is also good for business?

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Then, every boss, every manager in the world,

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
will want to have compassion --

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
like this.

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That would create the conditions

59
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for world peace.

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So, I started paying attention

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to what compassion looks like in a business setting.

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in Google, my company.

65
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but Google is the place I'm familiar with

67
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because I've been there for 10 years,

68
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
so I'll use Google as the case study.

69
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Google is a company

70
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
born of idealism.

71
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's a company that thrives on idealism.

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And maybe because of that,

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
compassion is organic

74
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and widespread company-wide.

75
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
In Google, expressions of corporate compassion

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
almost always follow the same pattern.

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's sort of a funny pattern.

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It starts with a small group of Googlers

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
taking the initiative to do something.

80
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And they don't usually ask for permission;

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
they just go ahead and do it,

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.

83
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And sometimes it gets big enough

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to become official.

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So in other words,

86
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
it almost always starts from the bottom up.

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And let me give you some examples.

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The first example is the largest annual community event --

89
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where Googlers from around the world

90
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
donate their labor to their local communities --

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
was initiated and organized

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
by three employees

93
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
before it became official,

94
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because it just became too big.

95
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Another example, three Googlers --

96
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
a chef, an engineer

97
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and, most funny, a massage therapist --

98
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
three of them, they learned about a region in India

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
where 200,000 people live

100
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
without a single medical facility.

101
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So what do they do?

102
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.

103
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And they raise enough money to build this hospital --

104
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the first hospital of its kind

105
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for 200,000 people.

106
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
During the Haiti earthquake,

107
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
a number of engineers and product managers

108
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
spontaneously came together

109
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and stayed overnight

110
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to build a tool

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.

112
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And expressions of compassion

113
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
are also found in our international offices.

114
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In China for example,

115
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
one mid-level employee

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
initiated the largest social action competition in China,

117
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
involving more than 1,000 schools in China,

118
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
working on issues

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
such as education, poverty,

120
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
health care and the environment.

121
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
There is so much organic social action

122
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
all around Google

123
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that the company decided to form

124
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a social responsibility team

125
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
just to support these efforts.

126
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And this idea, again,

127
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
came from the grassroots,

128
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions

129
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and volunteered themselves for the job.

130
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And I found it fascinating

131
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that the social responsibility team

132
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.

133
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It was two persons saying, "Let's do this,"

134
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and the company said, "Yes."

135
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So it turns out

136
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that Google is a compassionate company,

137
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because Googlers found

138
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
compassion to be fun.

139
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But again, fun is not enough.

140
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
There are also real business benefits.

141
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So what are they?

142
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The first benefit of compassion

143
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is that it creates highly effective business leaders.

144
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
What does that mean?

145
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
There are three components of compassion.

146
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
There is the affective component,

147
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
which is, "I feel for you."

148
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
There is the cognitive component,

149
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which is, "I understand you."

150
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And there is a motivational component,

151
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which is, "I want to help you."

152
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So what has this got to do with business leadership?

153
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
According to a very comprehensive study

154
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
led by Jim Collins,

155
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and documented in the book "Good to Great,"

156
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it takes a very special kind of leader

157
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to bring a company

158
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
from goodness to greatness.

159
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And he calls them "Level 5 leaders."

160
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
These are leaders

161
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
who, in addition to being highly capable,

162
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
possess two important qualities,

163
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and they are

164
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
humility and ambition.

165
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
These are leaders

166
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who are highly ambitious for the greater good.

167
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And because they're ambitious for a greater good,

168
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they feel no need to inflate their own egos.

169
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And they, according to the research,

170
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
make the best business leaders.

171
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And if you look at these qualities

172
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in the context of compassion,

173
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we find

174
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that the cognitive and affective components of compassion --

175
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
understanding people and empathizing with people --

176
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
inhibits, tones down,

177
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,

178
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
therefore creating the conditions

179
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
for humility.

180
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The motivational component of compassion

181
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
creates ambition for greater good.

182
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
In other words,

183
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.

184
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And this is the first compelling business benefit.

185
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The second compelling benefit of compassion

186
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
is that it creates an inspiring workforce.

187
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Employees mutually inspire each other

188
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
towards greater good.

189
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It creates a vibrant, energetic community

190
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
where people admire and respect each other.

191
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I mean, you come to work in the morning,

192
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and you work with three guys

193
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.

194
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --

195
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
your own coworkers?

196
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So this mutual inspiration

197
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
promotes collaboration,

198
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
initiative and creativity.

199
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It makes us a highly effective company.

200
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So, having said all that,

201
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
what is the secret formula

202
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
for brewing compassion

203
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in the corporate setting?

204
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
In our experience,

205
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
there are three ingredients.

206
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The first ingredient

207
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is to create a culture

208
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of passionate concern

209
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
for the greater good.

210
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So always think:

211
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
how is your company and your job

212
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
serving the greater good?

213
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Or, how can you further serve

214
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the greater good?

215
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This awareness of serving the greater good

216
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
is very self-inspiring

217
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and it creates fertile ground

218
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
for compassion to grow in.

219
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
That's one.

220
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The second ingredient

221
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is autonomy.

222
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.

223
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And one of our most popular managers jokes that,

224
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
this is what he says,

225
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
"Google is a place

226
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
where the inmates run the asylum."

227
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And he considers himself one of the inmates.

228
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
If you already have

229
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
a culture of compassion

230
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and idealism

231
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and you let your people roam free,

232
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they will do the right thing

233
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in the most compassionate way.

234
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
The third ingredient

235
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
is to focus on inner development

236
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and personal growth.

237
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Leadership training in Google, for example,

238
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,

239
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
such as self-awareness, self-mastery,

240
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
empathy and compassion,

241
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
because we believe

242
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that leadership begins

243
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
with character.

244
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We even created a seven-week curriculum

245
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
on emotion intelligence,

246
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself."

247
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's less naughty than it sounds.

248
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So I'm an engineer by training,

249
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,

250
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
which I find kind of funny,

251
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
because this is a company that trusts an engineer

252
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to teach emotion intelligence.

253
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What a company.

254
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

255
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?

256
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It works in three steps.

257
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The first step

258
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is attention training.

259
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Attention is the basis

260
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.

261
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Therefore, any curriculum

262
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
for training emotion intelligence

263
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
has to begin with attention training.

264
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The idea here is to train attention

265
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
to create a quality of mind

266
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that is calm and clear

267
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
at the same time.

268
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And this creates the foundation

269
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
for emotion intelligence.

270
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
The second step follows the first step.

271
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The second step is developing self-knowledge

272
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and self-mastery.

273
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So using the supercharged attention from step one,

274
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
we create a high-resolution perception

275
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
into the cognitive and emotive processes.

276
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
What does that mean?

277
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It means being able to observe our thought stream

278
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and the process of emotion

279
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
with high clarity,

280
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
objectivity

281
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and from a third-person perspective.

282
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And once you can do that,

283
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you create the kind of self-knowledge

284
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that enables self-mastery.

285
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
The third step, following the second step,

286
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is to create new mental habits.

287
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
What does that mean? Imagine this.

288
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Imagine whenever you meet any other person,

289
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
any time you meet a person,

290
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
your habitual, instinctive first thought

291
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is, "I want you to be happy.

292
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I want you to be happy."

293
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Imagine you can do that.

294
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Having this habit, this mental habit,

295
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
changes everything at work.

296
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Because this good will

297
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
is unconsciously picked up by other people,

298
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and it creates trust,

299
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.

300
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And this also creates the conditions

301
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
for compassion in the workplace.

302
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Someday, we hope to open-source

303
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
"Search Inside Yourself"

304
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
so that everybody in the corporate world

305
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
will at least be able to use it as a reference.

306
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And in closing,

307
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I want to end the same place I started,

308
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
with happiness.

309
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --

310
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
the Dalai Lama,

311
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
who said, "If you want others to be happy,

312
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
practice compassion.

313
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
If you want to be happy,

314
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
practice compassion."

315
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I found this to be true,

316
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
both on the individual level

317
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and at a corporate level.

318
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And I hope that compassion

319
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
will be both fun and profitable for you too.

320
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Thank you.

321
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Good afternoon.

3
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If you have followed

4
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
diplomatic news in the past weeks,

5
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you may have heard of a kind of crisis

6
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
between China and the U.S.

7
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
regarding cyberattacks

8
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
against the American company Google.

9
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Many things have been said about this.

10
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Some people have called a cyberwar

11
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
what may actually be

12
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
just a spy operation --

13
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and obviously, a quite mishandled one.

14
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
However, this episode reveals

15
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the growing anxiety in the Western world

16
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
regarding these emerging cyber weapons.

17
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It so happens that these weapons are dangerous.

18
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
They're of a new nature:

19
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
they could lead the world

20
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
into a digital conflict

21
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that could turn into an armed struggle.

22
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.

23
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
In 1982, in the middle of the Cold War

24
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in Soviet Siberia,

25
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons,

26
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb.

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now we know today -- this was revealed

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by Thomas Reed,

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary --

30
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
this explosion was actually the result

31
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of a CIA sabotage operation,

32
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in which they had managed

33
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to infiltrate the IT management systems

34
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of that pipeline.

35
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
More recently, the U.S. government revealed

36
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that in September 2008, more than 3 million people

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
were plunged into darkness,

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates.

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Even more worrying for the Americans,

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in December 2008 the holiest of holies,

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the IT systems of CENTCOM,

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the central command

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
may have been infiltrated by hackers

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
who used these:

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
plain but infected USB keys.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And with these keys, they may have been able

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to get inside CENTCOM's systems,

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to see and hear everything,

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and maybe even infect some of them.

52
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.

53
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I'll quote General James Cartwright,

54
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

55
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
who says in a report to Congress

56
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that cyberattacks could be as powerful as

57
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
weapons of mass destruction.

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Moreover, the Americans have decided

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to spend over 30 billion dollars

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in the next five years

61
0:02:31.76,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to build up their cyberwar capabilities.

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And across the world today, we see

63
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a sort of cyber arms race,

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with cyberwar units

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
built up by countries like North Korea

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or even Iran.

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Yet, what you'll never hear

68
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
from spokespeople

69
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence

70
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is that the question isn't really

71
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
who's the enemy, but actually

72
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the very nature of cyber weapons.

73
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
And to understand why, we must look at how,

74
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
through the ages, military technologies

75
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
have maintained or destroyed

76
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
world peace.

77
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
For example,

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
if we'd had TEDxParis

79
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
350 years ago,

80
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we would have talked about the military innovation of the day --

81
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the massive Vauban-style fortifications --

82
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and we could have predicted

83
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a period of stability in the world or in Europe.

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
which was indeed the case in Europe

85
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
between 1650 and 1750.

86
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Similarly, if we'd had this talk

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen

88
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
how the rise of nuclear weapons,

89
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply,

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers.

91
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we would have seen how the emergence

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of new aircraft and tank technologies,

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which give the advantage to the attacker,

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and thus create the possibility of war in Europe.

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So military technologies

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
can influence the course of the world,

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
can make or break world peace --

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and there lies the issue with cyber weapons.

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The first issue:

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Imagine a potential enemy announcing

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
they're building a cyberwar unit,

104
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but only for their country's defense.

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Okay, but what distinguishes it

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
from an offensive unit?

107
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It gets even more complicated

108
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
when the doctrines of use become ambiguous.

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Just 3 years ago, both the U.S. and France

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace,

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
strictly to defend their IT systems.

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But today both countries say

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the best defense is to attack.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And so, they're joining China,

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
both defensive and offensive.

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The second issue:

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Your country could be under cyberattack

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
with entire regions plunged into total darkness,

120
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and you may not even know

121
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
who's attacking you.

122
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature:

123
0:05:10.06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
they can be used

124
0:05:11.56,000 --> 0:05:12,000
without leaving traces.

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because the defender

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
doesn't know who to fight back against.

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary,

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
they risk making one more enemy

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and ending up diplomatically isolated.

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This issue isn't just theoretical.

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
In May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks,

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that damaged its communication

134
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and banking systems.

135
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Estonia accused Russia.

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But NATO, though it defends Estonia,

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
reacted very prudently. Why?

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Because NATO couldn't be 100% sure

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So to sum up, on the one hand,

141
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
when a possible enemy announces

142
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
they're building a cyberwar unit,

143
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
you don't know whether it's for attack

144
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or defense.

145
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
On the other hand,

146
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking.

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
In a major article published in 1978,

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York

149
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
described a model to understand

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
how conflicts could arise.

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
In this context,

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
when you don't know if the potential enemy

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
is preparing for defense or attack,

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking,

155
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
then this environment is

156
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
most likely to spark a conflict.

157
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is the environment that's being created

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
by cyber weapons today,

159
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and historically it was the environment in Europe

160
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
at the onset of World War I.

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So cyber weapons

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
are dangerous by nature,

163
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but in addition, they're emerging

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in a much more unstable environment.

165
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
If you remember the Cold War,

166
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
it was a very hard game,

167
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but a stable one played only by two players,

168
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers.

169
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Today we're moving to a multipolar world

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
in which coordination is much more complicated,

171
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
as we have seen at Copenhagen.

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And this coordination may become even trickier

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with the introduction of cyber weapons.

174
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Why? Because no nation

175
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
knows for sure whether its neighbor

176
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is about to attack.

177
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So nations may live under the threat

178
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling

179
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
called the "reciprocal fear of surprise attack,"

180
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
as I don't know if my neighbor

181
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is about to attack me or not --

182
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I may never know --

183
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
so I might take the upper hand

184
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and attack first.

185
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Just last week,

186
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in a New York Times article dated January 26, 2010,

187
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it was revealed for the first time that

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
officials at the National Security Agency

189
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks

190
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in cases where the U.S. was about

191
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to be cyberattacked.

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And these preemptive attacks

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
might not just remain

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in cyberspace.

195
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
In May 2009, General Kevin Chilton,

196
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
commander of the U.S. nuclear forces,

197
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.,

198
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
all options would be on the table.

199
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Cyber weapons do not replace

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
conventional or nuclear weapons --

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.

202
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But in doing so, they also add their own risk

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of triggering a conflict --

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
as we've just seen, a very important risk --

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and a risk we may have to confront

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
with a collective security solution

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which includes all of us:

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
European allies, NATO members,

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
our American friends and allies,

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
our other Western allies,

211
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and maybe, by forcing their hand a little,

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
our Russian and Chinese partners.

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The information technologies

214
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Joël de Rosnay was talking about,

215
0:08:58.76,000 --> 0:09:,000
which were historically born from military research,

216
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
are today on the verge of developing

217
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
an offensive capability of destruction,

218
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which could tomorrow, if we're not careful,

219
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
completely destroy world peace.

220
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Thank you.

221
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000

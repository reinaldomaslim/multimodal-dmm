1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It is actually a reality today

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that you can download products from the Web --

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
product data, I should say, from the Web --

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
perhaps tweak it and personalize it

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to your own preference or your own taste,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and have that information sent

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to a desktop machine

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that will fabricate it for you on the spot.

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We can actually build for you,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
very rapidly,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a physical object.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And the reason we can do this

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is through an emerging technology

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
called additive manufacturing,

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or 3D printing.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This is a 3D printer.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They have been around

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
for almost 30 years now,

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which is quite amazing to think of,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but they're only just starting

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to filter into the public arena.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And typically, you would take data,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
like the data of a pen here,

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which would be a geometric representation of that product in 3D,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and we would pass that data with material

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
into a machine.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And a process that would happen in the machine

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
would mean layer by layer that product would be built.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And we can take out the physical product,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and ready to use,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or to, perhaps, assemble into something else.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But if these machines have been around for almost 30 years,

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
why don't we know about them?

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Because typically they've been too inefficient,

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
inaccessible,

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they've not been fast enough,

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
they've been quite expensive.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But today,

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it is becoming a reality

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that they are now becoming successful.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Many barriers are breaking down.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
That means that you guys

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
will soon be able to access one of these machines,

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
if not this minute.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And it will change and disrupt

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the landscape of manufacturing,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and most certainly our lives, our businesses

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and the lives of our children.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So how does it work?

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It typically reads CAD data,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
which is a product design data

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
created on professional product design programs.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And here you can see an engineer --

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it could be an architect or it could be a professional product designer --

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
create a product in 3D.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And this data gets sent to a machine

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that slices the data

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
into two-dimensional representations of that product

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
all the way through --

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
almost like slicing it like salami.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And that data, layer by layer, gets passed through the machine,

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
starting at the base of the product

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and depositing material, layer upon layer,

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
infusing the new layer of materials to the old layer

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in an additive process.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And this material that's deposited

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
either starts as a liquid form

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
or a material powder form.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the bonding process can happen

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
by either melting and depositing or depositing then melting.

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In this case, we can see a laser sintering machine developed by EOS.

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's actually using a laser

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer.

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And over time --

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
quite rapidly actually, in a number of hours --

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we can build a physical product,

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
ready to take out of the machine and use.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And this is quite an extraordinary idea,

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but it is reality today.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So all these products that you can see on the screen

81
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
were made in the same way.

82
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They were all 3D printed.

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And you can see,

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
they're ranging from shoes,

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
rings that were made out of stainless steal,

86
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
phone covers out of plastic,

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
all the way through to spinal implants, for example,

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that were created out of medical-grade titanium,

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and engine parts.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But what you'll notice about all of these products

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is they're very, very intricate.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The design is quite extraordinary.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Because we're taking this data in 3D form,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
slicing it up before it gets past the machine,

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we can actually create structures

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that are more intricate

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
than any other manufacturing technology --

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or, in fact, are impossible to build in any other way.

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And you can create parts with moving components,

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
hinges, parts within parts.

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So in some cases, we can abolish totally

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the need for manual labor.

103
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It sounds great.

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It is great.

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We can have 3D printers today

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that build structures like these.

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This is almost three meters high.

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And this was built

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
by depositing artificial sandstone layer upon layer

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in layers of about five millimeters to 10 mm in thickness --

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
slowly growing this structure.

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This was created by an architectural firm called Shiro.

113
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And you can actually walk into it.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And on the other end of the spectrum,

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this is a microstructure.

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's created depositing layers

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of about four microns.

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So really the resolution is quite incredible.

119
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The detail that you can get today

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is quite amazing.

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So who's using it?

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Typically, because we can create products very rapidly,

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
it's been used by product designers,

124
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
or anyone who wanted to prototype a product

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and very quickly create or reiterate a design.

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And actually what's quite amazing about this technology as well

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is that you can create bespoke products en masse.

128
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
There's very little economies of scale.

129
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So you can now create one-offs very easily.

130
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Architects, for example,

131
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
they want to create prototypes of buildings.

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Again you can see,

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
this is a building of the Free University in Berlin

134
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it was designed by Foster and Partners.

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Again, not buildable in any other way.

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And very hard to even create this by hand.

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now this is an engine component.

138
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It was developed by a company called Within Technologies

139
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and 3T RPD.

140
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's very, very, very detailed

141
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
inside with the design.

142
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now 3D printing

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
can break away barriers in design

144
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
which challenge the constraints

145
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of mass production.

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If we slice into this product which is actually sitting here,

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
you can see that it has a number of cooling channels pass through it,

148
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which means it's a more efficient product.

149
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You can't create this with standard manufacturing techniques

150
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
even if you tried to do it manually.

151
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's more efficient

152
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because we can now create all these cavities within the object

153
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that cool fluid.

154
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And it's used by aerospace

155
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and automotive.

156
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's a lighter part

157
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and it uses less material waste.

158
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So it's overall performance and efficiency

159
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
just exceeds standard mass produced products.

160
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And then taking this idea

161
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of creating a very detailed structure,

162
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we can apply it to honeycomb structures

163
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and use them within implants.

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Typically an implant

165
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is more effective within the body

166
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
if it's more porous,

167
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because our body tissue will grow into it.

168
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
There's a lower chance of rejection.

169
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But it's very hard to create that in standard ways.

170
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
With 3D printing,

171
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we're seeing today

172
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that we can create much better implants.

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And in fact, because we can create

174
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
bespoke products en masse, one-offs,

175
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
we can create implants

176
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that are specific to individuals.

177
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So as you can see,

178
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
this technology and the quality of what comes out of the machines is fantastic.

179
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And we're starting to see it being used

180
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
for final end products.

181
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And in fact, as the detail is improving,

182
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the quality is improving,

183
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the price of the machines are falling

184
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and they're becoming quicker.

185
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
They're also now small enough

186
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
to sit on a desktop.

187
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You can buy a machine today for about $300

188
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that you can create yourself,

189
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which is quite incredible.

190
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But then it begs the question,

191
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
why don't we all have one in our home?

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Because, simply, most of us here today

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
don't know how to create the data

194
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that a 3D printer reads.

195
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
If I gave you a 3D printer,

196
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you wouldn't know how to direct it

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to make what you want it to.

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But there are more and more

199
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
technologies, software and processes today

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that are breaking down those barriers.

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I believe we're at a tipping point

202
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
where this is now something

203
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that we can't avoid.

204
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This technology

205
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is really going to disrupt

206
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
the landscape of manufacturing

207
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and, I believe, cause a revolution

208
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in manufacturing.

209
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So today,

210
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
you can download products from the Web --

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
anything you would have on your desktop,

212
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
like pens, whistles, lemon squeezers.

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You can use software like Google SketchUp

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to create products from scratch

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
very easily.

216
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
3D printing can be also used

217
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to download spare parts from the Web.

218
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So imagine you have, say,

219
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a Hoover in your home

220
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and it has broken down. You need a spare part,

221
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
but you realize that Hoover's been discontinued.

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Can you imagine going online --

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
this is a reality --

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and finding that spare part

225
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
from a database of geometries

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of that discontinued product

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and downloading that information, that data,

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and having the product made for you at home,

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
ready to use, on your demand?

230
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And in fact, because we can create spare parts

231
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
with things the machines

232
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
are quite literally making themselves.

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
You're having machines fabricate themselves.

234
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
These are parts of a RepRap machine,

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
which is a kind of desktop printer.

236
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But what interests my company the most

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is the fact that you can create

238
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
individual unique products en masse.

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There's no need to do a run

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of thousands of millions

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
or send that product to be injection molded in China.

242
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
You can just make it physically on the spot.

243
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Which means

244
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that we can now present to the public

245
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
the next generation of customization.

246
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
This is something that is now possible today,

247
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that you can direct personally

248
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
how you want your products to look.

249
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We're all familiar with the idea

250
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of customization or personalization.

251
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Brands like Nike are doing it.

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's all over the Web.

253
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In fact, every major household name

254
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
is allowing you

255
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to interact with their products

256
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
on a daily basis --

257
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
all the way from Smart Cars

258
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to Prada

259
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to Ray Ban, for example.

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But this is not really mass customization;

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
it's known as variant production,

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
variations of the same product.

263
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
What you could do is really influence your product now

264
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and shape-manipulate your product.

265
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I'm not sure about you guys,

266
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but I've had experiences

267
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
when I've walked into a store and I've know exactly what I've wanted

268
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and I've searched everywhere for that perfect lamp

269
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that I know where I want to sit in my house

270
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and I just can't find the right thing,

271
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or that perfect piece of jewelry

272
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
as a gift or for myself.

273
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Imagine that you can now

274
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
engage with a brand

275
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and interact,

276
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
so that you can pass your personal attributes

277
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to the products that you're about to buy.

278
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You can today

279
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
download a product with software like this,

280
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
view the product in 3D.

281
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is the sort of 3D data

282
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that a machine will read.

283
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
This is a lamp.

284
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And you can start iterating the design.

285
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
You can direct what color that product will be,

286
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
perhaps what material.

287
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And also, you can engage in shape manipulation of that product,

288
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but within boundaries that are safe.

289
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Because obviously the public are not professional product designers.

290
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The piece of software will keep an individual

291
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
within the bounds of the possible.

292
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And when somebody is ready to purchase the product

293
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in their personalized design,

294
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
they click "Enter" and this data gets converted

295
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
into the data that a 3D printer reads

296
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and gets passed to a 3D printer,

297
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
perhaps on someone's desktop.

298
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But I don't think that that's immediate.

299
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I don't think that will happen soon.

300
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
What's more likely, and we're seeing it today,

301
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is that data gets sent

302
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to a local manufacturing center.

303
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
This means lower carbon footprint.

304
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We're now, instead of shipping a product across the world,

305
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we're sending data across the Internet.

306
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Here's the product being built.

307
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You can see, this came out of the machine in one piece

308
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and the electronics were inserted later.

309
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It's this lamp, as you can see here.

310
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So as long as you have the data,

311
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
you can create the part on demand.

312
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And you don't necessarily need to use this

313
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
for just aesthetic customization,

314
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
you can use it for functional customization,

315
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
scanning parts of the body

316
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and creating things that are made to fit.

317
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So we can run this through to something like prosthetics,

318
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
which is highly specialized to an individual's handicap.

319
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Or we can create very specific prosthetics

320
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
for that individual.

321
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Scanning teeth today,

322
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
you can have your teeth scanned

323
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and dental coatings made in this way to fit you.

324
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
While you wait at the dentist,

325
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
a machine will quietly be creating this for you

326
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
ready to insert in the teeth.

327
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And the idea of now creating implants,

328
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
scanning data, an MRI scan of somebody

329
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
can now be converted into 3D data

330
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and we can create very specific implants for them.

331
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And applying this

332
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to the idea of building up what's in our bodies.

333
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
You know, this is pair of lungs and the bronchial tree.

334
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
It's very intricate.

335
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You couldn't really create this or simulate it in any other way.

336
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But with MRI data,

337
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
we can just build the product,

338
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
as you can see, very intricately.

339
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Using this process,

340
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
pioneers in the industry are layering up cells today.

341
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So one of the pioneers, for example, is Dr. Anthony Atala,

342
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and he has been working

343
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
on layering cells to create body parts --

344
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
bladders, valves, kidneys.

345
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now this is not something that's ready for the public,

346
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but it is in working progress.

347
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So just to finalize, we're all individual.

348
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
We all have different preferences, different needs.

349
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
We like different things.

350
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
We're all different sizes and our companies the same.

351
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Businesses want different things.

352
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Without a doubt in my mind,

353
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I believe that this technology

354
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
is going to cause a manufacturing revolution

355
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and will change the landscape of manufacturing as we know it.

356
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Thank you.

357
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000

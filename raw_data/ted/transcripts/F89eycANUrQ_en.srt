1
0:00:12.78,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I was 14 years old

2
0:00:14.86,000 --> 0:00:15,000
inside of a bowling alley,

3
0:00:16.46,000 --> 0:00:17,000
burglarizing an arcade game,

4
0:00:19.02,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and upon exiting the building

5
0:00:20.82,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a security guard grabbed my arm, so I ran.

6
0:00:23.58,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I ran down the street, and I jumped on top of a fence.

7
0:00:26.58,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And when I got to the top,

8
0:00:28.22,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the weight of 3,000 quarters in my book bag

9
0:00:30.42,000 --> 0:00:31,000
pulled me back down to the ground.

10
0:00:32.7,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So when I came to, the security guard was standing on top of me,

11
0:00:35.78,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and he said, "Next time you little punks steal something you can carry."

12
0:00:39.22,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I was taken to juvenile hall

14
0:00:43.42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and when I was released into the custody of my mother,

15
0:00:46.9,000 --> 0:00:48,000
the first words my uncle said was, "How'd you get caught?"

16
0:00:49.9,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I said, "Man, the book bag was too heavy."

17
0:00:52.1,000 --> 0:00:54,000
He said, "Man, you weren't supposed to take all the quarters."

18
0:00:55.06,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I said, "Man, they were small. What am I supposed to do?"

19
0:00:57.9,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And 10 minutes later, he took me to burglarize another arcade game.

20
0:01:02.82,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We needed gas money to get home.

21
0:01:05.1,000 --> 0:01:06,000
That was my life.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I grew up in Oakland, California,

23
0:01:09.14,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with my mother and members of my immediate family

24
0:01:11.5,000 --> 0:01:12,000
addicted to crack cocaine.

25
0:01:13.38,000 --> 0:01:17,000
My environment consisted of living with family, friends,

26
0:01:18.78,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and homeless shelters.

27
0:01:20.86,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Oftentimes, dinner was served in breadlines and soup kitchens.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The big homey told me this:

29
0:01:27.14,000 --> 0:01:28,000
money rules the world

30
0:01:29.14,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and everything in it.

31
0:01:30.38,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And in these streets, money is king.

32
0:01:33.14,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And if you follow the money,

33
0:01:34.78,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it'll lead you to the bad guy or the good guy.

34
0:01:37.9,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Soon after, I committed my first crime,

35
0:01:40.46,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and it was the first time that I was told that I had potential

36
0:01:43.46,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and felt like somebody believed in me.

37
0:01:46.06,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Nobody ever told me that I could be a lawyer,

38
0:01:48.22,000 --> 0:01:49,000
doctor or engineer.

39
0:01:49.9,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I mean, how was I supposed to do that? I couldn't read, write or spell.

40
0:01:53.34,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I was illiterate.

41
0:01:54.58,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So I always thought crime was my way to go.

42
0:01:59.3,000 --> 0:02:,000
And then one day

43
0:02:01.02,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I was talking to somebody

44
0:02:02.3,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and he was telling me about this robbery that we could do.

45
0:02:06.58,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And we did it.

46
0:02:08.9,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The reality was that I was growing up

47
0:02:10.74,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in the strongest financial nation in the world,

48
0:02:12.98,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the United States of America,

49
0:02:14.86,000 --> 0:02:18,000
while I watched my mother stand in line at a blood bank

50
0:02:20.5,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to sell her blood for 40 dollars just to try to feed her kids.

51
0:02:25.14,000 --> 0:02:28,000
She still has the needle marks on her arms to day to show for that.

52
0:02:29.3,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So I never cared about my community.

53
0:02:31.06,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They didn't care about my life.

54
0:02:32.58,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Everybody there was doing what they were doing to take what they wanted,

55
0:02:36.02,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the drug dealers, the robbers, the blood bank.

56
0:02:38.22,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Everybody was taking blood money.

57
0:02:39.86,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So I got mine by any means necessary.

58
0:02:41.78,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I got mine.

59
0:02:43.38,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Financial literacy really did rule the world,

60
0:02:46.5,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and I was a child slave to it

61
0:02:48.5,000 --> 0:02:49,000
following the bad guy.

62
0:02:52.1,000 --> 0:02:55,000
At 17 years old, I was arrested for robbery and murder

63
0:02:55.3,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I soon learned that finances in prison rule more than they did on the streets,

64
0:02:59.3,000 --> 0:03:,000
so I wanted in.

65
0:03:01.42,000 --> 0:03:04,000
One day, I rushed to grab the sports page of the newspaper

66
0:03:04.5,000 --> 0:03:05,000
so my cellie could read it to me,

67
0:03:06.34,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and I accidentally picked up the business section.

68
0:03:08.78,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And this old man said, "Hey youngster, you pick stocks?"

69
0:03:12.06,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I said, "What's that?"

70
0:03:13.34,000 --> 0:03:16,000
He said, "That's the place where white folks keep all their money."

71
0:03:16.54,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:17.78,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And it was the first time that I saw a glimpse of hope,

73
0:03:21.66,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a future.

74
0:03:23.18,000 --> 0:03:25,000
He gave me this brief description of what stocks were,

75
0:03:26.62,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but it was just a glimpse.

76
0:03:30.18,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I mean, how was I supposed to do it?

77
0:03:31.98,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I couldn't read, write or spell.

78
0:03:34.42,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The skills that I had developed to hide my illiteracy

79
0:03:37.06,000 --> 0:03:38,000
no longer worked in this environment.

80
0:03:39.06,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I was trapped in a cage, prey among predators,

81
0:03:42.18,000 --> 0:03:43,000
fighting for freedom I never had.

82
0:03:44.1,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I was lost, tired,

83
0:03:46.3,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and I was out of options.

84
0:03:48.82,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So at 20 years old,

85
0:03:50.62,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I did the hardest thing I'd ever done in my life.

86
0:03:53.98,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I picked up a book,

87
0:03:57.22,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and it was the most agonizing time of my life,

88
0:04:01.14,000 --> 0:04:02,000
trying to learn how to read,

89
0:04:02.98,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the ostracizing from my family,

90
0:04:05.62,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the homeys.

91
0:04:08.1,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It was rough, man.

92
0:04:09.58,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It was a struggle.

93
0:04:10.98,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But little did I know

94
0:04:12.7,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I was receiving the greatest gifts I had ever dreamed of:

95
0:04:16.14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
self-worth,

96
0:04:18.14,000 --> 0:04:19,000
knowledge, discipline.

97
0:04:20.82,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I was so excited to be reading that I read everything I could get my hands on:

98
0:04:24.54,000 --> 0:04:27,000
candy wrappers, clothing logos, street signs, everything.

99
0:04:27.899,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I was just reading stuff!

100
0:04:29.14,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Applause)

101
0:04:30.18,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Just reading stuff.

102
0:04:33.18,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I was so excited to know how to read and know how to spell.

103
0:04:36.54,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The homey came up, said, "Man, what you eating?"

104
0:04:38.82,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I said, "C-A-N-D-Y, candy."

105
0:04:40.58,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:42.86,000 --> 0:04:44,000
He said, "Let me get some." I said, "N-O. No."

107
0:04:45.38,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

108
0:04:46.62,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It was awesome.

109
0:04:48.06,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I mean, I can actually now for the first time in my life read.

110
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The feeling that I got from it was amazing.

111
0:04:55.06,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And then at 22, feeling myself,

112
0:04:58.62,000 --> 0:04:59,000
feeling confident,

113
0:05:00.38,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I remembered what the OG told me.

114
0:05:03.58,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So I picked up the business section of the newspaper.

115
0:05:07.34,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I wanted to find these rich white folks.

116
0:05:09.3,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:12.34,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I looked for that glimpse.

118
0:05:15.3,000 --> 0:05:16,000
As I furthered my career

119
0:05:16.94,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in teaching others how to financially manage money and invest,

120
0:05:20.82,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I soon learned that I had to take responsibility for my own actions.

121
0:05:24.18,000 --> 0:05:27,000
True, I grew up in a very complex environment,

122
0:05:27.22,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but I chose to commit crimes,

123
0:05:29.18,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I had to own up to that.

124
0:05:30.98,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I had to take responsibility for that, and I did.

125
0:05:33.62,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I was building a curriculum that could teach incarcerated men

126
0:05:36.54,000 --> 0:05:38,000
how to manage money through prison employments.

127
0:05:40.54,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Properly managing our lifestyle would provide transferrable tools

128
0:05:43.74,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that we can use to manage money when we reenter society,

129
0:05:47.1,000 --> 0:05:5,000
like the majority of people did who didn't commit crimes.

130
0:05:50.38,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Then I discovered

131
0:05:52.5,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that according to MarketWatch,

132
0:05:54.58,000 --> 0:05:56,000
over 60 percent of the American population

133
0:05:57.14,000 --> 0:05:59,000
has under 1,000 dollars in savings.

134
0:06:00.02,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Sports Illustrated said that over 60 percent of NBA players

135
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and NFL players go broke.

136
0:06:04.82,000 --> 0:06:07,000
40 percent of marital problems derive from financial issues.

137
0:06:08.9,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What the hell?

138
0:06:10.14,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:12.3,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You mean to tell me that people worked their whole lives,

140
0:06:15.02,000 --> 0:06:17,000
buying cars, clothes, homes and material stuff

141
0:06:17.62,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but were living check to check?

142
0:06:19.86,000 --> 0:06:23,000
How in the world were members of society going to help incarcerated individuals

143
0:06:24.22,000 --> 0:06:25,000
back into society

144
0:06:25.46,000 --> 0:06:26,000
if they couldn't manage they own stuff?

145
0:06:27.98,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We screwed.

146
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:31.02,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I needed a better plan.

148
0:06:34.34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is not going to work out too well.

149
0:06:36.86,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So ...

150
0:06:39.7,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I thought.

151
0:06:43.62,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I now had an obligation to meet those on the path

152
0:06:48.18,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and help,

153
0:06:49.42,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and it was crazy because I now cared about my community.

154
0:06:52.7,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Wow, imagine that. I cared about my community.

155
0:06:56.46,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Financial illiteracy is a disease

156
0:06:58.78,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that has crippled minorities and the lower class in our society

157
0:07:01.82,000 --> 0:07:03,000
for generations and generations,

158
0:07:03.98,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and we should be furious about that.

159
0:07:06.5,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Ask yourselves this:

160
0:07:08.1,000 --> 0:07:11,000
How can 50 percent of the American population

161
0:07:11.38,000 --> 0:07:14,000
be financially illiterate in a nation driven by financial prosperity?

162
0:07:16.82,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Our access to justice, our social status,

163
0:07:19.7,000 --> 0:07:22,000
living conditions, transportation and food

164
0:07:22.74,000 --> 0:07:25,000
are all dependent on money that most people can't manage.

165
0:07:25.82,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's crazy!

166
0:07:27.42,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's an epidemic

167
0:07:28.82,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and a bigger danger to public safety than any other issue.

168
0:07:33.54,000 --> 0:07:35,000
According to the California Department of Corrections,

169
0:07:36.22,000 --> 0:07:38,000
over 70 percent of those incarcerated

170
0:07:38.58,000 --> 0:07:41,000
have committed or have been charged with money-related crimes:

171
0:07:42.22,000 --> 0:07:46,000
robberies, burglaries, fraud, larceny, extortion --

172
0:07:47.54,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the list goes on.

173
0:07:49.74,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Check this out:

174
0:07:50.98,000 --> 0:07:52,000
a typical incarcerated person

175
0:07:53.94,000 --> 0:07:55,000
would enter the California prison system

176
0:07:56.46,000 --> 0:07:57,000
with no financial education,

177
0:07:58.66,000 --> 0:07:59,000
earn 30 cents an hour,

178
0:08:00.66,000 --> 0:08:02,000
over 800 dollars a year,

179
0:08:02.9,000 --> 0:08:04,000
with no real expenses and save no money.

180
0:08:06.58,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Upon his parole, he will be given 200 dollars gate money and told,

181
0:08:10.94,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Hey, good luck, stay out of trouble. Don't come back to prison."

182
0:08:14.62,000 --> 0:08:17,000
With no meaningful preparation or long-term financial plan,

183
0:08:17.94,000 --> 0:08:18,000
what does he do ... ?

184
0:08:20.42,000 --> 0:08:21,000
At 60?

185
0:08:22.94,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Get a good job,

186
0:08:24.3,000 --> 0:08:27,000
or go back to the very criminal behavior that led him to prison in the first place?

187
0:08:29.22,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You taxpayers, you choose.

188
0:08:31.02,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Well, his education already chose for him, probably.

189
0:08:34.94,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So how do we cure this disease?

190
0:08:38.06,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I cofounded a program

191
0:08:39.82,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that we call Financial Empowerment Emotional Literacy.

192
0:08:44.42,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We call it FEEL,

193
0:08:45.9,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and it teaches how do you separate your emotional decisions

194
0:08:49.1,000 --> 0:08:5,000
from your financial decisions,

195
0:08:51.1,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the four timeless rules to personal finance:

196
0:08:54.54,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the proper way to save,

197
0:08:57.38,000 --> 0:08:58,000
control your cost of living,

198
0:09:00.14,000 --> 0:09:01,000
borrow money effectively

199
0:09:01.94,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and diversify your finances by allowing your money to work for you

200
0:09:05.74,000 --> 0:09:06,000
instead of you working for it.

201
0:09:07.58,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Incarcerated people need these life skills before we reenter society.

202
0:09:13.3,000 --> 0:09:16,000
You can't have full rehabilitation without these life skills.

203
0:09:17.22,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This idea that only professionals can invest and manage money

204
0:09:21.06,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is absolutely ridiculous,

205
0:09:23.34,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and whoever told you that is lying.

206
0:09:25.031,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Applause)

207
0:09:30.02,000 --> 0:09:32,000
A professional is a person

208
0:09:32.46,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who knows his craft better than most,

209
0:09:34.98,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and nobody knows how much money you need, have or want better than you,

210
0:09:39.94,000 --> 0:09:4,000
which means you are the professional.

211
0:09:42.7,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Financial literacy is not a skill, ladies and gentlemen.

212
0:09:46.94,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It's a lifestyle.

213
0:09:49.38,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Financial stability is a byproduct of a proper lifestyle.

214
0:09:53.9,000 --> 0:09:56,000
A financially sound incarcerated person can become a taxpaying citizen,

215
0:09:58.5,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and a financially sound taxpaying citizen can remain one.

216
0:10:02.02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This allows us to create a bridge between those people who we influence:

217
0:10:06.38,000 --> 0:10:08,000
family, friends and those young people

218
0:10:09.14,000 --> 0:10:11,000
who still believe that crime and money are related.

219
0:10:13.54,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So let's lose the fear and anxiety

220
0:10:16.46,000 --> 0:10:17,000
of all the big financial words

221
0:10:17.94,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and all that other nonsense that you've been out there hearing.

222
0:10:21.54,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And let's get to the heart of what's been crippling our society

223
0:10:25.42,000 --> 0:10:29,000
from taking care of your responsibility to be better life managers.

224
0:10:30.82,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And let's provide a simple and easy to use curriculum

225
0:10:34.18,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that gets to the heart, the heart

226
0:10:36.46,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of what financial empowerment and emotional literacy really is.

227
0:10:40.42,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Now, if you're sitting out here in the audience and you said,

228
0:10:43.34,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"Oh yeah, well, that ain't me and I don't buy it,"

229
0:10:45.78,000 --> 0:10:46,000
then come take my class --

230
0:10:47.1,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:48.82,000 --> 0:10:51,000
so I can show you how much money it costs you every time you get emotional.

232
0:10:53.78,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Applause)

233
0:10:59.42,000 --> 0:11:,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

234
0:11:00.98,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Applause)

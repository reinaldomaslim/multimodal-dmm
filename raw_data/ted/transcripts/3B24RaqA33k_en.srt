1
0:00:12.766,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I will never forget the first time I visited a client in jail.

2
0:00:17.074,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The heavy, metal door slammed behind me,

3
0:00:19.305,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I heard the key turn in the lock.

4
0:00:22.198,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The cement floor underneath me had a sticky film on it

5
0:00:25.477,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that made a ripping sound,

6
0:00:27.043,000 --> 0:00:29,000
like tape being pulled off a box,

7
0:00:29.681,000 --> 0:00:3,000
every time I moved my foot.

8
0:00:31.955,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The only connection to the outside world was a small window placed too high to see.

9
0:00:37.441,000 --> 0:00:4,000
There was a small, square table bolted to the floor

10
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and two metal chairs,

11
0:00:41.996,000 --> 0:00:42,000
one on either side.

12
0:00:44.354,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That was the first time I understood viscerally --

13
0:00:47.846,000 --> 0:00:49,000
just for a fleeting moment --

14
0:00:50.267,000 --> 0:00:51,000
what incarceration might feel like.

15
0:00:52.886,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And I promised myself all those years ago as a young, public defender

16
0:00:56.911,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that I would never, ever forget that feeling.

17
0:01:00.277,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I never have.

18
0:01:02.024,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It inspired me to fight for each and every one of my clients' freedom

19
0:01:05.999,000 --> 0:01:07,000
as if it was my own.

20
0:01:09.142,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Freedom.

21
0:01:10.832,000 --> 0:01:13,000
A concept so fundamental to the American psyche

22
0:01:14.199,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that it is enshrined in our constitution.

23
0:01:17.839,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And yet, America is addicted to imprisonment.

24
0:01:22.958,000 --> 0:01:24,000
From slavery through mass incarceration,

25
0:01:25.534,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it always has been.

26
0:01:27.704,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Look, we all know the shocking numbers.

27
0:01:30.656,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The United States incarcerates more people per capita

28
0:01:33.332,000 --> 0:01:35,000
than almost any nation on the planet.

29
0:01:36.938,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But what you may not know is that on any given night in America,

30
0:01:41.172,000 --> 0:01:45,000
almost half a million people go to sleep in those concrete jail cells

31
0:01:45.387,000 --> 0:01:48,000
who have not been convicted of anything.

32
0:01:49.764,000 --> 0:01:52,000
These mothers and fathers and sons and daughters

33
0:01:53.562,000 --> 0:01:56,000
are there for one reason and one reason only:

34
0:01:57.281,000 --> 0:02:,000
they cannot afford to pay the price of their freedom.

35
0:02:01.312,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And that price is called bail.

36
0:02:05.208,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now, bail was actually created as a form of conditional release.

37
0:02:09.054,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The theory was simple:

38
0:02:10.4,000 --> 0:02:12,000
set bail at an amount that somebody could afford to pay --

39
0:02:13.139,000 --> 0:02:14,000
they would pay it --

40
0:02:14.32,000 --> 0:02:16,000
it would give them an incentive to come back to court;

41
0:02:16.868,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it would give them some skin in the game.

42
0:02:18.86,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Bail was never intended to be used as punishment.

43
0:02:22.86,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Bail was never intended to hold people in jail cells.

44
0:02:26.858,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And bail was never, ever intended to create a two-tier system of justice:

45
0:02:32.854,000 --> 0:02:35,000
one for the rich and one for everybody else.

46
0:02:36.433,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But that is precisely what it has done.

47
0:02:39.507,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Seventy-five percent of people in American local jails

48
0:02:42.923,000 --> 0:02:44,000
are there because they cannot pay bail.

49
0:02:46.215,000 --> 0:02:47,000
People like Ramel.

50
0:02:48.514,000 --> 0:02:49,000
On a chilly October afternoon,

51
0:02:50.138,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Ramel was riding his bicycle in his South Bronx neighborhood

52
0:02:53.004,000 --> 0:02:55,000
on his way to a market to pick up a quart of milk.

53
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:02:56,000
He was stopped by the police.

54
0:02:57.454,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And when he demanded to know why he was being stopped,

55
0:03:00.046,000 --> 0:03:02,000
an argument ensued, and the next thing he knew,

56
0:03:02.396,000 --> 0:03:03,000
he was on the ground in handcuffs,

57
0:03:04.041,000 --> 0:03:06,000
being charged with "riding your bicycle on the sidewalk

58
0:03:07.063,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and resisting arrest."

59
0:03:08.944,000 --> 0:03:09,000
He was taken to court,

60
0:03:10.018,000 --> 0:03:12,000
where a judge set 500 dollars bail.

61
0:03:12.936,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But Ramel -- he didn't have 500 dollars.

62
0:03:16.032,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So this 32-year-old father was sent to "The Boat" --

63
0:03:19.908,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a floating jail barge that sits on the East River

64
0:03:23.636,000 --> 0:03:25,000
between a sewage plant and a fish market.

65
0:03:27.241,000 --> 0:03:29,000
That's right, you heard me.

66
0:03:29.487,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In New York City, in 2018,

67
0:03:32.289,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we have a floating prison barge that sits out there

68
0:03:36.809,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and houses primarily black and brown men

69
0:03:40.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
who cannot pay their bail.

70
0:03:43.59,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Let's talk for a moment

71
0:03:45.259,000 --> 0:03:48,000
about what it means to be in jail even for a few days.

72
0:03:49.368,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Well, it can mean losing your job,

73
0:03:52.369,000 --> 0:03:53,000
losing your home,

74
0:03:53.726,000 --> 0:03:55,000
jeopardizing your immigration status.

75
0:03:56.169,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It may even mean losing custody of your children.

76
0:03:59.598,000 --> 0:04:01,000
A third of sexual victimization by jail staff

77
0:04:02.305,000 --> 0:04:04,000
happens in the first three days in jail,

78
0:04:05.1,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and almost half of all jail deaths, including suicides,

79
0:04:09.359,000 --> 0:04:1,000
happen in that first week.

80
0:04:11.787,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What's more, if you're held in jail on bail,

81
0:04:14.931,000 --> 0:04:16,000
you're four times more likely to get a jail sentence

82
0:04:17.566,000 --> 0:04:18,000
than if you had been free,

83
0:04:19.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and that jail sentence will be three times longer.

84
0:04:23.036,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And if you are black or Latino and cash bail has been set,

85
0:04:27.329,000 --> 0:04:31,000
you are two times more likely to remain stuck in that jail cell

86
0:04:31.564,000 --> 0:04:32,000
than if you were white.

87
0:04:34.061,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Jail in America is a terrifying, dehumanizing and violent experience.

88
0:04:41.574,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now imagine for just one moment that it's you stuck in that jail cell,

89
0:04:46.972,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and you don't have the 500 dollars to get out.

90
0:04:51.072,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And someone comes along and offers you a way out.

91
0:04:56.145,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"Just plead guilty," they say.

92
0:04:58.559,000 --> 0:05:,000
"You can go home back to your job.

93
0:05:01.182,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Just plead guilty.

94
0:05:03.003,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You can kiss your kids goodnight tonight."

95
0:05:05.503,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So you do what anybody would do in that situation.

96
0:05:08.703,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You plead guilty whether you did it or not.

97
0:05:13.173,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But now you have a criminal record

98
0:05:15.674,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that's going to follow you for the rest of your life.

99
0:05:19.66,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Jailing people because they don't have enough money to pay bail

100
0:05:22.796,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is one of the most unfair, immoral things we do as a society.

101
0:05:27.369,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But it is also expensive and counterproductive.

102
0:05:31.264,000 --> 0:05:32,000
American taxpayers --

103
0:05:32.783,000 --> 0:05:36,000
they spend 14 billion dollars annually holding people in jail cells

104
0:05:37.449,000 --> 0:05:38,000
who haven't been convicted of anything.

105
0:05:39.362,000 --> 0:05:41,000
That's 40 million dollars a day.

106
0:05:42.82,000 --> 0:05:45,000
What's perhaps more confounding is it doesn't make us any safer.

107
0:05:46.915,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Research is clear that holding somebody in jail

108
0:05:49.441,000 --> 0:05:52,000
makes you significantly more likely to commit a crime when you get out

109
0:05:53.438,000 --> 0:05:56,000
than if you had been free all along.

110
0:05:58.44,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Freedom makes all the difference.

111
0:06:03.574,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Low-income communities

112
0:06:04.829,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and communities of color have known that for generations.

113
0:06:08.75,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Together, they have pooled their resources to buy their loved ones freedom

114
0:06:13.71,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for as long as bondage and jail cells existed.

115
0:06:17.891,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But the reach of the criminal legal system has grown too enormous,

116
0:06:21.027,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and the numbers have just too large.

117
0:06:23.809,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Ninety-nine percent of jail growth in America has been the result --

118
0:06:28.468,000 --> 0:06:29,000
over the last 20 years --

119
0:06:30.358,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of pre-trial incarceration.

120
0:06:34.467,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I have been a public defender for over half my life,

121
0:06:37.167,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I have stood by and watched thousands of clients

122
0:06:40.857,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as they were dragged into those jail cells

123
0:06:43.021,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because they didn't have enough money to pay bail.

124
0:06:45.397,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I have watched as questions of justice were subsumed by questions of money,

125
0:06:49.976,000 --> 0:06:53,000
calling into question the legitimacy of the entire American legal system.

126
0:06:55.213,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I am here to say something simple --

127
0:06:58.468,000 --> 0:06:59,000
something obvious,

128
0:07:00.17,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but something urgent.

129
0:07:02.926,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Freedom makes all the difference,

130
0:07:06.205,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and freedom should be free.

131
0:07:09.919,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Applause)

132
0:07:17.919,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But how are we going to make that happen?

133
0:07:20.181,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Well, that's the question I was wrestling with over a decade ago

134
0:07:23.206,000 --> 0:07:25,000
when I was sitting at a kitchen table with my husband, David,

135
0:07:26.088,000 --> 0:07:27,000
who is also a public defender.

136
0:07:27.541,000 --> 0:07:3,000
We were eating our Chinese takeout and venting about the injustice of it all

137
0:07:31.23,000 --> 0:07:33,000
when David looked up and said,

138
0:07:33.666,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"Why don't we just start a bail fund,

139
0:07:35.574,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and just start bailing our clients out of jail?"

140
0:07:38.836,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And in that unexpected moment,

141
0:07:41.32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
the idea for the Bronx Freedom Fund was born.

142
0:07:45.026,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Look, we didn't know what to expect.

143
0:07:47.097,000 --> 0:07:49,000
There were plenty of people that told us we were crazy

144
0:07:49.737,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and we were going to lose all of the money.

145
0:07:51.761,000 --> 0:07:54,000
People wouldn't come back because they didn't have any stake in it.

146
0:07:54.928,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But what if clients did come back?

147
0:07:57.952,000 --> 0:08:,000
We knew that bail money comes back at the end of a criminal case,

148
0:08:01.747,000 --> 0:08:03,000
so it could come back into the fund,

149
0:08:04.019,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and we could use it over and over again for more and more bail.

150
0:08:08.527,000 --> 0:08:09,000
That was our big bet,

151
0:08:09.861,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and that bet paid off.

152
0:08:12.393,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Over the past 10 years,

153
0:08:13.608,000 --> 0:08:16,000
we have been paying bails for low-income residents of New York City,

154
0:08:17.304,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and what we have learned has exploded our ideas

155
0:08:21.229,000 --> 0:08:22,000
of why people come back to court

156
0:08:23.067,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and how the criminal legal system itself is operated.

157
0:08:26.533,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Turns out money isn't what makes people come back to court.

158
0:08:30.437,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We know this because when the Bronx Freedom Fund pays bail,

159
0:08:33.398,000 --> 0:08:37,000
96 percent of clients return for every court appearance,

160
0:08:37.591,000 --> 0:08:4,000
laying waste to the myth that it's money that mattered.

161
0:08:41.876,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's powerful evidence that we don't need cash

162
0:08:46.115,000 --> 0:08:47,000
or ankle bracelets

163
0:08:47.399,000 --> 0:08:5,000
or unnecessary systems of surveillance and supervision.

164
0:08:50.858,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We simply need court reminders --

165
0:08:53.627,000 --> 0:08:55,000
simple court reminders about when to come back to court.

166
0:08:57.553,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Next, we learned that if you're held in jail on a misdemeanor,

167
0:09:01.672,000 --> 0:09:03,000
90 percent of people will plead guilty.

168
0:09:04.603,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But when the fund pays bail,

169
0:09:06.526,000 --> 0:09:08,000
over half the cases are dismissed.

170
0:09:10.603,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And in the entire history of the Bronx Freedom Fund,

171
0:09:14.483,000 --> 0:09:18,000
fewer than two percent of our clients have ever received a jail sentence

172
0:09:19.204,000 --> 0:09:2,000
of any kind.

173
0:09:20.543,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Applause)

174
0:09:28.215,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Ramel, a week later --

175
0:09:31.128,000 --> 0:09:34,000
he was still on the boat, locked in that jail cell.

176
0:09:34.481,000 --> 0:09:36,000
He was on the cusp of losing everything,

177
0:09:36.99,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and he was about to plead guilty,

178
0:09:38.957,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the Bronx Freedom Fund intervened and paid his bail.

179
0:09:42.179,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now, reunited with his daughter,

180
0:09:44.14,000 --> 0:09:46,000
he was able to fight his case from outside.

181
0:09:46.972,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Look, it took some time --

182
0:09:48.299,000 --> 0:09:5,000
two years, to be exact --

183
0:09:50.387,000 --> 0:09:51,000
but at the end of that,

184
0:09:51.641,000 --> 0:09:53,000
his case was dismissed in its entirety.

185
0:09:54.928,000 --> 0:09:55,000
For Ramel --

186
0:09:56.103,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

187
0:10:01.364,000 --> 0:10:05,000
For Ramel, the Bronx Freedom Fund was a lifeline,

188
0:10:06.031,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but for countless other Americans locked in jail cells,

189
0:10:08.856,000 --> 0:10:1,000
there is no freedom fund coming.

190
0:10:11.528,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's time to do something about that.

191
0:10:14.173,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's time to do something big.

192
0:10:16.528,000 --> 0:10:18,000
It's time to do something bold.

193
0:10:19.016,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It's time to do something, maybe, audacious?

194
0:10:22.418,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:23.669,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We want to take our proven, revolving bail-fund model

196
0:10:26.963,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that we built in the Bronx

197
0:10:28.353,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and spread it across America,

198
0:10:30.201,000 --> 0:10:32,000
attacking the front end of the legal system

199
0:10:32.422,000 --> 0:10:33,000
before incarceration begins.

200
0:10:34.312,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Applause)

201
0:10:36.314,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Cheers)

202
0:10:39.65,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Applause)

203
0:10:45.732,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Here's the plan.

204
0:10:46.938,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

205
0:10:48.014,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We're going to bail out as many people as we can

206
0:10:50.277,000 --> 0:10:51,000
as quickly as we can.

207
0:10:51.535,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Over the next five years,

208
0:10:52.791,000 --> 0:10:55,000
partnering with public defenders and local community organizations,

209
0:10:55.958,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we're going to set up 40 sites in high-need jurisdictions.

210
0:10:58.732,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The goal is to bail out 160,000 people.

211
0:11:02.453,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Our strategy leverages the fact

212
0:11:04.089,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that bail money comes back at the end of a case.

213
0:11:06.621,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Data from the Bronx

214
0:11:07.865,000 --> 0:11:11,000
shows that a dollar can be used two or three times a year,

215
0:11:12.7,000 --> 0:11:14,000
creating a massive force multiplier.

216
0:11:15.516,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So a dollar donated today can be used to pay bail for up to 15 people

217
0:11:20.69,000 --> 0:11:22,000
over the next five years.

218
0:11:23.483,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Our strategy also relies on the experience and the wisdom and the leadership

219
0:11:28.576,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of those who have experienced this injustice firsthand.

220
0:11:32.474,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

221
0:11:34.347,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Each bail project site will be staffed by a team of bail disrupters.

222
0:11:38.903,000 --> 0:11:42,000
These are passionate, dedicated advocates from local communities,

223
0:11:42.928,000 --> 0:11:44,000
many of whom were formerly incarcerated themselves,

224
0:11:45.561,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who will pay bails and support clients

225
0:11:47.934,000 --> 0:11:49,000
while their cases are going through the legal system,

226
0:11:50.435,000 --> 0:11:53,000
providing them with whatever resources and support they may need.

227
0:11:54.233,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Our first two sites are up and running.

228
0:11:56.874,000 --> 0:11:57,000
One in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

229
0:11:58.651,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and one in St. Louis, Missouri.

230
0:12:01.12,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And Ramel?

231
0:12:02.634,000 --> 0:12:05,000
He's training right now to be a bail disrupter in Queens County, New York.

232
0:12:06.182,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Applause)

233
0:12:11.647,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Our next three sites are ready to launch

234
0:12:13.997,000 --> 0:12:15,000
in Dallas, Detroit and Louisville, Kentucky.

235
0:12:17.878,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The Bail Project will attack the money bail system

236
0:12:20.831,000 --> 0:12:21,000
on an unprecedented scale.

237
0:12:23.369,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We will also listen, collect and elevate

238
0:12:27.878,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and honor the stories of our clients

239
0:12:30.267,000 --> 0:12:32,000
so that we can change hearts and minds,

240
0:12:32.746,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and we will collect critical, national data

241
0:12:36.414,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that we need so we can chart a better path forward

242
0:12:40.078,000 --> 0:12:44,000
so that we do not recreate this system of oppression in just another form.

243
0:12:45.434,000 --> 0:12:46,000
The Bail Project,

244
0:12:46.619,000 --> 0:12:49,000
by bailing out 160,000 people over the next five years,

245
0:12:50.252,000 --> 0:12:53,000
will become one of the largest non-governmental decarcerations

246
0:12:53.714,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of Americans in history.

247
0:12:55.9,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So look --

248
0:12:57.075,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Applause)

249
0:12:59.559,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the criminal legal system, as it exists --

250
0:13:02.163,000 --> 0:13:03,000
it needs to be dismantled.

251
0:13:04.09,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But here's the thing I know from decades in the system:

252
0:13:06.695,000 --> 0:13:08,000
real, systemic change takes time,

253
0:13:09.434,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and it takes a variety of strategies.

254
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So it's going to take all of us.

255
0:13:13.44,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It's going to take the civil rights litigators,

256
0:13:15.717,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the community organizers, the academics, the media, the philanthropists,

257
0:13:20.17,000 --> 0:13:22,000
the students, the singers, the poets,

258
0:13:22.264,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and, of course, the voices and efforts of those who are impacted by this system.

259
0:13:27.924,000 --> 0:13:29,000
But here's what I also know:

260
0:13:30.389,000 --> 0:13:33,000
together, I believe we can end mass incarceration.

261
0:13:34.965,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But one last thing:

262
0:13:37.101,000 --> 0:13:4,000
those people, sitting in America, in those jail cells,

263
0:13:40.665,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in every corner of the country,

264
0:13:42.99,000 --> 0:13:45,000
who are held in jail on bail bondage, right now --

265
0:13:46.32,000 --> 0:13:48,000
they need a lifeline today.

266
0:13:49.322,000 --> 0:13:51,000
That's where The Bail Project comes in.

267
0:13:52.077,000 --> 0:13:55,000
We have a proven model, a plan of action,

268
0:13:55.426,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and a growing network of bail disrupters

269
0:13:57.57,000 --> 0:14:,000
who are audacious enough to dream big and fight hard,

270
0:14:01.414,000 --> 0:14:03,000
one bail at a time, for as long it takes,

271
0:14:04.412,000 --> 0:14:08,000
until true freedom and equal justice are a reality in America.

272
0:14:09.589,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Thank you.

273
0:14:10.763,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Applause)

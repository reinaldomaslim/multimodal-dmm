1
0:00:13.208,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When I die,

2
0:00:14.845,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I would like for my body to be laid out to be eaten by animals.

3
0:00:20.92,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Having your body laid out to be eaten by animals is not for everyone.

4
0:00:25.655,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:26.712,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Maybe you have already had the end-of-life talk with your family

6
0:00:30.689,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and decided on, I don't know, cremation.

7
0:00:34.833,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And in the interest of full disclosure,

8
0:00:37.423,000 --> 0:00:42,000
what I am proposing for my dead body is not strictly legal at the moment,

9
0:00:43.435,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but it's not without precedent.

10
0:00:45.924,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We've been laying out our dead for all of human history;

11
0:00:49.536,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it's call exposure burial.

12
0:00:52.096,000 --> 0:00:56,000
In fact, it's likely happening right now as we speak.

13
0:00:56.684,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In the mountainous regions of Tibet,

14
0:00:58.939,000 --> 0:01:,000
they practice "sky burial,"

15
0:01:01.027,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a ritual where the body is left to be consumed by vultures.

16
0:01:05.545,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In Mumbai, in India, those who follow the Parsi religion

17
0:01:10.795,000 --> 0:01:14,000
put their dead in structures called "Towers of Silence."

18
0:01:15.487,000 --> 0:01:17,000
These are interesting cultural tidbits,

19
0:01:18.055,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but they just haven't really been that popular in the Western world --

20
0:01:22.527,000 --> 0:01:23,000
they're not what you'd expect.

21
0:01:24.978,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In America, our death traditions have come to be chemical embalming,

22
0:01:30.032,000 --> 0:01:33,000
followed by burial at your local cemetery,

23
0:01:33.437,000 --> 0:01:35,000
or, more recently, cremation.

24
0:01:36.843,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I myself, am a recent vegetarian,

25
0:01:40.13,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which means I spent the first 30 years or so of my life

26
0:01:43.773,000 --> 0:01:45,000
frantically inhaling animals --

27
0:01:46.004,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as many as I could get my hands on.

28
0:01:48.706,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Why, when I die, should they not have their turn with me?

29
0:01:53.31,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:55.101,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Am I not an animal?

31
0:01:57.005,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Biologically speaking, are we not all, in this room, animals?

32
0:02:02.949,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Accepting the fact that we are animals

33
0:02:05.625,000 --> 0:02:08,000
has some potentially terrifying consequences.

34
0:02:09.22,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It means accepting that we are doomed to decay and die,

35
0:02:13.272,000 --> 0:02:16,000
just like any other creature on earth.

36
0:02:18.076,000 --> 0:02:21,000
For the last nine years, I've worked in the funeral industry,

37
0:02:21.714,000 --> 0:02:23,000
first as a crematory operator,

38
0:02:23.869,000 --> 0:02:24,000
then as a mortician

39
0:02:25.371,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and most recently, as the owner of my own funeral home.

40
0:02:29.162,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And I have some good news:

41
0:02:30.918,000 --> 0:02:35,000
if you're looking to avoid the whole "doomed to decay and die" thing:

42
0:02:36.514,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you will have all the help in the world in that avoidance

43
0:02:40.754,000 --> 0:02:41,000
from the funeral industry.

44
0:02:43.64,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It's a multi-billion-dollar industry,

45
0:02:45.829,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and its economic model is based on the principle

46
0:02:48.837,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of protection, sanitation and beautification of the corpse.

47
0:02:55.43,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Whether they mean to or not,

48
0:02:57.626,000 --> 0:03:01,000
the funeral industry promotes this idea of human exceptionalism.

49
0:03:02.636,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It doesn't matter what it takes,

50
0:03:04.302,000 --> 0:03:05,000
how much it costs,

51
0:03:05.618,000 --> 0:03:06,000
how bad it is for the environment,

52
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we're going to do it because humans are worth it!

53
0:03:11.767,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It ignores the fact

54
0:03:13.379,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that death can be an emotionally messy and complex affair,

55
0:03:18.49,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that there is beauty in decay --

56
0:03:21.058,000 --> 0:03:25,000
beauty in the natural return to the earth from whence we came.

57
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, I don't want you to get me wrong --

58
0:03:28.94,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I absolutely understand the importance of ritual,

59
0:03:31.951,000 --> 0:03:34,000
especially when it comes to the people that we love.

60
0:03:35.076,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But we have to be able to create and practice this ritual

61
0:03:38.635,000 --> 0:03:39,000
without harming the environment,

62
0:03:40.44,000 --> 0:03:42,000
which is why we need new options.

63
0:03:44.235,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So let's return to the idea of protection, sanitation and beautification.

64
0:03:49.299,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We'll start with a dead body.

65
0:03:51.672,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The funeral industry will protect your dead body

66
0:03:54.715,000 --> 0:03:58,000
by offering to sell your family a casket made of hardwood or metal

67
0:03:59.58,000 --> 0:04:,000
with a rubber sealant.

68
0:04:02.083,000 --> 0:04:05,000
At the cemetery, on the day of burial, that casket will be lowered

69
0:04:05.678,000 --> 0:04:08,000
into a large concrete or metal vault.

70
0:04:09.573,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We're wasting all of these resources -- concretes, metal, hardwoods --

71
0:04:13.521,000 --> 0:04:16,000
hiding them in vast underground fortresses.

72
0:04:18.12,000 --> 0:04:2,000
When you choose burial at the cemetery,

73
0:04:20.692,000 --> 0:04:25,000
your dead body is not coming anywhere near the dirt that surrounds it.

74
0:04:26.57,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Food for worms

75
0:04:28.148,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you are not.

76
0:04:30.477,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Next, the industry will sanitize your body through embalming:

77
0:04:35.32,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the chemical preservation of the dead.

78
0:04:38.126,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This procedure drains your blood

79
0:04:40.084,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and replaces it with a toxic, cancer-causing formaldehyde.

80
0:04:45.469,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They say they do this for the public health

81
0:04:47.836,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because the dead body can be dangerous,

82
0:04:50.71,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but the doctors in this room will tell you

83
0:04:53.233,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that that claim would only apply

84
0:04:56.011,000 --> 0:05:,000
if the person had died of some wildly infectious disease, like Ebola.

85
0:05:01.841,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Even human decomposition, which, let's be honest,

86
0:05:05.104,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is a little stinky and unpleasant,

87
0:05:08.118,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is perfectly safe.

88
0:05:10.615,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The bacteria that causes disease is not the same bacteria

89
0:05:15.147,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that causes decomposition.

90
0:05:18.476,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Finally, the industry will beautify the corpse.

91
0:05:23.001,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They'll tell you that the natural dead body of your mother or father

92
0:05:26.914,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is not good enough as it is.

93
0:05:29.485,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They'll put it in makeup.

94
0:05:31.237,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They'll put it in a suit.

95
0:05:33.052,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They'll inject dyes so the person looks a little more alive --

96
0:05:37.015,000 --> 0:05:38,000
just resting.

97
0:05:39.492,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Embalming is a cheat code,

98
0:05:41.782,000 --> 0:05:45,000
providing the illusion that death and then decay are not the natural end

99
0:05:46.203,000 --> 0:05:48,000
for all organic life on this planet.

100
0:05:50.429,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, if this system of beautification, sanitation, protection

101
0:05:55.471,000 --> 0:05:57,000
doesn't appeal to you,

102
0:05:57.688,000 --> 0:05:58,000
you are not alone.

103
0:05:59.65,000 --> 0:06:,000
There is a whole wave of people --

104
0:06:01.65,000 --> 0:06:03,000
funeral directors, designers, environmentalists --

105
0:06:04.638,000 --> 0:06:07,000
trying to come up with a more eco-friendly way of death.

106
0:06:09.201,000 --> 0:06:11,000
For these people, death is not necessarily

107
0:06:11.707,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a pristine, makeup, powder-blue tuxedo kind of affair.

108
0:06:16.566,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There's no question

109
0:06:17.988,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that our current methods of death are not particularly sustainable,

110
0:06:21.939,000 --> 0:06:24,000
what with the waste of resources and our reliance on chemicals.

111
0:06:26.318,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Even cremation,

112
0:06:27.684,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which is usually considered the environmentally friendly option,

113
0:06:31.426,000 --> 0:06:33,000
uses, per cremation,

114
0:06:33.688,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the natural gas equivalent of a 500-mile car trip.

115
0:06:39.748,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So where do we go from here?

116
0:06:43.188,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Last summer, I was in the mountains of North Carolina,

117
0:06:46.564,000 --> 0:06:49,000
hauling buckets of wood chips in the summer sun.

118
0:06:50.561,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I was at Western Carolina University at their "Body Farm,"

119
0:06:54.774,000 --> 0:06:57,000
more accurately called a "human decomposition facility."

120
0:06:59.614,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Bodies donated to science are brought here,

121
0:07:01.883,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and their decay is studied to benefit the future of forensics.

122
0:07:06.64,000 --> 0:07:07,000
On this particular day,

123
0:07:07.952,000 --> 0:07:11,000
there were 12 bodies laid out in various stages of decomposition.

124
0:07:12.547,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Some were skeletonized,

125
0:07:14.852,000 --> 0:07:16,000
one was wearing purple pajamas,

126
0:07:17.248,000 --> 0:07:19,000
one still had blonde facial hair visible.

127
0:07:21.03,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The forensic aspect is really fascinating,

128
0:07:23.963,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but not actually why I was there.

129
0:07:26.383,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I was there because a colleague of mine named Katrina Spade

130
0:07:29.669,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is attempting to create a system, not of cremating the dead,

131
0:07:34.033,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but composting the dead.

132
0:07:36.745,000 --> 0:07:38,000
She calls the system "Recomposition,"

133
0:07:39.287,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and we've been doing it with cattle and other livestock for years.

134
0:07:43.465,000 --> 0:07:44,000
She imagines a facility

135
0:07:45.013,000 --> 0:07:47,000
where the family could come and lay their dead loved one

136
0:07:47.663,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in a nutrient-rich mixture that would, in four-to-six weeks,

137
0:07:52.118,000 --> 0:07:55,000
reduce the body -- bones and all -- to soil.

138
0:07:56.622,000 --> 0:07:57,000
In those four-to-six weeks,

139
0:07:58.091,000 --> 0:08:,000
your molecules become other molecules;

140
0:08:00.573,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you literally transform.

141
0:08:03.526,000 --> 0:08:06,000
How would this fit in with the very recent desire

142
0:08:06.603,000 --> 0:08:07,000
a lot of people seem to have

143
0:08:08.229,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to be buried under a tree,

144
0:08:09.758,000 --> 0:08:11,000
or to become a tree when they die?

145
0:08:12.53,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In a traditional cremation, the ashes that are left over --

146
0:08:16.084,000 --> 0:08:17,000
inorganic bone fragments --

147
0:08:18.094,000 --> 0:08:2,000
form a thick, chalky layer

148
0:08:20.369,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that, unless distributed in the soil just right,

149
0:08:23.616,000 --> 0:08:26,000
can actually hurt or kill the tree.

150
0:08:27.372,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But if you're recomposed, if you actually become the soil,

151
0:08:30.701,000 --> 0:08:31,000
you can nourish the tree,

152
0:08:32.259,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and become the post-mortem contributor you've always wanted to be --

153
0:08:35.972,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that you deserve to be.

154
0:08:38.638,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So that's one option for the future of cremation.

155
0:08:42.005,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But what about the future of cemeteries?

156
0:08:44.932,000 --> 0:08:48,000
There are a lot of people who think we shouldn't even have cemeteries anymore

157
0:08:49.021,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because we're running out of land.

158
0:08:51.797,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But what if we reframed it,

159
0:08:54.034,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and the corpse wasn't the land's enemy,

160
0:08:56.663,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but its potential savior?

161
0:08:59.625,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I'm talking about conservation burial,

162
0:09:02.202,000 --> 0:09:06,000
where large swaths of land are purchased by a land trust.

163
0:09:07.094,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The beauty of this is that once you plant a few dead bodies in that land,

164
0:09:11.948,000 --> 0:09:14,000
it can't be touched, it can't be developed on --

165
0:09:14.99,000 --> 0:09:16,000
hence the term, "conservation burial."

166
0:09:17.812,000 --> 0:09:2,000
It's the equivalent of chaining yourself to a tree post-mortem --

167
0:09:21.718,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"Hell no, I won't go!

168
0:09:24.206,000 --> 0:09:27,000
No, really -- I can't. I'm decomposing under here."

169
0:09:27.275,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

170
0:09:28.394,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Any money that the family gives to the cemetery

171
0:09:30.739,000 --> 0:09:33,000
would go back into protecting and managing the land.

172
0:09:35.196,000 --> 0:09:39,000
There are no headstones and no graves in the typical sense.

173
0:09:39.619,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The graves are scattered about the property

174
0:09:41.79,000 --> 0:09:42,000
under elegant mounds,

175
0:09:43.374,000 --> 0:09:46,000
marked only by a rock or a small metal disk,

176
0:09:47.079,000 --> 0:09:49,000
or sometimes only locatable by GPS.

177
0:09:50.563,000 --> 0:09:51,000
There's no embalming,

178
0:09:52.261,000 --> 0:09:54,000
no heavy, metal caskets.

179
0:09:55.12,000 --> 0:09:57,000
My funeral home sells a few caskets

180
0:09:57.349,000 --> 0:10:,000
made out of things like woven willow and bamboo,

181
0:10:01.125,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but honestly, most of our families just choose a simple shroud.

182
0:10:05.799,000 --> 0:10:08,000
There are none of the big vaults that most cemeteries require

183
0:10:09.663,000 --> 0:10:12,000
just because it makes it easier for them to landscape.

184
0:10:13.921,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Families can come here; they can luxuriate in nature;

185
0:10:17.477,000 --> 0:10:19,000
they can even plant a tree or a shrub,

186
0:10:20.178,000 --> 0:10:23,000
though only native plants to the area are allowed.

187
0:10:23.874,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The dead then blend seamlessly in with the landscape.

188
0:10:28.079,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There's hope in conservation cemeteries.

189
0:10:31.911,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They offer dedicated green space in both urban and rural areas.

190
0:10:37.567,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They offer a chance to reintroduce native plants and animals to a region.

191
0:10:42.742,000 --> 0:10:43,000
They offer public trails,

192
0:10:44.739,000 --> 0:10:46,000
places for spiritual practice,

193
0:10:46.811,000 --> 0:10:49,000
places for classes and events --

194
0:10:49.95,000 --> 0:10:52,000
places where nature and mourning meet.

195
0:10:54.271,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Most importantly, they offer us, once again,

196
0:10:57.691,000 --> 0:11:02,000
a chance to just decompose in a hole in the ground.

197
0:11:03.786,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The soil,

198
0:11:05.199,000 --> 0:11:06,000
let me tell you,

199
0:11:06.891,000 --> 0:11:07,000
has missed us.

200
0:11:08.975,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I think for a lot of people,

201
0:11:11.031,000 --> 0:11:12,000
they're starting to get the sense

202
0:11:12.652,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that our current funeral industry isn't really working for them.

203
0:11:18.118,000 --> 0:11:19,000
For many of us,

204
0:11:19.332,000 --> 0:11:23,000
being sanitized and beautified just doesn't reflect us.

205
0:11:23.767,000 --> 0:11:26,000
It doesn't reflect what we stood for during our lives.

206
0:11:27.834,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Will changing the way we bury our dead solve climate change?

207
0:11:32.269,000 --> 0:11:33,000
No.

208
0:11:33.872,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But it will make bold moves

209
0:11:35.921,000 --> 0:11:38,000
in how we see ourselves as citizens of this planet.

210
0:11:40.474,000 --> 0:11:44,000
If we can die in a way that is more humble and self-aware,

211
0:11:45.106,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I believe that we stand a chance.

212
0:11:48.052,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Thank you.

213
0:11:49.32,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

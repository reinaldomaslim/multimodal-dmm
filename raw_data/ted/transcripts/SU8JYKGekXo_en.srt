1
0:00:12.999,000 --> 0:00:13,000
You're sitting there,

2
0:00:14.485,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and it's incredibly frustrating.

3
0:00:19.003,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's maddening.

4
0:00:20.192,000 --> 0:00:21,000
You've been sitting there for hours,

5
0:00:21.955,000 --> 0:00:23,000
filling in those little tiny circles with your No. 2 pencil --

6
0:00:24.931,000 --> 0:00:25,000
this is a standardized test.

7
0:00:26.296,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You look up, half-erased chalkboard,

8
0:00:29.684,000 --> 0:00:32,000
you can see that perfectly written cursive alphabet,

9
0:00:33.59,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the pull-down maps,

10
0:00:35.6,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you can hear, tick, tick, tick, ticking on the wall, that industrial clock.

11
0:00:40.485,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But most importantly, you can feel that oppressive fluorescent light,

12
0:00:45.765,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that death ray over your head.

13
0:00:47.65,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Bzzzzzz.

14
0:00:49.766,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And you can't take it anymore, but you don't have to,

15
0:00:52.325,000 --> 0:00:54,000
because Miss Darling says, "OK, boys and girls, you're done."

16
0:00:55.229,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So you jump up -- I mean, there is nothing left of you but a vapor trail.

17
0:00:58.755,000 --> 0:01:01,000
You move so quickly, you slam that little molded plastic chair,

18
0:01:02.535,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and you sprint down the hallway;

19
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
you go past the Lysol smell and the BO smell and the cubbies,

20
0:01:08.138,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and you push the door --

21
0:01:09.955,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Inhales deeply)

22
0:01:11.095,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and finally, you're outside.

23
0:01:13.139,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Oh, you can feel the wind on your face,

24
0:01:15.912,000 --> 0:01:17,000
then the sun on your skin

25
0:01:18.43,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and most importantly, the big blue sky.

26
0:01:22.776,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That is a revelation of space.

27
0:01:25.853,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Making revelations of space is what I do; I'm a designer and creative director,

28
0:01:30.975,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and that's what I do for a living.

29
0:01:32.629,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I do it for all sorts of people in all kinds of different ways,

30
0:01:35.648,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and it might seem complicated, but it's not.

31
0:01:37.778,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And over the next couple of minutes, I'm going to give you three ways

32
0:01:41.135,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that I think you can move through your world

33
0:01:43.253,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so that you, too, can make revelations of space, or at least reveal them.

34
0:01:47.459,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Step one: therapy.

35
0:01:50.449,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I know, I know, I know: blah, blah, blah, New Yorker, blah, blah, blah, therapy.

36
0:01:54.344,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But seriously, therapy -- you have to know why you're doing these things, right?

37
0:01:58.17,000 --> 0:02:,000
When I got the job of designing "Hamilton,"

38
0:02:00.369,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I sat with Lin-Manuel Miranda, writer,

39
0:02:02.617,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Tommy Kail, director, and I said,

40
0:02:04.452,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"Why are we telling this 246-year-old story?

41
0:02:07.561,000 --> 0:02:09,000
What is it about the story that you want to say,

42
0:02:10.138,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and what do you want people to feel like when they experience the show?"

43
0:02:13.719,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's important. When we get that, we move into step two: the design phase.

44
0:02:17.616,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And I'll give you some little tricks about that,

45
0:02:19.918,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but the design phase is important because we get to make these cool toys.

46
0:02:24.493,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I reach into Lin's brain, he reaches into mine,

47
0:02:27.11,000 --> 0:02:28,000
this monologue becomes a dialogue.

48
0:02:28.913,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I make these cool toys,

49
0:02:30.244,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and I say, "Does this world look like the world

50
0:02:32.477,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that you think could be a place where we could house your show?"

51
0:02:35.557,000 --> 0:02:37,000
If the answer is yes -- and when the answer is yes --

52
0:02:38.089,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we move into what I think is the most terrifying part,

53
0:02:41.271,000 --> 0:02:42,000
which is the execution phase.

54
0:02:43.008,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The execution phase is when we get to build this thing,

55
0:02:45.657,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and when this conversation goes from a few people to a few hundred people

56
0:02:50.11,000 --> 0:02:51,000
now translating this idea.

57
0:02:51.804,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We put it in this beautiful little thing,

58
0:02:53.927,000 --> 0:02:55,000
put it in the "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" super-sizer machine

59
0:02:56.81,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and blow it up full-scale,

60
0:02:58.137,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we never know if we did it right

61
0:02:59.963,000 --> 0:03:01,000
until we show up onstage and go, "Is it OK? Is it OK?"

62
0:03:02.822,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Here's the thing:

63
0:03:04.045,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you don't have to be Lin,

64
0:03:05.476,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you don't have to have a book that you want to turn into a show

65
0:03:08.815,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in order to do this in your real life.

66
0:03:10.665,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You're already starring in a show, by the way. It's called your life.

67
0:03:13.946,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Congratulations. (Laughter)

68
0:03:15.313,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But seriously, Shakespeare said it: "All the world's a stage."

69
0:03:18.435,000 --> 0:03:19,000
He nailed that part.

70
0:03:19.623,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What he screwed up royally was that part where he said,

71
0:03:23.207,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"And we are merely players."

72
0:03:25.223,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's ridiculous. We're not merely players.

73
0:03:27.278,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We are the costume designers and the lighting designers

74
0:03:30.147,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the makeup artists in our own world,

75
0:03:32.122,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I want to get you to think about being the set designer in your world.

76
0:03:35.94,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Because I think you can leave here if you do these three steps

77
0:03:40.05,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and a couple of little tricks, as I said, I'm going to tell you,

78
0:03:43.121,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and you can begin to change the world

79
0:03:45.002,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the way you want to.

80
0:03:46.46,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You want to do it?

81
0:03:47.648,000 --> 0:03:48,000
OK. Everybody write a show.

82
0:03:48.988,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:50.018,000 --> 0:03:51,000
No. Just kidding.

84
0:03:51.195,000 --> 0:03:54,000
OK. Step one: therapy. Right?

85
0:03:54.756,000 --> 0:03:55,000
How are you feeling?

86
0:03:56.461,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That's what the therapist says: "How are you feeling today?"

87
0:03:59.34,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's important to remember that, because when we design the world for you,

88
0:04:03.364,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the therapy is important.

89
0:04:05.775,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It tells you that emotion is going to become light and color.

90
0:04:10.114,000 --> 0:04:14,000
A good example of that light and color

91
0:04:14.242,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is a show I designed called "Dear Evan Hansen."

92
0:04:16.497,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Cheers)

93
0:04:17.536,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"Dear Evan Hansen" exists -- oh my God --

94
0:04:19.521,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Dear Evan Hansen" exists in a world of almost all light and color.

95
0:04:23.105,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So I chose a color: inky-black darkness.

96
0:04:25.714,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:26.773,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Inky-black darkness is a color the way that sadness is an emotion.

98
0:04:31.637,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And this show transforms people, but not before it wrecks people.

99
0:04:35.922,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I bet you're wondering, "How expensive could the set possibly be to transform you

100
0:04:40.466,000 --> 0:04:41,000
if you sit for two hours and 20 minutes

101
0:04:42.487,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in inky-black darkness?"

102
0:04:43.919,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The answer is: cheap!

103
0:04:46.572,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Inky-black darkness,

104
0:04:48.735,000 --> 0:04:49,000
turn the lights on at the right time.

105
0:04:50.54,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Seriously, think about leaving Miss Darling's class.

106
0:04:53.177,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Inky-black darkness gives way at the right moment,

107
0:04:56.001,000 --> 0:05:,000
we fly away that wall and reveal a beautiful blue sky.

108
0:05:01.558,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It blows people away and it transports them,

109
0:05:03.708,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it makes them feel hopeful.

110
0:05:05.224,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And we know this because color is emotion,

111
0:05:07.454,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and when you paint with color, you're painting with feelings.

112
0:05:12.033,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So think about that emotion, the one I had you file away in your mental Rolodex.

113
0:05:15.874,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What color is it?

114
0:05:17.051,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Where in your wardrobe does it exist, and where in your home does it exist?

115
0:05:20.627,000 --> 0:05:21,000
When we design the show for you,

116
0:05:22.532,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we're going to use that color to tell you how you feel in certain times.

117
0:05:26.83,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But also, you know this exists because you put the hero in white,

118
0:05:29.929,000 --> 0:05:32,000
you put the lead character in red, you put the villain in all black.

119
0:05:33.239,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's typecasting. You know that.

120
0:05:35.304,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So think about it.

121
0:05:36.486,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But there's also something else that happens in the world

122
0:05:39.232,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that helps us move through the world in a safe way.

123
0:05:41.689,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They're called architectural standards.

124
0:05:43.739,000 --> 0:05:45,000
They make us not fall down and go boom.

125
0:05:46.011,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Doorknobs are all at the same height. Light switches are all at the same height.

126
0:05:49.982,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Toilet bowls are always -- thank God -- at the same height,

127
0:05:52.816,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because no one ever misses the toilet bowl.

128
0:05:54.993,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But seriously,

129
0:05:56.74,000 --> 0:05:59,000
what would happen if we started to tweak those architectural standards

130
0:06:00.133,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to get what we wanted?

131
0:06:01.466,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It reminds me of the stairs I made for Pee-Wee Herman.

132
0:06:05.309,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Pee-Wee Herman is a child,

133
0:06:06.963,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and his entire world is created so that we perceive Pee-Wee as a child.

134
0:06:12.246,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The architecture and the furniture and everything come to life,

135
0:06:16.054,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but nothing more important than those stairs.

136
0:06:18.832,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Those stairs are 12 inches high,

137
0:06:21.143,000 --> 0:06:23,000
so when Pee-Wee clomps up and down those stairs,

138
0:06:23.892,000 --> 0:06:25,000
he interacts with them like a kid.

139
0:06:26.099,000 --> 0:06:28,000
You can't fake that kind of interaction,

140
0:06:28.343,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and that's the exact opposite of what we ask people in opera to do.

141
0:06:33.501,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In opera, we shrink those stairs

142
0:06:35.745,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so that our main characters can glide up and down effortlessly

143
0:06:40.142,000 --> 0:06:41,000
without ever breaking their voice.

144
0:06:42.078,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You could never put an opera singer in Pee-Wee's Playhouse,

145
0:06:45.246,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Sings in Pee-Wee's voice) or they wouldn't be able to do their job.

146
0:06:48.487,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:49.514,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But you couldn't put Pee-Wee in an opera set.

148
0:06:51.641,000 --> 0:06:53,000
He couldn't climb up and down those stairs.

149
0:06:53.673,000 --> 0:06:54,000
There'd be no Pee-Wee.

150
0:06:54.852,000 --> 0:06:57,000
He'd be like James Bond slinking elegantly up and down the stairs.

151
0:06:58.003,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It wouldn't work.

152
0:06:59.184,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:00.225,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now think of your set, your home, what you exist in every single day.

154
0:07:03.611,000 --> 0:07:05,000
If you're anything like me, the trash can is just too small

155
0:07:06.568,000 --> 0:07:08,000
for the amount of takeout that you buy every night, right?

156
0:07:09.345,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I find myself jamming like I'm kneading dough at a pizza place,

157
0:07:12.928,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I'm jamming it in because I don't understand.

158
0:07:15.592,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Or, maybe the light switch in your foyer

159
0:07:18.329,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is just stashed behind too many precariously placed coats,

160
0:07:21.489,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and so you don't even go for it.

161
0:07:23.349,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Therefore, day after day,

162
0:07:25.549,000 --> 0:07:27,000
you wind up walking in and out of a chasm of darkness.

163
0:07:28.265,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:29.75,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's true.

165
0:07:30.93,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But what would happen if the space revealed something about yourself

166
0:07:34.32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that you didn't even know?

167
0:07:36.369,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Kanye never told me specifically that he wanted to be God.

168
0:07:41.485,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But --

169
0:07:42.66,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:43.862,000 --> 0:07:47,000
when we started working together, we were sending images back and forth,

171
0:07:48.636,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and he sent me a picture of the aurora borealis

172
0:07:50.896,000 --> 0:07:51,000
with lightning strikes through it.

173
0:07:52.571,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And he sent me pictures from a mountaintop looking down

174
0:07:55.235,000 --> 0:07:57,000
at a smoke-filled canyon,

175
0:07:57.368,000 --> 0:07:59,000
or smoke underneath the surface of water --

176
0:07:59.85,000 --> 0:08:,000
like, epic stuff.

177
0:08:01.17,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So the first set I designed for him was a huge light box

178
0:08:04.571,000 --> 0:08:05,000
with the name of his record label.

179
0:08:06.266,000 --> 0:08:08,000
He would stand triumphantly in front of it,

180
0:08:08.341,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and it would flash lights like a lightning bolt.

181
0:08:10.627,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And it was epic, but, like, starter-kit epic.

182
0:08:12.773,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We moved on to a large swath of sky with a tear down the middle,

183
0:08:15.845,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and through the tear, you could see deep parts of the cosmos.

184
0:08:19.991,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Getting closer.

185
0:08:21.486,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We evolved to standing on top of an obelisk,

186
0:08:25.121,000 --> 0:08:27,000
standing on top of a mountainside, standing on top of boxes.

187
0:08:28.004,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You know, he was evolving as an artist through space,

188
0:08:30.531,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and it was my job to try and keep up.

189
0:08:32.398,000 --> 0:08:33,000
When we did Coachella,

190
0:08:34.177,000 --> 0:08:35,000
there he was,

191
0:08:35.353,000 --> 0:08:39,000
standing in front of an 80-foot-wide by 40-foot-tall ancient artifact,

192
0:08:39.384,000 --> 0:08:41,000
literally handed down from God to man.

193
0:08:42.352,000 --> 0:08:44,000
He was evolving, and we were all witness to it.

194
0:08:45.138,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And in his last show, which I didn't design but I witnessed,

195
0:08:48.357,000 --> 0:08:49,000
he had self-actualized.

196
0:08:49.873,000 --> 0:08:53,000
He was literally standing on a floating plexiglass deck

197
0:08:54.227,000 --> 0:08:56,000
over his adoring fans,

198
0:08:56.284,000 --> 0:09:01,000
who had no choice but to praise to Yeezus up above.

199
0:09:01.519,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:02.557,000 --> 0:09:03,000
He had deified himself.

201
0:09:04.34,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You can't become Yeezus in your living room.

202
0:09:06.741,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The space told him who he was about himself,

203
0:09:09.459,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and then he delivered that to us.

204
0:09:11.968,000 --> 0:09:12,000
When I was 20 years old,

205
0:09:13.628,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I was driving through a parking lot, and I saw a puddle.

206
0:09:17.011,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I thought, "I'm going to veer to the left. No -- I'm going through it."

207
0:09:20.493,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I hit the puddle, and -- ffftt! -- all the water underneath my car,

208
0:09:23.978,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and instantly, I have an aha moment.

209
0:09:26.463,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Light bulb goes off.

210
0:09:28.364,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Everything in the world needs to be designed.

211
0:09:31.923,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I mean, I'm sure I was thinking, "The drainage needs to be designed

212
0:09:35.155,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in this parking lot."

213
0:09:36.34,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But then I was like, "Everything in the world needs to be designed."

214
0:09:39.6,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And it's true: left to its own devices,

215
0:09:41.506,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Mother Nature isn't going to carve an interesting or necessarily helpful path

216
0:09:45.539,000 --> 0:09:46,000
for you.

217
0:09:47.569,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I've spent my career reaching into people's minds

218
0:09:51.072,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and creating worlds out here that we can all interact with.

219
0:09:56.309,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And yeah, you might not get to do this with fancy collaborators,

220
0:09:59.423,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but I think if you leave here, those three easy steps --

221
0:10:03.061,000 --> 0:10:06,000
therapy, who do I want to be, why do I do the things that I do;

222
0:10:07.051,000 --> 0:10:11,000
design, create a plan and try and follow through with it,

223
0:10:11.328,000 --> 0:10:12,000
what can I do;

224
0:10:13.146,000 --> 0:10:14,000
execute it --

225
0:10:15.061,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I think if you add that with a little color theory --

226
0:10:17.681,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter)

227
0:10:18.711,000 --> 0:10:22,000
some cool design choices and a general disrespect for architectural standards,

228
0:10:23.186,000 --> 0:10:24,000
you can go out

229
0:10:24.853,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and create the world that you want to live in,

230
0:10:27.831,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and I am going to go home and buy a new trash can.

231
0:10:30.76,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Thank you.

232
0:10:31.953,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

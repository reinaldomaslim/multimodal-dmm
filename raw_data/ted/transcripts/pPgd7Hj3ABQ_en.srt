1
0:00:12.682,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to tell you about the future of money.

2
0:00:16.467,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let's start with a story about this culture

3
0:00:19.088,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that lived in Micronesia in the early 1900s, called the Yap.

4
0:00:23.3,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now, I want to tell you about the Yap

5
0:00:25.107,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because their form of money is really interesting.

6
0:00:27.997,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They use these limestone discs called Rai stones.

7
0:00:31.659,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, the Yap don't actually move these Rai stones around

8
0:00:35.41,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or exchange them the way we do with our coins,

9
0:00:38.231,000 --> 0:00:41,000
because Rai stones can get to be pretty massive.

10
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The largest is about four tons and 12 feet across.

11
0:00:46.072,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So the Yap just keep track of who owns part of what stone.

12
0:00:52.051,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There's a story about these sailors

13
0:00:54.162,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that were transporting a stone across the ocean

14
0:00:56.842,000 --> 0:00:59,000
when they ran into some trouble and the stone actually fell in.

15
0:01:01.574,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The sailors got back to the main island

16
0:01:03.92,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and they told everyone what had happened.

17
0:01:06.201,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And everyone decided that, actually, yes,

18
0:01:08.974,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the sailors had the stone and -- why not? -- it still counted.

19
0:01:13.372,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Even though it was at the bottom of the ocean,

20
0:01:15.59,000 --> 0:01:17,000
it was still part of the Yap economy.

21
0:01:18.573,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You might think that this was just a small culture

22
0:01:21.766,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a hundred years ago.

23
0:01:23.158,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But things like this happen in the Western world as well,

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the Yap actually still use a form of these stones.

25
0:01:30.36,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In 1932, the Bank of France asked the United States

26
0:01:34.812,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to convert their holdings from dollars into gold.

27
0:01:38.749,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But it was too inconvenient to think about actually shipping

28
0:01:42.118,000 --> 0:01:43,000
all of that gold over to Europe.

29
0:01:44.071,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So instead, someone went to where that gold was being stored

30
0:01:47.928,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and they just labeled it as belonging to France now.

31
0:01:52.006,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And everyone agreed that France owned the gold.

32
0:01:55.843,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It's just like those Rai stones.

33
0:01:58.517,000 --> 0:02:,000
The point I want to make with these two examples

34
0:02:00.862,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is that there's nothing inherently valuable

35
0:02:04.274,000 --> 0:02:07,000
about a dollar or a stone or a coin.

36
0:02:08.09,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The only reason these things have any value

37
0:02:10.806,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is because we've all decided they should.

38
0:02:13.398,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And because we've decided that,

39
0:02:15.251,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they do.

40
0:02:17.223,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Money is about the exchanges and the transactions

41
0:02:21.387,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that we have with each other.

42
0:02:24.042,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Money isn't anything objective.

43
0:02:26.874,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's about a collective story that we tell each other about value.

44
0:02:32.101,000 --> 0:02:33,000
A collective fiction.

45
0:02:34.17,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And that's a really powerful concept.

46
0:02:38.059,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In the past two decades,

47
0:02:39.55,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we've begun to use digital money.

48
0:02:41.843,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So I get paid via direct deposit,

49
0:02:44.54,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I pay my rent via bank transfer,

50
0:02:47.047,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I pay my taxes online.

51
0:02:49.015,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And every month,

52
0:02:50.191,000 --> 0:02:52,000
a small amount of money is deducted from my paycheck

53
0:02:52.98,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and invested in mutual funds in my retirement account.

54
0:02:57.12,000 --> 0:02:58,000
All of these interactions

55
0:02:58.653,000 --> 0:03:02,000
are literally just changing 1's and 0's on computers.

56
0:03:02.735,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There's not even anything physical, like a stone or a coin.

57
0:03:08.32,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Digital money makes it so that I can pay someone around the world

58
0:03:11.627,000 --> 0:03:12,000
in seconds.

59
0:03:13.901,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now when this works,

60
0:03:15.516,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it's because there are large institutions underwriting every 1 or 0

61
0:03:20.385,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that changes on a computer.

62
0:03:22.338,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And when it doesn't,

63
0:03:23.527,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it's often the fault of those large institutions.

64
0:03:25.949,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Or at least, it's up to them to fix the problem.

65
0:03:28.916,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And a lot of times, they don't.

66
0:03:30.862,000 --> 0:03:32,000
There's a lot of friction in the system.

67
0:03:33.938,000 --> 0:03:35,000
How long did it take the US credit card companies

68
0:03:36.837,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to implement chip and pin?

69
0:03:38.908,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Half my credit cards still don't work in Europe.

70
0:03:42.739,000 --> 0:03:43,000
That's friction.

71
0:03:44.58,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Transferring money across borders and across currencies

72
0:03:48.496,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is really expensive:

73
0:03:50.807,000 --> 0:03:51,000
friction.

74
0:03:52.292,000 --> 0:03:56,000
An entrepreneur in India can set up an online business in minutes,

75
0:03:57.239,000 --> 0:04:,000
but it's hard for her to get loans and to get paid:

76
0:04:01.512,000 --> 0:04:02,000
friction.

77
0:04:03.701,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Our access to digital money and our ability to freely transact

78
0:04:08.569,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is being held captive by these gatekeepers.

79
0:04:11.536,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And there's a lot of impediments in the system slowing things down.

80
0:04:16.498,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That's because digital money isn't really mine,

81
0:04:20.064,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it's entries in databases that belong to my bank,

82
0:04:23.662,000 --> 0:04:26,000
my credit card company or my investment firm.

83
0:04:26.839,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And these companies have the right to say "no."

84
0:04:30.856,000 --> 0:04:31,000
If I'm a PayPal merchant

85
0:04:32.672,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and PayPal wrongly flags me for fraud,

86
0:04:37.167,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that's it.

87
0:04:38.347,000 --> 0:04:41,000
My account gets frozen, and I can't get paid.

88
0:04:44.789,000 --> 0:04:48,000
These institutions are standing in the way of innovation.

89
0:04:49.946,000 --> 0:04:53,000
How many of you use Facebook photos, Google Photos,

90
0:04:54.37,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Instagram?

91
0:04:55.977,000 --> 0:04:57,000
My photos are everywhere.

92
0:04:58.347,000 --> 0:05:,000
They are on my phone, they're on my laptop,

93
0:05:00.856,000 --> 0:05:02,000
they're on my old phone, they're in Dropbox.

94
0:05:03.396,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They're on all these different websites and services.

95
0:05:06.252,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And most of these services don't work together.

96
0:05:10.816,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They don't inter-operate.

97
0:05:13.538,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And as a result,

98
0:05:15.055,000 --> 0:05:17,000
my photo library is a mess.

99
0:05:18.469,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The same thing happens

100
0:05:20.235,000 --> 0:05:22,000
when institutions control the money supply.

101
0:05:23.962,000 --> 0:05:25,000
A lot of these services don't inter-operate,

102
0:05:26.721,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and as a result, this blocks what we can do with payment.

103
0:05:30.185,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And it makes transaction costs go up.

104
0:05:33.723,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So far, we've been through two phases of money.

105
0:05:37.952,000 --> 0:05:4,000
In an analog world, we had to deal with these physical objects,

106
0:05:41.94,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and money moved at a certain speed -- the speed of humans.

107
0:05:46.896,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In a digital world, money can reach much farther and is much faster,

108
0:05:51.789,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but we're at the mercy of these gatekeeper institutions.

109
0:05:55.222,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Money only moves at the speed of banks.

110
0:06:00.008,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We're about to enter a new phase of money.

111
0:06:03.158,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The future of money is programmable.

112
0:06:07.034,000 --> 0:06:1,000
When we combine software and currency,

113
0:06:10.485,000 --> 0:06:13,000
money becomes more than just a static unit of value,

114
0:06:14.286,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we don't have to rely on institutions for security.

115
0:06:18.176,000 --> 0:06:19,000
In a programmable world,

116
0:06:19.729,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we remove humans and institutions from the loop.

117
0:06:24.61,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And when this happens,

118
0:06:25.993,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we won't even feel like we're transacting anymore.

119
0:06:29.683,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Money will be directed by software,

120
0:06:31.981,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and it will just safely and securely flow.

121
0:06:36.828,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Cryptocurrencies are the first step of this evolution.

122
0:06:40.787,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Cryptocurrencies are digital money

123
0:06:42.466,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that isn't run by any government or bank.

124
0:06:45.358,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's money designed to work in a world without intermediaries.

125
0:06:50.153,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Bitcoin is the most ubiquitous cryptocurrency,

126
0:06:53.21,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but there are hundreds of them.

127
0:06:54.931,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There's Ethereum, Litecoin, Stellar, Dogecoin,

128
0:06:58.432,000 --> 0:07:,000
and those are just a few of the more popular ones.

129
0:07:01.408,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And these things are real money.

130
0:07:04.507,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The sushi restaurant down my street

131
0:07:06.386,000 --> 0:07:07,000
takes Bitcoin.

132
0:07:07.966,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I have an app on my phone that I can use to buy sashimi.

133
0:07:13.009,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But it's not just for small transactions.

134
0:07:15.453,000 --> 0:07:19,000
In March, there was a transaction that moved around 100,000 bitcoins.

135
0:07:20.719,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That's the equivalent of 40 million US dollars.

136
0:07:25.445,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Cryptocurrencies are based on a special field of mathematics

137
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:3,000
called cryptography.

138
0:07:31.023,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Cryptography is the study of how to secure communication,

139
0:07:34.818,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and it's about two really important things:

140
0:07:37.541,000 --> 0:07:4,000
masking information so it can be hidden in plain sight,

141
0:07:41.143,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and verifying a piece of information's source.

142
0:07:45.154,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Cryptography underpins so many of the systems around us.

143
0:07:49.387,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And it's so powerful that at times

144
0:07:51.937,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the US government has actually classified it as a weapon.

145
0:07:56.591,000 --> 0:08:,000
During World War II, breaking cryptosystems like Enigma

146
0:08:01.092,000 --> 0:08:04,000
was critical to decoding enemy transmissions

147
0:08:04.42,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and turning the tide of the war.

148
0:08:07.118,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Today, anyone with a modern web browser is running

149
0:08:10.436,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a pretty sophisticated cryptosystem.

150
0:08:13.03,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's what we use to secure our interactions on the Internet.

151
0:08:17.015,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's what makes it safe for us to type our passwords in

152
0:08:20.2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and to send financial information to websites.

153
0:08:23.322,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So what the banks used to give us --

154
0:08:26.173,000 --> 0:08:28,000
trustworthy digital money transfer --

155
0:08:28.417,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we can now get with a clever application of cryptography.

156
0:08:33.202,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And this means that we don't have to rely on the banks anymore

157
0:08:36.133,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to secure our transactions.

158
0:08:38.248,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We can do it ourselves.

159
0:08:40.857,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Bitcoin is based on the very same idea that the Yap used,

160
0:08:45.62,000 --> 0:08:48,000
this collective global knowledge of transfers.

161
0:08:49.852,000 --> 0:08:52,000
In Bitcoin, I spend by transferring Bitcoin,

162
0:08:53.488,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and I get paid when someone transfers Bitcoin to me.

163
0:08:58.313,000 --> 0:09:,000
Imagine that we had this magic paper.

164
0:09:01.711,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So the way that this paper works is I can give you a sheet of it

165
0:09:05.323,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and if you write something on it,

166
0:09:07.077,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it will magically appear on my piece as well.

167
0:09:10.721,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Let's say we just give everyone this paper

168
0:09:13.591,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and everyone writes down the transfers that they're doing

169
0:09:17.443,000 --> 0:09:18,000
in the Bitcoin system.

170
0:09:19.688,000 --> 0:09:22,000
All of these transfers get copied around to everyone else's pieces of paper.

171
0:09:23.658,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And I can look at mine

172
0:09:25.7,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and I'll have a list of all of the transfers that are happening

173
0:09:29.249,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in the entire Bitcoin economy.

174
0:09:31.779,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is actually what's happening with the Bitcoin blockchain,

175
0:09:35.365,000 --> 0:09:38,000
which is a list of all of the transactions in Bitcoin.

176
0:09:39.185,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Except, it's not done through paper.

177
0:09:42.023,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It's done through computer code,

178
0:09:43.743,000 --> 0:09:45,000
running on thousands of networked computers

179
0:09:46.43,000 --> 0:09:47,000
around the world.

180
0:09:49.235,000 --> 0:09:52,000
All of these computers are collectively confirming

181
0:09:53.003,000 --> 0:09:54,000
who owns what Bitcoin.

182
0:09:54.911,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So the Bitcoin blockchain is core to how Bitcoin works.

183
0:09:58.348,000 --> 0:10:,000
But where do bitcoins actually come from?

184
0:10:01.93,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Well, the code is designed to create new Bitcoin

185
0:10:05.814,000 --> 0:10:06,000
according to a schedule.

186
0:10:07.68,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And the way that it works is that to get those Bitcoin,

187
0:10:11.12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I have to solve a puzzle -- a random cryptographic puzzle.

188
0:10:17.069,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Imagine that we had 15 dice,

189
0:10:19.504,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and we were throwing these dice over and over again.

190
0:10:22.603,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Whenever the dice come up all sixes,

191
0:10:25.059,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we say that we win.

192
0:10:27.095,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is very close to what these computers are all actually doing.

193
0:10:30.995,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They're trying over and over again to land on the right number.

194
0:10:34.686,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And when they do,

195
0:10:36.067,000 --> 0:10:38,000
we say that they've solved the puzzle.

196
0:10:39.559,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The computer that solves the puzzle

197
0:10:42.023,000 --> 0:10:44,000
publishes its solution to the rest of the network

198
0:10:44.965,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and collects its reward: new bitcoins.

199
0:10:48.75,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And in the act of solving this puzzle,

200
0:10:51.008,000 --> 0:10:55,000
these computers are actually helping to secure the Bitcoin blockchain

201
0:10:55.108,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and add to the list of transactions.

202
0:10:57.866,000 --> 0:11:02,000
There are actually people all over the world running this software,

203
0:11:03.507,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and we call them Bitcoin miners.

204
0:11:06.438,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Anyone can become a Bitcoin miner.

205
0:11:09.626,000 --> 0:11:11,000
You can go download the software right now

206
0:11:12.441,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and run it in your computer and try to collect some bitcoins.

207
0:11:16.4,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I can't say that I would recommend it,

208
0:11:18.268,000 --> 0:11:23,000
because right now, the puzzle is so hard and the network is so powerful,

209
0:11:23.393,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that if I tried to mine Bitcoin on my laptop,

210
0:11:26.346,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I probably wouldn't see any for about two million years.

211
0:11:30.396,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The miners, professional miners, use this special hardware

212
0:11:34.667,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that's designed to solve the puzzle really fast.

213
0:11:37.976,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Now, the Bitcoin network and all of this special hardware,

214
0:11:41.842,000 --> 0:11:44,000
there are estimates that the amount of energy it uses

215
0:11:44.901,000 --> 0:11:46,000
is equivalent to that of a small country.

216
0:11:48.252,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So, the first set of cryptocurrencies

217
0:11:50.776,000 --> 0:11:52,000
are a little bit slow and a little bit cumbersome.

218
0:11:54.331,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But the next generation is going to be so much better and so much faster.

219
0:11:58.744,000 --> 0:12:,000
Cryptocurrencies are the first step

220
0:12:01.173,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to a world with a global programmable money.

221
0:12:05.634,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And in a world with programmable money,

222
0:12:08.431,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I can pay anyone else securely

223
0:12:11.982,000 --> 0:12:14,000
without having to sign up or ask permission,

224
0:12:15.579,000 --> 0:12:18,000
or do a conversion or worry about my money getting stuck.

225
0:12:20.428,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And I can send money around the world.

226
0:12:23.482,000 --> 0:12:25,000
This is a really amazing thing.

227
0:12:26.231,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's the idea of permission-less innovation.

228
0:12:31.447,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The Internet caused an explosion of innovation,

229
0:12:35.195,000 --> 0:12:38,000
because it was built upon an open architecture.

230
0:12:39.286,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And just like the Internet changed the way we communicate,

231
0:12:43.104,000 --> 0:12:46,000
programmable money is going to change the way we pay,

232
0:12:46.404,000 --> 0:12:48,000
allocate and decide on value.

233
0:12:49.716,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So what kind of world does programmable money create?

234
0:12:52.238,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Imagine a world where I can rent out my healthcare data

235
0:12:56.478,000 --> 0:12:57,000
to a pharmaceutical company.

236
0:12:59.063,000 --> 0:13:01,000
They can run large-scale data analysis

237
0:13:01.592,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and provide me with a cryptographic proof

238
0:13:03.988,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that shows they're only using my data in a way that we agreed.

239
0:13:08.138,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And they can pay me for what they find out.

240
0:13:11.529,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Instead of signing up for streaming services

241
0:13:14.262,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and getting a cable bill,

242
0:13:15.855,000 --> 0:13:18,000
what if my television analyzed my watching habits

243
0:13:18.885,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and recommended well-priced content that fit within my budget

244
0:13:22.581,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that I would enjoy?

245
0:13:24.604,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Imagine an Internet without ads,

246
0:13:27.494,000 --> 0:13:31,000
because instead of paying with our attention when we view content,

247
0:13:31.525,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we just pay.

248
0:13:33.831,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Interestingly, things like micro-payments

249
0:13:36.166,000 --> 0:13:39,000
are actually going to change the way security works in our world,

250
0:13:39.345,000 --> 0:13:41,000
because once we're better able to allocate value,

251
0:13:42.064,000 --> 0:13:45,000
people will use their money and their energies

252
0:13:45.112,000 --> 0:13:47,000
for more constructive things.

253
0:13:47.727,000 --> 0:13:49,000
If it cost a fraction of a cent to send an email,

254
0:13:50.34,000 --> 0:13:51,000
would we still have spam?

255
0:13:52.674,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We're not at this world yet,

256
0:13:54.901,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but it's coming.

257
0:13:56.382,000 --> 0:14:,000
Right now, it's like we're in a world that is seeing the first automobile.

258
0:14:01.579,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The first cryptocurrency, like the first car,

259
0:14:05.533,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is slow and hard to understand and hard to use.

260
0:14:10.095,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Digital money, like the horse and carriage,

261
0:14:12.665,000 --> 0:14:13,000
works pretty well,

262
0:14:14.219,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and the whole world economy is built on it.

263
0:14:18.386,000 --> 0:14:2,000
If you were the first person on your block

264
0:14:20.484,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to get a car with an internal combustion engine,

265
0:14:23.279,000 --> 0:14:25,000
your neighbors would probably think you were crazy:

266
0:14:26.321,000 --> 0:14:28,000
"Why would you want this large, clunky machine

267
0:14:28.818,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that breaks down all the time, that lights on fire,

268
0:14:31.747,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and is still slower than a horse?"

269
0:14:34.928,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But we all know how that story turns out.

270
0:14:38.431,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We're entering a new era of programmable money.

271
0:14:42.025,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And it's very exciting, but it's also a little bit scary.

272
0:14:46.691,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Cryptocurrencies can be used for illegal transactions,

273
0:14:50.229,000 --> 0:14:53,000
just like cash is used for crime in the world today.

274
0:14:54.497,000 --> 0:14:56,000
When all of our transactions are online,

275
0:14:56.999,000 --> 0:14:59,000
what does that mean for surveillance -- who can see what we do?

276
0:15:02.115,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Who's advantaged in this new world and who isn't?

277
0:15:05.226,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Will I have to start to pay for things that I didn't have to pay for before?

278
0:15:09.372,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Will we all become slaves to algorithms and utility functions?

279
0:15:15.114,000 --> 0:15:17,000
All new technology comes with trade-offs.

280
0:15:18.012,000 --> 0:15:21,000
The Internet brought us a lot of ways to waste time.

281
0:15:22.375,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But it also greatly increased productivity.

282
0:15:25.731,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Mobile phones are annoying

283
0:15:27.261,000 --> 0:15:29,000
because they make me feel like I have to stay connected to work

284
0:15:30.269,000 --> 0:15:31,000
all the time.

285
0:15:31.448,000 --> 0:15:33,000
But they also help me stay connected to friends and family.

286
0:15:35.274,000 --> 0:15:39,000
The new sharing economy is going to eliminate some jobs.

287
0:15:40.165,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But it's also going to create new, flexible forms of employment.

288
0:15:44.601,000 --> 0:15:45,000
With programmable money,

289
0:15:46.551,000 --> 0:15:5,000
we decouple the need for large, trusted institutions

290
0:15:51.527,000 --> 0:15:53,000
from the architecture of the network.

291
0:15:54.57,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And this pushes innovation in money out to the edges, where it belongs.

292
0:16:00.96,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Programmable money democratizes money.

293
0:16:04.461,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And because of this, things are going to change and unfold

294
0:16:07.243,000 --> 0:16:08,000
in ways that we can't even predict.

295
0:16:10.488,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Thank you.

296
0:16:11.674,000 --> 0:16:14,000
(Applause)

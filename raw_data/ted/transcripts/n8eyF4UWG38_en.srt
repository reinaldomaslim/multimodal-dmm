1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm standing in front of you today

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in all humility,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
wanting to share with you

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
my journey of the last six years

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in the field of service

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and education.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I'm not a trained academic.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Neither am I a veteran social worker.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was 26 years in the corporate world,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
trying to make organizations profitable.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And then in 2003

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
from my kitchen table.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The first thing that we did was walk through the slums.

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You know, by the way, there are two million people

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We couldn't go to all the slums,

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but we tried to cover as much as we could.

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We walked through these slums,

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
identified houses where children would never go to school.

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We talked to the parents,

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
tried to convince them about sending their children to school.

23
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We played with the children,

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and came back home really tired,

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
exhausted, but with images

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of bright faces, twinkling eyes,

27
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and went to sleep.

28
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We were all excited to start,

29
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but the numbers hit us then:

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
200 million children

31
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
between four to 14 that

32
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
should be going to school, but do not;

33
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
100 million children

34
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
who go to school but cannot read;

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
125 million who cannot do basic maths.

36
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees

37
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was dedicated for government schooling.

38
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary

39
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and administrators' salary.

40
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And yet, India has nearly

41
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the highest teacher absenteeism

42
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in the world,

43
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
with one out of four teachers

44
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
not going to school at all the entire academic year.

45
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling,

46
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
overwhelming, and we were constantly asked,

47
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
"When will you start? How many schools will you start?

48
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
How many children will you get?

49
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
How are you going to scale?

50
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
How are you going to replicate?"

51
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.

52
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But we dug our heels

53
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and said, "We're not in the number game.

54
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We want to take one child at a time

55
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and take the child right through school,

56
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
sent to college,

57
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and get them prepared for better living,

58
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
a high value job."

59
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, we started Parikrma.

60
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The first Parikrma school

61
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
started in a slum

62
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
where there were 70,000 people

63
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
living below the poverty line.

64
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Our first school was

65
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
on a rooftop of a building inside the slums,

66
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a second story building, the only second story building

67
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
inside the slums.

68
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And that rooftop did not have

69
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
any ceiling, only half a tin sheet.

70
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.

71
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Indian academic year begins in June.

72
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So, June it rains, so many a times

73
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
all of us would be huddled under the tin roof,

74
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
waiting for the rain to stop.

75
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
My God! What a bonding exercise that was.

76
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And all of us

77
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that were under that roof are still here together today.

78
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Then came the second school,

79
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the third school, the fourth school

80
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and a junior college.

81
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In six years now,

82
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we have four schools, one junior college,

83
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
1,100 children

84
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
coming from 28 slums

85
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and four orphanages.

86
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Applause)

87
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Our dream is very simple:

88
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to send each of these kids, get them prepared

89
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to be educated

90
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but also to live peacefully,

91
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
contented in this conflict-ridden

92
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
chaotic globalized world.

93
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, when you talk global

94
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you have to talk English.

95
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And so all our schools

96
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
are English medium schools.

97
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But they know there is this myth

98
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that children from the slums

99
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
cannot speak English well.

100
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
No one in their family has spoken English.

101
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
No one in their generation has spoken English.

102
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But how wrong it is.

103
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites

104
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear]

105
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and Hardy Boys.

106
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Although they are like

107
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in different contexts,

108
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
one is magical, the other two are like investigation,

109
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I like those books because

110
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they have something special in them.

111
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The vocabulary used in those books

112
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and the style of writing.

113
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I mean like once I pick up one book

114
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.

115
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Even if it takes me four and a half hours,

116
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.

117
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Boy: I did good research and I got the information

118
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
[on the] world's fastest cars.

119
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I like Ducati ZZ143,

120
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because it is the fastest,

121
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the world's fastest bike,

122
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI

123
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter)

124
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Shukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw,

125
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
her father sells flowers on the roadside.

126
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years.

127
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world

128
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
love fast bikes? (Laughter)

129
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course,

130
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but he has done a lot of research through Google search.

131
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You know, when we started with our English medium schools

132
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we also decided to adopt

133
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the best curriculum possible,

134
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the ICSE curriculum.

135
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And again, there were people who laughed at me

136
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and said, "Don't be crazy

137
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
choosing such a tough curriculum for these students.

138
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
They'll never be able to cope."

139
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Not only do our children cope very well,

140
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but they excel in it.

141
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You should just come across to see

142
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
how well our children do.

143
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
There is also this myth that

144
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
parents from the slums

145
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
are not interested in their children going to school;

146
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they'd much rather put them to work.

147
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
That's absolute hogwash.

148
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
All parents all over the world

149
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
want their children to lead a better life than themselves,

150
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but they need to believe that change is possible.

151
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Video: (Hindi)

152
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
SB: We have 80 percent attendance

153
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
for all our parents-teachers meeting.

154
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Sometimes it's even 100 percent,

155
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
much more than many privileged schools.

156
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Fathers have started to attend.

157
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It's very interesting. When we started our school

158
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.

159
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now they have started writing their signature.

160
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The children have taught them.

161
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's amazing how much children can teach.

162
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We have, a few months ago,

163
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
actually late last year,

164
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we had a few mothers who came to us and said,

165
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"You know, we want to learn how to read and write.

166
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool

167
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
for our parents, for our mothers.

168
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We had 25 mothers who came regularly

169
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
after school to study.

170
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We want to continue with this program

171
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and extend it to all our other schools.

172
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics.

173
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
So, you can imagine how traumatized

174
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.

175
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs

176
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and when they come back,

177
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
most times sober, we have to find a job for them

178
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
so that they don't regress.

179
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.

180
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We have taught them nutrition, hygiene.

181
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We have helped them set up the kitchen

182
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and now they are supplying food to all our children.

183
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They do a very good job because

184
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
their children are eating their food,

185
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
but most importantly this is the first time

186
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
they have got respect,

187
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.

188
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
More than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff

189
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
are all parents and extended families.

190
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We've started many programs

191
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
just to make sure that the child comes to school.

192
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Vocational skill program for the older siblings

193
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.

194
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
There is also this myth that children from the slums

195
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
cannot integrate with mainstream.

196
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Take a look at this little girl

197
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who was one of the 28 children

198
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
from all privileged schools,

199
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
best schools in the country

200
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that was selected for the Duke University

201
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
talent identification program

202
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.

203
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Video: Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA,

204
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
it was such a pride for us to go to that camp.

205
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Everybody was very friendly,

206
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
especially I got a lot of friends.

207
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And I felt that my English has improved a lot

208
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
going there and chatting with friends.

209
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
There they met children who are

210
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
with a different standard and

211
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
a different mindset, a totally different society.

212
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I mingled with almost everyone.

213
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
They were very friendly.

214
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I had very good friends there,

215
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.

216
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Even now we are in touch through Facebook.

217
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
After this Ahmedabad trip

218
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I've been like a totally different

219
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
mingling with people and all of those.

220
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Before that I feel like I wasn't like this.

221
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.

222
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
My accent with English improved a lot.

223
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And I learned football, volleyball,

224
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Frisbee, lots of games.

225
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.

226
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Such beautiful food,

227
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.

228
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I enjoyed eating food like

229
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
[unclear] would come and ask me,

230
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear!

231
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

233
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
SB: This girl was working as a maid

234
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
before she came to school.

235
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And today she wants to be a neurologist.

236
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Our children are doing brilliantly in sports.

237
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They are really excelling.

238
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
There is an inter-school athletic competition

239
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that is held every year

240
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate

241
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
from 140 best schools in the city.

242
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We've got the best school award for three years successively.

243
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And our children are coming back home

244
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.

245
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Last year there were a couple of kids

246
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
from elite schools that came

247
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to ask for admissions in our school.

248
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We also have our very own dream team.

249
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Why is this happening? Why this confidence?

250
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Is it the exposure? We have professors

251
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford,

252
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Indian Institute of Science

253
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas,

254
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
experiments, much beyond the classroom.

255
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Art, music are considered

256
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
therapy and mediums of expression.

257
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We also believe that

258
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it's the content that is more important.

259
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It is not the infrastructure,

260
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
not the toilets, not the libraries,

261
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but it is what actually happens in this school

262
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that is more important.

263
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Creating an environment of learning,

264
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of inquiry, of exploration

265
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
is what is true education.

266
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
When we started Parikrma

267
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
we had no idea which direction we were taking.

268
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.

269
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
But we know for sure that

270
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
what we want to do today is

271
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
take one child at a time,

272
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
not get bogged with numbers,

273
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and actually see the child complete

274
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
the circle of life,

275
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and unleash his total potential.

276
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We do not believe in scale

277
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
because we believe in quality,

278
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and scale and numbers will automatically happen.

279
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We have corporates that have stood behind us,

280
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and we are able to, now, open more schools.

281
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But we began with the idea

282
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
of one child at a time.

283
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
This is five-year-old Parusharam.

284
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
He was begging

285
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
by a bus stop a few years ago,

286
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
got picked up and is now in an orphanage,

287
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
has been coming to school for the last four and a half months.

288
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
He's in kindergarten.

289
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
He has learned how to speak English.

290
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We have a model by which kids can speak English

291
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and understand English

292
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
in three month's time.

293
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
He can tell you stories in English

294
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile

295
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and of the giraffe.

296
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And if you ask him what he likes to do

297
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
he will say, "I like sleeping.

298
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I like eating. I like playing."

299
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And if you ask him what he wants to do,

300
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
he will say, "I want to horsing."

301
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.

302
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So, Parusharam comes to my office every day.

303
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
He comes for a tummy rub,

304
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
because he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter)

305
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
When I started Parikrma

306
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I began with a great deal of arrogance

307
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of transforming the world.

308
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But today I have been transformed.

309
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I have been changed with my children.

310
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I've learned so much from them:

311
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
love, compassion, imagination

312
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and such creativity.

313
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Parusharam is Parikrma

314
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
with a simple beginning but a long way to go.

315
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
I promise you, Parusharam

316
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
will speak in the TED conference a few years from now.

317
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Thank you.

318
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
(Applause)

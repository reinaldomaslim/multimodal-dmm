1
0:00:13.961,000 --> 0:00:16,000
There is nothing bigger or older than the universe.

2
0:00:19.66,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The questions I would like to talk about are:

3
0:00:25.509,000 --> 0:00:28,000
one, where did we come from?

4
0:00:29.977,000 --> 0:00:31,000
How did the universe come into being?

5
0:00:34.167,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Are we alone in the universe?

6
0:00:37.153,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Is there alien life out there?

7
0:00:40.296,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What is the future of the human race?

8
0:00:43.606,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Up until the 1920s,

9
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
everyone thought the universe was essentially static

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and unchanging in time.

11
0:00:52.222,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding.

12
0:00:56.841,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Distant galaxies were moving away from us.

13
0:01:01.664,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This meant they must have been closer together in the past.

14
0:01:06.413,000 --> 0:01:08,000
If we extrapolate back,

15
0:01:08.54,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we find we must have all been on top of each other

16
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
about 15 billion years ago.

17
0:01:15.856,000 --> 0:01:18,000
This was the Big Bang, the beginning of the universe.

18
0:01:20.666,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But was there anything before the Big Bang?

19
0:01:24.643,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If not, what created the universe?

20
0:01:28.483,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did?

21
0:01:34.35,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We used to think that the theory of the universe

22
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
could be divided into two parts.

23
0:01:40.67,000 --> 0:01:41,000
First, there were the laws

24
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
like Maxwell's equations and general relativity

25
0:01:45.848,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that determined the evolution of the universe,

26
0:01:48.837,000 --> 0:01:51,000
given its state over all of space at one time.

27
0:01:53.468,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And second, there was no question of the initial state of the universe.

28
0:01:59.911,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We have made good progress on the first part,

29
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution

30
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in all but the most extreme conditions.

31
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But until recently, we have had little idea

32
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
about the initial conditions for the universe.

33
0:02:16.397,000 --> 0:02:21,000
However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions

34
0:02:21.85,000 --> 0:02:24,000
depends on time and space being separate and distinct.

35
0:02:26.834,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory

36
0:02:31.659,000 --> 0:02:34,000
allow time to behave like another dimension of space.

37
0:02:39.772,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This removes the distinction between time and space,

38
0:02:43.383,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state.

39
0:02:51.57,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.

40
0:02:58.757,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Moreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe

41
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
was created in different states.

42
0:03:06.593,000 --> 0:03:08,000
These predictions are in excellent agreement

43
0:03:08.946,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background,

44
0:03:15.142,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which is an imprint of the very early universe.

45
0:03:20.05,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We think we have solved the mystery of creation.

46
0:03:24.396,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Maybe we should patent the universe

47
0:03:26.952,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and charge everyone royalties for their existence.

48
0:03:33.562,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I now turn to the second big question:

49
0:03:36.538,000 --> 0:03:39,000
are we alone, or is there other life in the universe?

50
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth,

51
0:03:47.849,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets,

52
0:03:52.723,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy.

53
0:03:58.888,000 --> 0:04:,000
But we don't know how life first appeared.

54
0:04:04.264,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We have two pieces of observational evidence

55
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
on the probability of life appearing.

56
0:04:12.062,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago.

57
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago

58
0:04:23.34,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years.

59
0:04:33.59,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So life appeared on Earth

60
0:04:35.439,000 --> 0:04:38,000
within half a billion years of it being possible,

61
0:04:39.115,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime

62
0:04:42.815,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of a planet of Earth type.

63
0:04:45.584,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.

64
0:04:51.426,000 --> 0:04:54,000
If it was very low, one would have expected it

65
0:04:54.678,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to take most of the ten billion years available.

66
0:04:59.17,000 --> 0:05:03,000
On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens.

67
0:05:04.858,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I am discounting the reports of UFOs.

68
0:05:08.818,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos?

69
0:05:14.637,000 --> 0:05:18,000
If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports

70
0:05:18.726,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring,

71
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far.

72
0:05:32.446,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Furthermore, despite an extensive search by the SETI project,

73
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we haven't heard any alien television quiz shows.

74
0:05:42.294,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations

75
0:05:46.605,000 --> 0:05:48,000
at our stage of development

76
0:05:48.875,000 --> 0:05:51,000
within a radius of a few hundred light years.

77
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Issuing an insurance policy

78
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.

79
0:06:02.269,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This brings me to the last of the big questions:

80
0:06:05.579,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the future of the human race.

81
0:06:08.821,000 --> 0:06:11,000
If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy,

82
0:06:12.504,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we should make sure we survive and continue.

83
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history.

84
0:06:28.124,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth

85
0:06:32.982,000 --> 0:06:34,000
are growing exponentially,

86
0:06:35.078,000 --> 0:06:39,000
along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill.

87
0:06:44.869,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But our genetic code

88
0:06:46.639,000 --> 0:06:49,000
still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts

89
0:06:49.67,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that were of survival advantage in the past.

90
0:06:57.091,000 --> 0:07:,000
It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster

91
0:07:00.136,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in the next hundred years,

92
0:07:01.876,000 --> 0:07:03,000
let alone the next thousand or million.

93
0:07:08.667,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Our only chance of long-term survival

94
0:07:11.802,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth,

95
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but to spread out into space.

96
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The answers to these big questions

97
0:07:22.604,000 --> 0:07:26,000
show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years.

98
0:07:28.456,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years,

99
0:07:32.503,000 --> 0:07:34,000
our future is in space.

100
0:07:36.723,000 --> 0:07:38,000
That is why I am in favor of manned --

101
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
or should I say, personned -- space flight.

102
0:07:48.066,000 --> 0:07:52,000
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe

103
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and find answers to these questions.

104
0:07:55.665,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I have been very lucky

105
0:07:57.522,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that my disability has not been a serious handicap.

106
0:08:01.603,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people

107
0:08:06.266,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to pursue the quest for knowledge.

108
0:08:12.166,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe,

109
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and we are making good progress.

110
0:08:22.319,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Thank you for listening.

111
0:08:26.62,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Chris Anderson: Professor, if you had to guess either way,

112
0:08:29.998,000 --> 0:08:32,000
do you now believe that it is more likely than not

113
0:08:33.828,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that we are alone in the Milky Way,

114
0:08:37.17,000 --> 0:08:42,000
as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher?

115
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight

116
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.

117
0:09:18.643,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Stephen Hawking: I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization

118
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
within several hundred light years;

119
0:09:26.519,000 --> 0:09:29,000
otherwise we would have heard radio waves.

120
0:09:32.632,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The alternative is that civilizations don't last very long,

121
0:09:37.136,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but destroy themselves.

122
0:09:40.83,000 --> 0:09:43,000
CA: Professor Hawking, thank you for that answer.

123
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We will take it as a salutary warning, I think,

124
0:09:47.133,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for the rest of our conference this week.

125
0:09:50.261,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Professor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made

126
0:09:54.451,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to share your questions with us today.

127
0:09:57.388,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Thank you very much indeed.

128
0:09:59.064,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Applause)

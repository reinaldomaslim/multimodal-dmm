1
0:00:13.12,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Seven years ago, a student came to me and asked me to invest in his company.

2
0:00:17.56,000 --> 0:00:18,000
He said, "I'm working with three friends,

3
0:00:19.56,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and we're going to try to disrupt an industry by selling stuff online."

4
0:00:23.64,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I said, "OK, you guys spent the whole summer on this, right?"

5
0:00:26.72,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"No, we all took internships just in case it doesn't work out."

6
0:00:29.88,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"All right, but you're going to go in full time once you graduate."

7
0:00:33.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Not exactly. We've all lined up backup jobs."

8
0:00:37.6,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Six months go by,

9
0:00:38.88,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it's the day before the company launches,

10
0:00:40.88,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and there is still not a functioning website.

11
0:00:43.4,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"You guys realize, the entire company is a website.

12
0:00:45.84,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That's literally all it is."

13
0:00:48.8,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I obviously declined to invest.

14
0:00:53.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And they ended up naming the company Warby Parker.

15
0:00:55.92,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:57.56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
They sell glasses online.

17
0:01:00.48,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They were recently recognized as the world's most innovative company

18
0:01:03.72,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and valued at over a billion dollars.

19
0:01:05.76,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And now? My wife handles our investments.

20
0:01:10.88,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Why was I so wrong?

21
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
To find out, I've been studying people that I come to call "originals."

22
0:01:17.2,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Originals are nonconformists,

23
0:01:19.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
people who not only have new ideas

24
0:01:21.48,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but take action to champion them.

25
0:01:23.92,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They are people who stand out and speak up.

26
0:01:26.48,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Originals drive creativity and change in the world.

27
0:01:29.44,000 --> 0:01:31,000
They're the people you want to bet on.

28
0:01:31.6,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And they look nothing like I expected.

29
0:01:34.76,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I want to show you today three things I've learned

30
0:01:37.2,000 --> 0:01:39,000
about recognizing originals

31
0:01:39.24,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and becoming a little bit more like them.

32
0:01:42.44,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So the first reason that I passed on Warby Parker

33
0:01:45.8,000 --> 0:01:47,000
was they were really slow getting off the ground.

34
0:01:49.08,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, you are all intimately familiar with the mind of a procrastinator.

35
0:01:54.96,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Well, I have a confession for you. I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator.

36
0:02:00.12,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Yes, that's an actual term.

37
0:02:01.48,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You know that panic you feel a few hours before a big deadline

38
0:02:04.44,000 --> 0:02:05,000
when you haven't done anything yet.

39
0:02:06.76,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I just feel that a few months ahead of time.

40
0:02:09.12,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:11.92,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So this started early: when I was a kid, I took Nintendo games very seriously.

42
0:02:18.6,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I would wake up at 5am,

43
0:02:20.639,000 --> 0:02:22,000
start playing and not stop until I had mastered them.

44
0:02:24.32,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Eventually it got so out of hand that a local newspaper came

45
0:02:27.84,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and did a story on the dark side of Nintendo, starring me.

46
0:02:31.84,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:34.72,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Since then, I have traded hair for teeth.

49
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But this served me well in college,

51
0:02:52.04,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because I finished my senior thesis four months before the deadline.

52
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And I was proud of that, until a few years ago.

53
0:03:01.84,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I had a student named Jihae, who came to me and said,

54
0:03:05.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"I have my most creative ideas when I'm procrastinating."

55
0:03:09.36,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I was like, "That's cute, where are the four papers you owe me?"

56
0:03:12.6,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:15,000
No, she was one of our most creative students,

58
0:03:15.92,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and as an organizational psychologist, this is the kind of idea that I test.

59
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So I challenged her to get some data.

60
0:03:22.24,000 --> 0:03:23,000
She goes into a bunch of companies.

61
0:03:23.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
She has people fill out surveys about how often they procrastinate.

62
0:03:27.4,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Then she gets their bosses to rate how creative and innovative they are.

63
0:03:31.04,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And sure enough, the precrastinators like me,

64
0:03:33.92,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who rush in and do everything early

65
0:03:35.88,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are rated as less creative

66
0:03:37.64,000 --> 0:03:38,000
than people who procrastinate moderately.

67
0:03:40.48,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I want to know what happens to the chronic procrastinators.

68
0:03:43.68,000 --> 0:03:45,000
She was like, "I don't know. They didn't fill out my survey."

69
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:49.12,000 --> 0:03:5,000
No, here are our results.

71
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You actually do see that the people who wait until the last minute

72
0:03:55.84,000 --> 0:03:58,000
are so busy goofing off that they don't have any new ideas.

73
0:04:00.68,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And on the flip side, the people who race in

74
0:04:03.92,000 --> 0:04:06,000
are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they don't have original thoughts either.

75
0:04:09.4,000 --> 0:04:12,000
There's a sweet spot where originals seem to live.

76
0:04:13.88,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Why is this?

77
0:04:15.52,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Maybe original people just have bad work habits.

78
0:04:18.44,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Maybe procrastinating does not cause creativity.

79
0:04:22.2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
To find out, we designed some experiments.

80
0:04:25.44,000 --> 0:04:27,000
We asked people to generate new business ideas,

81
0:04:28.279,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and then we get independent readers

82
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to evaluate how creative and useful they are.

83
0:04:33.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And some of them are asked to do the task right away.

84
0:04:36.64,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Others we randomly assign to procrastinate

85
0:04:39.2,000 --> 0:04:41,000
by dangling Minesweeper in front of them

86
0:04:41.84,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for either five or 10 minutes.

87
0:04:43.92,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And sure enough, the moderate procrastinators

88
0:04:47.08,000 --> 0:04:5,000
are 16 percent more creative than the other two groups.

89
0:04:51.6,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, Minesweeper is awesome, but it's not the driver of the effect,

90
0:04:54.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because if you play the game first before you learn about the task,

91
0:04:58,000 --> 0:04:59,000
there's no creativity boost.

92
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's only when you're told that you're going to be working on this problem,

93
0:05:03.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and then you start procrastinating,

94
0:05:04.96,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but the task is still active in the back of your mind,

95
0:05:07.52,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that you start to incubate.

96
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Procrastination gives you time to consider divergent ideas,

97
0:05:12.64,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to think in nonlinear ways, to make unexpected leaps.

98
0:05:16.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So just as we were finishing these experiments,

99
0:05:18.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I was starting to write a book about originals,

100
0:05:21.48,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and I thought, "This is the perfect time to teach myself to procrastinate,

101
0:05:26.04,000 --> 0:05:28,000
while writing a chapter on procrastination."

102
0:05:28.72,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So I metaprocrastinated,

103
0:05:32.12,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and like any self-respecting precrastinator,

104
0:05:35.52,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I woke up early the next morning

105
0:05:37.12,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I made a to-do list with steps on how to procrastinate.

106
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:43.32,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And then I worked diligently

108
0:05:47.08,000 --> 0:05:5,000
toward my goal of not making progress toward my goal.

109
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I started writing the procrastination chapter,

110
0:05:54.36,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and one day -- I was halfway through --

111
0:05:56.28,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I literally put it away in mid-sentence

112
0:05:58.2,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for months.

113
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It was agony.

114
0:06:02.64,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But when I came back to it, I had all sorts of new ideas.

115
0:06:06.56,000 --> 0:06:07,000
As Aaron Sorkin put it,

116
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"You call it procrastinating. I call it thinking."

117
0:06:12.2,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And along the way I discovered

118
0:06:13.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that a lot of great originals in history were procrastinators.

119
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Take Leonardo da Vinci.

120
0:06:19.48,000 --> 0:06:22,000
He toiled on and off for 16 years

121
0:06:23.04,000 --> 0:06:24,000
on the Mona Lisa.

122
0:06:24.84,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He felt like a failure.

123
0:06:26.28,000 --> 0:06:27,000
He wrote as much in his journal.

124
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But some of the diversions he took in optics

125
0:06:32.84,000 --> 0:06:33,000
transformed the way that he modeled light

126
0:06:34.84,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and made him into a much better painter.

127
0:06:37.76,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What about Martin Luther King, Jr.?

128
0:06:40.48,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The night before the biggest speech of his life,

129
0:06:42.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the March on Washington,

130
0:06:44.04,000 --> 0:06:46,000
he was up past 3am, rewriting it.

131
0:06:46.8,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He's sitting in the audience waiting for his turn to go onstage,

132
0:06:50.24,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and he is still scribbling notes and crossing out lines.

133
0:06:54.76,000 --> 0:06:56,000
When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in,

134
0:06:56.84,000 --> 0:06:57,000
he leaves his prepared remarks

135
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to utter four words that changed the course of history:

136
0:07:01.96,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"I have a dream."

137
0:07:04.08,000 --> 0:07:06,000
That was not in the script.

138
0:07:07.08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
By delaying the task of finalizing the speech until the very last minute,

139
0:07:11.76,000 --> 0:07:14,000
he left himself open to the widest range of possible ideas.

140
0:07:15.52,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And because the text wasn't set in stone,

141
0:07:17.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
he had freedom to improvise.

142
0:07:20.64,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Procrastinating is a vice when it comes to productivity,

143
0:07:23.84,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but it can be a virtue for creativity.

144
0:07:27.4,000 --> 0:07:29,000
What you see with a lot of great originals

145
0:07:29.44,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is that they are quick to start but they're slow to finish.

146
0:07:33.08,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And this is what I missed with Warby Parker.

147
0:07:35.72,000 --> 0:07:37,000
When they were dragging their heels for six months,

148
0:07:38.4,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I looked at them and said,

149
0:07:40.04,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"You know, a lot of other companies are starting to sell glasses online."

150
0:07:43.52,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They missed the first-mover advantage.

151
0:07:46.2,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But what I didn't realize was they were spending all that time

152
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
trying to figure out how to get people

153
0:07:51.04,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to be comfortable ordering glasses online.

154
0:07:53.064,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And it turns out the first-mover advantage is mostly a myth.

155
0:07:56.08,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Look at a classic study of over 50 product categories,

156
0:07:59.92,000 --> 0:08:01,000
comparing the first movers who created the market

157
0:08:02.44,000 --> 0:08:05,000
with the improvers who introduced something different and better.

158
0:08:06.92,000 --> 0:08:09,000
What you see is that the first movers had a failure rate of 47 percent,

159
0:08:10.92,000 --> 0:08:13,000
compared with only 8 percent for the improvers.

160
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Look at Facebook, waiting to build a social network

161
0:08:17.56,000 --> 0:08:2,000
until after Myspace and Friendster.

162
0:08:21.04,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Look at Google, waiting for years after Altavista and Yahoo.

163
0:08:24.84,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's much easier to improve on somebody else's idea

164
0:08:27.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
than it is to create something new from scratch.

165
0:08:30.88,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So the lesson I learned is that to be original you don't have to be first.

166
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
You just have to be different and better.

167
0:08:38.36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But that wasn't the only reason I passed on Warby Parker.

168
0:08:41.36,000 --> 0:08:43,000
They were also full of doubts.

169
0:08:43.8,000 --> 0:08:44,000
They had backup plans lined up,

170
0:08:45.64,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and that made me doubt that they had the courage to be original,

171
0:08:49.08,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because I expected that originals would look something like this.

172
0:08:55.039,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:58.68,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, on the surface,

174
0:09:00.32,000 --> 0:09:01,000
a lot of original people look confident,

175
0:09:02.32,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but behind the scenes,

176
0:09:03.6,000 --> 0:09:06,000
they feel the same fear and doubt that the rest of us do.

177
0:09:06.64,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They just manage it differently.

178
0:09:08.84,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Let me show you: this is a depiction

179
0:09:10.6,000 --> 0:09:12,000
of how the creative process works for most of us.

180
0:09:16.12,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

181
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Now, in my research, I discovered there are two different kinds of doubt.

182
0:09:23.64,000 --> 0:09:24,000
There's self-doubt and idea doubt.

183
0:09:25.32,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Self-doubt is paralyzing.

184
0:09:26.88,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It leads you to freeze.

185
0:09:28.52,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But idea doubt is energizing.

186
0:09:30.28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine,

187
0:09:33.08,000 --> 0:09:35,000
just like MLK did.

188
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And so the key to being original

189
0:09:38.44,000 --> 0:09:39,000
is just a simple thing

190
0:09:40.2,000 --> 0:09:43,000
of avoiding the leap from step three to step four.

191
0:09:43.6,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Instead of saying, "I'm crap,"

192
0:09:45.44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you say, "The first few drafts are always crap,

193
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and I'm just not there yet."

194
0:09:50.92,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So how do you get there?

195
0:09:52.56,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Well, there's a clue, it turns out,

196
0:09:54.48,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in the Internet browser that you use.

197
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
We can predict your job performance and your commitment

198
0:09:59.64,000 --> 0:10:01,000
just by knowing what web browser you use.

199
0:10:03.44,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Now, some of you are not going to like the results of this study --

200
0:10:06.64,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Laughter)

201
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But there is good evidence that Firefox and Chrome users

202
0:10:11.96,000 --> 0:10:14,000
significantly outperform Internet Explorer and Safari users.

203
0:10:15.96,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Yes.

204
0:10:17.32,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Applause)

205
0:10:19.2,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They also stay in their jobs 15 percent longer, by the way.

206
0:10:23.12,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Why? It's not a technical advantage.

207
0:10:25.32,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The four browser groups on average have similar typing speed

208
0:10:28.72,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and they also have similar levels of computer knowledge.

209
0:10:31.88,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's about how you got the browser.

210
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Because if you use Internet Explorer or Safari,

211
0:10:36.48,000 --> 0:10:38,000
those came preinstalled on your computer,

212
0:10:39.04,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and you accepted the default option that was handed to you.

213
0:10:42.6,000 --> 0:10:45,000
If you wanted Firefox or Chrome, you had to doubt the default

214
0:10:45.64,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and ask, is there a different option out there,

215
0:10:47.92,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and then be a little resourceful and download a new browser.

216
0:10:51.76,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So people hear about this study and they're like,

217
0:10:54.12,000 --> 0:10:57,000
"Great, if I want to get better at my job, I just need to upgrade my browser?"

218
0:10:57.84,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:58.88,000 --> 0:11:,000
No, it's about being the kind of person

220
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
who takes the initiative to doubt the default

221
0:11:03.44,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and look for a better option.

222
0:11:05.6,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And if you do that well,

223
0:11:07.12,000 --> 0:11:09,000
you will open yourself up to the opposite of déjà vu.

224
0:11:10.6,000 --> 0:11:13,000
There's a name for it. It's called vuja de.

225
0:11:13.76,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

226
0:11:16.8,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Vuja de is when you look at something you've seen many times before

227
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and all of a sudden see it with fresh eyes.

228
0:11:23.92,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's a screenwriter who looks at a movie script

229
0:11:26.56,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that can't get the green light for more than half a century.

230
0:11:29.56,000 --> 0:11:33,000
In every past version, the main character has been an evil queen.

231
0:11:34.28,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But Jennifer Lee starts to question whether that makes sense.

232
0:11:37.44,000 --> 0:11:38,000
She rewrites the first act,

233
0:11:38.92,000 --> 0:11:4,000
reinvents the villain as a tortured hero

234
0:11:41.56,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and Frozen becomes the most successful animated movie ever.

235
0:11:45.6,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So there's a simple message from this story.

236
0:11:47.72,000 --> 0:11:49,000
When you feel doubt, don't let it go.

237
0:11:50.68,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

238
0:11:53.64,000 --> 0:11:54,000
What about fear?

239
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Originals feel fear, too.

240
0:11:57.6,000 --> 0:11:58,000
They're afraid of failing,

241
0:11:59.48,000 --> 0:12:01,000
but what sets them apart from the rest of us

242
0:12:01.6,000 --> 0:12:03,000
is that they're even more afraid of failing to try.

243
0:12:04.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
They know you can fail by starting a business that goes bankrupt

244
0:12:07.36,000 --> 0:12:09,000
or by failing to start a business at all.

245
0:12:10.48,000 --> 0:12:13,000
They know that in the long run, our biggest regrets are not our actions

246
0:12:14.04,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but our inactions.

247
0:12:15.72,000 --> 0:12:17,000
The things we wish we could redo, if you look at the science,

248
0:12:18.602,000 --> 0:12:2,000
are the chances not taken.

249
0:12:21.72,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Elon Musk told me recently, he didn't expect Tesla to succeed.

250
0:12:25.4,000 --> 0:12:27,000
He was sure the first few SpaceX launches

251
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
would fail to make it to orbit, let alone get back,

252
0:12:31.36,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but it was too important not to try.

253
0:12:34.36,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And for so many of us, when we have an important idea,

254
0:12:36.92,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we don't bother to try.

255
0:12:38.96,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But I have some good news for you.

256
0:12:41.04,000 --> 0:12:43,000
You are not going to get judged on your bad ideas.

257
0:12:43.64,000 --> 0:12:44,000
A lot of people think they will.

258
0:12:45.28,000 --> 0:12:46,000
If you look across industries

259
0:12:46.96,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and ask people about their biggest idea, their most important suggestion,

260
0:12:50.88,000 --> 0:12:53,000
85 percent of them stayed silent instead of speaking up.

261
0:12:55.24,000 --> 0:12:58,000
They were afraid of embarrassing themselves, of looking stupid.

262
0:12:58.68,000 --> 0:13:01,000
But guess what? Originals have lots and lots of bad ideas,

263
0:13:02.12,000 --> 0:13:03,000
tons of them, in fact.

264
0:13:04.56,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Take the guy who invented this.

265
0:13:07.4,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Do you care that he came up with a talking doll so creepy

266
0:13:10.12,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that it scared not only kids but adults, too?

267
0:13:13.92,000 --> 0:13:17,000
No. You celebrate Thomas Edison for pioneering the light bulb.

268
0:13:18.28,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:20.68,000 --> 0:13:22,000
If you look across fields,

270
0:13:23.12,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the greatest originals are the ones who fail the most,

271
0:13:26.12,000 --> 0:13:28,000
because they're the ones who try the most.

272
0:13:28.44,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Take classical composers, the best of the best.

273
0:13:31.44,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Why do some of them get more pages in encyclopedias than others

274
0:13:34.6,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and also have their compositions rerecorded more times?

275
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:39,000
One of the best predictors

276
0:13:39.32,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is the sheer volume of compositions that they generate.

277
0:13:43.24,000 --> 0:13:46,000
The more output you churn out, the more variety you get

278
0:13:46.36,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and the better your chances of stumbling on something truly original.

279
0:13:50.12,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Even the three icons of classical music -- Bach, Beethoven, Mozart --

280
0:13:54.48,000 --> 0:13:57,000
had to generate hundreds and hundreds of compositions

281
0:13:57.52,000 --> 0:14:,000
to come up with a much smaller number of masterpieces.

282
0:14:01.84,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Now, you may be wondering,

283
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:06,000
how did this guy become great without doing a whole lot?

284
0:14:07.52,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I don't know how Wagner pulled that off.

285
0:14:10.76,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But for most of us, if we want to be more original,

286
0:14:13.4,000 --> 0:14:15,000
we have to generate more ideas.

287
0:14:16.52,000 --> 0:14:19,000
The Warby Parker founders, when they were trying to name their company,

288
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
they needed something sophisticated, unique, with no negative associations

289
0:14:23.68,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to build a retail brand,

290
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and they tested over 2,000 possibilities

291
0:14:27.64,000 --> 0:14:28,000
before they finally put together

292
0:14:29.32,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Warby and Parker.

293
0:14:32.04,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So if you put all this together, what you see is that originals

294
0:14:35.04,000 --> 0:14:37,000
are not that different from the rest of us.

295
0:14:37.72,000 --> 0:14:4,000
They feel fear and doubt. They procrastinate.

296
0:14:40.88,000 --> 0:14:42,000
They have bad ideas.

297
0:14:42.92,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And sometimes, it's not in spite of those qualities but because of them

298
0:14:46.28,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that they succeed.

299
0:14:48.04,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So when you see those things, don't make the same mistake I did.

300
0:14:51.12,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Don't write them off.

301
0:14:52.4,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And when that's you, don't count yourself out either.

302
0:14:55.4,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Know that being quick to start but slow to finish

303
0:14:57.88,000 --> 0:14:58,000
can boost your creativity,

304
0:14:59.52,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that you can motivate yourself by doubting your ideas

305
0:15:02.08,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and embracing the fear of failing to try,

306
0:15:04.68,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and that you need a lot of bad ideas in order to get a few good ones.

307
0:15:08.88,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Look, being original is not easy,

308
0:15:11.36,000 --> 0:15:12,000
but I have no doubt about this:

309
0:15:13.32,000 --> 0:15:15,000
it's the best way to improve the world around us.

310
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Thank you.

311
0:15:17.4,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.285,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This is a strange and wonderful brain,

2
0:00:17.476,000 --> 0:00:22,000
one that gives rise to an idea of a kind of alternative intelligence

3
0:00:22.997,000 --> 0:00:23,000
on this planet.

4
0:00:24.769,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is a brain that is formed in a very strange body,

5
0:00:29.894,000 --> 0:00:32,000
one that has the equivalent of small satellite brains

6
0:00:33.861,000 --> 0:00:35,000
distributed throughout that body.

7
0:00:36.684,000 --> 0:00:39,000
How different is it from the human brain?

8
0:00:39.786,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Very different, so it seems,

9
0:00:41.954,000 --> 0:00:45,000
so much so that my colleagues and I are struggling to understand

10
0:00:46.309,000 --> 0:00:47,000
how that brain works.

11
0:00:48.1,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But what I can tell you for certain

12
0:00:50.516,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is that this brain is capable of some amazing things.

13
0:00:55.435,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So, who does this brain belong to?

14
0:00:59.153,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Well, join me for a little bit of diving into the ocean,

15
0:01:02.444,000 --> 0:01:03,000
where life began,

16
0:01:04.398,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and let's have a look.

17
0:01:07.471,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You may have seen some of this before,

18
0:01:09.529,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but we're behind a coral reef, and there's this rock out there,

19
0:01:12.962,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a lot of sand, fishes swimming around ...

20
0:01:15.528,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And all of a sudden this octopus appears,

21
0:01:18.092,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and now it flashes white,

22
0:01:20.614,000 --> 0:01:21,000
inks in my face and jets away.

23
0:01:22.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In slow motion reverse,

24
0:01:23.613,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you see the ring develop around the eye,

25
0:01:25.699,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and then the pattern develops in the skin.

26
0:01:28.071,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And now watch the 3-D texture of the skin change

27
0:01:31.511,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to really create this beautiful, 3-D camouflage.

28
0:01:36.249,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So there are 25 million color organs called "chromatophores" in the skin,

29
0:01:41.875,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and all those bumps out there, which we call "papillae,"

30
0:01:44.89,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and they're all neurally controlled and can change instantaneously.

31
0:01:48.391,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I would argue that dynamic camouflage

32
0:01:51.798,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is a form of "intelligence."

33
0:01:55.021,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The level of complexity of the skin with fast precision change

34
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:02:,000
is really quite astonishing.

35
0:02:00.706,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So what can you do with this skin?

36
0:02:03.31,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Well, let's think a little bit about other things besides camouflage

37
0:02:06.762,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that they can do with their skin.

38
0:02:08.636,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Here you see the mimic octopus and a pattern.

39
0:02:11.513,000 --> 0:02:13,000
All of a sudden, it changes dramatically --

40
0:02:13.569,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that's signaling, not camouflage.

41
0:02:15.218,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And then it goes back to the normal pattern.

42
0:02:17.44,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Then you see the broadclub cuttlefish

43
0:02:19.71,000 --> 0:02:23,000
showing this passing cloud display as it approaches a crab prey.

44
0:02:24.213,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And finally, you see the flamboyant cuttlefish in camouflage

45
0:02:27.901,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and it can shift instantly to this bright warning display.

46
0:02:32.75,000 --> 0:02:36,000
What we have here is a sliding scale of expression,

47
0:02:37.758,000 --> 0:02:38,000
a continuum, if you will,

48
0:02:39.393,000 --> 0:02:42,000
between conspicuousness and camouflage.

49
0:02:42.484,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And this requires a lot of control.

50
0:02:44.909,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Well, guess what?

51
0:02:46.107,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Brains are really good for control.

52
0:02:48.735,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The brain of the octopus shown here has 35 lobes to the brain,

53
0:02:53.096,000 --> 0:02:55,000
80 million tiny cells.

54
0:02:55.515,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And even though that's interesting,

55
0:02:58.157,000 --> 0:03:,000
what's really odd is that the skin of this animal

56
0:03:00.481,000 --> 0:03:04,000
has many more neurons, as illustrated here, especially in the yellow.

57
0:03:04.752,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There are 300 million neurons in the skin

58
0:03:07.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and only 80 million in the brain itself --

59
0:03:09.924,000 --> 0:03:1,000
four times as many.

60
0:03:11.479,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, if you look at that,

61
0:03:13.096,000 --> 0:03:16,000
there's actually one of those little satellite brains

62
0:03:16.977,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and the equivalent of the spinal cord for each of the eight arms.

63
0:03:20.077,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is a very unusual way to construct a nervous system in a body.

64
0:03:23.816,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Well, what is that brain good for?

65
0:03:25.758,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That brain has to outwit other big, smart brains

66
0:03:29.419,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that are trying to eat it,

67
0:03:31.141,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and that includes porpoises and seals

68
0:03:34.23,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and barracudas and sharks

69
0:03:35.87,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and even us humans.

70
0:03:37.77,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So decision-making is one of the things that this brain has to do,

71
0:03:42.582,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and it does a very good job of it.

72
0:03:44.331,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Shown here, you see this octopus perambulating along,

73
0:03:47.641,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and then it suddenly stops and creates that perfect camouflage.

74
0:03:51.905,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And it's really marvelous,

75
0:03:53.221,000 --> 0:03:55,000
because when these animals forage in the wild,

76
0:03:56.031,000 --> 0:03:58,000
they have to make over a hundred camouflaging decisions

77
0:03:59.001,000 --> 0:04:,000
in a two-hour forage,

78
0:04:00.276,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and they do that twice a day.

79
0:04:01.855,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So, decision-making.

80
0:04:03.047,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They're also figuring out where to go and how to get back home.

81
0:04:06.217,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So it's a decision-making thing.

82
0:04:08.083,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We can test this camouflage,

83
0:04:09.615,000 --> 0:04:11,000
like that cuttlefish you see behind me,

84
0:04:11.73,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where we pull the rug out from under it

85
0:04:13.694,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and give it a checkerboard,

86
0:04:15.211,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and it even uses that strange visual information

87
0:04:17.649,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and does its best to match the pattern with a little ad-libbing.

88
0:04:21.563,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So other cognitive skills are important, too.

89
0:04:24.537,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The squids have a different kind of smarts, if you will.

90
0:04:28.215,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They have an extremely complex, interesting sex life.

91
0:04:32.9,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They have fighting and flirting and courting and mate-guarding

92
0:04:38.023,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and deception.

93
0:04:40.131,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Sound familiar?

94
0:04:41.558,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:42.631,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And it's really quite amazing

96
0:04:44.175,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that these animals have this kind of intuitive ability

97
0:04:47.956,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to do these behaviors.

98
0:04:49.434,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Here you see a male and a female.

99
0:04:51.07,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The male, on the left, has been fighting off other males

100
0:04:53.782,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to pair with the female,

101
0:04:54.972,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and now he's showing a dual pattern.

102
0:04:56.736,000 --> 0:04:58,000
He shows courtship and love on her side,

103
0:04:59.055,000 --> 0:05:,000
fighting on the other.

104
0:05:00.75,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Watch him when she shifts places --

105
0:05:02.947,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:04.004,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and you see that he has fluidly changed the love-courtship pattern

107
0:05:07.597,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to the side of the female.

108
0:05:10.015,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So this kind of dual signaling simultaneously

109
0:05:12.481,000 --> 0:05:14,000
with a changing behavioral context

110
0:05:14.655,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is really extraordinary.

111
0:05:16.169,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It takes a lot of brain power.

112
0:05:17.823,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, another way to look at this is that, hmm,

113
0:05:20.381,000 --> 0:05:23,000
maybe we have 50 million years of evidence for the two-faced male.

114
0:05:24.198,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:29.188,000 --> 0:05:3,000
All right, let's move on.

116
0:05:30.764,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:31.845,000 --> 0:05:33,000
An octopus on a coral reef has a tough job in front it

118
0:05:34.674,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to go to so many places, remember and find its den.

119
0:05:38.394,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And they do this extremely well.

120
0:05:39.961,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They have short- and long-term memory,

121
0:05:41.828,000 --> 0:05:43,000
they learn things in three to five trials --

122
0:05:43.944,000 --> 0:05:44,000
it's a good brain.

123
0:05:45.123,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And the spatial memory is unusually good.

124
0:05:48.028,000 --> 0:05:51,000
They will even end their forage and make a beeline

125
0:05:51.684,000 --> 0:05:52,000
all the way back to their den.

126
0:05:53.269,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The divers watching them are completely lost,

127
0:05:55.583,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but they can get back,

128
0:05:56.767,000 --> 0:05:59,000
so it's really quite refined memory capability.

129
0:06:00.353,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, in terms of cognitive skills,

130
0:06:02.012,000 --> 0:06:04,000
look at this sleeping behavior in the cuttlefish.

131
0:06:04.887,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Especially on the right, you see the eye twitching.

132
0:06:07.293,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is rapid eye movement kind of dreaming

133
0:06:10.479,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that we only thought mammals and birds did.

134
0:06:12.675,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And you see the false color we put in there

135
0:06:14.765,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to see the skin patterning flashing,

136
0:06:17.188,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and this is what's happening a lot.

137
0:06:19.526,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But it's not normal awake behaviors; it's all different.

138
0:06:22.954,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Well, dreaming is when you have memory consolidation,

139
0:06:27.079,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and so this is probably what's happening in the cuttlefish.

140
0:06:30.507,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now, another form of memory that's really unusual

141
0:06:32.882,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is episodic-like memory.

142
0:06:34.645,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This is something that humans need four years of brain development to do

143
0:06:39.551,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to remember what happened during a particular event,

144
0:06:42.558,000 --> 0:06:44,000
where it happened and when it happened.

145
0:06:45.009,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The "when" part is particularly difficult,

146
0:06:49.12,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and these children can do that.

147
0:06:51.639,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But guess what?

148
0:06:52.834,000 --> 0:06:56,000
We find recently that the wily cuttlefish also has this ability,

149
0:06:57.035,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and in experiments last summer,

150
0:06:58.899,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when you present a cuttlefish with different foods at different times,

151
0:07:05.108,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they have to match that with where it was exactly

152
0:07:09.549,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and when was the last time they saw it.

153
0:07:12.695,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Then they have to guide their foraging to the rate of replenishment

154
0:07:17.167,000 --> 0:07:19,000
of each food type in a different place.

155
0:07:19.92,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Sound complicated?

156
0:07:21.362,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's so complicated, I hardly understood the experiment.

157
0:07:24.298,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So this is really high-level cognitive processing.

158
0:07:28.927,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now, speaking of brains and evolution at the moment,

159
0:07:32.626,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you look on the right, there's the pathway of vertebrate brain evolution,

160
0:07:36.513,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and we all have good brains.

161
0:07:37.909,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I think everyone will acknowledge that.

162
0:07:39.854,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But if you look on the left side,

163
0:07:41.475,000 --> 0:07:45,000
some of the evolutionary pathway outlined here to the octopus,

164
0:07:45.912,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they have both converged, if you will, to complex behaviors

165
0:07:50.289,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and some form of intelligence.

166
0:07:52.499,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The last common denominator in these two lines

167
0:07:56.058,000 --> 0:07:58,000
was 600 million years ago,

168
0:07:58.104,000 --> 0:08:,000
and it was a worm with very few neurons,

169
0:08:00.481,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so very divergent paths

170
0:08:02.58,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but convergence of complicated behavior.

171
0:08:05.91,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Here is the fundamental question:

172
0:08:08.531,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Is the brain structure of an octopus

173
0:08:11.721,000 --> 0:08:13,000
basically different down to the tiniest level

174
0:08:14.363,000 --> 0:08:15,000
from the vertebrate line?

175
0:08:16.244,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now, we don't know the answer,

176
0:08:18.296,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but if it turns out to be yes,

177
0:08:20.794,000 --> 0:08:22,000
then we have a different evolutionary pathway

178
0:08:23.66,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to create intelligence on planet Earth,

179
0:08:26.416,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and one might think that the artificial intelligence community

180
0:08:29.372,000 --> 0:08:31,000
might be interested in those mechanisms.

181
0:08:32.736,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Well, let's talk genetics just for a moment.

182
0:08:35.838,000 --> 0:08:37,000
We have genomes, we have DNA,

183
0:08:38.757,000 --> 0:08:4,000
DNA is transcripted into RNA,

184
0:08:40.957,000 --> 0:08:44,000
RNA translates that into a protein, and that's how we come to be.

185
0:08:45.252,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Well, the cephalopods do it differently.

186
0:08:47.595,000 --> 0:08:5,000
They have big genomes, they have DNA,

187
0:08:50.831,000 --> 0:08:51,000
they transcript it into RNA,

188
0:08:52.799,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but now something dramatically different happens.

189
0:08:55.331,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They edit that RNA at an astronomical weird rate,

190
0:08:58.459,000 --> 0:09:02,000
a hundredfold more than we as humans or other animals do.

191
0:09:02.599,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And it produces scores of proteins.

192
0:09:05.757,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And guess where most of them are for?

193
0:09:08.127,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The nervous system.

194
0:09:09.489,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So perhaps this is an unorthodox way

195
0:09:12.773,000 --> 0:09:15,000
for an animal to evolve behavioral plasticity.

196
0:09:16.854,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This is a lot of conjecture, but it's food for thought.

197
0:09:20.601,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now, I'd like to share with you for a moment

198
0:09:23.149,000 --> 0:09:27,000
my experience, and using my smarts and that of my colleagues,

199
0:09:27.998,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to try and get this kind of information.

200
0:09:30.018,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We're diving, we can't stay underwater forever

201
0:09:32.211,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because we can't breathe it,

202
0:09:33.583,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so we have to be efficient in what we do.

203
0:09:35.585,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The total sensory immersion into that world

204
0:09:37.924,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is what helps us understand what these animals are really doing,

205
0:09:41.759,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and I have to tell you that it's really an amazing experience

206
0:09:46.362,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to be down there and having this communication

207
0:09:49.639,000 --> 0:09:5,000
with an octopus and a diver

208
0:09:51.562,000 --> 0:09:55,000
when you really begin to understand that this is a thinking, cogitating,

209
0:09:56.083,000 --> 0:09:57,000
curious animal.

210
0:09:57.939,000 --> 0:10:,000
And this is the kind of thing that really inspires me endlessly.

211
0:10:01.318,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Let's go back to that smart skin for a few moments.

212
0:10:03.793,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Here's a squid and a camouflage pattern.

213
0:10:06.632,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We zoom down and we see there's beautiful pigments and reflectors.

214
0:10:09.885,000 --> 0:10:12,000
There are the chromatophores opening and closing very quickly.

215
0:10:13.108,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And then, in the next layer of skin,

216
0:10:15.38,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it's quite interesting.

217
0:10:16.624,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The chromatophores are closed,

218
0:10:18.127,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and you see this magical iridescence just come out of the skin.

219
0:10:22.283,000 --> 0:10:24,000
This is also neurally controlled,

220
0:10:24.386,000 --> 0:10:25,000
so it's the combination of the two,

221
0:10:26.381,000 --> 0:10:29,000
as seen here in the high-resolution skin of the cuttlefish,

222
0:10:29.991,000 --> 0:10:33,000
where you get this beautiful pigmentary structural coloration

223
0:10:34.077,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and even the faint blushing that is so beautiful.

224
0:10:38.211,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Well, how can we make use of some of this information?

225
0:10:42.231,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I talked about those skin bumps, the papillae.

226
0:10:44.434,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Here's the giant Australian cuttlefish.

227
0:10:46.516,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's got smooth skin and a conspicuous pattern.

228
0:10:49.274,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I took five pictures in a row one second apart,

229
0:10:51.975,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and just watch this animal morph -- one, two, three, four, five --

230
0:10:58.043,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and now I'm a seaweed.

231
0:10:59.558,000 --> 0:11:,000
And then we can come right back out of it

232
0:11:01.566,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to see the smooth skin and the conspicuousness.

233
0:11:04.655,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So this is really marvelous, morphing skin.

234
0:11:07.48,000 --> 0:11:09,000
You can see it in more detail here.

235
0:11:09.671,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Periscope up,

236
0:11:10.883,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and you've got those beautiful papillae.

237
0:11:13.089,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And then we look in a little more detail,

238
0:11:15.288,000 --> 0:11:17,000
you can see the individual papillae come up,

239
0:11:17.801,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and there are little ridges on there,

240
0:11:19.608,000 --> 0:11:21,000
so it's a papilla on papilla and so forth.

241
0:11:21.881,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Every individual species out there has more than a dozen shapes and sizes

242
0:11:26.557,000 --> 0:11:27,000
of those bumps

243
0:11:27.734,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to create fine-tuned, neurally controlled camouflage.

244
0:11:32.317,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So now, my colleagues at Cornell, engineers,

245
0:11:38.273,000 --> 0:11:41,000
watched our work and said, "We think we can make some of those."

246
0:11:41.361,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Because in industry and society,

247
0:11:42.983,000 --> 0:11:44,000
this kind of soft materials under control of shape

248
0:11:45.466,000 --> 0:11:46,000
are really very rare.

249
0:11:46.881,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And they went ahead, worked with us

250
0:11:48.985,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and made the first samples of artificial papillae, soft materials,

251
0:11:52.957,000 --> 0:11:53,000
shown here.

252
0:11:54.144,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And you see them blown up into different shapes,

253
0:11:56.704,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And then you can press your finger on them

254
0:11:58.751,000 --> 0:12:,000
to see that they're a little bit malleable as they are.

255
0:12:01.56,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And so this is an example of how that might work.

256
0:12:04.797,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Well, I want to segue from this into the color of fabrics,

257
0:12:09.584,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and I imagine that could have a lot of applications as well.

258
0:12:12.894,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Just look at this kaleidoscope of color

259
0:12:15.513,000 --> 0:12:17,000
of dynamically controlled pigments and reflectors

260
0:12:17.955,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that we see in the cephalopods.

261
0:12:20.314,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We know enough about the mechanics of how they work

262
0:12:24.016,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that we can begin to translate this

263
0:12:26.173,000 --> 0:12:27,000
not only into fabrics

264
0:12:27.69,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but perhaps even into changeable cosmetics.

265
0:12:31.24,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And moreover, there's been the recent discovery

266
0:12:34.234,000 --> 0:12:37,000
of light-sensing molecules in the skin of octopus

267
0:12:37.769,000 --> 0:12:4,000
which may pave the way to, eventually, smart materials

268
0:12:41.363,000 --> 0:12:45,000
that sense and respond on their own.

269
0:12:46.03,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Well, this form of biotechnology, or biomimicry, if you will,

270
0:12:51.54,000 --> 0:12:53,000
could change the way we look at the world even above water.

271
0:12:54.523,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Take, for example, artificial intelligence

272
0:12:57.237,000 --> 0:13:,000
that might be inspired by the body-distributed brain

273
0:13:01.234,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and behavior of the octopus

274
0:13:03.096,000 --> 0:13:05,000
or the smart skin of a cuttlefish

275
0:13:05.412,000 --> 0:13:08,000
translated into cutting-edge fashion.

276
0:13:12.003,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Well, how do we get there?

277
0:13:13.898,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Maybe all we have to do

278
0:13:15.897,000 --> 0:13:18,000
is to begin to be a little bit smarter

279
0:13:19.006,000 --> 0:13:21,000
about how smart the cephalopods are.

280
0:13:21.506,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Thank you.

281
0:13:22.721,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

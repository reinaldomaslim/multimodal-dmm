0:00:15.427,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Recently I visited Beloit, Wisconsin.

3
0:00:18.441,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer,

4
0:00:22.089,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Roy Chapman Andrews.

5
0:00:24.131,000 --> 0:00:26,000
During his time at the American Museum of Natural History,

6
0:00:26.975,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions,

7
0:00:31.075,000 --> 0:00:32,000
like here in the Gobi Desert.

8
0:00:32.81,000 --> 0:00:33,000
He was quite a figure.

9
0:00:34.218,000 --> 0:00:37,000
He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character.

10
0:00:37.892,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin,

11
0:00:40.089,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students.

12
0:00:44.222,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I'm here to tell you,

13
0:00:45.791,000 --> 0:00:47,000
if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED,

14
0:00:48.495,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it'll be trying to hold the attention

15
0:00:50.327,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture.

16
0:00:54.22,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Don't try that one.

17
0:00:56.099,000 --> 0:00:59,000
At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions,

18
0:00:59.641,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but there was one that's really stuck with me since then.

19
0:01:02.943,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There was a young girl who stood up,

20
0:01:04.86,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and she asked the question:

21
0:01:06.191,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"Where should we explore?"

22
0:01:08.239,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I think there's a sense that many of us have

23
0:01:10.37,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that the great age of exploration on Earth is over,

24
0:01:13.189,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that for the next generation

25
0:01:14.721,000 --> 0:01:17,000
they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans

26
0:01:18.139,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in order to find something significant to explore.

27
0:01:20.689,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But is that really the case?

28
0:01:23.189,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore

29
0:01:26.185,000 --> 0:01:27,000
left here on Earth?

30
0:01:27.91,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It sort of made me think back

31
0:01:29.093,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology.

32
0:01:31.843,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This is an explorer of the unseen world, Martinus Beijerinck.

33
0:01:35.177,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So Beijerinck set out to discover the cause

34
0:01:37.635,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of tobacco mosaic disease.

35
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants

36
0:01:43.552,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters.

37
0:01:46.489,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And he reached the point

38
0:01:48.055,000 --> 0:01:51,000
where he felt that there must be something out there

39
0:01:51.066,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known --

40
0:01:54.51,000 --> 0:01:56,000
bacteria, at the time.

41
0:01:56.554,000 --> 0:01:59,000
He came up with a name for his mystery agent.

42
0:01:59.942,000 --> 0:02:01,000
He called it the virus --

43
0:02:01.968,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Latin for "poison."

44
0:02:04.243,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And in uncovering viruses,

45
0:02:07.02,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us.

46
0:02:10.641,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We now know that viruses make up the majority

47
0:02:12.635,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of the genetic information on our planet,

48
0:02:14.927,000 --> 0:02:15,000
more than the genetic information

49
0:02:16.593,000 --> 0:02:17,000
of all other forms of life combined.

50
0:02:18.343,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And obviously there's been tremendous practical applications

51
0:02:21.437,000 --> 0:02:22,000
associated with this world --

52
0:02:22.691,000 --> 0:02:24,000
things like the eradication of smallpox,

53
0:02:25.093,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer,

54
0:02:28.748,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus.

55
0:02:32.347,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And Beijerinck's discovery,

56
0:02:34.02,000 --> 0:02:36,000
this was not something that occurred 500 years ago.

57
0:02:36.741,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It was a little over 100 years ago

58
0:02:39.42,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that Beijerinck discovered viruses.

59
0:02:41.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So basically we had automobiles,

60
0:02:43.727,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but we were unaware of the forms of life

61
0:02:45.97,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

62
0:02:48.976,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We now have these amazing tools

63
0:02:51.158,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to allow us to explore the unseen world --

64
0:02:53.468,000 --> 0:02:55,000
things like deep sequencing,

65
0:02:55.481,000 --> 0:02:58,000
which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface

66
0:02:59.045,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and look at individual genomes from a particular species,

67
0:03:02.135,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but to look at entire metagenomes,

68
0:03:04.63,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the communities of teeming microorganisms in, on and around us

69
0:03:08.81,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and to document all of the genetic information in these species.

70
0:03:12.331,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We can apply these techniques

71
0:03:13.802,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to things from soil to skin and everything in between.

72
0:03:18.312,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In my organization we now do this on a regular basis

73
0:03:21.302,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to identify the causes of outbreaks

74
0:03:23.681,000 --> 0:03:26,000
that are unclear exactly what causes them.

75
0:03:26.97,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And just to give you a sense of how this works,

76
0:03:29.302,000 --> 0:03:32,000
imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you.

77
0:03:32.302,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And this is something we commonly do

78
0:03:33.664,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to look for respiratory viruses like influenza.

79
0:03:36.658,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The first thing we would see

80
0:03:38.51,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is a tremendous amount of genetic information.

81
0:03:41.56,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And if we started looking into that genetic information,

82
0:03:43.968,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we'd see a number of usual suspects out there --

83
0:03:46.303,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of course, a lot of human genetic information,

84
0:03:48.096,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but also bacterial and viral information,

85
0:03:50.968,000 --> 0:03:53,000
mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose.

86
0:03:54.135,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But we'd also see something very, very surprising.

87
0:03:57.047,000 --> 0:03:59,000
As we started to look at this information,

88
0:03:59.122,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose

89
0:04:03.468,000 --> 0:04:05,000
doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before --

90
0:04:06.385,000 --> 0:04:09,000
no plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria.

91
0:04:09.556,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Basically we have no clue what this is.

92
0:04:13.06,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data,

93
0:04:17.18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
a few of us have actually begun to call this information

94
0:04:20.895,000 --> 0:04:22,000
biological dark matter.

95
0:04:23.297,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We know it's not anything that we've seen before;

96
0:04:26.245,000 --> 0:04:29,000
it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent

97
0:04:29.352,000 --> 0:04:31,000
right within our own genetic information.

98
0:04:32.07,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And there's a lot of it.

99
0:04:33.447,000 --> 0:04:36,000
If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot

100
0:04:36.933,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of biological dark matter,

101
0:04:38.552,000 --> 0:04:39,000
if we looked at your gut,

102
0:04:40.302,000 --> 0:04:43,000
up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter.

103
0:04:43.998,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And even in the relatively sterile blood,

104
0:04:46.237,000 --> 0:04:48,000
around one to two percent of this information is dark matter --

105
0:04:49.218,000 --> 0:04:53,000
can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before.

106
0:04:53.966,000 --> 0:04:55,000
At first we thought that perhaps this was artifact.

107
0:04:56.593,000 --> 0:04:59,000
These deep sequencing tools are relatively new.

108
0:04:59.845,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But as they become more and more accurate,

109
0:05:01.918,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we've determined that this information is a form of life,

110
0:05:05.506,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or at least some of it is a form of life.

111
0:05:08.093,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter

112
0:05:12.458,000 --> 0:05:13,000
are really only in their infancy,

113
0:05:14.396,000 --> 0:05:17,000
there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists:

114
0:05:18.073,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that buried in this life, in this genetic information,

115
0:05:21.552,000 --> 0:05:25,000
are signatures of as of yet unidentified life.

116
0:05:26.04,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That as we explore these strings of A's, T's, C's and G's,

117
0:05:29.975,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we may uncover a completely new class of life

118
0:05:33.31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that, like Beijerinck, will fundamentally change

119
0:05:35.722,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the way that we think about the nature of biology.

120
0:05:37.918,000 --> 0:05:41,000
That perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us

121
0:05:42.347,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with

122
0:05:45.879,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology.

123
0:05:48.773,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I'm pleased to announce that,

124
0:05:50.458,000 --> 0:05:54,000
along with colleagues at Stanford and Caltech and UCSF,

125
0:05:55.4,000 --> 0:05:56,000
we're currently starting an initiative

126
0:05:57.039,000 --> 0:06:,000
to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life.

127
0:06:01.012,000 --> 0:06:03,000
A little over a hundred years ago,

128
0:06:03.156,000 --> 0:06:05,000
people were unaware of viruses,

129
0:06:05.86,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet.

130
0:06:10.099,000 --> 0:06:12,000
A hundred years from now, people may marvel

131
0:06:12.681,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life

132
0:06:16.135,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that literally was right under our noses.

133
0:06:19.439,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's true, we may have charted all the continents on the planet

134
0:06:22.762,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there,

135
0:06:25.843,000 --> 0:06:28,000
but that doesn't mean that there's nothing left to explore on Earth.

136
0:06:29.399,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Beijerinck and his kind

137
0:06:31.404,000 --> 0:06:34,000
provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers --

138
0:06:35.091,000 --> 0:06:38,000
people like that young girl from Beloit, Wisconsin.

139
0:06:38.423,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And I think if we phrase that lesson, it's something like this:

140
0:06:42.218,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Don't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story.

141
0:06:46.447,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore.

142
0:06:51.51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
There are unknowns all around us

143
0:06:53.629,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and they're just waiting to be discovered.

144
0:06:56.01,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Thank you.

145
0:06:57.679,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

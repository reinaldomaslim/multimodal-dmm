1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Lauren Hodge: If you were going to a restaurant and wanted a healthier option,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
which would you choose, grilled or fried chicken?

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now most people would answer grilled,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and it's true that grilled chicken does contain less fat and fewer calories.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
However, grilled chicken poses a hidden danger.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The hidden danger is heterocyclic amines --

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
specifically phenomethylimidazopyridine,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
or PhIP --

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(laughter)

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which is the immunogenic or carcinogenic compound.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
A carcinogen is any substance or agent

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that causes abnormal growth of cells,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
which can also cause them to metastasize or spread.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
They are also organic compounds

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in which one or more of the hydrogens in ammonia

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is replaced with a more complex group.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Studies show that antioxidants

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
are known to decrease these heterocyclic amines.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
However, no studies exist yet

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that show how or why.

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
These here are five different organizations that classify carcinogens.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And as you can see, none of the organizations consider the compounds to be safe,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which justifies the need to decrease them in our diet.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I was led to it through a series of events.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I first learned about it through a lawsuit I read about in my doctor's office --

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which was between the Physician's Committee for Responsible Medicine

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and seven different fast food restaurants.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They weren't sued because there was carcinogens in the chicken,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but they were sued because of California's Proposition 65,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
which stated that if there's anything dangerous in the products

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
then the companies had to give a clear warning.

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I was very surprised about this.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I was wondering why nobody knew more

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
about this dangerous grilled chicken,

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which doesn't seem very harmful.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But then one night, my mom was cooking grilled chicken for dinner,

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I noticed that the edges of the chicken,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which had been marinated in lemon juice, turned white.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And later in biology class, I learned that it's due to a process called denaturing,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which is where the proteins will change shape

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and lose their ability to chemically function.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So I combined these two ideas and I formulated a hypothesis,

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
saying that, could possibly

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the carcinogens be decreased due to a marinade

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and could it be due to the differences in PH?

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So my idea was born,

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I had the project set up and a hypothesis,

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
so what was my next step?

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well obviously I had to find a lab to work at

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
because I didn't have the equipment in my school.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I thought this would be easy,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but I emailed about 200 different people

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
within a five-hour radius of where I lived,

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I got one positive response that said that they could work with me.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Most of the others either never responded back,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
said they didn't have the time

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
or didn't have the equipment and couldn't help me.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So it was a big commitment

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to drive to the lab to work multiple times.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
However, it was a great opportunity to work in a real lab --

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so I could finally start my project.

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
The first stage was completed at home,

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
which consisted of marinating the chicken,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
grilling the chicken, amassing it

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and preparing it to be transported to the lab.

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The second stage was completed

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
at the Penn State University main campus lab,

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which is where I extracted the chemicals,

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
changed the PH so I could run it through the equipment

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and separated the compounds I needed

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
from the rest of the chicken.

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The final stages, when I ran the samples

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
through a high-pressure

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
liquid chromatography mass spectrometer,

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which separated the compounds and analyzed the chemicals

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and told me exactly how much carcinogens I had

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in my chicken.

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So when I went through the data, I had very surprising results,

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because I found that four out of the five marinating ingredients

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
actually inhibited the carcinogen formation.

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
When compared with the unmarinated chicken,

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
which is what I used as my control,

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I found that lemon juice worked by far the best,

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which decreased the carcinogens

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
by about 98 percent.

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The saltwater marinade and the brown sugar marinade

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
also worked very well,

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
decreasing the carcinogens by about 60 percent.

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Olive oil slightly decreased the PhIP formation,

92
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but it was nearly negligible.

93
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And the soy sauce results were inconclusive

94
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because of the large data range,

95
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but it seems like soy sauce

96
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
actually increased the potential carcinogens.

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Another important factor that I didn't take into account initially

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was the time cooked.

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And I found that if you increase the time cooked,

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the amount of carcinogens rapidly increases.

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So the best way to marinate chicken, based on this,

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is to, not under-cook,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but definitely don't over-cook and char the chicken,

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and marinate in either lemon juice, brown sugar or saltwater.

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Applause)

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Based on these findings, I have a question for you.

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Would you be willing to make a simple change in your diet

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that could potentially save your life?

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now I'm not saying that if you eat grilled chicken that's not marinated,

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you're definitely going to catch cancer and die.

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
However, anything you can do

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to decrease the risk of potential carcinogens

113
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
can definitely increase the quality of lifestyle.

114
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Is it worth it to you?

115
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
How will you cook your chicken now?

116
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

117
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Shree Bose: Hi everyone. I'm Shree Bose.

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I was the 17-18 year-old age category winner

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and then the grand prize winner.

120
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I want all of you

121
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to imagine a little girl

122
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
holding a dead blue spinach plant.

123
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And she's standing in front of you and she's explaining to you

124
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that little kids will eat their vegetables

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
if they're different colors.

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Sounds ridiculous, right.

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But that was me years ago.

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And that was my first science fair project.

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It got a bit more complicated from there.

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
My older brother Panaki Bose

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
spent hours of his time explaining atoms to me

132
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
when I barely understood basic algebra.

133
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
My parents suffered through many more of my science fair projects,

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
including a remote controlled garbage can.

135
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

136
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And then came the summer after my freshman year,

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
when my grandfather passed away due to cancer.

138
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And I remember watching my family go through that

139
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and thinking that I never wanted another family

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to feel that kind of loss.

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, armed with all the wisdom

142
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
of freshman year biology,

143
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I decided I wanted to do cancer research

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
at 15.

145
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Good plan.

146
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So I started emailing all of these professors in my area

147
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
asking to work under their supervision in a lab.

148
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Got rejected by all except one.

149
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And then went on, my next summer,

150
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to work under Dr. Basu

151
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
at the UNT Health Center at Fort Worth, Texas.

152
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And that is where the research began.

153
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So ovarian cancer

154
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is one of those cancers that most people don't know about,

155
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
or at least don't pay that much attention to.

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But yet, it's the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths

157
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
among women in the United States.

158
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
In fact, one in 70 women

159
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

160
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
One in 100

161
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
will die from it.

162
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Chemotherapy, one of the most effective ways

163
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
used to treat cancer today,

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
involves giving patients really high doses of chemicals

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to try and kill off cancer cells.

166
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Cisplatin is a relatively common

167
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
ovarian cancer chemotherapy drug --

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
a relatively simple molecule made in the lab

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that messes with the DNA of cancer cells

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and causes them to kill themselves.

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Sounds great, right?

172
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But here's the problem:

173
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
sometimes patients become resistant to the drug,

174
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and then years after they've been declared to be cancer free,

175
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they come back.

176
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And this time, they no longer respond to the drug.

177
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's a huge problem.

178
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
In fact, it's one of the biggest problems

179
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
with chemotherapy today.

180
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So we wanted to figure out

181
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
how these ovarian cancer cells are becoming resistant

182
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to this drug called Cisplatin.

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And we wanted to figure this out,

184
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because if we could figure that out,

185
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening.

186
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So that's what we set out to do.

187
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And we thought it had something to do with this protein called AMP kinase,

188
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
an energy protein.

189
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So we ran all of these tests blocking the protein,

190
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and we saw this huge shift.

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I mean, on the slide, you can see

192
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that on our sensitive side,

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
these cells that are responding to the drug,

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
when we start blocking the protein,

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the number of dying cells -- those colored dots --

196
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they're going down.

197
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But then on this side, with the same treatment,

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
they're going up -- interesting.

199
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But those are dots on a screen for you;

200
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
what exactly does that mean?

201
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Well basically that means

202
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that this protein is changing

203
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
from the sensitive cell to the resistant cell.

204
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And in fact, it might be changing the cells themselves

205
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to make the cells resistant.

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And that's huge.

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
In fact, it means that if a patient comes in

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and they're resistant to this drug,

209
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
then if we give them a chemical to block this protein,

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
then we can treat them again

211
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
with the same drug.

212
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And that's huge for chemotherapy effectiveness --

213
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
possibly for many different types of cancer.

214
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So that was my work,

215
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and it was my way of reimagining the future

216
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
for future research, with figuring out exactly what this protein does,

217
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but also for the future of chemotherapy effectiveness --

218
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
so maybe all grandfathers with cancer

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
have a little bit more time to spend with their grandchildren.

220
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But my work wasn't just about the research.

221
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It was about finding my passion.

222
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
That's why being the grand prize winner

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of the Google Global Science Fair --

224
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
cute picture, right --

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it was so exciting to me and it was such an amazing honor.

226
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And ever since then,

227
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I've gotten to do some pretty cool stuff --

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
from getting to meet the president

229
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to getting to be on this stage

230
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to talk to all of you guys.

231
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But like I said, my journey wasn't just about the research,

232
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
it was about finding my passion,

233
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and it was about making my own opportunities

234
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when I didn't even know what I was doing.

235
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It was about inspiration

236
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and determination

237
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and never giving up on my interest

238
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
for science and learning and growing.

239
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
After all, my story begins

240
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
with a dried, withered spinach plant

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and it's only getting better from there.

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Thank you.

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

244
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Naomi Shah: Hi everyone. I'm Naomi Shah,

245
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and today I'll be talking to you about my research

246
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
involving indoor air quality

247
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and asthmatic patients.

248
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
1.6 million deaths worldwide.

249
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
One death every 20 seconds.

250
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
People spend over 90 percent of their lives indoors.

251
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And the economic burden of asthma

252
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
exceeds that of HIV and tuberculosis combined.

253
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now these statistics had a huge impact on me,

254
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but what really sparked my interest in my research

255
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
was watching both my dad and my brother

256
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
suffer from chronic allergies year-round.

257
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It confused me;

258
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
why did these allergy symptoms persist

259
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
well past the pollen season?

260
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
With this question in mind, I started researching,

261
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and I soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit.

262
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
As soon as I realized this,

263
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I investigated the underlying relationship

264
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
between four prevalent air pollutants

265
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and their affect on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

266
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
At first, I just wanted to figure out

267
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
which of these four pollutants have the largest negative health impact

268
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

269
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But soon after, I developed a novel mathematical model

270
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that essentially quantifies the effect

271
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
of these environmental pollutants

272
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
on the lung health of asthmatic patients.

273
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And it surprises me

274
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
that no model currently exists

275
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that quantifies the effect of environmental factors

276
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
on human lung health,

277
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because that relationship seems so important.

278
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So with that in mind,

279
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I started researching more, I started investigating more,

280
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and I became very passionate.

281
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Because I realized

282
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that if we could find a way to target remediation,

283
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
we could also find a way

284
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to treat asthmatic patients more effectively.

285
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
For example, volatile organic compounds

286
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
are chemical pollutants

287
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that are found in our schools, homes and workplaces.

288
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
They're everywhere.

289
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
These chemical pollutants

290
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
are currently not a criteria air pollutant,

291
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
as defined by the U.S. Clean Air Act.

292
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Which is surprising to me,

293
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because these chemical pollutants, through my research,

294
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I show that they had a very large negative impact

295
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
on the lung health of asthmatic patients

296
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and thus should be regulated.

297
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So today I want to show you

298
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
my interactive software model that I created.

299
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I'm going to show it to you on my laptop.

300
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I have a volunteer subject in the audience today,

301
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Julie.

302
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And all of Julie's data has been pre-entered

303
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
into my interactive software model.

304
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And this can be used by anyone.

305
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So I want you to imagine that you're in Julie's shoes,

306
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
or someone who's really close to you

307
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
who suffers from asthma or another lung disorder.

308
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So Julie's going to her doctor's office

309
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to get treated for her asthma.

310
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And the doctor has her sit down,

311
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and he takes her peak expiratory flow rate --

312
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
which is essentially her exhalation rate,

313
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
or the amount of air that she can breathe out in one breath.

314
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So that peak expiratory flow rate,

315
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I've entered it up into the interactive software model.

316
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I've also entered in her age, her gender and her height.

317
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I've assumed that she lives in an average household

318
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
with average air pollutant levels.

319
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So any user can come in here

320
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and click on "lung function report"

321
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and it'll take them to this report that I created.

322
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And this report really drives home the crux of my research.

323
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So what it shows -- if you want to focus on that top graph in the right-hand corner --

324
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
it shows Julie's actual peak expiratory flow rate

325
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
in the yellow bar.

326
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
This is the measurement that she took in her doctor's office.

327
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
In the blue bar at the bottom of the graph,

328
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
it shows what her peak expiratory flow rate,

329
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
what her exhalation rate or lung health, should be

330
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
based on her age, gender and height.

331
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So the doctor sees this difference between the yellow bar and the blue bar,

332
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and he says, "Wow, we need to give her steroids,

333
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
medication and inhalers."

334
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
But I want everyone here to reimagine a world

335
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
where instead of prescribing steroids,

336
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
inhalers and medication,

337
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the doctor turns to Julie and says,

338
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
"Why don't you go home and clean out your air filters.

339
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Clean out the air ducts in your home,

340
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
in your workplace, in your school.

341
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Stop the use of incense and candles.

342
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And if you're remodeling your house,

343
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring."

344
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Because these solutions are natural,

345
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
these solutions are sustainable,

346
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and these solutions are long-term investments --

347
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
long-term investments that we're making

348
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
for our generation and for future generations.

349
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Because these environmental solutions

350
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that Julie can make in her home, her workplace and her school

351
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
are impacting everyone that lives around her.

352
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So I'm very passionate about this research

353
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and I really want to continue it

354
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and expand it to more disorders besides asthma,

355
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
more respiratory disorders, as well as more pollutants.

356
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
But before I end my talk today,

357
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I want to leave you with one saying.

358
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And that saying is that genetics loads the gun,

359
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but the environment pulls the trigger.

360
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And that made a huge impact on me

361
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
when I was doing this research.

362
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Because what I feel, is a lot of us think

363
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that the environment is at a macro level,

364
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that we can't do anything to change our air quality

365
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
or to change the climate or anything.

366
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
But if each one of us takes initiative in our own home,

367
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
in our own school and in our own workplace,

368
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
we can make a huge difference in air quality.

369
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Because remember, we spend 90 percent of our lives indoors.

370
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And air quality and air pollutants

371
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
have a huge impact on the lung health of asthmatic patients,

372
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
anyone with a respiratory disorder

373
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and really all of us in general.

374
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So I want you to reimagine a world

375
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
with better air quality,

376
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
better quality of life

377
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and better quality of living for everyone

378
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
including our future generations.

379
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Thank you.

380
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Applause)

381
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Lisa Ling: Right.

382
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Can I have Shree and Lauren come up really quickly?

383
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Your Google Science Fair champions.

384
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Your winners.

385
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000

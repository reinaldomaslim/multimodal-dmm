1
0:00:15.871,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Fifty-two minutes ago, I took this picture about 10 blocks from here.

2
0:00:20.119,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This is the Grand Café here in Oxford.

3
0:00:23.187,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I took this picture

4
0:00:24.509,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because this turns out to be the first coffeehouse to open in England,

5
0:00:29.278,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in 1650.

6
0:00:30.461,000 --> 0:00:32,000
That's its great claim to fame.

7
0:00:32.602,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I wanted to show it to you,

8
0:00:34.134,000 --> 0:00:36,000
not because I want to give you the Starbucks tour

9
0:00:36.74,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of historic England --

10
0:00:37.946,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:39.079,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but rather because the English coffeehouse was crucial

12
0:00:42.551,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to the development and spread of one of the great intellectual flowerings

13
0:00:47.333,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of the last 500 years,

14
0:00:49.123,000 --> 0:00:5,000
what we now call the Enlightenment.

15
0:00:51.421,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And the coffeehouse played such a big role in the birth of the Enlightenment

16
0:00:55.528,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in part because of what people were drinking there.

17
0:00:58.047,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Because, before the spread of coffee and tea through British culture,

18
0:01:03.328,000 --> 0:01:06,000
what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank --

19
0:01:06.595,000 --> 0:01:08,000
day in and day out, from dawn until dusk,

20
0:01:08.992,000 --> 0:01:09,000
was alcohol.

21
0:01:10.241,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.

22
0:01:12.314,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You would drink a little beer with breakfast

23
0:01:14.412,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and have a little wine at lunch,

24
0:01:15.991,000 --> 0:01:17,000
a little gin, particularly around 1650,

25
0:01:18.313,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.

26
0:01:21.445,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That was the healthy choice, because the water wasn't safe to drink.

27
0:01:24.693,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And so, effectively, until the rise of the coffeehouse,

28
0:01:27.81,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day.

29
0:01:30.978,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:32.198,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And you can imagine what that would be like in your own life --

31
0:01:35.214,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and I know this is true of some of you -- if you were drinking all day --

32
0:01:38.694,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:39.749,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life.

34
0:01:43.05,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You would have better ideas.

35
0:01:44.618,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You would be sharper and more alert.

36
0:01:46.706,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened

37
0:01:50.093,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as England switched to tea and coffee.

38
0:01:52.285,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important

39
0:01:55.118,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is the architecture of the space.

40
0:01:57.548,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It was a space where people would get together,

41
0:01:59.775,000 --> 0:02:01,000
from different backgrounds, different fields of expertise,

42
0:02:02.538,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and share.

43
0:02:03.723,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.

44
0:02:07.15,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense; ideas would get together there.

45
0:02:10.655,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And an astonishing number of innovations from this period

46
0:02:13.371,000 --> 0:02:16,000
have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.

47
0:02:17.001,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses

48
0:02:19.874,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for the last five years

49
0:02:21.087,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because I've been kind of on this quest

50
0:02:24.069,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to investigate this question of where good ideas come from.

51
0:02:27.811,000 --> 0:02:32,000
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation,

52
0:02:33.087,000 --> 0:02:35,000
unusual levels of creativity?

53
0:02:35.416,000 --> 0:02:38,000
What's the kind of environmental -- what is the space of creativity?

54
0:02:39.777,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And what I've done is,

55
0:02:41.626,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse,

56
0:02:44.193,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I've looked at media environments like the World Wide Web,

57
0:02:46.943,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that have been extraordinarily innovative;

58
0:02:48.975,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I've gone back to the history of the first cities;

59
0:02:51.4,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I've even gone to biological environments, like coral reefs and rain forests,

60
0:02:55.044,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that involve unusual levels of biological innovation.

61
0:02:57.639,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And what I've been looking for is shared patterns,

62
0:03:00.551,000 --> 0:03:03,000
signature behavior that shows up again and again

63
0:03:04.034,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in all of these environments.

64
0:03:05.459,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from,

65
0:03:08.115,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that we can take and apply to our own lives

66
0:03:10.617,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or our own organizations or our own environments

67
0:03:13.046,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to make them more creative and innovative?

68
0:03:15.078,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And I think I've found a few.

69
0:03:16.535,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But what you have to do to make sense of this

70
0:03:19.323,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and to really understand these principles is,

71
0:03:21.66,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you have to do away with

72
0:03:23.915,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the way in which our conventional metaphors and language steers us

73
0:03:27.065,000 --> 0:03:3,000
towards certain concepts of idea creation.

74
0:03:30.356,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We have this very rich vocabulary to describe moments of inspiration.

75
0:03:35.122,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We have the "flash" of insight,

76
0:03:37.592,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the "stroke" of insight,

77
0:03:39.126,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we have "epiphanies,"

78
0:03:40.836,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we have eureka moments,

79
0:03:42.571,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we have the "light bulb" moments, right?

80
0:03:44.609,000 --> 0:03:48,000
All of these concepts, as rhetorically florid as they are,

81
0:03:49.623,000 --> 0:03:5,000
share this basic assumption,

82
0:03:51.004,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which is that an idea is a single thing.

83
0:03:54.021,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's something that happens often in a wonderful, illuminating moment.

84
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But, in fact, what I would argue and what you really need to begin with

85
0:04:03.048,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is this idea that an idea is a network on the most elemental level.

86
0:04:07.45,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I mean, this is what is happening inside your brain.

87
0:04:09.984,000 --> 0:04:11,000
An idea -- a new idea -- is a new network of neurons

88
0:04:12.546,000 --> 0:04:14,000
firing in sync with each other inside your brain.

89
0:04:14.91,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's a new configuration that has never formed before.

90
0:04:18.178,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And the question is: How do you get your brain into environments

91
0:04:21.405,000 --> 0:04:23,000
where these new networks are going to be more likely to form?

92
0:04:24.306,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And it turns out that, in fact, the network patterns of the outside world

93
0:04:28.007,000 --> 0:04:32,000
mimic a lot of the network patterns of the internal world of a human brain.

94
0:04:32.203,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So the metaphor I'd like to use,

95
0:04:35.192,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I can take from a story of a great idea that's quite recent --

96
0:04:39.639,000 --> 0:04:41,000
a lot more recent than the 1650s.

97
0:04:43.461,000 --> 0:04:45,000
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero

98
0:04:45.525,000 --> 0:04:47,000
has an organization called Design That Matters.

99
0:04:48.636,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They decided to tackle this really pressing problem

100
0:04:52.254,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates

101
0:04:55.81,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in the developing world.

102
0:04:57.691,000 --> 0:04:59,000
One of the things that's very frustrating about this

103
0:05:00.164,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is that we know by getting modern neonatal incubators into any context,

104
0:05:05.565,000 --> 0:05:08,000
if we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple --

105
0:05:08.892,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.

106
0:05:11.659,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So the technology is there.

107
0:05:13.476,000 --> 0:05:15,000
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds.

108
0:05:16.311,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,

109
0:05:19.77,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and you send it off to a midsized village in Africa,

110
0:05:23.173,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it will work great for a year or two years,

111
0:05:25.708,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and then something will go wrong and it will break,

112
0:05:28.161,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it will remain broken forever,

113
0:05:30.321,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because you don't have a whole system of spare parts,

114
0:05:33.082,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise

115
0:05:35.273,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.

116
0:05:37.74,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So you end up having this problem where you spend all this money

117
0:05:40.812,000 --> 0:05:43,000
getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries,

118
0:05:43.969,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and it ends up being useless.

119
0:05:45.393,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So what Prestero and his team decided to do

120
0:05:47.434,000 --> 0:05:49,000
was to look around and see: What are the abundant resources

121
0:05:50.233,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in these developing world contexts?

122
0:05:51.957,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And what they noticed was,

123
0:05:53.246,000 --> 0:05:56,000
they don't have a lot of DVRs, they don't have a lot of microwaves,

124
0:05:56.484,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.

125
0:05:59.909,000 --> 0:06:02,000
There's a Toyota 4Runner on the street in all these places.

126
0:06:03.214,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.

127
0:06:06.569,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So they started to think,

128
0:06:07.878,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Could we build a neonatal incubator

129
0:06:10.81,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that's built entirely out of automobile parts?"

130
0:06:13.988,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And this is what they came up with.

131
0:06:15.741,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's called the NeoNurture device.

132
0:06:17.404,000 --> 0:06:19,000
From the outside, it looks like a normal little thing

133
0:06:19.921,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you'd find in a modern Western hospital.

134
0:06:22.106,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In the inside, it's all car parts.

135
0:06:23.763,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth,

136
0:06:26.005,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it's got door chimes for alarm,

137
0:06:27.648,000 --> 0:06:28,000
it runs off a car battery.

138
0:06:29.338,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota

139
0:06:32.349,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and the ability to fix a headlight,

140
0:06:34.081,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and you can repair this thing.

141
0:06:35.614,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Now that's a great idea,

142
0:06:36.79,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but I'd like to say that, in fact,

143
0:06:38.48,000 --> 0:06:4,000
this is a great metaphor for the way ideas happen.

144
0:06:40.86,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know,

145
0:06:43.246,000 --> 0:06:45,000
are like that $40,000, brand-new incubator,

146
0:06:45.294,000 --> 0:06:46,000
state-of-the-art technology.

147
0:06:46.663,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But more often than not, they're cobbled together

148
0:06:48.978,000 --> 0:06:5,000
from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby.

149
0:06:51.449,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We take ideas from other people,

150
0:06:53.004,000 --> 0:06:56,000
people we've learned from, people we run into in the coffee shop,

151
0:06:56.093,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new.

152
0:06:59.456,000 --> 0:07:,000
That's really where innovation happens.

153
0:07:01.351,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And that means we have to change some of our models

154
0:07:03.771,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right?

155
0:07:06.722,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I mean, this is one vision of it.

156
0:07:08.34,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Another is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge.

157
0:07:11.937,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This is a statue from Oxford.

158
0:07:13.444,000 --> 0:07:15,000
You know, you're sitting there, thinking a deep thought,

159
0:07:16.147,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.

160
0:07:19.363,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation tend to look like this.

161
0:07:23.401,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,

162
0:07:27.035,000 --> 0:07:29,000
but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then.

163
0:07:29.691,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This is the kind of chaotic environment where ideas were likely to come together,

164
0:07:33.654,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where people were likely to have new, interesting, unpredictable collisions,

165
0:07:37.287,000 --> 0:07:38,000
people from different backgrounds.

166
0:07:38.932,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative,

167
0:07:42.119,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we have to build spaces that, strangely enough, look a bit more like this.

168
0:07:45.633,000 --> 0:07:48,000
This is what your office should look like, it's part of my message here.

169
0:07:49.064,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And one of the problems with this is that, when you research this field,

170
0:07:52.495,000 --> 0:07:54,000
people are notoriously unreliable

171
0:07:54.607,000 --> 0:07:57,000
when they actually self-report on where they have their own good ideas,

172
0:07:58.024,000 --> 0:08:,000
or their history of their best ideas.

173
0:08:00.768,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar

174
0:08:04.127,000 --> 0:08:07,000
decided to go around and basically do the Big Brother approach

175
0:08:07.784,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to figuring out where good ideas come from.

176
0:08:09.812,000 --> 0:08:11,000
He went to a bunch of science labs around the world

177
0:08:12.274,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job:

178
0:08:15.93,000 --> 0:08:17,000
when they were sitting in front of the microscope,

179
0:08:18.311,000 --> 0:08:2,000
when they were talking to colleagues at the watercooler ...

180
0:08:21.139,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And he recorded all these conversations

181
0:08:23.045,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and tried to figure out where the most important ideas happened.

182
0:08:26.185,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,

183
0:08:29.52,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we have this image -- you know, they're poring over the microscope,

184
0:08:32.731,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and they see something in the tissue sample,

185
0:08:34.83,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and -- "Eureka!" -- they've got the idea.

186
0:08:36.961,000 --> 0:08:39,000
What happened, actually, when Dunbar looked at the tape,

187
0:08:40.294,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas

188
0:08:43.556,000 --> 0:08:46,000
did not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.

189
0:08:46.675,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting,

190
0:08:50.056,000 --> 0:08:53,000
when everybody got together and shared their latest data and findings,

191
0:08:53.703,000 --> 0:08:55,000
oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having,

192
0:08:56.592,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.

193
0:08:59.324,000 --> 0:09:,000
And something about that environment --

194
0:09:01.317,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and I've started calling it the "liquid network,"

195
0:09:03.646,000 --> 0:09:05,000
where you have lots of different ideas that are together,

196
0:09:06.616,000 --> 0:09:08,000
different backgrounds, different interests,

197
0:09:08.669,000 --> 0:09:1,000
jostling with each other, bouncing off each other --

198
0:09:11.134,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that environment is, in fact, the environment that leads to innovation.

199
0:09:14.622,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The other problem that people have is,

200
0:09:16.469,000 --> 0:09:18,000
they like to condense their stories of innovation

201
0:09:18.86,000 --> 0:09:19,000
down to shorter time frames.

202
0:09:20.552,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So they want to tell the story of the eureka moment.

203
0:09:23.242,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there,

204
0:09:25.755,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and I had it all, suddenly, clear in my head."

205
0:09:27.943,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But, in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record,

206
0:09:30.925,000 --> 0:09:35,000
it turns out that a lot of important ideas have very long incubation periods.

207
0:09:36.483,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I call this the "slow hunch."

208
0:09:38.412,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We've heard a lot recently about hunch and instinct

209
0:09:42.967,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and blink-like sudden moments of clarity,

210
0:09:46.092,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but, in fact, a lot of great ideas linger on, sometimes for decades,

211
0:09:50.168,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in the back of people's minds.

212
0:09:51.649,000 --> 0:09:53,000
They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem,

213
0:09:54.302,000 --> 0:09:56,000
but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them.

214
0:09:57.001,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They spend all this time working on certain problems,

215
0:09:59.511,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but there's another thing lingering there that they're interested in,

216
0:10:02.819,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but can't quite solve.

217
0:10:04.034,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Darwin is a great example of this.

218
0:10:05.693,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Darwin himself, in his autobiography,

219
0:10:07.721,000 --> 0:10:1,000
tells the story of coming up with the idea for natural selection

220
0:10:11.289,000 --> 0:10:12,000
as a classic eureka moment.

221
0:10:13.29,000 --> 0:10:16,000
He's in his study, it's October of 1838,

222
0:10:17.005,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and he's reading Malthus, actually, on population.

223
0:10:19.884,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And all of a sudden,

224
0:10:21.092,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head,

225
0:10:24.307,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."

226
0:10:27.486,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That's in his autobiography.

227
0:10:29.381,000 --> 0:10:3,000
About a decade or two ago,

228
0:10:30.73,000 --> 0:10:31,000
a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber

229
0:10:32.73,000 --> 0:10:35,000
went back and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period.

230
0:10:36.413,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Darwin kept these copious notebooks,

231
0:10:38.204,000 --> 0:10:41,000
where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.

232
0:10:41.319,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And what Gruber found was that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection

233
0:10:46.636,000 --> 0:10:47,000
for months and months and months

234
0:10:48.269,000 --> 0:10:52,000
before he had his alleged epiphany reading Malthus in October of 1838.

235
0:10:53.194,000 --> 0:10:54,000
There are passages where you can read it,

236
0:10:55.196,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook,

237
0:10:58.321,000 --> 0:11:,000
from the period before he has his epiphany.

238
0:11:00.799,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,

239
0:11:03.28,000 --> 0:11:04,000
had the idea, he had the concept,

240
0:11:05.107,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but was unable to fully think it yet.

241
0:11:08.361,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And that is, actually, how great ideas often happen --

242
0:11:11.268,000 --> 0:11:13,000
they fade into view over long periods of time.

243
0:11:13.823,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Now the challenge for all of us is:

244
0:11:15.691,000 --> 0:11:16,000
How do you create environments

245
0:11:17.157,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that allow these ideas to have this long half-life?

246
0:11:19.928,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It's hard to go to your boss and say,

247
0:11:21.727,000 --> 0:11:23,000
"I have an excellent idea for our organization.

248
0:11:23.972,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It will be useful in 2020."

249
0:11:25.367,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

250
0:11:26.81,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"Could you just give me some time to do that?"

251
0:11:29.046,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Now a couple of companies like Google have innovation time off, 20 percent time.

252
0:11:32.912,000 --> 0:11:35,000
In a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization.

253
0:11:36.274,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But that's a key thing.

254
0:11:38.071,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And the other thing is to allow those hunches

255
0:11:40.498,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to connect with other people's hunches;

256
0:11:42.403,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that's what often happens.

257
0:11:43.682,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half,

258
0:11:46.484,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and if you're in the right environment,

259
0:11:48.374,000 --> 0:11:5,000
they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.

260
0:11:51.218,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So in a sense,

261
0:11:52.394,000 --> 0:11:55,000
we often talk about the value of protecting intellectual property --

262
0:11:55.646,000 --> 0:11:56,000
you know, building barricades,

263
0:11:57.105,000 --> 0:12:,000
having secretive R and D labs, patenting everything that we have

264
0:12:00.979,000 --> 0:12:02,000
so that those ideas will remain valuable,

265
0:12:03.47,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas,

266
0:12:06.349,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and the culture will be more innovative.

267
0:12:08.576,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But I think there's a case to be made

268
0:12:10.376,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that we should spend at least as much time, if not more,

269
0:12:13.036,000 --> 0:12:14,000
valuing the premise of connecting ideas

270
0:12:15.001,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and not just protecting them.

271
0:12:17.809,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And I'll leave you with this story,

272
0:12:19.521,000 --> 0:12:21,000
which I think captures a lot of these values.

273
0:12:21.897,000 --> 0:12:26,000
It's just a wonderful tale of innovation, and how it happens in unlikely ways.

274
0:12:27.431,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's October of 1957,

275
0:12:30.614,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and Sputnik has just launched.

276
0:12:32.741,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And we're in Laurel, Maryland,

277
0:12:34.81,000 --> 0:12:38,000
at the Applied Physics Lab associated with Johns Hopkins University.

278
0:12:39.314,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It's Monday morning,

279
0:12:40.561,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and the news has just broken about this satellite

280
0:12:43.321,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that's now orbiting the planet.

281
0:12:44.923,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And, of course, this is nerd heaven, right?

282
0:12:47.477,000 --> 0:12:49,000
There are all these physics geeks who are there,

283
0:12:49.811,000 --> 0:12:52,000
thinking, "Oh my gosh! This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened."

284
0:12:53.53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And two of them, two twentysomething researchers at the APL,

285
0:12:56.372,000 --> 0:12:58,000
are there at the cafeteria table,

286
0:12:58.484,000 --> 0:13:01,000
having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.

287
0:13:01.564,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.

288
0:13:04.005,000 --> 0:13:05,000
They start talking, and one of them says,

289
0:13:05.988,000 --> 0:13:07,000
"Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing?

290
0:13:08.925,000 --> 0:13:11,000
There's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space

291
0:13:12.34,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.

292
0:13:14.719,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."

293
0:13:16.751,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So they ask around to a couple of their colleagues,

294
0:13:19.162,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and everybody's like, "No, I hadn't thought of doing that.

295
0:13:21.925,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That's an interesting idea."

296
0:13:23.291,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception,

297
0:13:27.244,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and he's got a little antenna set up with an amplifier in his office.

298
0:13:31.132,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office,

299
0:13:33.86,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and they start noodling around -- "hacking," as we might call it now.

300
0:13:37.18,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And after a couple of hours, they start picking up the signal,

301
0:13:40.305,000 --> 0:13:43,000
because the Soviets made Sputnik very easy to track;

302
0:13:43.375,000 --> 0:13:45,000
it was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,

303
0:13:46.362,000 --> 0:13:49,000
because they were afraid people would think it was a hoax, basically,

304
0:13:49.636,000 --> 0:13:5,000
so they made it really easy to find.

305
0:13:51.396,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So these guys are sitting there, listening to this signal,

306
0:13:54.298,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and people start coming into the office and saying,

307
0:13:56.717,000 --> 0:13:57,000
"That's pretty cool. Can I hear?"

308
0:13:58.339,000 --> 0:14:,000
And before long, they think, "Jeez, this is kind of historic.

309
0:14:01.284,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We may be the first people in the United States listening to this.

310
0:14:04.424,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We should record it."

311
0:14:05.607,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder

312
0:14:08.179,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and start recording these little bleep, bleeps.

313
0:14:10.597,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And they start writing down the date stamp, time stamps

314
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
for each little bleep that they record.

315
0:14:16.643,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And then they start thinking,

316
0:14:18.068,000 --> 0:14:21,000
"Well, gosh, we're noticing small little frequency variations here.

317
0:14:21.335,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We could probably calculate the speed that the satellite is traveling

318
0:14:26.35,000 --> 0:14:3,000
if we do a little basic math here using the Doppler effect."

319
0:14:30.904,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And they played around with it a little bit more

320
0:14:33.184,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other specialties.

321
0:14:37.017,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And they said, "You know,

322
0:14:38.252,000 --> 0:14:4,000
we could actually look at the slope of the Doppler effect

323
0:14:40.997,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to figure out the points at which the satellite is closest to our antenna

324
0:14:44.545,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and the points at which it's furthest away.

325
0:14:46.693,000 --> 0:14:47,000
That's pretty cool."

326
0:14:47.869,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Eventually, they get permission -- this is all a little side project

327
0:14:51.117,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that hadn't been officially part of their job description --

328
0:14:53.97,000 --> 0:14:55,000
they get permission to use the new UNIVAC computer

329
0:14:56.493,000 --> 0:14:59,000
that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.

330
0:14:59.547,000 --> 0:15:,000
And they run some more of the numbers,

331
0:15:01.39,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and at the end of about three or four weeks,

332
0:15:03.464,000 --> 0:15:05,000
turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory

333
0:15:05.694,000 --> 0:15:06,000
of this satellite around the Earth,

334
0:15:07.39,000 --> 0:15:09,000
just from listening to this one little signal,

335
0:15:09.584,000 --> 0:15:12,000
going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do

336
0:15:12.987,000 --> 0:15:13,000
over lunch one morning.

337
0:15:15.81,000 --> 0:15:17,000
A couple weeks later, their boss, Frank McClure,

338
0:15:18.334,000 --> 0:15:19,000
pulls them into the room and says,

339
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something

340
0:15:22.295,000 --> 0:15:23,000
about that project you were working on.

341
0:15:24.194,000 --> 0:15:27,000
You've figured out an unknown location

342
0:15:27.252,000 --> 0:15:31,000
of a satellite orbiting the planet from a known location on the ground.

343
0:15:32.034,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Could you go the other way?

344
0:15:33.66,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground

345
0:15:36.233,000 --> 0:15:38,000
if you knew the location of the satellite?"

346
0:15:38.838,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And they thought about it and they said,

347
0:15:40.772,000 --> 0:15:42,000
"Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here."

348
0:15:43.78,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So they went back and thought about it

349
0:15:45.633,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier."

350
0:15:48.095,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And he said, "Oh, that's great,

351
0:15:49.647,000 --> 0:15:51,000
because, see, I have these new nuclear submarines"

352
0:15:52.179,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Laughter)

353
0:15:53.205,000 --> 0:15:54,000
"that I'm building.

354
0:15:54.576,000 --> 0:15:56,000
And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile

355
0:15:57.469,000 --> 0:15:59,000
so that it will land right on top of Moscow

356
0:15:59.586,000 --> 0:16:02,000
if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

357
0:16:03.199,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So we're thinking we could throw up a bunch of satellites

358
0:16:05.957,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and use it to track our submarines

359
0:16:08.684,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.

360
0:16:11.389,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Could you work on that problem?"

361
0:16:12.942,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And that's how GPS was born.

362
0:16:16.168,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Thirty years later,

363
0:16:17.359,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Ronald Reagan, actually, opened it up and made it an open platform

364
0:16:20.849,000 --> 0:16:21,000
that anybody could build upon,

365
0:16:22.493,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and anybody could come along and build new technology

366
0:16:25.071,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that would create and innovate on top of this open platform,

367
0:16:29.136,000 --> 0:16:32,000
left it open for anyone to do pretty much anything they wanted with it.

368
0:16:32.94,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And now, I guarantee you, certainly half of this room, if not more,

369
0:16:38.043,000 --> 0:16:4,000
has a device sitting in their pocket right now

370
0:16:40.242,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space.

371
0:16:43.025,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And I bet you one of you, if not more,

372
0:16:45.81,000 --> 0:16:48,000
has used said device and said satellite system

373
0:16:48.956,000 --> 0:16:51,000
to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last --

374
0:16:52.524,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Laughter)

375
0:16:53.978,000 --> 0:16:55,000
in the last day or last week, right?

376
0:16:56.81,000 --> 0:16:59,000
(Applause)

377
0:17:00.107,000 --> 0:17:01,000
And that, I think,

378
0:17:01.703,000 --> 0:17:03,000
is a great case study, a great lesson

379
0:17:04.276,000 --> 0:17:08,000
in the power -- the marvelous, unplanned, emergent, unpredictable power --

380
0:17:09.244,000 --> 0:17:1,000
of open innovative systems.

381
0:17:11.262,000 --> 0:17:12,000
When you build them right,

382
0:17:12.526,000 --> 0:17:14,000
they will be led to completely new directions

383
0:17:14.656,000 --> 0:17:15,000
the creators never even dreamed of.

384
0:17:16.351,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I mean, here you have these guys

385
0:17:17.9,000 --> 0:17:19,000
who basically thought they were just following this hunch,

386
0:17:20.644,000 --> 0:17:21,000
this little passion that had developed,

387
0:17:22.548,000 --> 0:17:24,000
then they thought they were fighting the Cold War,

388
0:17:24.915,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and then, it turns out, they're just helping somebody find a soy latte.

389
0:17:28.31,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Laughter)

390
0:17:29.468,000 --> 0:17:31,000
That is how innovation happens.

391
0:17:31.631,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Chance favors the connected mind.

392
0:17:33.826,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Thank you very much.

393
0:17:35.159,000 --> 0:17:4,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What if an African girl from a traditional family

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in a part of future Africa

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is accepted into the finest university in the galaxy,

4
0:00:21.92,000 --> 0:00:22,000
planets away?

5
0:00:24.28,000 --> 0:00:25,000
What if she decides to go?

6
0:00:27.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This is an excerpt from my "Binti" novella trilogy:

7
0:00:32.12,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I powered up the transporter and said a silent prayer.

8
0:00:35.6,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I had no idea what I was going to do if it didn't work.

9
0:00:38.88,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My transporter was cheap,

10
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:43,000
so even a droplet of moisture or, more likely, a grain of sand,

11
0:00:43.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
would cause it to short.

12
0:00:45.8,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It was faulty, and most of the time I had to restart it over and over

13
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
before it worked.

14
0:00:50.32,000 --> 0:00:53,000
"Please not now, please not now," I thought.

15
0:00:53.56,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The transporter shivered in the sand and I held my breath.

16
0:00:57.2,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Tiny, flat and black as a prayer stone,

17
0:00:59.52,000 --> 0:01:02,000
it buzzed softly and then slowly rose from the sand.

18
0:01:03.76,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Finally, it produced the baggage-lifting force.

19
0:01:06.28,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I grinned.

20
0:01:07.84,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now I could make it to the shuttle on time.

21
0:01:11.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I swiped otjize from my forehead with my index finger and knelt down,

22
0:01:15.72,000 --> 0:01:16,000
then I touched the finger to the sand,

23
0:01:17.6,000 --> 0:01:19,000
grounding the sweet-smelling red clay into it.

24
0:01:20.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"Thank you," I whispered.

25
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It was a half-mile walk along the dark desert road.

26
0:01:26.04,000 --> 0:01:28,000
With the transporter working I would make it there on time.

27
0:01:30.08,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Straightening up, I paused and shut my eyes.

28
0:01:32.84,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now, the weight of my entire life was pressing on my shoulders.

29
0:01:36.76,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was defying the most traditional part of myself for the first time

30
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in my entire life.

31
0:01:41.6,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I was leaving in the dead of night, and they had no clue.

32
0:01:45.76,000 --> 0:01:48,000
My nine siblings, all older than me except for my younger sister and brother,

33
0:01:49.44,000 --> 0:01:51,000
would never see this coming.

34
0:01:51.48,000 --> 0:01:54,000
My parents would never imagine I'd do such a thing in a million years.

35
0:01:55.64,000 --> 0:01:58,000
By the time they all realized what I'd done and where I was going,

36
0:01:59.44,000 --> 0:02:,000
I'd have left the planet.

37
0:02:02.84,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In my absence, my parents would growl to each other

38
0:02:05.56,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that I was never to set foot in their home again.

39
0:02:08.44,000 --> 0:02:1,000
My four aunties and two uncles who lived down the road

40
0:02:11.04,000 --> 0:02:12,000
would shout and gossip amongst themselves

41
0:02:13.04,000 --> 0:02:15,000
about how I had scandalized the entire bloodline.

42
0:02:16.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I was going to be a pariah.

43
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"Go," I softly whispered to the transporter,

44
0:02:21.759,000 --> 0:02:22,000
stamping my foot.

45
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The thin metal rings I wore around each ankle jingled noisily,

46
0:02:26.84,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but I stamped my foot again.

47
0:02:29.44,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Once on, the transporter worked best when I didn't touch it.

48
0:02:32.8,000 --> 0:02:35,000
"Go," I said again, sweat forming on my brow.

49
0:02:36.6,000 --> 0:02:37,000
When nothing moved,

50
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I chanced giving the two large suitcases sitting atop the force field a shove.

51
0:02:42.52,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They moved smoothly, and I breathed another sigh of relief.

52
0:02:45.6,000 --> 0:02:47,000
At least some luck was on my side.

53
0:02:50.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, in a distant future part of Africa,

54
0:02:53.8,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Binti is a mathematical genius of the Himba ethnic group.

55
0:02:57.6,000 --> 0:02:59,000
She's been accepted into a university on another planet,

56
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and she's decided to go.

57
0:03:02.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Carrying the blood of her people in her veins,

58
0:03:04.96,000 --> 0:03:08,000
adorned with the teachings, ways, even the land on her very skin,

59
0:03:09.76,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Binti leaves the earth.

60
0:03:12.48,000 --> 0:03:15,000
As the story progresses, she becomes not other, but more.

61
0:03:16.36,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This idea of leaving but bringing and then becoming more

62
0:03:19.56,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is at one of the hearts of Afrofuturism,

63
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or you can simply call it a different type of science fiction.

64
0:03:26.92,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I can best explain the difference between classic science fiction and Afrofuturism

65
0:03:31.08,000 --> 0:03:32,000
if I used the octopus analogy.

66
0:03:34.68,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Like humans,

67
0:03:35.92,000 --> 0:03:38,000
octopuses are some of the most intelligent creatures on earth.

68
0:03:39.12,000 --> 0:03:43,000
However, octopus intelligence evolved from a different evolutionary line,

69
0:03:44.08,000 --> 0:03:46,000
separate from that of human beings,

70
0:03:46.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
so the foundation is different.

71
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The same can be said about the foundations of various forms of science fiction.

72
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So much of science fiction speculates

73
0:03:57.48,000 --> 0:04:,000
about technologies, societies, social issues,

74
0:04:00.72,000 --> 0:04:03,000
what's beyond our planet, what's within our planet.

75
0:04:03.76,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms

76
0:04:06.76,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of political writing.

77
0:04:08.44,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's all about the question, "What if?"

78
0:04:11.8,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Still, not all science fiction has the same ancestral bloodline,

79
0:04:16.76,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that line being Western-rooted science fiction,

80
0:04:19.76,000 --> 0:04:2,000
which is mostly white and male.

81
0:04:22.2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We're talking Isaac Asimov, Jules Verne,

82
0:04:25.72,000 --> 0:04:28,000
H.G. Wells, George Orwell, Robert Heinlein, etc.

83
0:04:30.839,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So what if a Nigerian-American wrote science fiction?

84
0:04:35.6,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Growing up, I didn't read much science fiction.

85
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I couldn't relate to these stories

86
0:04:40.64,000 --> 0:04:45,000
preoccupied with xenophobia, colonization and seeing aliens as others.

87
0:04:46.24,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I saw no reflection of anyone who looked like me in those narratives.

88
0:04:50.84,000 --> 0:04:51,000
In the "Binti" novella trilogy,

89
0:04:52.4,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Binti leaves the planet to seek education from extraterrestrials.

90
0:04:56.72,000 --> 0:04:57,000
She goes out as she is,

91
0:04:58.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
looking the way she looks,

92
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
carrying her cultures,

93
0:05:01.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
being who she is.

94
0:05:04.12,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I was inspired to write this story

95
0:05:05.8,000 --> 0:05:09,000
not because I was following a line of classic space opera narratives,

96
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but because of blood that runs deep,

97
0:05:12.36,000 --> 0:05:14,000
family, cultural conflict

98
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the need to see an African girl leave the planet on her own terms.

99
0:05:20.64,000 --> 0:05:22,000
My science fiction had different ancestors,

100
0:05:23.64,000 --> 0:05:24,000
African ones.

101
0:05:26.56,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So I'm Nigerian-American.

102
0:05:28.72,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I was born to two Nigerian immigrant parents

103
0:05:31.24,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and raised in the United States,

104
0:05:33.4,000 --> 0:05:35,000
one of the birthplaces of classic science fiction.

105
0:05:36.12,000 --> 0:05:41,000
However, it was my Nigerian heritage that led me to write science fiction.

106
0:05:41.44,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Specifically I cite those family trips to Nigeria in the late '90s.

107
0:05:47.04,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'd been taking trips back to Nigeria with my family since I was very young.

108
0:05:51.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
These early trips inspired me.

109
0:05:54.56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Hence the first story that I ever even wrote took place in Nigeria.

110
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:,000
I wrote mainly magical realism and fantasy

111
0:06:01.72,000 --> 0:06:02,000
inspired by my love of Igbo

112
0:06:03.32,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and other West African traditional cosmologies and spiritualities.

113
0:06:08.4,000 --> 0:06:1,000
However, in the late '90s,

114
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I started noticing the role of technology in Nigeria:

115
0:06:15.24,000 --> 0:06:17,000
cable TV and cell phones in the village,

116
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:21,000
419 scammers occupying the cybercafes,

117
0:06:21.92,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the small generator connected to my cousin's desktop computer

118
0:06:25.36,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because the power was always going on and off.

119
0:06:28.76,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And my Americanness othered me enough

120
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to be intrigued by these things that most Nigerians saw as normal.

121
0:06:36.4,000 --> 0:06:38,000
My intrigue eventually gave birth to stories.

122
0:06:40.32,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I started opening strange doors.

123
0:06:44.48,000 --> 0:06:47,000
What if aliens came to Lagos, Nigeria?

124
0:06:50.8,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is an excerpt from my novel, "Lagoon."

125
0:06:56.32,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Everybody saw it,

126
0:06:58.32,000 --> 0:06:59,000
all over the world.

127
0:07:00.76,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That was a real introduction to the great mess happening in Lagos,

128
0:07:04.32,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Nigeria, West Africa, Africa, here.

129
0:07:10.36,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Because so many people in Lagos had portable, chargeable,

130
0:07:13.48,000 --> 0:07:17,000
glowing, vibrating, chirping, tweeting, communicating, connected devices,

131
0:07:17.92,000 --> 0:07:2,000
practically everything was recorded and posted online in some way,

132
0:07:21.64,000 --> 0:07:22,000
somehow,

133
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
quickly.

134
0:07:25.08,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The modern human world is connected like a spider's web.

135
0:07:30.04,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The world was watching.

136
0:07:32.2,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It watched in fascinated horror

137
0:07:34.48,000 --> 0:07:35,000
for information,

138
0:07:36.56,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but mostly for entertainment.

139
0:07:39.2,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Footage of what was happening dominated every international news source,

140
0:07:42.76,000 --> 0:07:47,000
video-sharing website, social network, circle, pyramid and trapezoid.

141
0:07:47.8,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But the story goes deeper.

142
0:07:50.08,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It is in the mud,

143
0:07:51.84,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the dirt,

144
0:07:53.4,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the earth,

145
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in the fond memory of the soily cosmos.

146
0:07:58.56,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It is in the always mingling past, present and future.

147
0:08:02.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It is in the water.

148
0:08:04.64,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It is in the powerful spirits and ancestors who dwelled in Lagos.

149
0:08:08.56,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It is in the hearts and minds of the people of Lagos.

150
0:08:12.72,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Change begets change.

151
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The alien Ayodele knew it.

152
0:08:17.72,000 --> 0:08:18,000
All her people know it.

153
0:08:21.2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So, this is a voice of Udide, the supreme spider artist,

154
0:08:25.08,000 --> 0:08:26,000
who is older than dirt

155
0:08:26.44,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and lives in the dirt beneath the city of Lagos,

156
0:08:29.04,000 --> 0:08:3,000
listening and commenting

157
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and weaving the story of extraterrestrials coming to Lagos.

158
0:08:35.12,000 --> 0:08:38,000
In the end, the great spider who was the size of a house

159
0:08:38.88,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and responsible for weaving the past, present and future

160
0:08:41.84,000 --> 0:08:43,000
decides to come forth and be a part of the story.

161
0:08:45.559,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Like Udide, the spider artist,

162
0:08:47.96,000 --> 0:08:5,000
African science fiction's blood runs deep

163
0:08:51.159,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and it's old,

164
0:08:52.96,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and it's ready to come forth,

165
0:08:55.24,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and when it does,

166
0:08:56.84,000 --> 0:09:,000
imagine the new technologies, ideas and sociopolitical changes it'll inspire.

167
0:09:03.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
For Africans, homegrown science fiction can be a will to power.

168
0:09:08.84,000 --> 0:09:09,000
What if?

169
0:09:10.52,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It's a powerful question.

170
0:09:12.6,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Thank you.

171
0:09:13.84,000 --> 0:09:18,000

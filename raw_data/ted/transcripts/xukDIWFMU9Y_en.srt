2
0:00:15.692,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Now, I don't usually like cartoons,

3
0:00:18.414,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I don't think many of them are funny,

4
0:00:20.924,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I find them weird. But I love this cartoon from the New Yorker.

5
0:00:26.147,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Text: Never, ever think outside the box.) (Laughter)

6
0:00:28.759,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So, the guy is telling the cat,

7
0:00:31.228,000 --> 0:00:36,000
don't you dare think outside the box.

8
0:00:36.599,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Well, I'm afraid I used to be the cat.

9
0:00:39.906,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I always wanted to be outside the box.

10
0:00:42.964,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And it's partly because I came to this field

11
0:00:46.446,000 --> 0:00:51,000
from a different background, chemist and a bacterial geneticist.

12
0:00:51.659,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So, what people were saying to me

13
0:00:54.261,000 --> 0:00:57,000
about the cause of cancer, sources of cancer,

14
0:00:57.452,000 --> 0:01:,000
or, for that matter, why you are who you are,

15
0:01:00.533,000 --> 0:01:01,000
didn't make sense.

16
0:01:02.407,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So, let me quickly try and tell you why I thought that

17
0:01:05.454,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and how I went about it.

18
0:01:08.055,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, to begin with, however,

19
0:01:10.487,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I have to give you a very, very quick lesson

20
0:01:14.913,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in developmental biology,

21
0:01:16.68,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with apologies to those of you who know some biology.

22
0:01:20.742,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So, when your mom and dad met,

23
0:01:23.756,000 --> 0:01:25,000
there is a fertilized egg,

24
0:01:26.43,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that round thing with that little blip.

25
0:01:28.551,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It grows and then it grows,

26
0:01:31.606,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and then it makes this handsome man.

27
0:01:35.759,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:37.174,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So, this guy, with all the cells in his body,

29
0:01:42.832,000 --> 0:01:46,000
all have the same genetic information.

30
0:01:47.044,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So how did his nose become his nose, his elbow his elbow,

31
0:01:51.419,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and why doesn't he get up one morning

32
0:01:53.595,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and have his nose turn into his foot?

33
0:01:56.155,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It could. It has the genetic information.

34
0:01:59.395,000 --> 0:02:,000
You all remember, dolly,

35
0:02:00.603,000 --> 0:02:02,000
it came from a single mammary cell.

36
0:02:03.284,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, why doesn't it do it?

37
0:02:05.218,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So, have a guess of how many cells he has in his body.

38
0:02:10.721,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Somewhere between 10 trillion to 70 trillion cells in his body.

39
0:02:18.123,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Trillion!

40
0:02:19.763,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now, how did these cells, all with the same genetic material,

41
0:02:24.401,000 --> 0:02:26,000
make all those tissues?

42
0:02:26.609,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And so, the question I raised before

43
0:02:29.753,000 --> 0:02:32,000
becomes even more interesting if you thought about

44
0:02:33.367,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the enormity of this in every one of your bodies.

45
0:02:37.953,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now, the dominant cancer theory would say

46
0:02:40.953,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that there is a single oncogene

47
0:02:43.265,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in a single cancer cell, and it would make you

48
0:02:46.969,000 --> 0:02:48,000
a cancer victim.

49
0:02:49.618,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Well, this did not make sense to me.

50
0:02:53.284,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Do you even know how a trillion looks?

51
0:02:56.466,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, let's look at it.

52
0:02:58.185,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There it comes, these zeroes after zeroes after zeroes.

53
0:03:03.226,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, if .0001 of these cells got mutated,

54
0:03:10.044,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and .00001 got cancer, you will be a lump of cancer.

55
0:03:15.301,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You will have cancer all over you. And you're not.

56
0:03:17.597,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Why not?

57
0:03:19.906,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So, I decided over the years,

58
0:03:23.628,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because of a series of experiments

59
0:03:25.556,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that this is because of context and architecture.

60
0:03:30.436,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And let me quickly tell you

61
0:03:32.613,000 --> 0:03:35,000
some crucial experiment that was able to actually show this.

62
0:03:36.54,000 --> 0:03:39,000
To begin with, I came to work with this virus

63
0:03:40.451,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that causes that ugly tumor in the chicken.

64
0:03:43.844,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Rous discovered this in 1911.

65
0:03:47.204,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It was the first cancer virus discovered,

66
0:03:50.769,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and when I call it "oncogene," meaning "cancer gene."

67
0:03:55.66,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So, he made a filtrate, he took this filter

68
0:03:58.572,000 --> 0:04:02,000
which was the liquid after he passed the tumor through a filter,

69
0:04:02.828,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and he injected it to another chicken, and he got another tumor.

70
0:04:06.829,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So, scientists were very excited,

71
0:04:09.54,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and they said, a single oncogene can do it.

72
0:04:11.708,000 --> 0:04:13,000
All you need is a single oncogene.

73
0:04:14.004,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So, they put the cells in cultures, chicken cells,

74
0:04:16.899,000 --> 0:04:18,000
dumped the virus on it,

75
0:04:18.934,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and it would pile up,

76
0:04:20.383,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and they would say, this is malignant and this is normal.

77
0:04:23.404,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And again this didn't make sense to me.

78
0:04:25.422,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So for various reasons, we took this oncogene,

79
0:04:28.708,000 --> 0:04:3,000
attached it to a blue marker,

80
0:04:31.02,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we injected it into the embryos.

81
0:04:34.028,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now look at that. There is that beautiful feather in the embryo.

82
0:04:38.221,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene

83
0:04:42.5,000 --> 0:04:46,000
inside a cancer cell, and they're part of the feather.

84
0:04:46.916,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So, when we dissociated the feather and put it in a dish,

85
0:04:51.516,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we got a mass of blue cells.

86
0:04:54.228,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So, in the chicken you get a tumor,

87
0:04:55.694,000 --> 0:04:56,000
in the embryo you don't,

88
0:04:57.398,000 --> 0:05:,000
you dissociate, you put it in a dish, you get another tumor.

89
0:05:01.39,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What does that mean?

90
0:05:02.613,000 --> 0:05:04,000
That means that microenvironment

91
0:05:05.597,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and the context which surrounds those cells

92
0:05:09.606,000 --> 0:05:15,000
actually are telling the cancer gene and the cancer cell what to do.

93
0:05:16.533,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, let's take a normal example.

94
0:05:19.845,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The normal example, let's take the human mammary gland.

95
0:05:23.03,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I work on breast cancer.

96
0:05:24.51,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So, here is a lovely human breast.

97
0:05:27.517,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And many of you know how it looks,

98
0:05:29.465,000 --> 0:05:31,000
except that inside that breast, there are all these

99
0:05:32.318,000 --> 0:05:35,000
pretty, developing, tree-like structures.

100
0:05:35.695,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So, we decided that what we like to do

101
0:05:38.593,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is take just a bit of that mammary gland,

102
0:05:41.553,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which is called an "acinus,"

103
0:05:43.585,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where there are all these little things inside the breast

104
0:05:47.226,000 --> 0:05:5,000
where the milk goes, and the end of the nipple

105
0:05:50.769,000 --> 0:05:53,000
comes through that little tube when the baby sucks.

106
0:05:54.313,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And we said, wonderful! Look at this pretty structure.

107
0:05:57.72,000 --> 0:06:,000
We want to make this a structure, and ask the question,

108
0:06:01.489,000 --> 0:06:02,000
how do the cells do that?

109
0:06:03.193,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So, we took the red cells --

110
0:06:04.985,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you see the red cells are surrounded by blue,

111
0:06:08.233,000 --> 0:06:11,000
other cells that squeeze them, and behind it

112
0:06:11.562,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is material that people thought was mainly inert,

113
0:06:15.28,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and it was just having a structure to keep the shape,

114
0:06:18.877,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and so we first photographed it

115
0:06:21.805,000 --> 0:06:23,000
with the electron microscope years and years ago,

116
0:06:24.573,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and you see this cell is actually quite pretty.

117
0:06:27.629,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It has a bottom, it has a top,

118
0:06:30.092,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it is secreting gobs and gobs of milk,

119
0:06:32.773,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because it just came from an early pregnant mouse.

120
0:06:35.965,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You take these cells, you put them in a dish,

121
0:06:38.292,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and within three days, they look like that.

122
0:06:41.637,000 --> 0:06:44,000
They completely forget.

123
0:06:44.797,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So you take them out, you put them in a dish,

124
0:06:47.597,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they don't make milk. They completely forget.

125
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
For example, here is a lovely yellow droplet of milk

126
0:06:55.159,000 --> 0:06:57,000
on the left, there is nothing on the right.

127
0:06:57.414,000 --> 0:07:,000
Look at the nuclei. The nuclei in the cell on the left

128
0:07:01.143,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is in the animal, the one on the right is in a dish.

129
0:07:04.639,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They are completely different from each other.

130
0:07:07.375,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So, what does this tell you?

131
0:07:09.4,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This tells you that here also, context overrides.

132
0:07:14.367,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In different contexts, cells do different things.

133
0:07:17.752,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But how does context signal?

134
0:07:20.497,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So, Einstein said that

135
0:07:23.039,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"For an idea that does not first seem insane, there is no hope."

136
0:07:29.692,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So, you can imagine the amount of skepticism

137
0:07:35.652,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I received -- couldn't get money,

138
0:07:38.053,000 --> 0:07:39,000
couldn't do a whole lot of other things,

139
0:07:39.996,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but I'm so glad it all worked out.

140
0:07:41.725,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So, we made a section of the mammary gland of the mouse,

141
0:07:45.54,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and all those lovely acini are there,

142
0:07:48.723,000 --> 0:07:52,000
every one of those with the red around them are an acinus,

143
0:07:52.934,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and we said okay, we are going to try and make this,

144
0:07:56.628,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and I said, maybe that red stuff

145
0:07:59.86,000 --> 0:08:04,000
around the acinus that people think there's just a structural scaffold,

146
0:08:04.985,000 --> 0:08:05,000
maybe it has information,

147
0:08:06.925,000 --> 0:08:1,000
maybe it tells the cells what to do, maybe it tells the nucleus what to do.

148
0:08:11.491,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So I said, extracellular matrix, which is this stuff

149
0:08:15.774,000 --> 0:08:19,000
called ECM, signals and actually tells the cells what to do.

150
0:08:20.165,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, we decided to make things that would look like that.

151
0:08:23.932,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We found some gooey material

152
0:08:26.812,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that had the right extracellular matrix in it,

153
0:08:29.687,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we put the cells in it, and lo and behold,

154
0:08:32.226,000 --> 0:08:34,000
in about four days, they got reorganized

155
0:08:35.047,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and on the right, is what we can make in culture.

156
0:08:38.455,000 --> 0:08:42,000
On the left is what's inside the animal, we call it in vivo,

157
0:08:42.951,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the one in culture was full of milk,

158
0:08:45.535,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the lovely red there is full of milk.

159
0:08:48.335,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So, we Got Milk, for the American audience.

160
0:08:51.751,000 --> 0:08:56,000
All right. And here is this beautiful human cell,

161
0:08:57.095,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and you can imagine that here also, context goes.

162
0:09:02.041,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So, what do we do now?

163
0:09:04.757,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I made a radical hypothesis.

164
0:09:06.981,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I said, if it's true that architecture is dominant,

165
0:09:13.644,000 --> 0:09:17,000
architecture restored to a cancer cell

166
0:09:18.13,000 --> 0:09:2,000
should make the cancer cell think it's normal.

167
0:09:21.119,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Could this be done?

168
0:09:22.603,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So, we tried it.

169
0:09:25.131,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In order to do that, however,

170
0:09:27.169,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we needed to have a method of distinguishing normal from malignant,

171
0:09:32.054,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and on the left is the single normal cell,

172
0:09:36.051,000 --> 0:09:39,000
human breast, put in three-dimensional gooey gel

173
0:09:40.014,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that has extracellular matrix, it makes all these beautiful structures.

174
0:09:43.878,000 --> 0:09:45,000
On the right, you see it looks very ugly,

175
0:09:46.766,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the cells continue to grow,

176
0:09:48.414,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the normal ones stop.

177
0:09:49.99,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And you see here in higher magnification

178
0:09:52.822,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the normal acinus and the ugly tumor.

179
0:09:57.174,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So we said, what is on the surface of these ugly tumors?

180
0:10:01.398,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Could we calm them down --

181
0:10:03.566,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they were signaling like crazy and they have pathways all messed up --

182
0:10:08.486,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and make them to the level of the normal?

183
0:10:11.55,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well, it was wonderful. Boggles my mind.

184
0:10:16.27,000 --> 0:10:18,000
This is what we got.

185
0:10:18.431,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We can revert the malignant phenotype.

186
0:10:22.11,000 --> 0:10:24,000
(Applause)

187
0:10:24.678,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And in order to show you that the malignant phenotype

188
0:10:27.79,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I didn't just choose one,

189
0:10:29.508,000 --> 0:10:31,000
here are little movies, sort of fuzzy,

190
0:10:32.278,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but you see that on the left are the malignant cells,

191
0:10:35.934,000 --> 0:10:36,000
all of them are malignant,

192
0:10:37.278,000 --> 0:10:41,000
we add one single inhibitor in the beginning,

193
0:10:42.078,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and look what happens, they all look like that.

194
0:10:45.535,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We inject them into the mouse, the ones on the right,

195
0:10:48.982,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and none of them would make tumors.

196
0:10:51.222,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We inject the other ones in the mouse, 100 percent tumors.

197
0:10:54.758,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So, it's a new way of thinking about cancer,

198
0:10:57.43,000 --> 0:10:59,000
it's a hopeful way of thinking about cancer.

199
0:10:59.83,000 --> 0:11:02,000
We should be able to be dealing with these things at this level,

200
0:11:03.806,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and these conclusions say that growth and malignant behavior

201
0:11:09.718,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is regulated at the level of tissue organization

202
0:11:13.59,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and that the tissue organization is dependent

203
0:11:17.582,000 --> 0:11:2,000
on the extracellular matrix and the microenvironment.

204
0:11:21.278,000 --> 0:11:28,000
All right, thus form and function interact dynamically and reciprocally.

205
0:11:28.909,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And here is another five seconds of repose,

206
0:11:33.029,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is my mantra. Form and function.

207
0:11:37.451,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And of course, we now ask, where do we go now?

208
0:11:41.097,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We'd like to take this kind of thinking into the clinic.

209
0:11:44.092,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But before we do that, I'd like you to think

210
0:11:48.016,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that at any given time when you're sitting there,

211
0:11:51.604,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in your 70 trillion cells,

212
0:11:54.617,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the extracellular matrix signaling to your nucleus,

213
0:11:58.09,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the nucleus is signaling to your extracellular matrix

214
0:12:01.168,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and this is how your balance is kept and restored.

215
0:12:07.162,000 --> 0:12:09,000
We have made a lot of discoveries,

216
0:12:09.377,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we have shown that extracellular matrix talks to chromatin.

217
0:12:12.465,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We have shown that there's little pieces of DNA

218
0:12:15.912,000 --> 0:12:18,000
on the specific genes of the mammary gland

219
0:12:19.735,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that actually respond to extracellular matrix.

220
0:12:22.599,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It has taken many years, but it has been very rewarding.

221
0:12:26.296,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And before I get to the next slide, I have to tell you

222
0:12:30.687,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that there are so many additional discoveries to be made.

223
0:12:35.799,000 --> 0:12:37,000
There is so much mystery we don't know.

224
0:12:38.327,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I always say to the students and post-docs I lecture to,

225
0:12:42.688,000 --> 0:12:47,000
don't be arrogant, because arrogance kills curiosity.

226
0:12:48.351,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Curiosity and passion.

227
0:12:50.543,000 --> 0:12:53,000
You need to always think, what else needs to be discovered?

228
0:12:54.44,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And maybe my discovery needs to be added to

229
0:12:57.415,000 --> 0:12:58,000
or maybe it needs to be changed.

230
0:12:59.207,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So, we have now made an amazing discovery,

231
0:13:02.711,000 --> 0:13:05,000
a post-doc in the lab who is a physicist asked me,

232
0:13:05.815,000 --> 0:13:07,000
what do the cells do when you put them in?

233
0:13:07.992,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What do they do in the beginning when they do?

234
0:13:11.286,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I said, I don't know, we couldn't look at them.

235
0:13:12.767,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We didn't have high images in the old days.

236
0:13:15.36,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So she, being an imager and a physicist,

237
0:13:18.055,000 --> 0:13:19,000
did this incredible thing.

238
0:13:19.799,000 --> 0:13:23,000
This is a single human breast cell in three dimensions.

239
0:13:24.175,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Look at it. It's constantly doing this.

240
0:13:26.703,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Has a coherent movement.

241
0:13:28.799,000 --> 0:13:32,000
You put the cancer cells there, and they do go all over,

242
0:13:33.133,000 --> 0:13:34,000
they do this. They don't do this.

243
0:13:35.037,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And when we revert the cancer cell, it again does this.

244
0:13:39.045,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Absolutely boggles my mind.

245
0:13:41.229,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So the cell acts like an embryo. What an exciting thing.

246
0:13:46.573,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So I'd like to finish with a poem.

247
0:13:49.429,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Well I used to love English literature,

248
0:13:52.493,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and I debated in college, which one should I do?

249
0:13:55.1,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And unfortunately or fortunately, chemistry won.

250
0:13:59.712,000 --> 0:14:04,000
But here is a poem from Yeats. I'll just read you the last two lines.

251
0:14:05.436,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It's called "Among the School Children."

252
0:14:08.095,000 --> 0:14:12,000
"O body swayed to music / O brightening glance /

253
0:14:12.616,000 --> 0:14:15,000
How [can we know] the dancer from the dance?"

254
0:14:15.766,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And here is Merce Cunningham,

255
0:14:17.677,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I was fortunate to dance with him when I was younger,

256
0:14:20.661,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and here he is a dancer,

257
0:14:22.854,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and while he is dancing, he is both the dancer and the dance.

258
0:14:26.158,000 --> 0:14:29,000
The minute he stops, we have neither.

259
0:14:29.859,000 --> 0:14:32,000
So it's like form and function.

260
0:14:33.333,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Now, I'd like to show you a current picture of my group.

261
0:14:39.112,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I have been fortunate to have had these magnificant

262
0:14:42.64,000 --> 0:14:45,000
students and post-docs who have taught me so much,

263
0:14:45.864,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and I have had many of these groups come and go.

264
0:14:49.127,000 --> 0:14:53,000
They are the future and I try to make them not be afraid

265
0:14:53.704,000 --> 0:14:56,000
of being the cat and being told,

266
0:14:57.407,000 --> 0:14:58,000
don't think outside the box.

267
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And I'd like to leave you with this thought.

268
0:15:01.495,000 --> 0:15:05,000
On the left is water coming through the shore,

269
0:15:06.24,000 --> 0:15:07,000
taken from a NASA satellite.

270
0:15:08.135,000 --> 0:15:11,000
On the right, there is a coral.

271
0:15:11.184,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Now if you take the mammary gland and spread it

272
0:15:15.186,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and take the fat away, on a dish it looks like that.

273
0:15:18.631,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Do they look the same? Do they have the same patterns?

274
0:15:21.983,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Why is it that nature keeps doing that over and over again?

275
0:15:25.935,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And I'd like to submit to you

276
0:15:28.295,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that we have sequenced the human genome,

277
0:15:30.472,000 --> 0:15:32,000
we know everything about the sequence of the gene,

278
0:15:33.352,000 --> 0:15:35,000
the language of the gene, the alphabet of the gene,

279
0:15:35.783,000 --> 0:15:38,000
But we know nothing, but nothing,

280
0:15:39.022,000 --> 0:15:43,000
about the language and alphabet of form.

281
0:15:43.685,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So, it's a wonderful new horizon,

282
0:15:46.729,000 --> 0:15:49,000
it's a wonderful thing to discover for the young

283
0:15:50.479,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and the passionate old, and that's me.

284
0:15:52.959,000 --> 0:15:54,000
So go to it!

285
0:15:55.007,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Applause)

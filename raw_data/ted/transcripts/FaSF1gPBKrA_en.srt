1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I cannot believe I'm here.

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I have not slept in weeks.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous --

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
about how we all might join in and do similar things.

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Back in about 2000, I was living in Brooklyn,

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was trying to finish my first book,

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I was wandering around dazed every day

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I would walk around in a daze during the day.

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,

17
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
there are a lot of writers --

18
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it's like a very high per capita ratio

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
of writers to normal people.

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and after college so many of my friends went into teaching.

23
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives

24
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and how inspiring they were,

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and they were really sort of the most hard-working

26
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and constantly inspiring people I knew.

27
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But I knew so many of the things they were up against,

28
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
so many of the struggles they were dealing with.

29
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And one of them was that so many of my friends

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that were teaching in city schools were having trouble

31
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with their students keeping up at grade level,

32
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in their reading and writing in particular.

33
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, so many of these students had come from households

34
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
where English isn't spoken in the home,

35
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
where a lot of them have different special needs,

36
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools

37
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which sometimes and very often are under-funded.

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And so they would talk to me about this and say,

39
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"You know, what we really need is just more people,

40
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
more bodies, more one-on-one attention,

41
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
more hours, more expertise from people

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."

43
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, I would say, "Well, why don't you just work with them one-on-one?"

44
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.

45
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.

46
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
How can we possibly give each student

47
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"

48
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.

49
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And so we started talking about this.

50
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And at the same time,

51
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I thought about this massive group of people I knew:

52
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
writers, editors, journalists, graduate students,

53
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
assistant professors, you name it.

54
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours

55
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and an interest in the English word --

56
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I hope to have an interest in the English language,

57
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)

58
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'm trying. That clock has got me.

59
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word

60
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.

61
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And so they had, you know, their time

62
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and their interest, but at the same time

63
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community

64
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to bring these two communities together.

65
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So when I moved back to San Francisco, we rented this building.

66
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And the idea was to put McSweeney's --

67
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,

68
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and a few other magazines --

69
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we were going to move it into an office for the first time.

70
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.

71
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We were going to move it into an office,

72
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.

73
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody --

74
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway,

75
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
why don't we just open up

76
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the front of the building for students to come in there after school,

77
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
get extra help on their written homework,

78
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
so you have basically no border between these two communities?"

79
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So the idea was that we would be

80
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
working on whatever we're working on,

81
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,

82
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.

83
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You give those hours in the afternoon

84
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to the students in the neighborhood.

85
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So, we had this place, we rented it,

86
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the landlord was all for it. We did this mural,

87
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history

88
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time

89
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road.

90
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So we rented this space.

91
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And everything was great except the landlord said,

92
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.

93
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You've gotta sell something.

94
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
You can't just have a tutoring center."

95
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"

96
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,

97
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but we did all the necessary research.

98
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,

99
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.

100
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We took all that down, and we found beautiful wooden floors,

101
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
whitewashed beams and it had the look --

102
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
while we were renovating this place, somebody said,

103
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."

104
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And we looked around and somebody else said,

105
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter)

106
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And so this is what we did. So it made everybody laugh,

107
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and we said, "There's a point to that.

108
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.

109
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.

110
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,

111
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.

112
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Here you see planks sold by the foot

113
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we have supplies to combat scurvy.

114
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.

115
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display,

116
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
which is the black column there for everyday use

117
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for your eyepatch, and then you have the pastel

118
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and other colors for stepping out at night --

119
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.

120
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So we opened this place. And this is a vat

121
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that we fill with treasures that students dig in.

122
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.

123
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
These are some signs that we have all over the place:

124
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"Practical Joking with Pirates."

125
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter

126
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and eight mop heads drop on your head.

127
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.

128
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,

129
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which is just a saltwater tank with three seats,

130
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and then right behind it we set up this space,

131
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which was the tutoring center.

132
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So right there is the tutoring center,

133
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,

134
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.

135
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The kids would come in --

136
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or we thought they would come in. I should back up.

137
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months

138
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
renovating this place.

139
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.

140
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto

141
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.

142
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.

143
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It was started with about 12 of my friends,

144
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.

145
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk

146
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related

147
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free."

148
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,

149
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
they're gonna love it." And they didn't.

150
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.

151
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
And everybody was becoming very discouraged

152
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because it was weeks and weeks that we waited, really, where nobody came in.

153
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And then somebody alerted us to the fact

154
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that maybe there was a trust gap,

155
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)

156
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We never put it together, you know?

157
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,

158
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
a longtime San Francisco educator --

159
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
she was teaching in Mexico City,

160
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
she had all the experience necessary,

161
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
knew everything about education,

162
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood --

163
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.

164
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
She took over as executive director.

165
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachers

166
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and the parents and the students and everything,

167
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and so suddenly it was actually full every day.

168
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And what we were trying to offer every day

169
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
was one-on-one attention.

170
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.

171
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
You know, it's been proven

172
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that 35 to 40 hours a year with one-on-one attention,

173
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
a student can get one grade level higher.

174
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.

175
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They come there, many times their parents --

176
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you can't see it, but there's a church pew

177
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there --

178
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.

179
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So that was the basis of it,

180
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
was one-on-one attention.

181
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And we found ourselves full every day with kids.

182
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,

183
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,

184
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,

185
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
which is very strange, because it's school, in a way.

186
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But there was something psychological happening there

187
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that was just a little bit different.

188
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And the other thing was, there was no stigma.

189
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,"

190
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.

191
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.

192
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.

193
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
And so our interns were actually working

194
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
at the same tables very often,

195
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.

196
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And so it became a tutoring center --

197
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
publishing center, is what we called it --

198
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and a writing center.

199
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
They go in, and they might be working with a high school student

200
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.

201
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So there's no stigma.

202
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.

203
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.

204
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
These adults, they're working in their field.

205
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults

206
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and it all sort of feeds on each other.

207
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,

208
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
especially for the adults working at McSweeney's

209
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,

210
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)

211
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.

212
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But you know, there's something about the kids finishing their homework

213
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention --

214
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.

215
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
They don't do their homework in front of the TV.

216
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,

217
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.

218
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And that makes a happy family.

219
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.

220
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.

221
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So the key to it all is homework! (Laughter) (Applause)

222
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.

223
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So we started off with about 12 volunteers,

224
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and then we had about 50,

225
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and then a couple hundred.

226
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.

227
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.

228
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,

229
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,

230
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
next to one student, concentrated attention,

231
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
shining this beam of light on their work,

232
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
on their thoughts and their self-expression,

233
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is going to be absolutely transformative,

234
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because so many of the students have not had that ever before.

235
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,

236
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."

237
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.

238
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Then we said, "Well, what are we

239
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
going to do with the space during the day,

240
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"

241
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So we started bringing in classes during the day.

242
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So every day, there's a field trip where they together create a book --

243
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
you can see it being typed up above.

244
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.

245
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You just point a camera at a class,

246
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and it always looks like this.

247
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So this is one of the books that they do.

248
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Notice the title of the book,

249
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
"The Book That Was Never Checked Out: Titanic."

250
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy

251
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that was about the Titanic."

252
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,

253
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.

254
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So then we still had more tutors to use.

255
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.

256
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
The teachers that we work with --

257
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.

258
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We went in there thinking,

259
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.

260
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
The neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.

261
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The teachers are going to tell us how we're most useful."

262
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So then they said, "Why don't you come into the schools?

263
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you,

264
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,

265
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,

266
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.

267
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say,

268
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.

269
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We're working on our college essays. Send them in."

270
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.

271
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.

272
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The teacher tells them what to do,

273
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.

274
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They work under the teacher's guide,

275
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and it's all in one big room.

276
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And that's actually the brunt of what we do is,

277
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
people going straight from their workplace, straight from home,

278
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
straight into the classroom and

279
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
working directly with the students.

280
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.

281
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Then another school said, "Well, what if we

282
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"

283
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So this is the Everett Middle School Writers' Room,

284
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
where we decorated it in buccaneer style.

285
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It's right off the library. And there we serve

286
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
all 529 kids in this middle school.

287
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,"

288
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom

289
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
in both languages -- English and Spanish.

290
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,

291
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?

292
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."

293
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,

294
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
which is a school that we had worked with on some other things,

295
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and we gave that assignment to the students.

296
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.

297
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
She's going to publish them in a book.

298
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.

299
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area

300
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."

301
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So these kids worked harder

302
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
than they've ever worked on anything in their lives,

303
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
because there was that outside audience,

304
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
there was Isabel Allende on the other end.

305
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them

306
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and so this worked out incredibly well.

307
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We had a big party at the end.

308
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.

309
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,

310
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
"I Might Get Somewhere."

311
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.

312
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Now we're sort of addicted to the book thing.

313
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life

314
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
if they know it's going to be permanent,

315
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
know it's going to be on a shelf,

316
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
know that nobody can diminish what they've thought and said,

317
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that we've honored their words, honored their thoughts

318
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
with hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts --

319
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
all this attention that we give to their thoughts.

320
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,

321
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
they can never go back.

322
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
It's absolutely transformative.

323
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.

324
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We sell all the student books.

325
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Where else would you put them, right?

326
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening

327
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
with the stores. The store, actually --

328
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.

329
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So it was paying the rent.

330
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing --

331
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I don't know, I don't want to judge.

332
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
But people would come in --

333
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and this was before the pirate movies and everything!

334
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,

335
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.

336
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.

337
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And it became a gateway to the community.

338
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
People would come in and say, "What the --?

339
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter)

340
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Is that a rule? I don't know.

341
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
They would say, "What is this?"

342
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And people would come in and learn more about it.

343
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there --

344
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.

345
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
This is a field trip going on. And so they would be shopping,

346
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and they might be more likely to buy some lard,

347
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,

348
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.

349
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
So the store actually did really well.

350
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
But it brought in so many people --

351
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody --

352
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
because it was street level. It was open to the public.

353
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor

354
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood

355
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.

356
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.

357
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So all the people I used to know in Brooklyn, they said,

358
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"

359
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And a lot of them had been former educators

360
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
or would-be educators, so they combined

361
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
with a lot of local designers, local writers,

362
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and they just took the idea independently

363
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and they did their own thing.

364
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.

365
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
They didn't think that that was going to work there.

366
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,

367
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.

368
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.

369
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those

370
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
keysmith's shops that has to have every service

371
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
they've ever offered, you know, all over there.

372
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco

373
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.

374
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
These are all handmade.

375
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.

376
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.

377
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
So then you have the villain containment unit,

378
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
where kids put their parents. You have the office.

379
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there,

380
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
it goes up an electric lift

381
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
and then the guy behind the counter tells you

382
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
that you have to recite the vow of heroism,

383
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.

384
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Personally, I think it's a problem.

385
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.

386
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
These are some of the products. These are all handmade.

387
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
This is a secret identity kit.

388
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,

389
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
one American female marketing executive

390
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier

391
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.

392
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,

393
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:47,000
and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps

394
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and then we turn on three hydraulic fans

395
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
from every side and then you can see the cape in action.

396
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
There's nothing worse than, you know,

397
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.

398
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
So then, the secret door --

399
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
this is one of the shelves you don't see

400
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
when you walk in, but it slowly opens.

401
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.

402
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)

403
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
So you can see the full effect!

404
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
But this is -- I just want to emphasize --

405
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
locally funded, locally built.

406
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
All the designers, all of the builders,

407
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.

408
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,"

409
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
or whatever. That was it. You can see the time

410
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
in all five boroughs of New York in the back. (Laughter) (Applause)

411
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
So this is the space during tutoring hours.

412
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:43,000
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,

413
0:19:43.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
complete devotion to the students' work

414
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility

415
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
of creativity and ideas.

416
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
And this switch is flicked in their heads

417
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?

418
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
So it's school, but it's not school.

419
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
It's clearly not school, even though

420
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
they're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.

421
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
This is one of the students, Khaled Hamdan.

422
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
You can read this quote.

423
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.

424
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:1,000
Came in. Got this concentrated attention.

425
0:20:10.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
And he couldn't escape it.

426
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early --

427
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
got really addicted to finishing his homework early.

428
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
It's an addictive thing to sort of be done with it,

429
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve

430
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.

431
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.

432
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
He's now been published in five books.

433
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:31,000
He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes

434
0:20:31.16,000 --> 0:20:35,000
called "Super-Has-Beens."

435
0:20:35.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
He wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,"

436
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
which is a fighting -- a boxing -- penguin.

437
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,

438
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:49,000
at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.

439
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:52,000
He's evangelical about it. He brings his cousins in now.

440
0:20:52.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
There's four family members that come in every day.

441
0:20:55.16,000 --> 0:20:57,000
So, I'll go through really quickly.

442
0:20:57.16,000 --> 0:21:,000
This is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:

443
0:21:00.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter)

444
0:21:05.16,000 --> 0:21:08,000
This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.

445
0:21:08.16,000 --> 0:21:11,000
So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.

446
0:21:11.16,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:

447
0:21:16.16,000 --> 0:21:19,000
"Out of Order. Come Back Yesterday." (Laughter) (Applause)

448
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:29,000
Anyway. So I'm going to jump ahead.

449
0:21:29.16,000 --> 0:21:32,000
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us,

450
0:21:32.16,000 --> 0:21:35,000
doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;

451
0:21:35.16,000 --> 0:21:37,000
Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,

452
0:21:37.16,000 --> 0:21:4,000
which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;

453
0:21:40.16,000 --> 0:21:43,000
Austin Bat Cave in Austin;

454
0:21:43.16,000 --> 0:21:46,000
Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,

455
0:21:46.16,000 --> 0:21:48,000
this will be open in April.

456
0:21:48.16,000 --> 0:21:52,000
Now I'm going to the TED Wish -- is that okay?

457
0:21:52.16,000 --> 0:21:55,000
All right, I've got a minute. So, the TED Wish:

458
0:21:55.16,000 --> 0:21:58,000
I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual

459
0:21:58.16,000 --> 0:22:,000
and organization you know -- will find a way

460
0:22:00.16,000 --> 0:22:03,000
to directly engage with a public school in your area

461
0:22:03.16,000 --> 0:22:06,000
and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,

462
0:22:06.16,000 --> 0:22:08,000
so that within a year we have a thousand examples --

463
0:22:08.16,000 --> 0:22:1,000
a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships.

464
0:22:10.16,000 --> 0:22:12,000
Profound leaps forward!

465
0:22:12.16,000 --> 0:22:14,000
And these can be things that maybe you're already doing.

466
0:22:14.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
I know that so many people in this room

467
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:18,000
are already doing really interesting things.

468
0:22:18.16,000 --> 0:22:22,000
I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.

469
0:22:22.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
We created a website.

470
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
I'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:

471
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:3,000
We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in

472
0:22:30.16,000 --> 0:22:32,000
a new era of participation in our public schools.

473
0:22:32.16,000 --> 0:22:34,000
We hope that you will take the lead

474
0:22:34.16,000 --> 0:22:36,000
in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise

475
0:22:36.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
with that of innovative educators in your community.

476
0:22:39.16,000 --> 0:22:41,000
Always let the teachers lead the way.

477
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:45,000
They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.

478
0:22:45.16,000 --> 0:22:47,000
There are a million ways.

479
0:22:47.16,000 --> 0:22:48,000
You can walk up to your local school

480
0:22:48.16,000 --> 0:22:51,000
and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.

481
0:22:51.16,000 --> 0:22:54,000
So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,

482
0:22:54.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
they did this phenomenal job.

483
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:22:58,000
This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,

484
0:22:58.16,000 --> 0:23:01,000
a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,"

485
0:23:01.16,000 --> 0:23:02,000
which is a great title, I think.

486
0:23:02.16,000 --> 0:23:04,000
This site will document every story, every project that comes

487
0:23:04.16,000 --> 0:23:08,000
out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,

488
0:23:08.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by

489
0:23:10.16,000 --> 0:23:12,000
and then you add your own projects once you get started.

490
0:23:13.16,000 --> 0:23:17,000
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.

491
0:23:17.16,000 --> 0:23:2,000
If you have any questions, you can ask this guy,

492
0:23:20.16,000 --> 0:23:23,000
who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.

493
0:23:23.16,000 --> 0:23:25,000
You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.

494
0:23:25.16,000 --> 0:23:28,000
And he'll get you inspired and get you going

495
0:23:28.16,000 --> 0:23:31,000
and guide you through the process so that you can affect change.

496
0:23:31.16,000 --> 0:23:33,000
And it can be fun! That's the point of this talk --

497
0:23:33.16,000 --> 0:23:4,000
it needn't be sterile. It needn't be bureaucratically untenable.

498
0:23:40.16,000 --> 0:23:44,000
You can do and use the skills that you have.

499
0:23:44.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
The schools need you. The teachers need you.

500
0:23:46.16,000 --> 0:23:49,000
Students and parents need you. They need your actual person:

501
0:23:49.16,000 --> 0:23:51,000
your physical personhood and your open minds

502
0:23:51.16,000 --> 0:23:54,000
and open ears and boundless compassion,

503
0:23:54.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
sitting next to them, listening and nodding

504
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:23:59,000
and asking questions for hours at a time.

505
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:03,000
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:

506
0:24:03.16,000 --> 0:24:06,000
how smart and how much they have to say.

507
0:24:06.16,000 --> 0:24:09,000
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them,

508
0:24:09.16,000 --> 0:24:13,000
one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.

509
0:24:13.16,000 --> 0:24:15,000
Thank you so much.

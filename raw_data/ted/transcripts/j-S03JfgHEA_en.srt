1
0:00:12.117,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So this is Anna Hazare,

2
0:00:15.769,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and Anna Hazare may well be the most cutting-edge

3
0:00:19.677,000 --> 0:00:22,000
digital activist in the world today.

4
0:00:22.914,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And you wouldn't know it by looking at him.

5
0:00:24.452,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Hazare is a 77-year-old Indian anticorruption and social justice activist.

6
0:00:30.099,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And in 2011, he was running a big campaign

7
0:00:33.69,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to address everyday corruption in India,

8
0:00:36.65,000 --> 0:00:38,000
a topic that Indian elites love to ignore.

9
0:00:39.521,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So as part of this campaign,

10
0:00:41.103,000 --> 0:00:42,000
he was using all of the traditional tactics

11
0:00:43.025,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that a good Gandhian organizer would use.

12
0:00:45.241,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So he was on a hunger strike,

13
0:00:47.297,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and Hazare realized through his hunger

14
0:00:49.822,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that actually maybe this time,

15
0:00:51.599,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in the 21st century,

16
0:00:53.345,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a hunger strike wouldn't be enough.

17
0:00:54.834,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So he started playing around with mobile activism.

18
0:00:59.126,000 --> 0:01:,000
So the first thing he did is he said to people,

19
0:01:01.013,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"Okay, why don't you send me

20
0:01:03.084,000 --> 0:01:04,000
a text message if you support

21
0:01:04.845,000 --> 0:01:05,000
my campaign against corruption?"

22
0:01:06.585,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So he does this, he gives people a short code,

23
0:01:08.854,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and about 80,000 people do it.

24
0:01:11.47,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Okay, that's pretty respectable.

25
0:01:13.438,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But then he decides,

26
0:01:14.375,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"Let me tweak my tactics a little bit."

27
0:01:16.495,000 --> 0:01:2,000
He says, "Why don't you leave me a missed call?"

28
0:01:20.97,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now, for those of you who have lived in the global South,

29
0:01:24.039,000 --> 0:01:25,000
you'll know that missed calls

30
0:01:25.531,000 --> 0:01:28,000
are a really critical part of global mobile culture.

31
0:01:29.374,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I see people nodding.

32
0:01:30.488,000 --> 0:01:32,000
People leave missed calls all the time:

33
0:01:32.596,000 --> 0:01:33,000
If you're running late for a meeting

34
0:01:34.542,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and you just want to let them know that you're on the way,

35
0:01:36.848,000 --> 0:01:37,000
you leave them a missed call.

36
0:01:38.571,000 --> 0:01:39,000
If you're dating someone and you just want to say "I miss you"

37
0:01:40.497,000 --> 0:01:41,000
you leave them a missed call.

38
0:01:41.883,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So a note for a dating tip here,

39
0:01:44.427,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in some cultures,

40
0:01:45.552,000 --> 0:01:46,000
if you want to please your lover,

41
0:01:46.834,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you call them and hang up. (Laughter)

42
0:01:51.335,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So why do people leave missed calls?

43
0:01:54.69,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Well, the reason of course is that

44
0:01:56.14,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they're trying to avoid charges

45
0:01:58.898,000 --> 0:02:01,000
associated with making calls and sending texts.

46
0:02:02.264,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So when Hazare asked people to leave him a missed call,

47
0:02:06.32,000 --> 0:02:11,000
let's have a little guess how many people actually did this?

48
0:02:11.997,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Thirty-five million.

49
0:02:15.415,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So this is one of the largest coordinated actions in human history.

50
0:02:19.458,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's remarkable.

51
0:02:21.212,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And this reflects the extraordinary strength of the emerging Indian middle class

52
0:02:25.712,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the power that their mobile phones bring.

53
0:02:28.684,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But he used that,

54
0:02:30.269,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Hazare ended up with this massive CSV file of mobile phone numbers,

55
0:02:34.488,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and he used that to deploy

56
0:02:36.273,000 --> 0:02:37,000
real people power on the ground

57
0:02:38.269,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to get hundreds of thousands of people out on the streets in Delhi

58
0:02:41.683,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to make a national point of everyday corruption in India.

59
0:02:46.033,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's a really striking story.

60
0:02:48.47,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So this is me when I was 12 years old.

61
0:02:50.68,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I hope you see the resemblance.

62
0:02:52.392,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I was also an activist,

63
0:02:54.317,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and I have been an activist all my life.

64
0:02:56.557,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I had this really funny childhood

65
0:02:57.887,000 --> 0:02:59,000
where I traipsed around the world

66
0:02:59.91,000 --> 0:03:01,000
meeting world leaders and Noble prize winners,

67
0:03:02.704,000 --> 0:03:04,000
talking about Third World debt,

68
0:03:04.99,000 --> 0:03:05,000
as it was then called,

69
0:03:06.279,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and demilitarization.

70
0:03:07.813,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I was a very, very serious child. (Laughter)

71
0:03:12.045,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And back then,

72
0:03:13.95,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in the early '90s,

73
0:03:15.384,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I had a very cutting-edge tech tool of my own:

74
0:03:19.214,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the fax.

75
0:03:21.466,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And the fax was the tool of my activism.

76
0:03:23.644,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And at that time, it was the best way

77
0:03:25.202,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to get a message to a lot of people

78
0:03:27.097,000 --> 0:03:29,000
all at once.

79
0:03:29.535,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I'll give you one example of a fax campaign that I ran.

80
0:03:31.981,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It was the eve of the Gulf War

81
0:03:34.077,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and I organized a global campaign to flood the hotel,

82
0:03:37.628,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the Intercontinental in Geneva,

83
0:03:39.109,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where James Baker and Tariq Aziz

84
0:03:40.664,000 --> 0:03:41,000
were meeting on the eve of the war,

85
0:03:42.588,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and I thought if I could flood them with faxes,

86
0:03:44.972,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we'll stop the war.

87
0:03:46.05,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Well, unsurprisingly,

88
0:03:48.243,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that campaign was wholly unsuccessful.

89
0:03:51.834,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There are lots of reasons for that,

90
0:03:53.488,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but there's no doubt that one sputtering fax machine

91
0:03:55.973,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in Geneva was a little bit of a bandwidth constraint

92
0:03:59.3,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in terms of the ability to get a message to lots of people.

93
0:04:02.142,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so, I went on to discover some better tools.

94
0:04:06.172,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I cofounded Avaaz, which uses the Internet to mobilize people

95
0:04:08.814,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and now has almost 40 million members,

96
0:04:11.412,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I now run Purpose, which is a home for these kinds of

97
0:04:13.972,000 --> 0:04:15,000
technology-powered movements.

98
0:04:16.268,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So what's the moral of this story?

99
0:04:18.088,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Is the moral of this story,

100
0:04:19.596,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you know what, the fax is kind of eclipsed by the mobile phone?

101
0:04:24.705,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is another story of tech-determinism?

102
0:04:26.935,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Well, I would argue that there's actually more to it than that.

103
0:04:30.125,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I'd argue that in the last 20 years,

104
0:04:32.798,000 --> 0:04:34,000
something more fundamental has changed

105
0:04:35.036,000 --> 0:04:36,000
than just new tech.

106
0:04:36.741,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I would argue that there has been a fundamental shift

107
0:04:39.561,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in the balance of power

108
0:04:41.709,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in the world.

109
0:04:43.228,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You ask any activist how to understand the world,

110
0:04:45.145,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they'll say, "Look at where the power is,

111
0:04:47.619,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who has it, how it's shifting."

112
0:04:50.077,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I think we all sense that something big is happening.

113
0:04:53.079,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So Henry Timms and I —

114
0:04:55.523,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Henry's a fellow movement builder —

115
0:04:57.371,000 --> 0:04:58,000
got talking one day and we started to think,

116
0:04:59.273,000 --> 0:05:01,000
how can we make sense of this new world?

117
0:05:01.274,000 --> 0:05:02,000
How can we describe it and give

118
0:05:02.463,000 --> 0:05:04,000
it a framework that makes it more useful?

119
0:05:04.906,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Because we realized that many

120
0:05:06.136,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of the lessons that we were discovering in movements

121
0:05:08.95,000 --> 0:05:1,000
actually applied all over the world

122
0:05:11.657,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in many sectors of our society.

123
0:05:13.779,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So I want to introduce you to this framework:

124
0:05:15.656,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Old power, meet new power.

125
0:05:17.876,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And I want to talk to you about what new power is today.

126
0:05:21.307,000 --> 0:05:22,000
New power is the deployment

127
0:05:23.271,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of mass participation and peer coordination —

128
0:05:26.46,000 --> 0:05:27,000
these are the two key elements —

129
0:05:28.102,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to create change and shift outcomes.

130
0:05:30.599,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And we see new power all around us.

131
0:05:33.687,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This is Beppe Grillo

132
0:05:34.971,000 --> 0:05:36,000
he was a populist Italian blogger

133
0:05:37.116,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who, with a minimal political apparatus and only some online tools,

134
0:05:40.536,000 --> 0:05:42,000
won more than 25 percent of the vote

135
0:05:43.034,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in recent Italian elections.

136
0:05:45.455,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is Airbnb,

137
0:05:46.817,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which in just a few years

138
0:05:48.566,000 --> 0:05:5,000
has radically disrupted the hotel industry

139
0:05:50.728,000 --> 0:05:52,000
without owning a single square foot of real estate.

140
0:05:53.646,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is Kickstarter,

141
0:05:55.001,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which we know has raised over a billion dollars

142
0:05:57.898,000 --> 0:05:59,000
from more than five million people.

143
0:06:00.319,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now, we're familiar with all of these models.

144
0:06:02.249,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But what's striking is the commonalities,

145
0:06:05.45,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the structural features of these new models

146
0:06:07.576,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and how they differ from old power.

147
0:06:09.725,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Let's look a little bit at this.

148
0:06:11.394,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Old power is held like a currency.

149
0:06:14.552,000 --> 0:06:15,000
New power works like a current.

150
0:06:16.531,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Old power is held by a few.

151
0:06:19.033,000 --> 0:06:22,000
New power isn't held by a few, it's made by many.

152
0:06:22.473,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Old power is all about download,

153
0:06:24.98,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and new power uploads.

154
0:06:26.706,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And you see a whole set of characteristics that you can trace,

155
0:06:29.24,000 --> 0:06:32,000
whether it's in media or politics or education.

156
0:06:32.356,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So we've talked a little bit about what new power is.

157
0:06:34.422,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Let's, for a second, talk about what new power isn't.

158
0:06:37.587,000 --> 0:06:4,000
New power is not your Facebook page.

159
0:06:41.383,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I assure you that having a social media strategy

160
0:06:44.208,000 --> 0:06:46,000
can enable you to do just as much download

161
0:06:46.756,000 --> 0:06:48,000
as you used to do when you had the radio.

162
0:06:49.618,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Just ask Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,

163
0:06:53.146,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I assure you that his Facebook page

164
0:06:54.888,000 --> 0:06:58,000
has not embraced the power of participation.

165
0:06:59.015,000 --> 0:07:02,000
New power is not inherently positive.

166
0:07:02.413,000 --> 0:07:04,000
In fact, this isn't an normative argument that we're making,

167
0:07:04.702,000 --> 0:07:05,000
there are many good things about new power,

168
0:07:06.514,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but it can produce bad outcomes.

169
0:07:08.331,000 --> 0:07:1,000
More participation, more peer coordination,

170
0:07:10.336,000 --> 0:07:11,000
sometimes distorts outcomes

171
0:07:12.123,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and there are some things,

172
0:07:13.198,000 --> 0:07:15,000
like things, for example, in the medical profession

173
0:07:15.297,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that we want new power to get nowhere near.

174
0:07:18.293,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And thirdly, new power is not the inevitable victor.

175
0:07:21.296,000 --> 0:07:22,000
In fact, unsurprisingly,

176
0:07:22.875,000 --> 0:07:24,000
as many of these new power models get to scale,

177
0:07:25.864,000 --> 0:07:27,000
what you see is this massive pushback

178
0:07:28.334,000 --> 0:07:29,000
from the forces of old power.

179
0:07:30.083,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Just look at this really interesting epic struggle

180
0:07:32.292,000 --> 0:07:36,000
going on right now between Edward Snowden and the NSA.

181
0:07:36.675,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You'll note that only one of the two people on this slide

182
0:07:39.059,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is currently in exile.

183
0:07:41.238,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And so, it's not at all clear

184
0:07:42.653,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that new power will be the inevitable victor.

185
0:07:44.743,000 --> 0:07:46,000
That said, keep one thing in mind:

186
0:07:47.686,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We're at the beginning of a very steep curve.

187
0:07:50.575,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So you think about some of these new power models, right?

188
0:07:52.216,000 --> 0:07:54,000
These were just like someone's

189
0:07:54.328,000 --> 0:07:56,000
garage idea a few years ago,

190
0:07:56.874,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and now they're disrupting entire industries.

191
0:08:00.01,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And so, what's interesting about new power,

192
0:08:02.679,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is the way it feeds on itself.

193
0:08:04.695,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Once you have an experience of new power,

194
0:08:06.719,000 --> 0:08:08,000
you tend to expect and want more of it.

195
0:08:08.909,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So let's say you've used a peer-to-peer lending platform

196
0:08:11.789,000 --> 0:08:13,000
like Lending Tree or Prosper,

197
0:08:14.323,000 --> 0:08:16,000
then you've figured out that you don't need the bank,

198
0:08:16.607,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and who wants the bank, right?

199
0:08:18.544,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And so, that experience tends to embolden you

200
0:08:20.982,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it tends to make you want more participation

201
0:08:23.919,000 --> 0:08:25,000
across more aspects of your life.

202
0:08:26.264,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And what this gives rise to is

203
0:08:27.809,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a set of values.

204
0:08:29.38,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We talked about the models

205
0:08:30.69,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that new power has engendered —

206
0:08:32.284,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the Airbnbs, the Kickstarters.

207
0:08:34.116,000 --> 0:08:35,000
What about the values?

208
0:08:35.645,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And this is an early sketch

209
0:08:37.315,000 --> 0:08:39,000
at what new power values look like.

210
0:08:39.878,000 --> 0:08:42,000
New power values prize transparency above all else.

211
0:08:43.009,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's almost a religious belief in transparency,

212
0:08:45.231,000 --> 0:08:47,000
a belief that if you shine a light on something,

213
0:08:47.495,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it will be better.

214
0:08:48.926,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And remember that in the 20th century, this was not at all true.

215
0:08:51.676,000 --> 0:08:53,000
People thought that gentlemen should sit behind closed doors

216
0:08:54.643,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and make comfortable agreements.

217
0:08:56.925,000 --> 0:08:59,000
New power values of informal, networked governance.

218
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
New power folks would never have invented the U.N. today,

219
0:09:02.974,000 --> 0:09:03,000
for better or worse.

220
0:09:04.807,000 --> 0:09:05,000
New power values participation,

221
0:09:06.522,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and new power is all about do-it-yourself.

222
0:09:09.317,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In fact, what's interesting about new power

223
0:09:10.806,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is that it eschews some of the professionalization

224
0:09:14.519,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and specialization that was

225
0:09:15.994,000 --> 0:09:17,000
all the rage in the 20th century.

226
0:09:18.384,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So what's interesting about these

227
0:09:20.194,000 --> 0:09:21,000
new power values and these new power models

228
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is what they mean for organizations.

229
0:09:24.455,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So we've spent a bit of time thinking,

230
0:09:26.963,000 --> 0:09:28,000
how can we plot organizations

231
0:09:29.229,000 --> 0:09:31,000
on a two-by-two where, essentially,

232
0:09:31.493,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we look at new power values

233
0:09:33.549,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and new power models

234
0:09:34.813,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and see where different people sit?

235
0:09:36.614,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We started with a U.S. analysis,

236
0:09:38.503,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and let me show you some interesting findings.

237
0:09:40.879,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So the first is Apple.

238
0:09:42.858,000 --> 0:09:44,000
In this framework, we actually described Apple

239
0:09:45.393,000 --> 0:09:47,000
as an old power company.

240
0:09:47.515,000 --> 0:09:48,000
That's because the ideology,

241
0:09:49.169,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the governing ideology of Apple

242
0:09:51.457,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is the ideology of the perfectionist

243
0:09:54.331,000 --> 0:09:56,000
product designer in Cupertino.

244
0:09:56.355,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's absolutely about that beautiful, perfect thing descending upon us

245
0:10:00.427,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in perfection.

246
0:10:01.778,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And it does not value, as a company, transparency.

247
0:10:04.401,000 --> 0:10:05,000
In fact, it's very secretive.

248
0:10:06.064,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, Apple is one of the most succesful companies in the world.

249
0:10:08.89,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So this shows that you can

250
0:10:10.262,000 --> 0:10:12,000
still pursue a successful old power strategy.

251
0:10:12.951,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But one can argue that there's real vulnerabilites in that model.

252
0:10:15.921,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I think another interesting comparison

253
0:10:17.945,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is that of the Obama campaign

254
0:10:20.122,000 --> 0:10:23,000
versus the Obama presidency.

255
0:10:23.238,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Applause)

256
0:10:30.7,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now, I like President Obama,

257
0:10:32.447,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but he ran with new power at his back, right?

258
0:10:36.403,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And he said to people,

259
0:10:38.23,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we are the ones we've been waiting for.

260
0:10:40.203,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And he used crowdfunding

261
0:10:41.654,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to power a campaign.

262
0:10:42.865,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But when he got into office,

263
0:10:44.266,000 --> 0:10:47,000
he governed like more or less all the other presidents did.

264
0:10:47.458,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And this is a really interesting trend,

265
0:10:49.822,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is when new power gets powerful,

266
0:10:51.82,000 --> 0:10:52,000
what happens?

267
0:10:53.391,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So this is a framework you should look at

268
0:10:55.155,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and think about where your own organization

269
0:10:56.647,000 --> 0:10:56,000
sits on it.

270
0:10:57.611,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And think about where it should be

271
0:10:59.184,000 --> 0:11:,000
in five or 10 years.

272
0:11:00.732,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So what do you do if you're old power?

273
0:11:03.197,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Well, if you're there thinking, in old power,

274
0:11:06.162,000 --> 0:11:07,000
this won't happen to us.

275
0:11:08.062,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Then just look at the Wikipedia entry for Encyclopædia Britannica.

276
0:11:13.229,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Let me tell you, it's a very sad read.

277
0:11:15.625,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But if you are old power,

278
0:11:17.044,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the most important thing you can do is to occupy yourself

279
0:11:20.837,000 --> 0:11:22,000
before others occupy you,

280
0:11:23.491,000 --> 0:11:24,000
before you are occupied.

281
0:11:24.819,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Imagine that a group of your biggest skeptics

282
0:11:27.592,000 --> 0:11:29,000
are camped in the heart of your organization

283
0:11:29.944,000 --> 0:11:3,000
asking the toughest questions

284
0:11:31.823,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and they can see everything inside of your organization.

285
0:11:34.751,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And ask them, would they like what they see

286
0:11:37.501,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and should our model change?

287
0:11:39.776,000 --> 0:11:4,000
What about if you're new power?

288
0:11:41.639,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Is new power kind of just riding the wave to glory?

289
0:11:44.273,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I would argue no.

290
0:11:45.753,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I would argue that there are some very real challenges

291
0:11:47.709,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to new power in this nascent phase.

292
0:11:49.401,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Let's stick with the Occupy Wall Street example for a moment.

293
0:11:52.903,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Occupy was this incredible example of new power,

294
0:11:55.893,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the purest example of new power.

295
0:11:57.736,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And yet, it failed to consolidate.

296
0:12:00.267,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So the energy that it created

297
0:12:02.164,000 --> 0:12:03,000
was great for the meme phase,

298
0:12:03.605,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but they were so committed to participation,

299
0:12:06.406,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that they never got anything done.

300
0:12:08.04,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And in fact that model

301
0:12:09.831,000 --> 0:12:11,000
means that the challenge for new power is:

302
0:12:12.623,000 --> 0:12:14,000
how do you use institutional power

303
0:12:15.162,000 --> 0:12:17,000
without being institutionalized?

304
0:12:17.233,000 --> 0:12:19,000
One the other end of the spectra is Uber.

305
0:12:19.866,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Uber is an amazing,

306
0:12:21.25,000 --> 0:12:23,000
highly scalable new power model.

307
0:12:23.303,000 --> 0:12:25,000
That network is getting denser and denser

308
0:12:25.329,000 --> 0:12:26,000
by the day.

309
0:12:26.589,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But what's really interesting about Uber is

310
0:12:28.748,000 --> 0:12:31,000
it hasn't really adopted new power values.

311
0:12:32.489,000 --> 0:12:36,000
This is a real quote from the Uber CEO recently:

312
0:12:36.561,000 --> 0:12:4,000
He says, "Once we get rid of the dude in the car" — he means drivers —

313
0:12:41.009,000 --> 0:12:44,000
"Uber will be cheaper."

314
0:12:44.901,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Now, new power models live and die

315
0:12:47.876,000 --> 0:12:49,000
by the strength of their networks.

316
0:12:50.058,000 --> 0:12:51,000
By whether the drivers and the consumers

317
0:12:51.991,000 --> 0:12:53,000
who use the service actually believe in it.

318
0:12:54.332,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Because they're not an exercise of top-down perfectionism,

319
0:12:57.833,000 --> 0:12:58,000
they are about the network.

320
0:12:59.781,000 --> 0:13:,000
And so, the challenge,

321
0:13:01.477,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and this is why it's in no way surprising,

322
0:13:03.727,000 --> 0:13:07,000
is that Uber's drivers are now unionizing.

323
0:13:07.983,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It's extraordinary.

324
0:13:09.583,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Uber's drivers are turning on Uber.

325
0:13:11.872,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And the challenge for Uber —

326
0:13:13.166,000 --> 0:13:14,000
this isn't an easy situation for them —

327
0:13:15.093,000 --> 0:13:18,000
is that they are locked into a broader superstrcuture

328
0:13:18.389,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that is really old power.

329
0:13:20.074,000 --> 0:13:23,000
They've raised more than a billion dollars in the capital markets.

330
0:13:23.082,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Those markets expect a financial return,

331
0:13:25.61,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and they way you get a financial return

332
0:13:27.527,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is by squeezing and squeezing

333
0:13:29.924,000 --> 0:13:31,000
your users and your drivers

334
0:13:32.169,000 --> 0:13:33,000
for more and more value

335
0:13:33.464,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and giving that value to your investors.

336
0:13:35.931,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So the big question about the future of new power, in my view, is:

337
0:13:39.534,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Will that old power just emerge?

338
0:13:42.093,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So will new power elites just become

339
0:13:43.876,000 --> 0:13:44,000
old power and squeeze?

340
0:13:45.765,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Or will that new power base bite back?

341
0:13:48.378,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Will the next big Uber

342
0:13:50.139,000 --> 0:13:52,000
be co-owned by Uber drivers?

343
0:13:52.519,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And I think this going to be a very interesting

344
0:13:55.302,000 --> 0:13:56,000
structural question.

345
0:13:57.204,000 --> 0:14:,000
Finally, think about new power

346
0:14:00.486,000 --> 0:14:02,000
being more than just an

347
0:14:02.853,000 --> 0:14:03,000
entity that scales things

348
0:14:04.489,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that make us have slightly better consumer experiences.

349
0:14:08.205,000 --> 0:14:1,000
My call to action for new power

350
0:14:10.371,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is to not be an island.

351
0:14:12.779,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We have major structural problems in the world today

352
0:14:15.935,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that could benefit enormously

353
0:14:18.191,000 --> 0:14:2,000
from the kinds of mass participation

354
0:14:20.505,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and peer coordination

355
0:14:21.842,000 --> 0:14:22,000
that these new power players

356
0:14:23.57,000 --> 0:14:25,000
know so well how to generate.

357
0:14:25.966,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And we badly need them to turn their energies and their power

358
0:14:29.479,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to big, what economists might call

359
0:14:32.703,000 --> 0:14:33,000
public goods problems,

360
0:14:34.276,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that are often beyond markets

361
0:14:36.322,000 --> 0:14:38,000
where investors can easily be found.

362
0:14:38.332,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And I think if we can do that,

363
0:14:40.222,000 --> 0:14:42,000
we might be able to fundamentally change

364
0:14:43.207,000 --> 0:14:46,000
not only human beings' sense of their own agency and power —

365
0:14:46.738,000 --> 0:14:48,000
because I think that's the most wonderful thing about new power,

366
0:14:49.596,000 --> 0:14:51,000
is that people feel more powerful —

367
0:14:52.348,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but we might also be able to change

368
0:14:54.129,000 --> 0:14:55,000
the way we relate to each other

369
0:14:55.892,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and the way we relate to authority and institutions.

370
0:14:59.003,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And to me, that's absolutely

371
0:15:01.051,000 --> 0:15:02,000
worth trying for.

372
0:15:02.622,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Thank you very much.

373
0:15:03.718,000 --> 0:15:05,000

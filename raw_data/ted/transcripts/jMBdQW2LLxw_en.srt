1
0:00:12.491,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Adam Ockelford: I promise there won't be too much

2
0:00:13.836,000 --> 0:00:15,000
of me talking, and a lot of Derek playing,

3
0:00:16.248,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I thought it would just be nice to recap

4
0:00:18.692,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on how Derek got to where he is today.

5
0:00:22.628,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's amazing now, because he's so much bigger than me,

6
0:00:25.119,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but when Derek was born,

7
0:00:26.737,000 --> 0:00:28,000
he could have fitted on the palm of your hand.

8
0:00:29.376,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He was born three and a half months premature,

9
0:00:32.34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and really it was a fantastic fight for him to survive.

10
0:00:37.556,000 --> 0:00:38,000
He had to have a lot of oxygen,

11
0:00:38.776,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and that affected your eyes, Derek,

12
0:00:40.776,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and also the way you understand language

13
0:00:42.604,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the way you understand the world.

14
0:00:45.575,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But that was the end of the bad news,

15
0:00:47.657,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because when Derek came home from the hospital,

16
0:00:50.648,000 --> 0:00:53,000
his family decided to employ the redoubtable nanny

17
0:00:53.83,000 --> 0:00:55,000
who was going to look after you, Derek,

18
0:00:56.201,000 --> 0:00:58,000
really for the rest of your childhood.

19
0:00:58.849,000 --> 0:01:,000
And Nanny's great insight, really,

20
0:01:01.425,000 --> 0:01:03,000
was to think, here's a child who can't see.

21
0:01:04.11,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Music must be the thing for Derek.

22
0:01:07.031,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And sure enough, she sang, or as Derek called it, warbled,

23
0:01:11.298,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to him for his first few years of life.

24
0:01:14.843,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I think it was that excitement with hearing her voice

25
0:01:18.894,000 --> 0:01:2,000
hour after hour every day that made him think

26
0:01:21.878,000 --> 0:01:24,000
maybe, you know, in his brain something was stirring,

27
0:01:24.896,000 --> 0:01:27,000
some sort of musical gift.

28
0:01:27.905,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Here's a little picture of Derek going up now,

29
0:01:30.178,000 --> 0:01:33,000
when you were with your nanny.

30
0:01:33.852,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now Nanny's great other insight was to think,

31
0:01:37.371,000 --> 0:01:4,000
perhaps we should get Derek something to play,

32
0:01:40.706,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and sure enough, she dragged this little keyboard

33
0:01:44.342,000 --> 0:01:46,000
out of the loft, never thinking really

34
0:01:46.938,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that anything much would come of it.

35
0:01:49.281,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But Derek, your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing

36
0:01:52.269,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and actually bashed it,

37
0:01:53.89,000 --> 0:01:55,000
bashed it so hard they thought it was going to break.

38
0:01:56.679,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But out of all the bashing, after a few months,

39
0:02:00.671,000 --> 0:02:03,000
emerged the most fantastic music,

40
0:02:03.84,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I think there was just a miracle moment, really, Derek,

41
0:02:07.206,000 --> 0:02:11,000
when you realized that all the sounds you hear in the world

42
0:02:11.721,000 --> 0:02:14,000
out there is something that you can copy on the keyboard.

43
0:02:15.321,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That was the great eureka moment.

44
0:02:17.834,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, not being able to see meant, of course,

45
0:02:20.404,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that you taught yourself.

46
0:02:21.595,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Derek Paravicini: I taught myself to play.

47
0:02:22.919,000 --> 0:02:23,000
AO: You did teach yourself to play,

48
0:02:24.216,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and as a consequence,

49
0:02:26.747,000 --> 0:02:27,000
playing the piano for you, Derek,

50
0:02:27.798,000 --> 0:02:29,000
was a lot of knuckles and karate chops,

51
0:02:30.275,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and even a bit of nose going on in there.

52
0:02:32.731,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And now, here's what Nanny did also do

53
0:02:36.059,000 --> 0:02:39,000
was to press the record button on one of those little

54
0:02:39.381,000 --> 0:02:41,000
early tape recorders that they had,

55
0:02:41.939,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and this is a wonderful tape, now, of Derek playing

56
0:02:44.042,000 --> 0:02:45,000
when you were four years old.

57
0:02:45.454,000 --> 0:02:47,000
DP: "Molly Malone (Cockles and Mussels)."

58
0:02:48.152,000 --> 0:02:49,000
AO: It wasn't actually "Cockles and Mussels."

59
0:02:49.214,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This one is "English Country Garden."

60
0:02:51.364,000 --> 0:02:53,000
DP: "English Country Garden."

61
0:02:53.629,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Music: "English Country Garden")

62
0:03:30.521,000 --> 0:03:31,000
AO: There you are.

63
0:03:32.319,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Applause)

64
0:03:39.477,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I think that's just fantastic.

65
0:03:41.383,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You know, there's this little child who can't see,

66
0:03:43.113,000 --> 0:03:45,000
can't really understand much about the world,

67
0:03:45.32,000 --> 0:03:47,000
has no one in the family who plays an instrument,

68
0:03:48.026,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and yet he taught himself to play that.

69
0:03:50.327,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And as you can see from the picture,

70
0:03:51.559,000 --> 0:03:53,000
there was quite a lot of body action going on

71
0:03:53.918,000 --> 0:03:54,000
while you were playing, Derek.

72
0:03:55.719,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Now, along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old,

73
0:04:00.289,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and at first, Derek, I thought you were mad, to be honest,

74
0:04:04.107,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because when you played the piano,

75
0:04:05.921,000 --> 0:04:07,000
you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard,

76
0:04:08.838,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and also you had this little habit

77
0:04:10.246,000 --> 0:04:12,000
of hitting me out of the way.

78
0:04:12.429,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So as soon as I tried to get near the piano,

79
0:04:14.235,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I was firmly shoved off.

80
0:04:16.383,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And having said to your dad, Nic,

81
0:04:19.067,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that I would try to teach you, I was then slightly confused

82
0:04:21.562,000 --> 0:04:22,000
as to how I might go about that

83
0:04:23.149,000 --> 0:04:25,000
if I wasn't allowed near the piano.

84
0:04:25.55,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But after a while, I thought, well, the only way

85
0:04:27.727,000 --> 0:04:31,000
is to just pick you up, shove Derek over to the other side of the room,

86
0:04:31.828,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and in the 10 seconds that I got before Derek came back,

87
0:04:34.972,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I could just play something very quickly

88
0:04:37.149,000 --> 0:04:38,000
for him to learn.

89
0:04:39.141,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And in the end, Derek, I think you agreed

90
0:04:40.543,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together.

91
0:04:44.523,000 --> 0:04:46,000
As you can see, there's me in my early,

92
0:04:47.348,000 --> 0:04:49,000
pre-marriage days with a brown beard,

93
0:04:49.587,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and little Derek concentrating there.

94
0:04:53.233,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I just realized this is going to be recorded, isn't it? Right. Okay.

95
0:04:55.777,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:57.079,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now then, by the age of 10, Derek really

97
0:05:01.3,000 --> 0:05:03,000
had taken the world by storm.

98
0:05:03.352,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This is a photo of you, Derek, playing at the Barbican

99
0:05:06.37,000 --> 0:05:07,000
with the Royal Philharmonic Pops.

100
0:05:08.081,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Basically it was just an exciting journey, really.

101
0:05:12.65,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And in those days, Derek, you didn't speak very much,

102
0:05:14.791,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and so there was always a moment of tension

103
0:05:17.102,000 --> 0:05:19,000
as to whether you'd actually understood what it was we were going to play

104
0:05:20.063,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and whether you'd play the right piece in the right key,

105
0:05:22.574,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and all that kind of thing.

106
0:05:24.033,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But the orchestra were wowed as well,

107
0:05:26.858,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and the press of the world were fascinated by your ability

108
0:05:30.715,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to play these fantastic pieces.

109
0:05:34.052,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now the question is, how do you do it, Derek?

110
0:05:37.114,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And hopefully we can show the audience now

111
0:05:39.685,000 --> 0:05:42,000
how it is you do what you do.

112
0:05:42.737,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I think that one of the first things that happened

113
0:05:44.57,000 --> 0:05:45,000
when you were very little, Derek,

114
0:05:45.847,000 --> 0:05:47,000
was that by the time you were two,

115
0:05:48.183,000 --> 0:05:52,000
your musical ear had already outstripped that of most adults.

116
0:05:53.162,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And so whenever you heard any note at all --

117
0:05:55.96,000 --> 0:05:56,000
if I just play a random note --

118
0:05:57.864,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Piano notes) --

119
0:06:00.292,000 --> 0:06:01,000
you knew instantly what it was,

120
0:06:02.183,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and you'd got the ability as well to find that note on the piano.

121
0:06:06.421,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now that's called perfect pitch,

122
0:06:08.009,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and some people have perfect pitch for a few white notes

123
0:06:11.246,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in the middle of the piano.

124
0:06:12.396,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Piano notes)

125
0:06:18.424,000 --> 0:06:21,000
You can see how -- you get a sense of playing with Derek.

126
0:06:21.85,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Applause)

127
0:06:25.398,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But Derek, your ear is so much more than that.

128
0:06:28.424,000 --> 0:06:29,000
If I just put the microphone down for a bit,

129
0:06:29.851,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'm going to play a cluster of notes.

130
0:06:32.571,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Those of you who can see will know how many notes,

131
0:06:34.887,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but Derek, of course, can't.

132
0:06:35.896,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Not only can you say how many notes,

133
0:06:38.798,000 --> 0:06:43,000
it's being able to play them all at the same time. Here we are.

134
0:06:44.222,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Chords)

135
0:06:54.103,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Well, forget the terminology, Derek. Fantastic.

136
0:06:56.921,000 --> 0:07:,000
And it's that ability, that ability to hear simultaneous sounds,

137
0:07:01.866,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not only just single sounds, but when a whole orchestra is playing,

138
0:07:04.188,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Derek, you can hear every note,

139
0:07:06.096,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and instantly, through all those hours and hours of practice,

140
0:07:09.352,000 --> 0:07:1,000
reproduce those on the keyboard,

141
0:07:11.31,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that makes you, I think, is the basis of all your ability.

142
0:07:15.577,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now then.

143
0:07:18.18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's no use having that kind of raw ability

144
0:07:21.748,000 --> 0:07:22,000
without the technique,

145
0:07:23.509,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and luckily, Derek, you decided that,

146
0:07:25.431,000 --> 0:07:27,000
once we did start learning, you'd let me help you

147
0:07:28.053,000 --> 0:07:29,000
learn all the scale fingerings.

148
0:07:29.692,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So for example using your thumb under with C major.

149
0:07:32.639,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Piano notes)

150
0:07:37.752,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Etc.

151
0:07:44.161,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And in the end, you got so quick,

152
0:07:47.521,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that things like "Flight of the Bumblebee"

153
0:07:49.395,000 --> 0:07:5,000
were no problem, were they?

154
0:07:50.625,000 --> 0:07:51,000
DP: No.

155
0:07:51.903,000 --> 0:07:53,000
AO: Right. So here, by the age of 11,

156
0:07:54.532,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Derek was playing things like this.

157
0:07:56.504,000 --> 0:07:59,000
DP: This.

158
0:07:59.586,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

159
0:09:07.792,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Applause)

160
0:09:09.358,000 --> 0:09:11,000
AO: Derek, let's have a bow.

161
0:09:23.408,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Well done.

162
0:09:27.48,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now the truly amazing thing was, with all those scales, Derek,

163
0:09:31.403,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you could not only play "Flight of the Bumblebee"

164
0:09:33.638,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in the usual key, but any note I play,

165
0:09:36.304,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Derek can play it on.

166
0:09:38.297,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So if I just choose a note at random, like that one.

167
0:09:40.765,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Piano notes)

168
0:09:42.58,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Can you play "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note?

169
0:09:44.184,000 --> 0:09:46,000
DP: "Flight of the Bumblebee" on that note.

170
0:09:46.488,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

171
0:09:52.178,000 --> 0:09:56,000
AO: Or another one? How about in G minor?

172
0:09:56.251,000 --> 0:09:58,000
DP: G minor.

173
0:09:58.522,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Music: "Flight of the Bumblebee")

174
0:10:03.833,000 --> 0:10:05,000
AO: Fantastic. Well done, Derek.

175
0:10:06.117,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So you see, in your brain, Derek, is this amazing musical computer

176
0:10:09.899,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that can instantly recalibrate, recalculate,

177
0:10:13.598,000 --> 0:10:15,000
all the pieces in the world that are out there.

178
0:10:15.77,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said,

179
0:10:18.197,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"Sorry, do you mind playing 'Flight of the Bumblebee'

180
0:10:20.014,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in B minor instead of A minor?" as we went on.

181
0:10:23.244,000 --> 0:10:26,000
In fact, the first time, Derek, you played that with an orchestra,

182
0:10:26.665,000 --> 0:10:28,000
you'd learned the version that you'd learned,

183
0:10:28.754,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and then the orchestra, in fact, did have a different version,

184
0:10:30.983,000 --> 0:10:32,000
so while we were waiting in the two hours

185
0:10:33.461,000 --> 0:10:35,000
before the rehearsal and the concert,

186
0:10:35.463,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly

187
0:10:37.703,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and then was able to play it with the orchestra.

188
0:10:40.18,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Fantastic chap.

189
0:10:41.64,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The other wonderful thing about you is memory.

190
0:10:45.099,000 --> 0:10:48,000
DP: Memory. AO: Your memory is truly amazing, and every concert we do,

191
0:10:48.935,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we ask the audience to participate, of course,

192
0:10:51.765,000 --> 0:10:54,000
by suggesting a piece Derek might like to play.

193
0:10:55.529,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And people say, "Well, that's terribly brave

194
0:10:57.051,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because what happens if Derek doesn't know it?"

195
0:10:59.276,000 --> 0:11:,000
And I say, "No, it's not brave at all,

196
0:11:00.288,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because if you ask for something that Derek doesn't know,

197
0:11:02.94,000 --> 0:11:03,000
you're invited to come and sing it first,

198
0:11:04.541,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and then he'll pick it up." (Laughter)

199
0:11:07.027,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So just be thoughtful before you suggest something too outlandish.

200
0:11:11.742,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But seriously, would anyone like to choose a piece?

201
0:11:15.459,000 --> 0:11:18,000
DP: Choose a piece. Choose, choose, would you like to choose? AO: Because it's quite dark. You'll just have to shout out.

202
0:11:19.392,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Would you like to hear me play?

203
0:11:22.213,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Audience: "Theme of Paganini.")

204
0:11:23.427,000 --> 0:11:25,000
AO: Paganini. DP: "The Theme of Paganini."

205
0:11:26.389,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

206
0:11:28.227,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Music: "Theme of Paganini")

207
0:13:03.178,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Applause)

208
0:13:14.409,000 --> 0:13:19,000
AO: Well done.

209
0:13:20.223,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Derek's going to L.A. soon,

210
0:13:22.897,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and it's a milestone, because it means that Derek and I

211
0:13:26.119,000 --> 0:13:29,000
will have spent over 100 hours on long-haul flights together,

212
0:13:29.49,000 --> 0:13:31,000
which is quite interesting, isn't it Derek?

213
0:13:32.117,000 --> 0:13:35,000
DP: Very interesting, Adam, yes. Long-haul flights. Yes.

214
0:13:35.468,000 --> 0:13:37,000
AO: You may think 13 hours is a long time to keep talking,

215
0:13:37.93,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but Derek does it effortlessly. Now then.

216
0:13:40.448,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Laughter)

217
0:13:42.56,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But in America, they've coined this term,

218
0:13:44.434,000 --> 0:13:45,000
"the human iPod" for Derek,

219
0:13:46.044,000 --> 0:13:48,000
which I think is just missing the point, really,

220
0:13:48.4,000 --> 0:13:51,000
because Derek, you're so much more than an iPod.

221
0:13:51.477,000 --> 0:13:53,000
You're a fantastic, creative musician,

222
0:13:54.264,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and I think that was nowhere clearer to see, really,

223
0:13:57.215,000 --> 0:13:59,000
than when we went to Slovenia,

224
0:13:59.412,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and someone -- in a longer concert we tend to get people joining in,

225
0:14:04.809,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and this person, very, very nervously came onto the stage.

226
0:14:08.463,000 --> 0:14:1,000
DP: He played "Chopsticks." AO: And played "Chopsticks."

227
0:14:10.998,000 --> 0:14:11,000
DP: "Chopsticks."

228
0:14:12.489,000 --> 0:14:15,000
AO: A bit like this. DP: Like this. Yes.

229
0:14:15.853,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Piano notes)

230
0:14:16.791,000 --> 0:14:17,000
AO: I should really get Derek's manager to come and play it.

231
0:14:18.471,000 --> 0:14:19,000
He's sitting there.

232
0:14:19.695,000 --> 0:14:22,000
DP: Somebody played "Chopsticks" like this. AO: Just teasing, right? Here we go.

(Music: "Chopsticks")

234
0:14:24.229,000 --> 0:14:26,000
DP: Let Derek play it.

235
0:14:26.491,000 --> 0:14:27,000
AO: What did you do with it, Derek?

236
0:14:28.064,000 --> 0:14:29,000
DP: I got to improvise with it, Adam.

237
0:14:29.805,000 --> 0:14:32,000
AO: This is Derek the musician.

Keep up with Derek.

(Applause)

244
0:16:55.131,000 --> 0:16:56,000
The TED people will kill me,

245
0:16:56.579,000 --> 0:16:58,000
but perhaps there's time for one encore.

246
0:16:58.635,000 --> 0:17:01,000
DP: For one encore. AO: One encore, yes.

247
0:17:02.46,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So this is one of Derek's heroes.

248
0:17:04.515,000 --> 0:17:06,000
It's the great Art Tatum -- DP: Art Tatum.

249
0:17:06.687,000 --> 0:17:08,000
AO: -- who also was a pianist who couldn't see,

250
0:17:08.713,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and also, I think, like Derek,

251
0:17:09.87,000 --> 0:17:1,000
thought that all the world was a piano,

252
0:17:11.379,000 --> 0:17:12,000
so whenever Art Tatum plays something,

253
0:17:13.339,000 --> 0:17:15,000
it sounds like there's three pianos in the room.

254
0:17:15.974,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And here is Derek's take on Art Tatum's take on "Tiger Rag."

255
0:17:21.798,000 --> 0:17:24,000
DP: "Tiger Rag."

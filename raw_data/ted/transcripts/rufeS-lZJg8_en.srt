Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:13.341,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Like most journalists, I'm an idealist.

3
0:00:15.857,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I love unearthing good stories, especially untold stories.

4
0:00:21.126,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I just didn't think that in 2011,

5
0:00:23.583,000 --> 0:00:25,000
women would still be in that category.

6
0:00:26.538,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm the President of the Journalism and Women Symposium -- JAWS.

7
0:00:30.539,000 --> 0:00:31,000
That's Sharky.

8
0:00:31.715,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:33.23,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I joined 10 years ago because I wanted female role models,

10
0:00:36.058,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and I was frustrated by the lagging status of women in our profession

11
0:00:40.281,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and what that meant for our image in the media.

12
0:00:44.086,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We make up half the population of the world,

13
0:00:46.213,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but we're just 24 percent of the news subjects

14
0:00:48.824,000 --> 0:00:49,000
quoted in news stories.

15
0:00:50.752,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And we're just 20 percent of the experts quoted in stories.

16
0:00:54.461,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And now, with today's technology,

17
0:00:56.557,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it's possible to remove women from the picture completely.

18
0:01:00.588,000 --> 0:01:03,000
This is a picture of President Barack Obama and his advisors,

19
0:01:04.484,000 --> 0:01:06,000
tracking the killing of Osama bin Laden.

20
0:01:06.596,000 --> 0:01:08,000
You can see Hillary Clinton on the right.

21
0:01:09.261,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Let's see how the photo ran

22
0:01:10.605,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in an Orthodox Jewish newspaper based in Brooklyn.

23
0:01:14.327,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Hillary's completely gone.

24
0:01:16.064,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:18.936,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The paper apologized, but said it never runs photos of women;

26
0:01:22.009,000 --> 0:01:23,000
they might be sexually provocative.

27
0:01:23.965,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:26.099,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This is an extreme case, yes.

29
0:01:28.171,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But the fact is,

30
0:01:29.362,000 --> 0:01:33,000
women are only 19 percent of the sources in stories on politics,

31
0:01:33.505,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and only 20 percent in stories on the economy.

32
0:01:38.21,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The news continues to give us a picture

33
0:01:40.115,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where men outnumber women

34
0:01:41.751,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in nearly all occupational categories, except two:

35
0:01:44.489,000 --> 0:01:46,000
students and homemakers.

36
0:01:47.001,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:48.282,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So we all get a very distorted picture of reality.

38
0:01:52.414,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The problem is, of course, there aren't enough women in newsrooms.

39
0:01:55.544,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They report at just 37 percent of stories in print, TV and radio.

40
0:02:00.006,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Even in stories on gender-based violence,

41
0:02:03.11,000 --> 0:02:06,000
men get an overwhelming majority of print space and airtime.

42
0:02:06.737,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Case in point:

43
0:02:08.999,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This March, the New York Times ran a story by James McKinley

44
0:02:11.927,000 --> 0:02:12,000
about a gang rape of a young girl,

45
0:02:13.605,000 --> 0:02:15,000
11 years old, in a small Texas town.

46
0:02:16.515,000 --> 0:02:19,000
McKinley writes that the community is wondering,

47
0:02:19.594,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"How could their boys have been drawn into this?"

48
0:02:23.136,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"Drawn into this" --

49
0:02:24.564,000 --> 0:02:27,000
like they were seduced into committing an act of violence.

50
0:02:27.668,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And the first person he quotes says,

51
0:02:29.677,000 --> 0:02:32,000
"These boys will have to live with this the rest of their lives."

52
0:02:32.774,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Groans, laughter)

53
0:02:35.636,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You don't hear much about the 11-year-old victim,

54
0:02:38.644,000 --> 0:02:41,000
except that she wore clothes that were a little old for her

55
0:02:42.085,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and she wore makeup.

56
0:02:44.223,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The Times was deluged with criticism.

57
0:02:47.37,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Initially, it defended itself,

58
0:02:48.973,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and said, "These aren't our views.

59
0:02:50.718,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This is what we found in our reporting."

60
0:02:52.67,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, here's a secret you probably know already:

61
0:02:55.492,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Your stories are constructed.

62
0:02:57.114,000 --> 0:03:,000
As reporters, we research, we interview.

63
0:03:00.159,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We try to give a good picture of reality.

64
0:03:03.091,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We also have our own unconscious biases.

65
0:03:05.86,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But The Times makes it sound like anyone would have reported this story

66
0:03:09.407,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the same way.

67
0:03:11.175,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I disagree with that.

68
0:03:13.083,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So three weeks later,

69
0:03:14.859,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The Times revisits the story.

70
0:03:16.41,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This time, it adds another byline to it with McKinley's:

71
0:03:20.183,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Erica Goode.

72
0:03:21.683,000 --> 0:03:23,000
What emerges is a truly sad, horrific tale

73
0:03:24.609,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of a young girl and her family trapped in poverty.

74
0:03:27.592,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She was raped numerous times by many men.

75
0:03:30.703,000 --> 0:03:32,000
She had been a bright, easygoing girl.

76
0:03:33.117,000 --> 0:03:35,000
She was maturing quickly, physically,

77
0:03:35.703,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but her bed was still covered with stuffed animals.

78
0:03:38.719,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's a very different picture.

79
0:03:40.64,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Perhaps the addition of Ms. Goode is what made this story more complete.

80
0:03:44.96,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The Global Media Monitoring Project has found that stories by female reporters

81
0:03:49.094,000 --> 0:03:52,000
are more likely to challenge stereotypes than those by male reporters.

82
0:03:52.887,000 --> 0:03:53,000
At KUNM here in Albuquerque,

83
0:03:54.284,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Elaine Baumgartel did some graduate research

84
0:03:56.443,000 --> 0:03:58,000
on the coverage of violence against women.

85
0:03:58.736,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What she found was many of these stories tend to blame victims

86
0:04:02.133,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and devalue their lives.

87
0:04:03.676,000 --> 0:04:06,000
They tend to sensationalize, and they lack context.

88
0:04:07.423,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So for her graduate work,

89
0:04:08.662,000 --> 0:04:1,000
she did a three-part series on the murder of 11 women,

90
0:04:11.583,000 --> 0:04:13,000
found buried on Albuquerque's West Mesa.

91
0:04:14.183,000 --> 0:04:17,000
She tried to challenge those patterns and stereotypes in her work

92
0:04:17.571,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and she tried to show the challenges that journalists face

93
0:04:20.436,000 --> 0:04:23,000
from external sources, their own internal biases

94
0:04:23.98,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and cultural norms.

95
0:04:25.652,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And she worked with an editor at National Public Radio

96
0:04:28.399,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to try to get a story aired nationally.

97
0:04:30.956,000 --> 0:04:33,000
She's not sure that would have happened if the editor had not been a female.

98
0:04:35.472,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Stories in the news

99
0:04:36.695,000 --> 0:04:4,000
are more than twice as likely to present women as victims than men,

100
0:04:40.956,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and women are more likely to be defined by their body parts.

101
0:04:45.562,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Wired magazine, November 2010.

102
0:04:48.44,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Yes, the issue was about breast-tissue engineering.

103
0:04:52.769,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now I know you're all distracted, so I'll take that off.

104
0:04:55.467,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:56.492,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Eyes up here.

106
0:04:57.67,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:00.946,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So --

108
0:05:02.121,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Applause)

109
0:05:06.323,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Here's the thing:

110
0:05:07.507,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Wired almost never puts women on its cover.

111
0:05:10.414,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Oh, there have been some gimmicky ones --

112
0:05:12.415,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Pam from "The Office,"

113
0:05:14.041,000 --> 0:05:15,000
manga girls,

114
0:05:15.974,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a voluptuous model covered in synthetic diamonds.

115
0:05:19.863,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Texas State University professor Cindy Royal wondered in her blog

116
0:05:23.455,000 --> 0:05:26,000
how are young women like her students supposed to feel about their roles

117
0:05:27.47,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in technology, reading Wired.

118
0:05:28.962,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Chris Anderson, the editor of Wired, defended his choice

119
0:05:32.239,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and said there aren't enough women, prominent women

120
0:05:34.652,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in technology to sell a cover, to sell an issue.

121
0:05:38.581,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Part of that is true,

122
0:05:39.764,000 --> 0:05:41,000
there aren't as many prominent women in technology.

123
0:05:42.336,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Here's my problem with that argument:

124
0:05:44.85,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Media tells us every day what's important,

125
0:05:47.453,000 --> 0:05:49,000
by the stories they choose and where they place them;

126
0:05:49.98,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it's called agenda setting.

127
0:05:52.433,000 --> 0:05:54,000
How many people knew the founders of Facebook and Google

128
0:05:55.192,000 --> 0:05:57,000
before their faces were on a magazine cover?

129
0:05:57.384,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Putting them there made them more recognizable.

130
0:06:00.265,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now, Fast Company Magazine embraces that idea.

131
0:06:03.085,000 --> 0:06:05,000
This is its cover from November 15, 2010.

132
0:06:06.371,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The issue is about the most prominent and influential women in technology.

133
0:06:10.827,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Editor Robert Safian told the Poynter Institute,

134
0:06:13.39,000 --> 0:06:15,000
"Silicon Valley is very white and very male.

135
0:06:16.261,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But that's not what Fast Company thinks

136
0:06:18.579,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the business world will look like in the future,

137
0:06:20.967,000 --> 0:06:23,000
so it tries to give a picture of where the globalized world is moving."

138
0:06:25.354,000 --> 0:06:27,000
By the way, apparently, Wired took all this to heart.

139
0:06:28.459,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This was its issue in April.

140
0:06:30.032,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:31.934,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That's Limor Fried, the founder of Adafruit Industries,

142
0:06:34.775,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in the Rosie the Riveter pose.

143
0:06:37.704,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It would help to have more women in positions of leadership in media.

144
0:06:41.198,000 --> 0:06:42,000
A recent global survey

145
0:06:42.459,000 --> 0:06:44,000
found that 73 percent of the top media-management jobs

146
0:06:45.349,000 --> 0:06:46,000
are still held by men.

147
0:06:47.335,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But this is also about something far more complex:

148
0:06:49.992,000 --> 0:06:51,000
our own unconscious biases and blind spots.

149
0:06:53.817,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Shankar Vedantam is the author

150
0:06:55.465,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of "The Hidden Brain: How Our Unconscious Minds Elect Presidents,

151
0:06:58.537,000 --> 0:07:,000
Control Markets, Wage Wars, and Save Our Lives."

152
0:07:01.718,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He told the former ombudsman at National Public Radio,

153
0:07:04.869,000 --> 0:07:07,000
who was doing a report on how women fare in NPR coverage,

154
0:07:08.63,000 --> 0:07:11,000
unconscious bias flows throughout most of our lives.

155
0:07:11.744,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's really difficult to disentangle those strands.

156
0:07:15.311,000 --> 0:07:16,000
But he did have one suggestion.

157
0:07:17.301,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He used to work for two editors

158
0:07:20.116,000 --> 0:07:23,000
who said every story had to have at least one female source.

159
0:07:24.099,000 --> 0:07:25,000
He balked at first,

160
0:07:25.616,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but said he eventually followed the directive happily,

161
0:07:28.592,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because his stories got better

162
0:07:30.057,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and his job got easier.

163
0:07:32.014,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, I don't know if one of the editors was a woman,

164
0:07:34.636,000 --> 0:07:36,000
but that can make the biggest difference.

165
0:07:37.037,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The Dallas Morning News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1994

166
0:07:41.027,000 --> 0:07:43,000
for a series it did on women around the world,

167
0:07:43.654,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but one of the reporters told me

168
0:07:45.385,000 --> 0:07:47,000
she's convinced it never would have happened

169
0:07:47.758,000 --> 0:07:5,000
if they had not had a female assistant foreign editor,

170
0:07:51.193,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and they would not have gotten some of those stories

171
0:07:53.701,000 --> 0:07:55,000
without female reporters and editors on the ground,

172
0:07:56.216,000 --> 0:07:58,000
particularly one on female genital mutilation --

173
0:07:59.142,000 --> 0:08:01,000
men would just not be allowed into those situations.

174
0:08:02.22,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is an important point to consider,

175
0:08:04.478,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because much of our foreign policy now revolves around countries

176
0:08:07.758,000 --> 0:08:09,000
where the treatment of women is an issue,

177
0:08:10.203,000 --> 0:08:11,000
such as Afghanistan.

178
0:08:13.578,000 --> 0:08:17,000
What we're told in terms of arguments against leaving this country

179
0:08:17.726,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is that the fate of the women is primary.

180
0:08:21.701,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now, I'm sure a male reporter in Kabul can find women to interview.

181
0:08:25.835,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Not so sure about rural, traditional areas,

182
0:08:29.631,000 --> 0:08:31,000
where I'm guessing women can't talk to strange men.

183
0:08:32.858,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It's important to keep talking about this, in light of Lara Logan.

184
0:08:36.881,000 --> 0:08:38,000
She was the CBS News correspondent

185
0:08:39.057,000 --> 0:08:41,000
who was brutally sexually assaulted in Egypt's Tahrir Square,

186
0:08:41.994,000 --> 0:08:42,000
right after this photo was taken.

187
0:08:44.133,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Almost immediately, pundits weighed in,

188
0:08:46.926,000 --> 0:08:49,000
blaming her and saying things like,

189
0:08:50.189,000 --> 0:08:53,000
"You know, maybe women shouldn't be sent to cover those stories."

190
0:08:53.613,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I never heard anyone say this about Anderson Cooper and his crew,

191
0:08:56.874,000 --> 0:08:58,000
who were attacked covering the same story.

192
0:09:00.387,000 --> 0:09:02,000
One way to get more women into leadership

193
0:09:02.462,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is to have other women mentor them.

194
0:09:04.64,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One of my board members is an editor at a major global media company,

195
0:09:08.257,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but she never thought about this as a career path,

196
0:09:10.917,000 --> 0:09:12,000
until she met female role models at JAWS.

197
0:09:14.425,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But this is not just a job for super-journalists

198
0:09:16.949,000 --> 0:09:17,000
or my organization.

199
0:09:18.152,000 --> 0:09:2,000
You all have a stake in a strong, vibrant media.

200
0:09:21.743,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Analyze your news.

201
0:09:23.474,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And speak up when there are gaps missing in coverage,

202
0:09:26.055,000 --> 0:09:27,000
like people at The New York Times did.

203
0:09:28.03,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Suggest female sources to reporters and editors.

204
0:09:31.41,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Remember -- a complete picture of reality may depend upon it.

205
0:09:35.48,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And I'll leave you with a video clip

206
0:09:37.219,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that I first saw in [1987] when I was a student in London.

207
0:09:41.137,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's for The Guardian newspaper.

208
0:09:42.733,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It's actually long before I ever thought about becoming a journalist,

209
0:09:46.106,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but I was very interested in how we learn to perceive our world.

210
0:09:50.823,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Narrator: An event seen from one point of view gives one impression.

211
0:10:00.579,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Seen from another point of view,

212
0:10:02.355,000 --> 0:10:04,000
it gives quite a different impression.

213
0:10:06.982,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But it's only when you get the whole picture,

214
0:10:09.384,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you can fully understand what's going on.

215
0:10:15.809,000 --> 0:10:16,000
[The Guardian]

216
0:10:17.825,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Megan Kamerick: I think you'll all agree

217
0:10:19.771,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that we'd be better off if we all had the whole picture.

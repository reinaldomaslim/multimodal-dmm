1
0:00:12.737,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was about three or four years old,

2
0:00:17.027,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I remember my mum reading a story to me

3
0:00:20.909,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and my two big brothers,

4
0:00:23.624,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I remember putting up my hands

5
0:00:25.643,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to feel the page of the book,

6
0:00:27.646,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to feel the picture they were discussing.

7
0:00:31.177,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And my mum said, "Darling,

8
0:00:33.626,000 --> 0:00:35,000
remember that you can't see

9
0:00:36.479,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and you can't feel the picture

10
0:00:39.525,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and you can't feel the print on the page."

11
0:00:42.462,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I thought to myself,

12
0:00:44.236,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"But that's what I want to do.

13
0:00:46.131,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I love stories. I want to read."

14
0:00:50.292,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Little did I know

15
0:00:52.554,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that I would be part of a technological revolution

16
0:00:55.073,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that would make that dream come true.

17
0:00:58.774,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I was born premature by about 10 weeks,

18
0:01:02.191,000 --> 0:01:06,000
which resulted in my blindness, some 64 years ago.

19
0:01:06.836,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The condition is known as retrolental fibroplasia,

20
0:01:09.706,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it's now very rare in the developed world.

21
0:01:13.591,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Little did I know, lying curled up

22
0:01:16.5,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in my prim baby humidicrib in 1948

23
0:01:21.293,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that I'd been born at the right place

24
0:01:24.121,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and the right time,

25
0:01:26.686,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that I was in a country where I could participate

26
0:01:30.57,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in the technological revolution.

27
0:01:33.503,000 --> 0:01:38,000
There are 37 million totally blind people on our planet,

28
0:01:38.944,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but those of us who've shared in the technological changes

29
0:01:42.168,000 --> 0:01:45,000
mainly come from North America, Europe,

30
0:01:45.172,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Japan and other developed parts of the world.

31
0:01:49.597,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Computers have changed the lives of us all in this room

32
0:01:52.77,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and around the world,

33
0:01:53.673,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but I think they've changed the lives

34
0:01:55.34,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of we blind people more than any other group.

35
0:01:58.883,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And so I want to tell you about the interaction

36
0:02:02.161,000 --> 0:02:05,000
between computer-based adaptive technology

37
0:02:05.213,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and the many volunteers who helped me over the years

38
0:02:09.875,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to become the person I am today.

39
0:02:13.276,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's an interaction between volunteers,

40
0:02:15.91,000 --> 0:02:17,000
passionate inventors and technology,

41
0:02:18.831,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it's a story that many other blind people could tell.

42
0:02:21.766,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But let me tell you a bit about it today.

43
0:02:26.181,000 --> 0:02:29,000
When I was five, I went to school and I learned braille.

44
0:02:30.007,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's an ingenious system of six dots

45
0:02:32.531,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that are punched into paper,

46
0:02:34.265,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and I can feel them with my fingers.

47
0:02:37.652,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In fact, I think they're putting up my grade six report.

48
0:02:40.828,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I don't know where Julian Morrow got that from.

49
0:02:43.553,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:45.109,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I was pretty good in reading,

51
0:02:46.93,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but religion and musical appreciation needed more work.

52
0:02:51.89,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:53.366,000 --> 0:02:55,000
When you leave the opera house,

54
0:02:55.453,000 --> 0:02:58,000
you'll find there's braille signage in the lifts.

55
0:02:58.862,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Look for it. Have you noticed it?

56
0:03:02.579,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I do. I look for it all the time.

57
0:03:05.309,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:07.395,000 --> 0:03:09,000
When I was at school,

59
0:03:09.734,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the books were transcribed by transcribers,

60
0:03:13.026,000 --> 0:03:15,000
voluntary people who punched one dot at a time

61
0:03:15.859,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so I'd have volumes to read,

62
0:03:17.527,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and that had been going on, mainly by women,

63
0:03:19.986,000 --> 0:03:21,000
since the late 19th century in this country,

64
0:03:22.659,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but it was the only way I could read.

65
0:03:25.143,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When I was in high school,

66
0:03:27.537,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I got my first Philips reel-to-reel tape recorder,

67
0:03:31.343,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and tape recorders became my sort of pre-computer

68
0:03:34.732,000 --> 0:03:36,000
medium of learning.

69
0:03:36.912,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I could have family and friends read me material,

70
0:03:40.051,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I could then read it back

71
0:03:42.444,000 --> 0:03:44,000
as many times as I needed.

72
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And it brought me into contact

73
0:03:46.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
with volunteers and helpers.

74
0:03:48.53,000 --> 0:03:52,000
For example, when I studied at graduate school

75
0:03:53.022,000 --> 0:03:55,000
at Queen's University in Canada,

76
0:03:55.259,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the prisoners at the Collins Bay jail agreed to help me.

77
0:03:59.342,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I gave them a tape recorder, and they read into it.

78
0:04:02.147,000 --> 0:04:03,000
As one of them said to me,

79
0:04:03.433,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Ron, we ain't going anywhere at the moment."

80
0:04:06.192,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:08.653,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But think of it. These men,

82
0:04:10.958,000 --> 0:04:13,000
who hadn't had the educational opportunities I'd had,

83
0:04:14.905,000 --> 0:04:18,000
helped me gain post-graduate qualifications in law

84
0:04:19.181,000 --> 0:04:22,000
by their dedicated help.

85
0:04:22.6,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Well, I went back and became an academic

86
0:04:24.961,000 --> 0:04:26,000
at Melbourne's Monash University,

87
0:04:27.603,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and for those 25 years,

88
0:04:31.113,000 --> 0:04:33,000
tape recorders were everything to me.

89
0:04:33.926,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In fact, in my office in 1990,

90
0:04:36.377,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I had 18 miles of tape.

91
0:04:40.904,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Students, family and friends all read me material.

92
0:04:47.809,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Mrs. Lois Doery,

93
0:04:49.346,000 --> 0:04:51,000
whom I later came to call my surrogate mum,

94
0:04:52.324,000 --> 0:04:55,000
read me many thousands of hours onto tape.

95
0:04:55.976,000 --> 0:04:57,000
One of the reasons I agreed to give this talk today

96
0:04:58.44,000 --> 0:05:,000
was that I was hoping that Lois would be here

97
0:05:00.929,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so I could introduce you to her and publicly thank her.

98
0:05:04.966,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But sadly, her health hasn't permitted her to come today.

99
0:05:08.715,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But I thank you here, Lois, from this platform.

100
0:05:13.303,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

101
0:05:25.776,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I saw my first Apple computer in 1984,

102
0:05:32.635,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and I thought to myself,

103
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"This thing's got a glass screen, not much use to me."

104
0:05:39.128,000 --> 0:05:43,000
How very wrong I was.

105
0:05:43.182,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In 1987, in the month our eldest son Gerard was born,

106
0:05:47.715,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I got my first blind computer,

107
0:05:50.169,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and it's actually here.

108
0:05:53.383,000 --> 0:05:54,000
See it up there?

109
0:05:55.318,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And you see it has no, what do you call it, no screen.

110
0:05:59.601,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:03.919,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's a blind computer.

112
0:06:05.913,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

113
0:06:07.813,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It's a Keynote Gold 84k,

114
0:06:10.418,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and the 84k stands for it had 84 kilobytes of memory.

115
0:06:14.594,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:17.495,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Don't laugh, it cost me 4,000 dollars at the time. (Laughter)

117
0:06:22.433,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I think there's more memory in my watch.

118
0:06:27.127,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It was invented by Russell Smith, a passionate inventor

119
0:06:30.147,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in New Zealand who was trying to help blind people.

120
0:06:32.945,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Sadly, he died in a light plane crash in 2005,

121
0:06:36.747,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but his memory lives on in my heart.

122
0:06:39.605,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It meant, for the first time,

123
0:06:41.857,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I could read back what I had typed into it.

124
0:06:45.188,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It had a speech synthesizer.

125
0:06:47.145,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I'd written my first coauthored labor law book

126
0:06:49.405,000 --> 0:06:53,000
on a typewriter in 1979 purely from memory.

127
0:06:54.231,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This now allowed me to read back what I'd written

128
0:06:58.542,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and to enter the computer world,

129
0:07:00.22,000 --> 0:07:03,000
even with its 84k of memory.

130
0:07:03.62,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In 1974, the great Ray Kurzweil, the American inventor,

131
0:07:09.008,000 --> 0:07:11,000
worked on building a machine that would scan books

132
0:07:11.758,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and read them out in synthetic speech.

133
0:07:14.289,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Optical character recognition units then

134
0:07:16.836,000 --> 0:07:18,000
only operated usually on one font,

135
0:07:19.576,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but by using charge-coupled device flatbed scanners

136
0:07:23.92,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and speech synthesizers,

137
0:07:25.426,000 --> 0:07:29,000
he developed a machine that could read any font.

138
0:07:29.832,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And his machine, which was as big as a washing machine,

139
0:07:32.963,000 --> 0:07:35,000
was launched on the 13th of January, 1976.

140
0:07:36.937,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I saw my first commercially available Kurzweil

141
0:07:40.02,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in March 1989, and it blew me away,

142
0:07:43.327,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and in September 1989,

143
0:07:46.117,000 --> 0:07:49,000
the month that my associate professorship

144
0:07:49.31,000 --> 0:07:5,000
at Monash University was announced,

145
0:07:51.282,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the law school got one, and I could use it.

146
0:07:55.14,000 --> 0:07:59,000
For the first time, I could read what I wanted to read

147
0:07:59.173,000 --> 0:08:,000
by putting a book on the scanner.

148
0:08:00.581,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I didn't have to be nice to people!

149
0:08:03.297,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Laughter)

150
0:08:05.94,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I no longer would be censored.

151
0:08:08.089,000 --> 0:08:11,000
For example, I was too shy then,

152
0:08:11.13,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and I'm actually too shy now, to ask anybody

153
0:08:13.602,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to read me out loud sexually explicit material.

154
0:08:16.415,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:20.387,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But, you know, I could pop a book on in the middle of the night, and --

156
0:08:23.875,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

157
0:08:33.528,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now, the Kurzweil reader is simply

158
0:08:36.712,000 --> 0:08:38,000
a program on my laptop.

159
0:08:38.996,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That's what it's shrunk to.

160
0:08:40.34,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And now I can scan the latest novel

161
0:08:42.43,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and not wait to get it into talking book libraries.

162
0:08:44.635,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I can keep up with my friends.

163
0:08:47.896,000 --> 0:08:5,000
There are many people who have helped me in my life,

164
0:08:51.136,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and many that I haven't met.

165
0:08:53.767,000 --> 0:08:56,000
One is another American inventor Ted Henter.

166
0:08:57.416,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Ted was a motorcycle racer,

167
0:08:59.788,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but in 1978 he had a car accident and lost his sight,

168
0:09:04.02,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which is devastating if you're trying to ride motorbikes.

169
0:09:07.579,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He then turned to being a waterskier

170
0:09:10.375,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and was a champion disabled waterskier.

171
0:09:13.887,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But in 1989, he teamed up with Bill Joyce

172
0:09:17.134,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to develop a program that would read out

173
0:09:21.269,000 --> 0:09:22,000
what was on the computer screen

174
0:09:23.02,000 --> 0:09:25,000
from the Net or from what was on the computer.

175
0:09:25.024,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It's called JAWS, Job Access With Speech,

176
0:09:28.531,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and it sounds like this.

177
0:09:30.535,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(JAWS speaking)

178
0:09:41.985,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Ron McCallum: Isn't that slow?

179
0:09:43.748,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:44.718,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You see, if I read like that, I'd fall asleep.

181
0:09:46.986,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I slowed it down for you.

182
0:09:48.195,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I'm going to ask that we play it at the speed I read it.

183
0:09:51.467,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Can we play that one?

184
0:09:53.982,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(JAWS speaking)

185
0:10:07.809,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

186
0:10:09.832,000 --> 0:10:1,000
RM: You know, when you're marking student essays,

187
0:10:11.653,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you want to get through them fairly quickly.

188
0:10:13.57,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

189
0:10:23.139,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This technology that fascinated me in 1987

190
0:10:26.722,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is now on my iPhone and on yours as well.

191
0:10:30.443,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But, you know, I find reading with machines

192
0:10:33.977,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a very lonely process.

193
0:10:36.39,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I grew up with family, friends, reading to me,

194
0:10:41.329,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and I loved the warmth and the breath

195
0:10:44.248,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and the closeness of people reading.

196
0:10:46.602,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Do you love being read to?

197
0:10:48.875,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And one of my most enduring memories

198
0:10:51.675,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is in 1999, Mary reading to me and the children

199
0:10:57.124,000 --> 0:10:59,000
down near Manly Beach

200
0:10:59.52,000 --> 0:11:02,000
"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone."

201
0:11:02.925,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Isn't that a great book?

202
0:11:05.228,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I still love being close to someone reading to me.

203
0:11:08.06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But I wouldn't give up the technology,

204
0:11:09.821,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because it's allowed me to lead a great life.

205
0:11:15.111,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Of course, talking books for the blind

206
0:11:17.798,000 --> 0:11:18,000
predated all this technology.

207
0:11:19.41,000 --> 0:11:22,000
After all, the long-playing record was developed

208
0:11:22.889,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in the early 1930s,

209
0:11:24.278,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and now we put talking books on CDs

210
0:11:26.967,000 --> 0:11:31,000
using the digital access system known as DAISY.

211
0:11:32.53,000 --> 0:11:35,000
But when I'm reading with synthetic voices,

212
0:11:35.712,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I love to come home and read a racy novel

213
0:11:38.662,000 --> 0:11:41,000
with a real voice.

214
0:11:42.612,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now there are still barriers

215
0:11:44.684,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in front of we people with disabilities.

216
0:11:46.677,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Many websites we can't read using JAWS

217
0:11:49.595,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and the other technologies.

218
0:11:50.882,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Websites are often very visual,

219
0:11:53.086,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and there are all these sorts of graphs

220
0:11:54.533,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that aren't labeled and buttons that aren't labeled,

221
0:11:57.484,000 --> 0:12:,000
and that's why the World Wide Web Consortium 3,

222
0:12:01.281,000 --> 0:12:06,000
known as W3C, has developed worldwide standards

223
0:12:06.844,000 --> 0:12:07,000
for the Internet.

224
0:12:08.258,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And we want all Internet users or Internet site owners

225
0:12:13.688,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to make their sites compatible so that

226
0:12:15.91,000 --> 0:12:19,000
we persons without vision can have a level playing field.

227
0:12:20.586,000 --> 0:12:24,000
There are other barriers brought about by our laws.

228
0:12:24.641,000 --> 0:12:26,000
For example, Australia,

229
0:12:27.19,000 --> 0:12:29,000
like about one third of the world's countries,

230
0:12:29.682,000 --> 0:12:33,000
has copyright exceptions which allow books to be brailled

231
0:12:34.226,000 --> 0:12:36,000
or read for we blind persons.

232
0:12:36.398,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But those books can't travel across borders.

233
0:12:39.618,000 --> 0:12:41,000
For example, in Spain, there are a 100,000

234
0:12:42.4,000 --> 0:12:44,000
accessible books in Spanish.

235
0:12:44.426,000 --> 0:12:46,000
In Argentina, there are 50,000.

236
0:12:46.804,000 --> 0:12:47,000
In no other Latin American country

237
0:12:48.583,000 --> 0:12:5,000
are there more than a couple of thousand.

238
0:12:50.66,000 --> 0:12:52,000
But it's not legal to transport the books

239
0:12:52.765,000 --> 0:12:54,000
from Spain to Latin America.

240
0:12:55.59,000 --> 0:12:57,000
There are hundreds of thousands of accessible books

241
0:12:58.347,000 --> 0:13:,000
in the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, etc.,

242
0:13:01.223,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but they can't be transported to the 60 countries

243
0:13:03.912,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in our world where English is the first and the second language.

244
0:13:06.886,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And remember I was telling you about Harry Potter.

245
0:13:10.297,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Well, because we can't transport books across borders,

246
0:13:13.411,000 --> 0:13:14,000
there had to be separate versions read

247
0:13:15.335,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in all the different English-speaking countries:

248
0:13:18.264,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Britain, United States, Canada, Australia,

249
0:13:21.315,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and New Zealand all had to have

250
0:13:23.396,000 --> 0:13:25,000
separate readings of Harry Potter.

251
0:13:26.139,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And that's why, next month in Morocco,

252
0:13:29.253,000 --> 0:13:31,000
a meeting is taking place between all the countries.

253
0:13:31.752,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's something that a group of countries

254
0:13:33.155,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and the World Blind Union are advocating,

255
0:13:35.283,000 --> 0:13:37,000
a cross-border treaty

256
0:13:37.601,000 --> 0:13:4,000
so that if books are available under a copyright exception

257
0:13:40.739,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and the other country has a copyright exception,

258
0:13:42.708,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we can transport those books across borders

259
0:13:45.106,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and give life to people, particularly in developing countries,

260
0:13:48.322,000 --> 0:13:51,000
blind people who don't have the books to read.

261
0:13:52.247,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I want that to happen.

262
0:13:54.359,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

263
0:14:02.598,000 --> 0:14:05,000
My life has been extraordinarily blessed

264
0:14:05.863,000 --> 0:14:07,000
with marriage and children

265
0:14:08.497,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and certainly interesting work to do,

266
0:14:11.576,000 --> 0:14:13,000
whether it be at the University of Sydney Law School,

267
0:14:14.23,000 --> 0:14:15,000
where I served a term as dean,

268
0:14:15.502,000 --> 0:14:18,000
or now as I sit on the United Nations Committee

269
0:14:19.023,000 --> 0:14:22,000
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in Geneva.

270
0:14:22.163,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I've indeed been a very fortunate human being.

271
0:14:27.158,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I wonder what the future will hold.

272
0:14:30.166,000 --> 0:14:33,000
The technology will advance even further,

273
0:14:33.857,000 --> 0:14:36,000
but I can still remember my mum saying, 60 years ago,

274
0:14:37.525,000 --> 0:14:38,000
"Remember, darling,

275
0:14:39.459,000 --> 0:14:43,000
you'll never be able to read the print with your fingers."

276
0:14:43.604,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I'm so glad that the interaction between braille transcribers,

277
0:14:48.781,000 --> 0:14:5,000
volunteer readers and passionate inventors,

278
0:14:51.678,000 --> 0:14:54,000
has allowed this dream of reading to come true for me

279
0:14:54.868,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and for blind people throughout the world.

280
0:14:57.872,000 --> 0:15:,000
I'd like to thank my researcher Hannah Martin,

281
0:15:01.518,000 --> 0:15:03,000
who is my slide clicker, who clicks the slides,

282
0:15:04.488,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and my wife, Professor Mary Crock, who's the light of my life,

283
0:15:08.879,000 --> 0:15:09,000
is coming on to collect me.

284
0:15:10.237,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I want to thank her too.

285
0:15:11.432,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I think I have to say goodbye now.

286
0:15:13.432,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Bless you. Thank you very much.

287
0:15:15.003,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause)

288
0:15:16.727,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Yay! (Applause)

289
0:15:32.602,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. (Applause)

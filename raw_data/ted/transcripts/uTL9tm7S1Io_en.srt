1
0:00:13.006,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We have historical records that allow us to know how the ancient Greeks dressed,

2
0:00:18.18,000 --> 0:00:19,000
how they lived,

3
0:00:19.458,000 --> 0:00:2,000
how they fought ...

4
0:00:21.004,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but how did they think?

5
0:00:23.432,000 --> 0:00:27,000
One natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought --

6
0:00:27.896,000 --> 0:00:28,000
our ability to imagine,

7
0:00:29.792,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to be conscious,

8
0:00:31.213,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to dream --

9
0:00:32.468,000 --> 0:00:33,000
have always been the same.

10
0:00:34.872,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Another possibility

11
0:00:36.395,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is that the social transformations that have shaped our culture

12
0:00:40.142,000 --> 0:00:43,000
may have also changed the structural columns of human thought.

13
0:00:44.911,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We may all have different opinions about this.

14
0:00:47.459,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Actually, it's a long-standing philosophical debate.

15
0:00:50.644,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But is this question even amenable to science?

16
0:00:54.834,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Here I'd like to propose

17
0:00:57.364,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that in the same way we can reconstruct how the ancient Greek cities looked

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
just based on a few bricks,

19
0:01:04.572,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that the writings of a culture are the archaeological records,

20
0:01:08.722,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the fossils, of human thought.

21
0:01:11.905,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And in fact,

22
0:01:13.103,000 --> 0:01:15,000
doing some form of psychological analysis

23
0:01:15.333,000 --> 0:01:18,000
of some of the most ancient books of human culture,

24
0:01:18.901,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s with a very wild and radical hypothesis:

25
0:01:24.88,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that only 3,000 years ago,

26
0:01:27.317,000 --> 0:01:31,000
humans were what today we would call schizophrenics.

27
0:01:33.753,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And he made this claim

28
0:01:35.285,000 --> 0:01:38,000
based on the fact that the first humans described in these books

29
0:01:38.61,000 --> 0:01:39,000
behaved consistently,

30
0:01:40.538,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in different traditions and in different places of the world,

31
0:01:43.578,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as if they were hearing and obeying voices

32
0:01:47.134,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that they perceived as coming from the Gods,

33
0:01:50.198,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or from the muses ...

34
0:01:52.063,000 --> 0:01:54,000
what today we would call hallucinations.

35
0:01:55.888,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And only then, as time went on,

36
0:01:58.538,000 --> 0:02:01,000
they began to recognize that they were the creators,

37
0:02:02.213,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the owners of these inner voices.

38
0:02:05.316,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And with this, they gained introspection:

39
0:02:08.055,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the ability to think about their own thoughts.

40
0:02:11.785,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness,

41
0:02:15.206,000 --> 0:02:18,000
at least in the way we perceive it today,

42
0:02:18.396,000 --> 0:02:21,000
where we feel that we are the pilots of our own existence --

43
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is a quite recent cultural development.

44
0:02:25.456,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And this theory is quite spectacular,

45
0:02:27.266,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but it has an obvious problem

46
0:02:28.723,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which is that it's built on just a few and very specific examples.

47
0:02:33.085,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So the question is whether the theory

48
0:02:34.872,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that introspection built up in human history only about 3,000 years ago

49
0:02:39.647,000 --> 0:02:41,000
can be examined in a quantitative and objective manner.

50
0:02:43.543,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the problem of how to go about this is quite obvious.

51
0:02:47.13,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's not like Plato woke up one day and then he wrote,

52
0:02:50.614,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"Hello, I'm Plato,

53
0:02:52.297,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and as of today, I have a fully introspective consciousness."

54
0:02:55.21,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:57.527,000 --> 0:03:,000
And this tells us actually what is the essence of the problem.

56
0:03:01.467,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We need to find the emergence of a concept that's never said.

57
0:03:06.434,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The word introspection does not appear a single time

58
0:03:10.768,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in the books we want to analyze.

59
0:03:13.728,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So our way to solve this is to build the space of words.

60
0:03:18.571,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is a huge space that contains all words

61
0:03:21.882,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in such a way that the distance between any two of them

62
0:03:24.708,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is indicative of how closely related they are.

63
0:03:28.46,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So for instance,

64
0:03:29.635,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you want the words "dog" and "cat" to be very close together,

65
0:03:32.556,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but the words "grapefruit" and "logarithm" to be very far away.

66
0:03:36.809,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And this has to be true for any two words within the space.

67
0:03:41.626,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And there are different ways that we can construct the space of words.

68
0:03:44.991,000 --> 0:03:45,000
One is just asking the experts,

69
0:03:46.658,000 --> 0:03:47,000
a bit like we do with dictionaries.

70
0:03:48.896,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Another possibility

71
0:03:50.348,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is following the simple assumption that when two words are related,

72
0:03:54.087,000 --> 0:03:56,000
they tend to appear in the same sentences,

73
0:03:56.46,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in the same paragraphs,

74
0:03:57.937,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in the same documents,

75
0:03:59.731,000 --> 0:04:02,000
more often than would be expected just by pure chance.

76
0:04:04.231,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And this simple hypothesis,

77
0:04:06.305,000 --> 0:04:07,000
this simple method,

78
0:04:07.635,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with some computational tricks

79
0:04:09.266,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that have to do with the fact

80
0:04:10.679,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that this is a very complex and high-dimensional space,

81
0:04:13.767,000 --> 0:04:14,000
turns out to be quite effective.

82
0:04:16.155,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And just to give you a flavor of how well this works,

83
0:04:18.981,000 --> 0:04:21,000
this is the result we get when we analyze this for some familiar words.

84
0:04:23.607,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And you can see first

85
0:04:24.816,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that words automatically organize into semantic neighborhoods.

86
0:04:28.118,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So you get the fruits, the body parts,

87
0:04:30.359,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the computer parts, the scientific terms and so on.

88
0:04:33.119,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The algorithm also identifies that we organize concepts in a hierarchy.

89
0:04:37.852,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So for instance,

90
0:04:39.027,000 --> 0:04:42,000
you can see that the scientific terms break down into two subcategories

91
0:04:42.648,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of the astronomic and the physics terms.

92
0:04:45.338,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And then there are very fine things.

93
0:04:47.608,000 --> 0:04:48,000
For instance, the word astronomy,

94
0:04:49.537,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which seems a bit bizarre where it is,

95
0:04:51.376,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is actually exactly where it should be,

96
0:04:53.448,000 --> 0:04:54,000
between what it is,

97
0:04:55.067,000 --> 0:04:56,000
an actual science,

98
0:04:56.361,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and between what it describes,

99
0:04:57.921,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the astronomical terms.

100
0:05:00.182,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And we could go on and on with this.

101
0:05:02.097,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Actually, if you stare at this for a while,

102
0:05:04.181,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and you just build random trajectories,

103
0:05:06.063,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you will see that it actually feels a bit like doing poetry.

104
0:05:10.018,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And this is because, in a way,

105
0:05:11.924,000 --> 0:05:13,000
walking in this space is like walking in the mind.

106
0:05:16.027,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And the last thing

107
0:05:17.668,000 --> 0:05:21,000
is that this algorithm also identifies what are our intuitions,

108
0:05:21.732,000 --> 0:05:24,000
of which words should lead in the neighborhood of introspection.

109
0:05:25.652,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So for instance,

110
0:05:26.899,000 --> 0:05:29,000
words such as "self," "guilt," "reason," "emotion,"

111
0:05:30.902,000 --> 0:05:31,000
are very close to "introspection,"

112
0:05:32.815,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but other words,

113
0:05:33.99,000 --> 0:05:35,000
such as "red," "football," "candle," "banana,"

114
0:05:36.181,000 --> 0:05:37,000
are just very far away.

115
0:05:38.054,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And so once we've built the space,

116
0:05:40.84,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the question of the history of introspection,

117
0:05:43.69,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or of the history of any concept

118
0:05:46.047,000 --> 0:05:5,000
which before could seem abstract and somehow vague,

119
0:05:50.85,000 --> 0:05:51,000
becomes concrete --

120
0:05:52.478,000 --> 0:05:54,000
becomes amenable to quantitative science.

121
0:05:56.216,000 --> 0:05:58,000
All that we have to do is take the books,

122
0:05:59.002,000 --> 0:06:,000
we digitize them,

123
0:06:00.407,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and we take this stream of words as a trajectory

124
0:06:03.24,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and project them into the space,

125
0:06:05.233,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and then we ask whether this trajectory spends significant time

126
0:06:09.011,000 --> 0:06:11,000
circling closely to the concept of introspection.

127
0:06:12.76,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And with this,

128
0:06:13.98,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we could analyze the history of introspection

129
0:06:16.116,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in the ancient Greek tradition,

130
0:06:18.061,000 --> 0:06:2,000
for which we have the best available written record.

131
0:06:21.631,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So what we did is we took all the books --

132
0:06:23.91,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we just ordered them by time --

133
0:06:26.218,000 --> 0:06:27,000
for each book we take the words

134
0:06:27.994,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and we project them to the space,

135
0:06:29.979,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and then we ask for each word how close it is to introspection,

136
0:06:33.035,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and we just average that.

137
0:06:34.59,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And then we ask whether, as time goes on and on,

138
0:06:37.812,000 --> 0:06:4,000
these books get closer, and closer and closer

139
0:06:41.088,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to the concept of introspection.

140
0:06:42.866,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And this is exactly what happens in the ancient Greek tradition.

141
0:06:47.698,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So you can see that for the oldest books in the Homeric tradition,

142
0:06:50.849,000 --> 0:06:53,000
there is a small increase with books getting closer to introspection.

143
0:06:54.285,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But about four centuries before Christ,

144
0:06:56.515,000 --> 0:07:,000
this starts ramping up very rapidly to an almost five-fold increase

145
0:07:01.247,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of books getting closer, and closer and closer

146
0:07:03.771,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to the concept of introspection.

147
0:07:06.159,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And one of the nice things about this

148
0:07:08.607,000 --> 0:07:09,000
is that now we can ask

149
0:07:09.829,000 --> 0:07:13,000
whether this is also true in a different, independent tradition.

150
0:07:14.962,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we just ran this same analysis on the Judeo-Christian tradition,

151
0:07:18.162,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and we got virtually the same pattern.

152
0:07:21.548,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Again, you see a small increase for the oldest books in the Old Testament,

153
0:07:26.207,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and then it increases much more rapidly

154
0:07:28.145,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in the new books of the New Testament.

155
0:07:30.008,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And then we get the peak of introspection

156
0:07:32.064,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in "The Confessions of Saint Augustine,"

157
0:07:34.215,000 --> 0:07:35,000
about four centuries after Christ.

158
0:07:36.897,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And this was very important,

159
0:07:38.865,000 --> 0:07:41,000
because Saint Augustine had been recognized by scholars,

160
0:07:42.262,000 --> 0:07:44,000
philologists, historians,

161
0:07:44.458,000 --> 0:07:46,000
as one of the founders of introspection.

162
0:07:47.06,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Actually, some believe him to be the father of modern psychology.

163
0:07:51.012,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So our algorithm,

164
0:07:52.875,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which has the virtue of being quantitative,

165
0:07:55.741,000 --> 0:07:56,000
of being objective,

166
0:07:57.028,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and of course of being extremely fast --

167
0:07:59.068,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it just runs in a fraction of a second --

168
0:08:01.489,000 --> 0:08:04,000
can capture some of the most important conclusions

169
0:08:05.016,000 --> 0:08:07,000
of this long tradition of investigation.

170
0:08:08.317,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And this is in a way one of the beauties of science,

171
0:08:11.992,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which is that now this idea can be translated

172
0:08:15.492,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and generalized to a whole lot of different domains.

173
0:08:18.769,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So in the same way that we asked about the past of human consciousness,

174
0:08:23.56,000 --> 0:08:26,000
maybe the most challenging question we can pose to ourselves

175
0:08:26.99,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is whether this can tell us something about the future of our own consciousness.

176
0:08:31.55,000 --> 0:08:32,000
To put it more precisely,

177
0:08:33.044,000 --> 0:08:35,000
whether the words we say today

178
0:08:35.484,000 --> 0:08:4,000
can tell us something of where our minds will be in a few days,

179
0:08:40.705,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in a few months

180
0:08:41.88,000 --> 0:08:42,000
or a few years from now.

181
0:08:43.597,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And in the same way many of us are now wearing sensors

182
0:08:46.641,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that detect our heart rate,

183
0:08:48.451,000 --> 0:08:49,000
our respiration,

184
0:08:49.744,000 --> 0:08:5,000
our genes,

185
0:08:51.435,000 --> 0:08:54,000
on the hopes that this may help us prevent diseases,

186
0:08:55.11,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we can ask whether monitoring and analyzing the words we speak,

187
0:08:58.655,000 --> 0:09:,000
we tweet, we email, we write,

188
0:09:01.362,000 --> 0:09:05,000
can tell us ahead of time whether something may go wrong with our minds.

189
0:09:07.087,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And with Guillermo Cecchi,

190
0:09:08.645,000 --> 0:09:11,000
who has been my brother in this adventure,

191
0:09:11.67,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we took on this task.

192
0:09:14.228,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And we did so by analyzing the recorded speech of 34 young people

193
0:09:19.784,000 --> 0:09:21,000
who were at a high risk of developing schizophrenia.

194
0:09:23.434,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And so what we did is, we measured speech at day one,

195
0:09:26.339,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and then we asked whether the properties of the speech could predict,

196
0:09:29.605,000 --> 0:09:31,000
within a window of almost three years,

197
0:09:32.125,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the future development of psychosis.

198
0:09:35.427,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But despite our hopes,

199
0:09:37.817,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we got failure after failure.

200
0:09:41.793,000 --> 0:09:44,000
There was just not enough information in semantics

201
0:09:45.699,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to predict the future organization of the mind.

202
0:09:48.516,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It was good enough

203
0:09:50.349,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to distinguish between a group of schizophrenics and a control group,

204
0:09:54.548,000 --> 0:09:56,000
a bit like we had done for the ancient texts,

205
0:09:57.284,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but not to predict the future onset of psychosis.

206
0:10:01.164,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But then we realized

207
0:10:02.894,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that maybe the most important thing was not so much what they were saying,

208
0:10:07.006,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but how they were saying it.

209
0:10:09.679,000 --> 0:10:1,000
More specifically,

210
0:10:10.923,000 --> 0:10:12,000
it was not in which semantic neighborhoods the words were,

211
0:10:13.774,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but how far and fast they jumped

212
0:10:16.398,000 --> 0:10:18,000
from one semantic neighborhood to the other one.

213
0:10:19.247,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And so we came up with this measure,

214
0:10:21.002,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which we termed semantic coherence,

215
0:10:23.415,000 --> 0:10:27,000
which essentially measures the persistence of speech within one semantic topic,

216
0:10:28.243,000 --> 0:10:29,000
within one semantic category.

217
0:10:31.294,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And it turned out to be that for this group of 34 people,

218
0:10:35.365,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the algorithm based on semantic coherence could predict,

219
0:10:39.048,000 --> 0:10:41,000
with 100 percent accuracy,

220
0:10:41.572,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who developed psychosis and who will not.

221
0:10:44.976,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And this was something that could not be achieved --

222
0:10:47.937,000 --> 0:10:48,000
not even close --

223
0:10:49.469,000 --> 0:10:52,000
with all the other existing clinical measures.

224
0:10:54.525,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I remember vividly, while I was working on this,

225
0:10:58.128,000 --> 0:11:,000
I was sitting at my computer

226
0:11:00.469,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo --

227
0:11:03.128,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Polo had been my first student back in Buenos Aires,

228
0:11:06.319,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and at the time he was living in New York.

229
0:11:08.413,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And there was something in this tweets --

230
0:11:10.525,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I could not tell exactly what because nothing was said explicitly --

231
0:11:14.05,000 --> 0:11:16,000
but I got this strong hunch,

232
0:11:16.095,000 --> 0:11:18,000
this strong intuition, that something was going wrong.

233
0:11:20.347,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I picked up the phone, and I called Polo,

234
0:11:23.094,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and in fact he was not feeling well.

235
0:11:25.362,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And this simple fact,

236
0:11:27.323,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that reading in between the lines,

237
0:11:29.838,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I could sense, through words, his feelings,

238
0:11:34.124,000 --> 0:11:36,000
was a simple, but very effective way to help.

239
0:11:37.987,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What I tell you today

240
0:11:39.649,000 --> 0:11:41,000
is that we're getting close to understanding

241
0:11:42.181,000 --> 0:11:46,000
how we can convert this intuition that we all have,

242
0:11:46.491,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that we all share,

243
0:11:47.88,000 --> 0:11:48,000
into an algorithm.

244
0:11:50.102,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And in doing so,

245
0:11:51.587,000 --> 0:11:55,000
we may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health,

246
0:11:56.261,000 --> 0:12:01,000
based on objective, quantitative and automated analysis

247
0:12:01.906,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of the words we write,

248
0:12:03.639,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of the words we say.

249
0:12:05.2,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Gracias.

250
0:12:06.375,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.914,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As a little girl, I always imagined

2
0:00:15.211,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I would one day run away.

3
0:00:17.546,000 --> 0:00:18,000
From the age of six on,

4
0:00:19.01,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I kept a packed bag with some clothes

5
0:00:21.462,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and cans of food tucked away

6
0:00:22.988,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in the back of a closet.

7
0:00:24.982,000 --> 0:00:26,000
There was a deep restlessness in me,

8
0:00:27.604,000 --> 0:00:29,000
a primal fear that I would fall prey

9
0:00:30.15,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to a life of routine and boredom.

10
0:00:32.925,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And so, many of my early memories involved

11
0:00:35.534,000 --> 0:00:38,000
intricate daydreams where I would walk across borders,

12
0:00:39.1,000 --> 0:00:4,000
forage for berries,

13
0:00:40.468,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and meet all kinds of strange people

14
0:00:42.532,000 --> 0:00:45,000
living unconventional lives on the road.

15
0:00:45.576,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Years have passed, but many of the adventures

16
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I fantasized about as a child --

17
0:00:50.927,000 --> 0:00:51,000
traveling and weaving my way

18
0:00:52.524,000 --> 0:00:54,000
between worlds other than my own —

19
0:00:54.524,000 --> 0:00:55,000
have become realities through my work

20
0:00:56.124,000 --> 0:00:58,000
as a documentary photographer.

21
0:00:58.685,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But no other experience has felt as true

22
0:01:01.82,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to my childhood dreams

23
0:01:03.74,000 --> 0:01:05,000
as living amongst and documenting the lives

24
0:01:06.458,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of fellow wanderers across the United States.

25
0:01:11.15,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is the nomadic dream,

26
0:01:13.91,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a different kind of American dream

27
0:01:15.82,000 --> 0:01:17,000
lived by young hobos, travelers,

28
0:01:18.464,000 --> 0:01:21,000
hitchhikers, vagrants and tramps.

29
0:01:21.848,000 --> 0:01:22,000
In most of our minds,

30
0:01:23.197,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the vagabond is a creature from the past.

31
0:01:26.288,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The word "hobo" conjures up an old

32
0:01:28.591,000 --> 0:01:29,000
black and white image

33
0:01:30.028,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of a weathered old man covered in coal,

34
0:01:32.534,000 --> 0:01:34,000
legs dangling out of a boxcar,

35
0:01:34.935,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but these photographs are in color,

36
0:01:37.047,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and they portray a community

37
0:01:38.83,000 --> 0:01:39,000
swirling across the country,

38
0:01:40.552,000 --> 0:01:42,000
fiercely alive and creatively free,

39
0:01:43.377,000 --> 0:01:45,000
seeing sides of America that no one else

40
0:01:45.876,000 --> 0:01:47,000
gets to see.

41
0:01:48.066,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Like their predecessors, today's nomads

42
0:01:50.756,000 --> 0:01:52,000
travel the steel and asphalt arteries

43
0:01:53.423,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of the United States.

44
0:01:55.112,000 --> 0:01:58,000
By day, they hop freight trains, stick out their thumbs,

45
0:01:58.3,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and ride the highways with anyone

46
0:02:00.154,000 --> 0:02:03,000
from truckers to soccer moms.

47
0:02:03.17,000 --> 0:02:05,000
By night, they sleep beneath the stars,

48
0:02:05.496,000 --> 0:02:07,000
huddled together with their packs of dogs,

49
0:02:08.178,000 --> 0:02:11,000
cats and pet rats between their bodies.

50
0:02:11.886,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Some travelers take to the road by choice,

51
0:02:14.514,000 --> 0:02:16,000
renouncing materialism, traditional jobs

52
0:02:17.1,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and university degrees in exchange for a glimmer of adventure.

53
0:02:21.034,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Others come from the underbelly of society,

54
0:02:24.284,000 --> 0:02:27,000
never given a chance to mobilize upwards:

55
0:02:27.324,000 --> 0:02:3,000
foster care dropouts, teenage runaways escaping

56
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:33,000
abuse and unforgiving homes.

57
0:02:33.844,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Where others see stories of privation

58
0:02:36.754,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and economic failure,

59
0:02:38.834,000 --> 0:02:39,000
travelers view their own existence

60
0:02:40.694,000 --> 0:02:43,000
through the prism of liberation and freedom.

61
0:02:44.267,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They'd rather live off of the excess

62
0:02:46.482,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of what they view as a wasteful consumer society

63
0:02:49.432,000 --> 0:02:51,000
than slave away at an unrealistic chance

64
0:02:52.233,000 --> 0:02:54,000
at the traditional American dream.

65
0:02:54.912,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They take advantage of the fact

66
0:02:57.001,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that in the United States,

67
0:02:58.549,000 --> 0:03:01,000
up to 40 percent of all food ends up in the garbage

68
0:03:02.37,000 --> 0:03:04,000
by scavenging for perfectly good produce

69
0:03:05.003,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in dumpsters and trash cans.

70
0:03:07.677,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They sacrifice material comforts in exchange

71
0:03:10.046,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for the space and the time to explore

72
0:03:12.769,000 --> 0:03:13,000
a creative interior,

73
0:03:14.491,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to dream, to read, to work on music, art and writing.

74
0:03:19.373,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But there are many aspects to this life

75
0:03:21.881,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that are far from idyllic.

76
0:03:24.244,000 --> 0:03:26,000
No one loses their inner demons

77
0:03:26.367,000 --> 0:03:27,000
by taking to the road.

78
0:03:28.076,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Addiction is real, the elements are real,

79
0:03:31.238,000 --> 0:03:33,000
freight trains maim and kill,

80
0:03:33.45,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and anyone who has lived on the streets can attest

81
0:03:36.11,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to the exhaustive list of laws

82
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that criminalize homeless existence.

83
0:03:42.106,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Who here knows that in many cities

84
0:03:43.936,000 --> 0:03:45,000
across the United States it is now illegal

85
0:03:46.586,000 --> 0:03:48,000
to sit on the sidewalk,

86
0:03:48.619,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to wrap oneself in a blanket,

87
0:03:52.006,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to sleep in your own car,

88
0:03:54.741,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to offer food to a stranger?

89
0:03:58.1,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I know about these laws because I've watched

90
0:03:59.872,000 --> 0:04:,000
as friends and other travelers

91
0:04:01.664,000 --> 0:04:03,000
were hauled off to jail or received citations

92
0:04:04.334,000 --> 0:04:07,000
for committing these so-called crimes.

93
0:04:07.922,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Many of you might be wondering why anyone

94
0:04:10.083,000 --> 0:04:11,000
would choose a life like this,

95
0:04:11.794,000 --> 0:04:13,000
under the thumb of discriminatory laws,

96
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
eating out of trash cans,

97
0:04:15.478,000 --> 0:04:16,000
sleeping under bridges,

98
0:04:17.267,000 --> 0:04:2,000
picking up seasonal jobs here and there.

99
0:04:20.518,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The answer to such a question is as varied

100
0:04:23.032,000 --> 0:04:25,000
as the people that take to the road,

101
0:04:25.568,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but travelers often respond with a single word:

102
0:04:28.95,000 --> 0:04:3,000
freedom.

103
0:04:31.281,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Until we live in a society where every human

104
0:04:34.794,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is assured dignity in their labor

105
0:04:36.863,000 --> 0:04:37,000
so that they can work to live well,

106
0:04:38.738,000 --> 0:04:4,000
not only work to survive,

107
0:04:40.845,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there will always be an element of those

108
0:04:42.762,000 --> 0:04:45,000
who seek the open road as a means of escape,

109
0:04:45.894,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of liberation and, of course, of rebellion.

110
0:04:50.952,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Thank you.

111
0:04:52.968,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.595,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Theater matters because democracy matters.

2
0:00:17.653,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Theater is the essential art form of democracy,

3
0:00:21.596,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and we know this because they were born in the same city.

4
0:00:26.245,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In the late 6th century BC,

5
0:00:28.356,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the idea of Western democracy was born.

6
0:00:30.239,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It was, of course,

7
0:00:31.772,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a very partial and flawed democracy,

8
0:00:34.258,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but the idea that power should stem from the consent of the governed,

9
0:00:39.237,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that power should flow from below to above,

10
0:00:42.689,000 --> 0:00:43,000
not the other way around,

11
0:00:44.324,000 --> 0:00:45,000
was born in that decade.

12
0:00:45.908,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And in that same decade, somebody -- legend has it, somebody named Thespis --

13
0:00:51.116,000 --> 0:00:53,000
invented the idea of dialogue.

14
0:00:53.284,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What does that mean, to invent dialogue?

15
0:00:55.214,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Well, we know that the Festival of Dionysus gathered

16
0:00:57.864,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the entire citizenry of Athens

17
0:00:59.422,000 --> 0:01:,000
on the side of the Acropolis,

18
0:01:01.154,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and they would listen to music, they would watch dancing,

19
0:01:04.477,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and they would have stories told as part of the Festival of Dionysus.

20
0:01:08.314,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And storytelling is much like what's happening right now:

21
0:01:11.033,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I'm standing up here,

22
0:01:12.612,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the unitary authority,

23
0:01:14.657,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I am talking to you.

24
0:01:16.239,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And you are sitting back, and you are receiving what I have to say.

25
0:01:19.653,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And you may disagree with it, you may think I'm an insufferable fool,

26
0:01:23.111,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you may be bored to death,

27
0:01:24.743,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own head.

28
0:01:28.577,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But what happens if, instead of me talking to you --

29
0:01:32.701,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and Thespis thought of this --

30
0:01:34.705,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I just shift 90 degrees to the left,

31
0:01:37.48,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I talk to another person onstage with me?

32
0:01:41.09,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Everything changes,

33
0:01:43.35,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because at that moment, I'm not the possessor of truth;

34
0:01:47.299,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm a guy with an opinion.

35
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I'm talking to somebody else.

36
0:01:51.88,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And you know what?

37
0:01:53.055,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That other person has an opinion too,

38
0:01:55.532,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and it's drama, remember, conflict -- they disagree with me.

39
0:01:59.522,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There's a conflict between two points of view.

40
0:02:02.491,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And the thesis of that is that the truth can only emerge

41
0:02:08.811,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in the conflict of different points of view.

42
0:02:11.107,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's not the possession of any one person.

43
0:02:13.865,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And if you believe in democracy, you have to believe that.

44
0:02:18.136,000 --> 0:02:2,000
If you don't believe that, you're an autocrat

45
0:02:20.6,000 --> 0:02:21,000
who is putting up with democracy.

46
0:02:22.778,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But that's the basic thesis of democracy,

47
0:02:25.322,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that the conflict of different points of views leads to the truth.

48
0:02:28.475,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What's the other thing that's happening?

49
0:02:30.458,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I'm not asking you to sit back and listen to me.

50
0:02:33.125,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm asking you to lean forward

51
0:02:35.4,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and imagine my point of view --

52
0:02:38.506,000 --> 0:02:41,000
what this looks like and feels like to me as a character.

53
0:02:42.129,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And then I'm asking you to switch your mind

54
0:02:45.085,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and imagine what it feels like to the other person talking.

55
0:02:49.002,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I'm asking you to exercise empathy.

56
0:02:52.671,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And the idea that truth comes from the collision of different ideas

57
0:02:56.539,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the emotional muscle of empathy

58
0:02:59.456,000 --> 0:03:02,000
are the necessary tools for democratic citizenship.

59
0:03:03.722,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What else happens?

60
0:03:05.729,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The third thing really is you,

61
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is the community itself, is the audience.

62
0:03:11.322,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And you know from personal experience that when you go to the movies,

63
0:03:15.335,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you walk into a movie theater, and if it's empty, you're delighted,

64
0:03:18.607,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because nothing's going to be between you and the movie.

65
0:03:21.289,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You can spread out, put your legs over the top of the stadium seats,

66
0:03:24.525,000 --> 0:03:25,000
eat your popcorn and just enjoy it.

67
0:03:26.257,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But if you walk into a live theater

68
0:03:28.183,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and you see that the theater is half full,

69
0:03:30.65,000 --> 0:03:31,000
your heart sinks.

70
0:03:32.42,000 --> 0:03:34,000
You're disappointed immediately,

71
0:03:34.501,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because whether you knew it or not,

72
0:03:36.524,000 --> 0:03:37,000
you were coming to that theater

73
0:03:38.444,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to be part of an audience.

74
0:03:40.323,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You were coming to have the collective experience

75
0:03:43.256,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of laughing together, crying together, holding your breath together

76
0:03:46.851,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to see what's going to happen next.

77
0:03:48.6,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You may have walked into that theater as an individual consumer,

78
0:03:53.107,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but if the theater does its job,

79
0:03:55.758,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you've walked out with a sense of yourself as part of a whole,

80
0:03:59.465,000 --> 0:04:,000
as part of a community.

81
0:04:01.643,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That's built into the DNA of my art form.

82
0:04:06.678,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Twenty-five hundred years later, Joe Papp decided

83
0:04:11.244,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that the culture should belong to everybody in the United States of America,

84
0:04:15.227,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and that it was his job to try to deliver on that promise.

85
0:04:19.047,000 --> 0:04:21,000
He created Free Shakespeare in the Park.

86
0:04:21.949,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And Free Shakespeare in the Park is based on a very simple idea,

87
0:04:25.069,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the idea that the best theater, the best art that we can produce,

88
0:04:29.663,000 --> 0:04:31,000
should go to everybody and belong to everybody,

89
0:04:32.497,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and to this day,

90
0:04:34.262,000 --> 0:04:36,000
every summer night in Central Park,

91
0:04:36.675,000 --> 0:04:38,000
2,000 people are lining up

92
0:04:39.076,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to see the best theater we can provide for free.

93
0:04:42.724,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's not a commercial transaction.

94
0:04:45.59,000 --> 0:04:49,000
In 1967, 13 years after he figured that out,

95
0:04:50.085,000 --> 0:04:51,000
he figured out something else,

96
0:04:51.756,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which is that the democratic circle was not complete

97
0:04:55.337,000 --> 0:04:58,000
by just giving the people the classics.

98
0:04:58.588,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We had to actually let the people create their own classics

99
0:05:02.149,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and take the stage.

100
0:05:03.988,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And so in 1967,

101
0:05:06.069,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Joe opened the Public Theater downtown on Astor Place,

102
0:05:09.152,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the first show he ever produced was the world premiere of "Hair."

103
0:05:13.394,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That's the first thing he ever did that wasn't Shakespeare.

104
0:05:16.206,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Clive Barnes in The Times said that it was as if Mr. Papp took a broom

105
0:05:19.541,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and swept up all the refuse from the East Village streets

106
0:05:22.827,000 --> 0:05:24,000
onto the stage at the Public.

107
0:05:25.19,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:26.218,000 --> 0:05:27,000
He didn't mean it complimentarily,

109
0:05:28.019,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but Joe put it up in the lobby, he was so proud of it.

110
0:05:31.574,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

111
0:05:33.074,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And what the Public Theater did over the next years with amazing shows like

112
0:05:37.518,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf,"

113
0:05:41.066,000 --> 0:05:43,000
"A Chorus Line,"

114
0:05:43.858,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and -- here's the most extraordinary example I can think of:

115
0:05:47.914,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Larry Kramer's savage cry of rage about the AIDS crisis,

116
0:05:53.192,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"The Normal Heart."

117
0:05:54.88,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Because when Joe produced that play in 1985,

118
0:05:58.953,000 --> 0:06:01,000
there was more information about AIDS

119
0:06:02.019,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in Frank Rich's review in the New York Times

120
0:06:05.234,000 --> 0:06:08,000
than the New York Times had published in the previous four years.

121
0:06:08.684,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Larry was actually changing the dialogue about AIDS

122
0:06:13.108,000 --> 0:06:14,000
through writing this play,

123
0:06:14.519,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and Joe was by producing it.

124
0:06:15.946,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I was blessed to commission and work on Tony Kushner's "Angels in America,"

125
0:06:20.415,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and when doing that play and along with "Normal Heart,"

126
0:06:24.087,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we could see that the culture was actually shifting,

127
0:06:27.459,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and it wasn't caused by the theater,

128
0:06:29.512,000 --> 0:06:31,000
but the theater was doing its part

129
0:06:31.991,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to change what it meant to be gay in the United States.

130
0:06:36.29,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And I'm incredibly proud of that.

131
0:06:38.605,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Applause)

132
0:06:40.522,000 --> 0:06:44,000
When I took over Joe's old job at the Public in 2005,

133
0:06:45.342,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I realized one of the problems we had was a victim of our own success,

134
0:06:49.101,000 --> 0:06:54,000
which is: Shakespeare in the Park had been founded as a program for access,

135
0:06:54.15,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and it was now the hardest ticket to get in New York City.

136
0:06:57.725,000 --> 0:07:,000
People slept out for two nights to get those tickets.

137
0:07:01.664,000 --> 0:07:02,000
What was that doing?

138
0:07:02.845,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That was eliminating 98 percent of the population

139
0:07:05.462,000 --> 0:07:06,000
from even considering going to it.

140
0:07:07.315,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So we refounded the mobile unit

141
0:07:09.569,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and took Shakespeare to prisons, to homeless shelters,

142
0:07:12.672,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to community centers in all five boroughs

143
0:07:15.184,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and even in New Jersey and Westchester County.

144
0:07:17.899,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And that program proved something to us that we knew intuitively:

145
0:07:22.127,000 --> 0:07:26,000
people's need for theater is as powerful as their desire for food

146
0:07:26.891,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or for drink.

147
0:07:28.56,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's been an extraordinary success, and we've continued it.

148
0:07:31.427,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And then there was yet another barrier that we realized we weren't crossing,

149
0:07:35.14,000 --> 0:07:37,000
which is a barrier of participation.

150
0:07:37.428,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And the idea, we said, is:

151
0:07:38.75,000 --> 0:07:42,000
How can we turn theater from being a commodity, an object,

152
0:07:43.293,000 --> 0:07:45,000
back into what it really is --

153
0:07:45.559,000 --> 0:07:47,000
a set of relationships among people?

154
0:07:48.122,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And under the guidance of the amazing Lear deBessonet,

155
0:07:51.038,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we started the Public Works program,

156
0:07:52.94,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which now every summer produces

157
0:07:54.856,000 --> 0:07:56,000
these immense Shakespearean musical pageants,

158
0:07:57.722,000 --> 0:07:59,000
where Tony Award-winning actors and musicians

159
0:08:00.51,000 --> 0:08:03,000
are side by side with nannies and domestic workers

160
0:08:04.38,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and military veterans and recently incarcerated prisoners,

161
0:08:08.278,000 --> 0:08:09,000
amateurs and professionals,

162
0:08:09.897,000 --> 0:08:11,000
performing together on the same stage.

163
0:08:12.355,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And it's not just a great social program,

164
0:08:14.376,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it's the best art that we do.

165
0:08:16.825,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And the thesis of it is that artistry is not something

166
0:08:20.978,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that is the possession of a few.

167
0:08:23.093,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Artistry is inherent in being a human being.

168
0:08:26.485,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Some of us just get to spend a lot more of our lives practicing it.

169
0:08:31.252,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And then occasionally --

170
0:08:32.427,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Applause)

171
0:08:34.349,000 --> 0:08:36,000
you get a miracle like "Hamilton,"

172
0:08:36.476,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Lin-Manuel's extraordinary retelling of the foundational story of this country

173
0:08:42.62,000 --> 0:08:46,000
through the eyes of the only Founding Father who was a bastard immigrant orphan

174
0:08:47.45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
from the West Indies.

175
0:08:49.03,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And what Lin was doing

176
0:08:50.792,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is exactly what Shakespeare was doing.

177
0:08:53.645,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He was taking the voice of the people, the language of the people,

178
0:08:57.878,000 --> 0:08:59,000
elevating it into verse,

179
0:09:00.159,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and by doing so,

180
0:09:01.747,000 --> 0:09:02,000
ennobling the language

181
0:09:03.572,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and ennobling the people who spoke the language.

182
0:09:06.933,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And by casting that show entirely with a cast of black and brown people,

183
0:09:11.741,000 --> 0:09:13,000
what Lin was saying to us,

184
0:09:14.228,000 --> 0:09:16,000
he was reviving in us

185
0:09:16.856,000 --> 0:09:19,000
our greatest aspirations for the United States,

186
0:09:20.475,000 --> 0:09:22,000
our better angels of America,

187
0:09:22.85,000 --> 0:09:24,000
our sense of what this country could be,

188
0:09:25.279,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the inclusion that was at the heart of the American Dream.

189
0:09:29.442,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And it unleashed a wave of patriotism in me

190
0:09:33.692,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and in our audience,

191
0:09:35.038,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the appetite for which is proving to be insatiable.

192
0:09:40.132,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But there was another side to that, and it's where I want to end,

193
0:09:43.249,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and it's the last story I want to talk about.

194
0:09:45.444,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Some of you may have heard that Vice President-elect Pence

195
0:09:48.24,000 --> 0:09:5,000
came to see "Hamilton" in New York.

196
0:09:50.986,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And when he came in, some of my fellow New Yorkers booed him.

197
0:09:55.064,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And beautifully, he said,

198
0:09:56.923,000 --> 0:09:58,000
"That's what freedom sounds like."

199
0:09:59.799,000 --> 0:10:,000
And at the end of the show,

200
0:10:01.195,000 --> 0:10:04,000
we read what I feel was a very respectful statement from the stage,

201
0:10:04.412,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and Vice President-elect Pence listened to it,

202
0:10:07.79,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but it sparked a certain amount of outrage, a tweetstorm,

203
0:10:11.719,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and also an internet boycott of "Hamilton"

204
0:10:15.317,000 --> 0:10:19,000
from outraged people who had felt we had treated him with disrespect.

205
0:10:20.142,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I looked at that boycott and I said, we're getting something wrong here.

206
0:10:24.091,000 --> 0:10:27,000
All of these people who have signed this boycott petition,

207
0:10:27.434,000 --> 0:10:29,000
they were never going to see "Hamilton" anyway.

208
0:10:30.052,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It was never going to come to a city near them.

209
0:10:32.661,000 --> 0:10:34,000
If it could come, they couldn't afford a ticket,

210
0:10:35.244,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and if they could afford a ticket, they didn't have the connections

211
0:10:38.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to get that ticket.

212
0:10:40.691,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They weren't boycotting us;

213
0:10:43.066,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we had boycotted them.

214
0:10:46.187,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And if you look at the red and blue electoral map of the United States,

215
0:10:50.507,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and if I were to tell you,

216
0:10:51.844,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"Oh, the blue is what designates

217
0:10:53.923,000 --> 0:10:55,000
all of the major nonprofit cultural institutions,"

218
0:10:56.903,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I'd be telling you the truth.

219
0:10:58.362,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You'd believe me.

220
0:10:59.592,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We in the culture have done exactly what the economy,

221
0:11:04.219,000 --> 0:11:07,000
what the educational system, what technology has done,

222
0:11:07.873,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which is turn our back on a large part of the country.

223
0:11:12.1,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So this idea of inclusion, it has to keep going.

224
0:11:15.134,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Next fall, we are sending out on tour

225
0:11:18.28,000 --> 0:11:23,000
a production of Lynn Nottage's brilliant, Pulitzer Prize-winning play "Sweat."

226
0:11:23.493,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Years of research in Redding, Pennsylvania led her to write this play

227
0:11:27.896,000 --> 0:11:3,000
about the deindustrialization of Pennsylvania:

228
0:11:31.145,000 --> 0:11:33,000
what happened when steel left,

229
0:11:33.817,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the rage that was unleashed,

230
0:11:36.101,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the tensions that were unleashed,

231
0:11:37.756,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the racism that was unleashed

232
0:11:40.04,000 --> 0:11:41,000
by the loss of jobs.

233
0:11:41.949,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We're taking that play and we're touring it

234
0:11:44.948,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to rural counties in Pennsylvania,

235
0:11:47.761,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Ohio, Michigan,

236
0:11:50.013,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Minnesota and Wisconsin.

237
0:11:52.364,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We're partnering with community organizations there to try and make sure

238
0:11:56.849,000 --> 0:11:59,000
not only that we reach the people that we're trying to reach,

239
0:12:00.799,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but that we find ways to listen to them back

240
0:12:03.701,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and say, "The culture is here for you, too."

241
0:12:07.962,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Because --

242
0:12:09.139,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Applause)

243
0:12:11.591,000 --> 0:12:13,000
we in the culture industry,

244
0:12:13.761,000 --> 0:12:15,000
we in the theater,

245
0:12:15.884,000 --> 0:12:18,000
have no right to say that we don't know what our job is.

246
0:12:19.52,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It's in the DNA of our art form.

247
0:12:21.57,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Our job "... is to hold up, as 'twere, a mirror to nature;

248
0:12:26.253,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to show scorn her image,

249
0:12:28.956,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to show virtue her appearance,

250
0:12:32.013,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and the very age its form and pressure."

251
0:12:35.301,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Our job is to try to hold up a vision to America

252
0:12:39.694,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that shows not only who all of us are individually,

253
0:12:43.781,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but that welds us back into the commonality that we need to be,

254
0:12:48.112,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the sense of unity,

255
0:12:49.946,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the sense of whole,

256
0:12:51.642,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the sense of who we are as a country.

257
0:12:54.398,000 --> 0:12:56,000
That's what the theater is supposed to do,

258
0:12:57.149,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and that's what we need to try to do as well as we can.

259
0:12:59.802,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you very much.

260
0:13:01.102,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Applause)

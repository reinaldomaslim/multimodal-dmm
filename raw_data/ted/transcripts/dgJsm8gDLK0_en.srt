1
0:00:12.984,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today, we are a country divided,

2
0:00:15.666,000 --> 0:00:16,000
or at least that's what we're told.

3
0:00:18.065,000 --> 0:00:23,000
We are torn apart by immigration, education, guns

4
0:00:23.217,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and health care.

5
0:00:25.038,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Health care is ugly and it is loud,

6
0:00:28.432,000 --> 0:00:32,000
so loud that it threatens to drown out everything else.

7
0:00:32.607,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Voice-over) Protesters: Health care is a human right! Fight, fight, fight!

8
0:00:36.211,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Protesters: Hey hey! Ho ho! Obamacare has got to go!

9
0:00:41.009,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Rebecca Onie: But what if underneath all the noise,

10
0:00:43.481,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we're not divided?

11
0:00:45.219,000 --> 0:00:47,000
What if the things that we don't ask about

12
0:00:47.9,000 --> 0:00:49,000
are the things that we most agree upon?

13
0:00:50.822,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It turns out that when we ask the right questions,

14
0:00:53.509,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the answers are startling,

15
0:00:56.002,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because we agree, not on health care, but on something more important:

16
0:01:01.997,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we agree on health.

17
0:01:04.627,000 --> 0:01:07,000
For 20 years, I've been obsessed with one question:

18
0:01:08.295,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What do we, what do all of us need in order to be healthy?

19
0:01:13.043,000 --> 0:01:15,000
As a college student in 1995,

20
0:01:15.117,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I spent months talking to physicians at a chaotic hospital in Boston,

21
0:01:19.882,000 --> 0:01:24,000
asking them, "What's the one thing your patients most need to be healthy?"

22
0:01:25.709,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They shared the same story again and again,

23
0:01:28.246,000 --> 0:01:31,000
one that I've heard hundreds of variations of since.

24
0:01:32.143,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They say, "Every day I see a patient with an asthma exacerbation,

25
0:01:35.48,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I prescribe a controller medication.

26
0:01:38.1,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But I know she is living in a mold-infested apartment.

27
0:01:41.86,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Or I see a kid with an ear infection, and I prescribe antibiotics,

28
0:01:46.18,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but I know there is no food at home.

29
0:01:48.702,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I don't ask about those issues, because there's nothing I can do."

30
0:01:53.586,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Now, it seemed that it shouldn't be so complicated

31
0:01:56.039,000 --> 0:02:,000
to design a doctor's visit around what people actually need to be healthy.

32
0:02:00.925,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So I created Health Leads,

33
0:02:02.295,000 --> 0:02:06,000
an organization enabling thousands of physicians and other caregivers

34
0:02:07.104,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to ask their patients,

35
0:02:08.89,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"What do you need to be healthy?"

36
0:02:10.838,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and then prescribe those things --

37
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
fruits and vegetables, heat in the winter,

38
0:02:16.57,000 --> 0:02:19,000
electricity to refrigerate their medication --

39
0:02:19.859,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we then navigated patients to those resources

40
0:02:23.242,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in their communities.

41
0:02:25.584,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The model works.

42
0:02:26.764,000 --> 0:02:3,000
A Mass General Hospital study found that navigating patients to essential resources

43
0:02:31.573,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is associated with improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol levels

44
0:02:36.024,000 --> 0:02:38,000
similar to introducing a new drug,

45
0:02:38.881,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but without all the side effects.

46
0:02:41.817,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So two decades later, what's changed?

47
0:02:45.084,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's now widely recognized that just 20 percent of health outcomes

48
0:02:49.093,000 --> 0:02:51,000
are tied to medical care,

49
0:02:51.117,000 --> 0:02:56,000
whereas up to 70 percent are tied to healthy behaviors

50
0:02:56.201,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and what's called the social determinants of health --

51
0:02:59.7,000 --> 0:03:03,000
basically, everything that happens to us for that vast majority of time

52
0:03:03.839,000 --> 0:03:05,000
when we're not in the doctor's office

53
0:03:05.866,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or the hospital.

54
0:03:08.509,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Health care executives now routinely remind us

55
0:03:10.939,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that our zip code matters more than our genetic code.

56
0:03:14.441,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And one health care publication even recently had the audacity

57
0:03:18.244,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to describe the social determinants of health

58
0:03:20.447,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as "the feel-good buzzword of the year."

59
0:03:23.785,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now, there's been some action, too.

60
0:03:25.5,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Over the past decade, six major health care providers and insurers

61
0:03:29.403,000 --> 0:03:31,000
have committed over 600 million dollars

62
0:03:32.053,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to affordable housing,

63
0:03:33.778,000 --> 0:03:36,000
recognizing that it reduces infant mortality

64
0:03:37.777,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and increases life expectancy.

65
0:03:41.055,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But let's be honest.

66
0:03:42.786,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Is our 3.5 trillion dollar health care system

67
0:03:47.296,000 --> 0:03:49,000
fundamentally designed to create health?

68
0:03:50.317,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Absolutely not.

69
0:03:52.468,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Take access to healthy food.

70
0:03:54.952,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Not long ago, a teenage boy shows up at a hospital in Baltimore,

71
0:03:59.14,000 --> 0:04:,000
losing weight.

72
0:04:00.683,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Just as his doctors are huddled up figuring out which metabolic panels

73
0:04:04.639,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and blood tests to run,

74
0:04:06.745,000 --> 0:04:08,000
one of my colleagues asks out loud,

75
0:04:09.108,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Do you think he might be hungry?"

76
0:04:12.314,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It turned out that this kid had been kicked out of his housing

77
0:04:15.257,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and literally hadn't had a meal in weeks.

78
0:04:18.9,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He said he was "... so relieved that somebody finally asked me."

79
0:04:24.269,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Somehow, we've created a health care system

80
0:04:26.766,000 --> 0:04:28,000
where asking a patient "Are you hungry?"

81
0:04:29.666,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is so far outside the bounds of what counts as health care

82
0:04:33.661,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that we mostly fail or forget to ask altogether;

83
0:04:37.708,000 --> 0:04:41,000
where doctors lament a hospital's "no third sandwich policy,"

84
0:04:42.59,000 --> 0:04:44,000
meaning that if you're a hungry patient in the ER,

85
0:04:45.484,000 --> 0:04:47,000
you can have only two free sandwiches,

86
0:04:48.319,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but as many MRIs as the doctor orders;

87
0:04:52.186,000 --> 0:04:55,000
where, in 2016 in the state of Texas,

88
0:04:55.323,000 --> 0:05:,000
they spent 1.2 billion dollars on the medical costs of malnutrition

89
0:05:00.806,000 --> 0:05:02,000
instead of on access to healthy food;

90
0:05:03.385,000 --> 0:05:06,000
where a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services program

91
0:05:07.124,000 --> 0:05:09,000
stratifies hungry patients,

92
0:05:09.571,000 --> 0:05:14,000
so that some get access to food and some get information about food,

93
0:05:14.82,000 --> 0:05:17,000
with the justification that doing nothing for hungry patients

94
0:05:17.976,000 --> 0:05:19,000
is standard and usual care in this country.

95
0:05:21.649,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And that's just food.

96
0:05:22.9,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The same is true for housing, electricity ...

97
0:05:25.643,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The bottom line is, health care may be changing,

98
0:05:29.114,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but not by enough and certainly not fast enough.

99
0:05:33.418,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We ask the wrong questions of our doctors, of our patients,

100
0:05:37.383,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but also of our citizens.

101
0:05:40.423,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We ask about and argue about health care,

102
0:05:43.317,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but how do voters think about health?

103
0:05:46.042,000 --> 0:05:49,000
No one could tell us the answer to that question,

104
0:05:49.151,000 --> 0:05:5,000
so we launched a new initiative

105
0:05:51.122,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and hired a polling firm to ask voters across the country:

106
0:05:54.517,000 --> 0:05:55,000
What do you need to be healthy?

107
0:05:58.893,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What was so striking about this was that no one has any clue

108
0:06:04.207,000 --> 0:06:06,000
what we are talking about in health care.

109
0:06:07.135,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Voters do not think the social determinants of health

110
0:06:10.095,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is a feel-good phrase.

111
0:06:12.097,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They actually hate it.

112
0:06:14.265,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"What uneducated person came up with that language?"

113
0:06:17.193,000 --> 0:06:18,000
one of the voters said.

114
0:06:19.092,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Or my favorite was the guy who said,

115
0:06:21.155,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"You're killing me."

116
0:06:23.842,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But when you strip away all the ridiculousness

117
0:06:26.463,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of our language in health care,

118
0:06:28.365,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we know exactly what creates health.

119
0:06:31.165,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So take Charlotte, North Carolina.

120
0:06:33.493,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We had two focus groups,

121
0:06:35.004,000 --> 0:06:39,000
one of African American Democratic women and one of white Republican women.

122
0:06:39.229,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And we asked them, "If you had a hundred dollars,

123
0:06:42.074,000 --> 0:06:45,000
how would you spend it to buy health in your community?

124
0:06:45.672,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Turns out, they agree nearly to the last percentage point.

125
0:06:50.537,000 --> 0:06:54,000
First, they agree that health care only sort of impacts health.

126
0:06:54.641,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So they choose to spend the majority of their dollars

127
0:06:57.21,000 --> 0:06:58,000
outside of hospitals and clinics.

128
0:06:59.632,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And second, they agree on what creates health,

129
0:07:02.792,000 --> 0:07:04,000
spending 19 percent on affordable housing

130
0:07:05.041,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and about 25 percent on access to healthy food.

131
0:07:08.868,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So I am sure you are thinking, "This has got to be a fluke."

132
0:07:12.388,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But it's not.

133
0:07:14.112,000 --> 0:07:17,000
White and Latino male swing voters in Seattle,

134
0:07:17.567,000 --> 0:07:2,000
white and African American Democratic voters in Cleveland,

135
0:07:21.482,000 --> 0:07:23,000
white male Republicans in Dallas,

136
0:07:24.135,000 --> 0:07:28,000
low-income white Democrats in Hendersonville, North Carolina:

137
0:07:28.594,000 --> 0:07:3,000
their answers are strikingly similar,

138
0:07:31.498,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with all of them choosing to spend more money

139
0:07:33.819,000 --> 0:07:35,000
on healthy food and safe housing

140
0:07:36.419,000 --> 0:07:38,000
than they would on hospitals and health centers.

141
0:07:40.43,000 --> 0:07:42,000
When you ask the right questions,

142
0:07:42.702,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it becomes pretty clear:

143
0:07:44.974,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we may be fractured on health care in this country,

144
0:07:48.481,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but we are unified on health.

145
0:07:51.839,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The thing that I've been struggling with is why.

146
0:07:55.023,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Why do we agree on health?

147
0:07:57.712,000 --> 0:08:,000
We agree on health because it is common sense.

148
0:08:01.27,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We all know that the things we need to get healthy --

149
0:08:04.526,000 --> 0:08:06,000
medicine and medical care --

150
0:08:06.784,000 --> 0:08:08,000
are not the things we need to be healthy,

151
0:08:09.402,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to not get sick in the first place.

152
0:08:12.255,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But we also agree because of common experience.

153
0:08:15.966,000 --> 0:08:17,000
In a study of 5,000 patients,

154
0:08:18.628,000 --> 0:08:22,000
24 percent of the patients with commercial health insurance --

155
0:08:22.936,000 --> 0:08:23,000
meaning, they had a job --

156
0:08:24.77,000 --> 0:08:28,000
still ran out of food or struggled to find housing or transportation

157
0:08:29.511,000 --> 0:08:31,000
or other essential resources.

158
0:08:31.542,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Twenty-four percent.

159
0:08:33.505,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And we saw the same thing in our focus groups.

160
0:08:35.873,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Nearly every voter knew what it meant to struggle,

161
0:08:39.645,000 --> 0:08:41,000
either themselves or their families

162
0:08:42.414,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or their neighbors.

163
0:08:44.674,000 --> 0:08:47,000
One of those white Republican women in Charlotte was a waitress

164
0:08:49.443,000 --> 0:08:53,000
struggling to stay awake with an enormous Big Gulp soda.

165
0:08:53.58,000 --> 0:08:54,000
She just looked exhausted.

166
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And she was.

167
0:08:57.771,000 --> 0:08:58,000
She told us that she worked two jobs

168
0:08:59.772,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but still could not afford a membership to the Y,

169
0:09:02.785,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but it was OK that she couldn't go to the gym, she said,

170
0:09:05.898,000 --> 0:09:07,000
because she also could not afford gas

171
0:09:08.609,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and walked 10 miles to and from work

172
0:09:11.364,000 --> 0:09:12,000
every single day.

173
0:09:14.212,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Listening to her, I felt this familiar panic rise in me,

174
0:09:18.948,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the residue of my own childhood.

175
0:09:22.441,000 --> 0:09:23,000
When I was 10 years old,

176
0:09:24.059,000 --> 0:09:26,000
my father lay on the living room floor

177
0:09:26.657,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in the grips of one of his many depressions.

178
0:09:30.435,000 --> 0:09:33,000
As I crouched next to him, he told me that he wanted to kill himself.

179
0:09:37.721,000 --> 0:09:39,000
My father lived,

180
0:09:39.828,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but he struggled to work.

181
0:09:41.939,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And my family survived,

182
0:09:43.556,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but we teetered,

183
0:09:45.288,000 --> 0:09:46,000
down one paycheck,

184
0:09:46.789,000 --> 0:09:48,000
relying on my mom's schoolteacher salary.

185
0:09:49.771,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Even as a little kid, I knew we lived in the shadow

186
0:09:53.816,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of financial and emotional collapse.

187
0:09:57.482,000 --> 0:09:59,000
This is really hard to say,

188
0:09:59.744,000 --> 0:10:02,000
because it's taken me 25 years to be honest with myself

189
0:10:03.697,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that this is why I do this work:

190
0:10:07.1,000 --> 0:10:1,000
knowing that my father needed health care to recover,

191
0:10:10.466,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but to be healthy, my family needed something else,

192
0:10:14.052,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we needed a decent income;

193
0:10:16.406,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and knowing, as so many do more than I,

194
0:10:19.667,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that panic when the basics threaten to slip away.

195
0:10:24.378,000 --> 0:10:28,000
To the voters in our focus groups, the solutions were straightforward.

196
0:10:28.586,000 --> 0:10:31,000
As one of those white Republican women in Charlotte said,

197
0:10:31.866,000 --> 0:10:33,000
"Instead of putting all this money into health care,

198
0:10:34.606,000 --> 0:10:35,000
put it into affordable housing.

199
0:10:36.458,000 --> 0:10:39,000
You know, like, take it and distribute it differently."

200
0:10:41.201,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It turns out that when you have the right language

201
0:10:43.876,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and you ask the right questions,

202
0:10:46.292,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the answers become remarkably clear

203
0:10:48.929,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and unanimous.

204
0:10:53.055,000 --> 0:10:58,000
What we know is that, despite all the noise,

205
0:10:58.259,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the plan for health care in this country

206
0:11:01.431,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is that there is no plan.

207
0:11:03.88,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But we have something more powerful than any politician's bill,

208
0:11:08.2,000 --> 0:11:1,000
any candidate's platform,

209
0:11:10.987,000 --> 0:11:12,000
any think tank's policy statement.

210
0:11:13.67,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We have our common sense and our common experience.

211
0:11:18.057,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I ask, if you are a health care executive:

212
0:11:22.172,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Do you know how many of your patients run out of food

213
0:11:24.9,000 --> 0:11:26,000
or struggle to pay the rent at the end of the month?

214
0:11:27.83,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Is that data on your scorecard,

215
0:11:30.23,000 --> 0:11:32,000
shaping your business and your bonuses?

216
0:11:33.796,000 --> 0:11:34,000
If you are a politician:

217
0:11:35.74,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Will you continue to fight on the scorched earth of health care,

218
0:11:40.043,000 --> 0:11:42,000
or will you act on what your voters,

219
0:11:42.512,000 --> 0:11:44,000
what Democratic and Republican voters alike,

220
0:11:45.426,000 --> 0:11:46,000
already know,

221
0:11:46.841,000 --> 0:11:49,000
which is that good wages, healthy food and safe housing

222
0:11:50.217,000 --> 0:11:51,000
are health?

223
0:11:51.997,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And for the rest of us, for the citizens of this country:

224
0:11:56.131,000 --> 0:12:,000
Will we demand accountability to what we know to be true,

225
0:12:00.481,000 --> 0:12:02,000
which is that our common sense,

226
0:12:02.691,000 --> 0:12:03,000
our common experience,

227
0:12:04.535,000 --> 0:12:07,000
makes us the experts in what it takes to be healthy?

228
0:12:09.123,000 --> 0:12:11,000
This moment, as it turns out,

229
0:12:11.779,000 --> 0:12:13,000
is not about changing minds.

230
0:12:14.632,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It is about something more powerful.

231
0:12:17.205,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It is about changing the questions we ask

232
0:12:19.803,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and quieting the noise to hear each other's answers.

233
0:12:24.659,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It is about the radical possibility that we the patients,

234
0:12:28.601,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we the physicians, we the caregivers,

235
0:12:31.082,000 --> 0:12:32,000
we the health care executives

236
0:12:32.522,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and yes, even we the people,

237
0:12:34.61,000 --> 0:12:35,000
that we agree.

238
0:12:36.642,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And it is now time --

239
0:12:38.556,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in fact, long overdue --

240
0:12:40.531,000 --> 0:12:42,000
for us to marshal the courage

241
0:12:43.409,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to hear those answers and to act upon them.

242
0:12:47.058,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Thank you.

243
0:12:48.264,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Applause)

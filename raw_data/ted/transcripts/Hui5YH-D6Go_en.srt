1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm going to speak

2
0:00:14,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about a tiny, little idea.

3
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And this is about shifting baseline.

4
0:00:21,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And because the idea can be explained in one minute,

5
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I will tell you three stories before

6
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to fill in the time.

7
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And the first story

8
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.

9
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And he was here, as you well know, in '35.

10
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And you'd think he was chasing finches,

11
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but he wasn't.

12
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
He was actually collecting fish.

13
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And he described one of them

14
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
as very "common."

15
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This was the sailfin grouper.

16
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
A big fishery was run on it

17
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
until the '80s.

18
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.

19
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now this story,

20
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
we have heard it lots of times

21
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on Galapagos and other places,

22
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
so there is nothing particular about it.

23
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.

24
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We still think it is pristine.

25
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The brochures still say

26
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
it is untouched.

27
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So what happens here?

28
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The second story, also to illustrate another concept,

29
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is called shifting waistline.

30
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Because I was there in '71,

32
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
studying a lagoon in West Africa.

33
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I was there because I grew up in Europe

34
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I wanted later to work in Africa.

35
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I thought I could blend in.

36
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And I got a big sunburn,

37
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I was convinced that I was really not from there.

38
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This was my first sunburn.

39
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And the lagoon

40
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
was surrounded by palm trees,

41
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
as you can see, and a few mangrove.

42
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And it had tilapia

43
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
about 20 centimeters,

44
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.

45
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And the fisheries for this tilapia

46
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
sustained lots of fish and they had a good time

47
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and they earned more than average

48
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in Ghana.

49
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
When I went there 27 years later,

50
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the fish had shrunk to half of their size.

51
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They were maturing at five centimeters.

52
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They had been pushed genetically.

53
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
There were still fishes.

54
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
They were still kind of happy.

55
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And the fish also were happy to be there.

56
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So nothing has changed,

57
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but everything has changed.

58
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
My third little story

59
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is that I was an accomplice

60
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in the introduction of trawling

61
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in Southeast Asia.

62
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --

63
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Europe did lots of development projects.

64
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Fish development

65
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
meant imposing on countries

66
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that had already 100,000 fishers

67
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to impose on them industrial fishing.

68
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And this boat, quite ugly,

69
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is called the Mutiara 4.

70
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I went sailing on it,

71
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and we did surveys

72
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:09,000
throughout the southern South China sea

73
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and especially the Java Sea.

74
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And what we caught,

75
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we didn't have words for it.

76
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
What we caught, I know now,

77
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
is the bottom of the sea.

78
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And 90 percent of our catch

79
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
were sponges,

80
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
other animals that are fixed on the bottom.

81
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And actually most of the fish,

82
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
they are a little spot on the debris,

83
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.

84
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck

85
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and then was thrown down.

86
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And these pictures are extraordinary

87
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because this transition is very rapid.

88
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Within a year, you do a survey

89
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and then commercial fishing begins.

90
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The bottom is transformed

91
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral

92
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
into a muddy mess.

93
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is a dead turtle.

94
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.

95
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And one time we caught a live one.

96
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It was not drowned yet.

97
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.

98
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This mountain of debris

99
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is actually collected by fishers

100
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
every time they go

101
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
into an area that's never been fished.

102
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But it's not documented.

103
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We transform the world,

104
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but we don't remember it.

105
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We adjust our baseline

106
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to the new level,

107
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we don't recall what was there.

108
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
If you generalize this,

109
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
something like this happens.

110
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You have on the y axis some good thing:

111
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
biodiversity, numbers of orca,

112
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the greenness of your country, the water supply.

113
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And over time it changes --

114
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
it changes

115
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because people do things, or naturally.

116
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Every generation

117
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
will use the images

118
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives

119
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
as a standard

120
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and will extrapolate forward.

121
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And the difference then,

122
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
they perceive as a loss.

123
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.

124
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You can have a succession of changes.

125
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:16,000
At the end you want to sustain

126
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
miserable leftovers.

127
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.

128
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We want to sustain things that are gone

129
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:29,000
or things that are not the way they were.

130
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now one should think

131
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:33,000
this problem affected people

132
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
certainly when in predatory societies,

133
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they killed animals

134
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and they didn't know they had done so

135
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
after a few generations.

136
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Because, obviously,

137
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:51,000
an animal that is very abundant,

138
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:54,000
before it gets extinct,

139
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it becomes rare.

140
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
So you don't lose abundant animals.

141
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You always lose rare animals.

142
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And therefore they're not perceived

143
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as a big loss.

144
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Over time,

145
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we concentrate on large animals,

146
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and in a sea that means the big fish.

147
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
They become rarer because we fish them.

148
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Over time we have a few fish left

149
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and we think this is the baseline.

150
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And the question is,

151
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:27,000
why do people accept this?

152
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Well because they don't know that it was different.

153
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And in fact, lots of people, scientists,

154
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
will contest that it was really different.

155
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And they will contest this

156
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because the evidence

157
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:44,000
presented in an earlier mode

158
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is not in the way

159
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
they would like the evidence presented.

160
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
For example,

161
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the anecdote that some present,

162
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
as Captain so-and-so

163
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:58,000
observed lots of fish in this area

164
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:,000
cannot be used

165
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,

166
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because it's not "scientific."

167
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So you have a situation

168
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:1,000
where people don't know the past,

169
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:13,000
even though we live in literate societies,

170
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because they don't trust

171
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the sources of the past.

172
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And hence, the enormous role

173
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that a marine protected area can play.

174
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Because with marine protected areas,

175
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we actually recreate the past.

176
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We recreate the past that people cannot conceive

177
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because the baseline has shifted

178
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and is extremely low.

179
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That is for people

180
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:44,000
who can see a marine protected area

181
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and who can benefit

182
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
from the insight that it provides,

183
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which enables them to reset their baseline.

184
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
How about the people who can't do that

185
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:57,000
because they have no access --

186
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
the people in the Midwest for example?

187
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:02,000
There I think

188
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that the arts and film

189
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
can perhaps fill the gap,

190
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and simulation.

191
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.

192
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --

193
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:15,000
500 years ago.

194
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And you will have noticed that the hues and tones

195
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
are like "Avatar."

196
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And if you think about "Avatar,"

198
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
if you think of why people were so touched by it --

199
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
never mind the Pocahontas story --

200
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:35,000
why so touched by the imagery?

201
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Because it evokes something

202
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that in a sense has been lost.

203
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And so my recommendation,

204
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
it's the only one I will provide,

205
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater.

206
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Thank you very much.

207
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Applause)

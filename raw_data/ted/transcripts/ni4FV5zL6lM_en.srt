1
0:00:13.343,000 --> 0:00:14,000
For more than 100 years,

2
0:00:15.096,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to governments.

3
0:00:19.146,000 --> 0:00:22,000
For much of this time, this assistance was manual.

4
0:00:22.708,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Surveillance took place manually and wires were connected by hand.

5
0:00:26.85,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Calls were recorded to tape.

6
0:00:29.334,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But as in so many other industries,

7
0:00:31.502,000 --> 0:00:32,000
computing has changed everything.

8
0:00:33.725,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The telephone companies built surveillance features

9
0:00:36.772,000 --> 0:00:38,000
into the very core of their networks.

10
0:00:39.494,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I want that to sink in for a second:

11
0:00:41.498,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls

12
0:00:45.782,000 --> 0:00:47,000
were wired for surveillance first.

13
0:00:48.179,000 --> 0:00:49,000
First and foremost.

14
0:00:50.763,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse,

15
0:00:54.613,000 --> 0:00:58,000
your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone,

16
0:00:58.959,000 --> 0:00:59,000
someone could be listening.

17
0:01:00.901,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, that someone might be your own government;

18
0:01:03.49,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it could also be another government, a foreign intelligence service,

19
0:01:07.677,000 --> 0:01:09,000
or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker

20
0:01:10.528,000 --> 0:01:13,000
or any other party that breaks into the surveillance system,

21
0:01:14.122,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that hacks into the surveillance system of the telephone companies.

22
0:01:19.834,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a priority,

23
0:01:24.38,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Silicon Valley companies have not.

24
0:01:26.523,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And increasingly, over the last couple years,

25
0:01:29.066,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Silicon Valley companies have built strong encryption technology

26
0:01:32.752,000 --> 0:01:33,000
into their communications products

27
0:01:34.714,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that makes surveillance extremely difficult.

28
0:01:37.416,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For example, many of you might have an iPhone,

29
0:01:39.614,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and if you use an iPhone to send a text message

30
0:01:42.328,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to other people who have an iPhone,

31
0:01:44.529,000 --> 0:01:47,000
those text messages cannot easily be wiretapped.

32
0:01:47.563,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And in fact, according to Apple,

33
0:01:49.415,000 --> 0:01:51,000
they're not able to even see the text messages themselves.

34
0:01:52.662,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Likewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call

35
0:01:56.552,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or a video call with one of your friends or loved ones,

36
0:01:59.187,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped.

37
0:02:01.34,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And it's not just Apple.

38
0:02:03.315,000 --> 0:02:05,000
WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook

39
0:02:05.691,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world,

40
0:02:08.573,000 --> 0:02:11,000
also has built strong encryption technology into its product,

41
0:02:12.104,000 --> 0:02:15,000
which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate

42
0:02:15.635,000 --> 0:02:17,000
without their governments, often authoritarian,

43
0:02:18.469,000 --> 0:02:19,000
wiretapping their text messages.

44
0:02:21.599,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So, after 100 years of being able to listen to any telephone call --

45
0:02:26.568,000 --> 0:02:28,000
anytime, anywhere --

46
0:02:29.146,000 --> 0:02:32,000
you might imagine that government officials are not very happy.

47
0:02:32.301,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And in fact, that's what's happening.

48
0:02:34.111,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Government officials are extremely mad.

49
0:02:36.354,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And they're not mad because these encryption tools are now available.

50
0:02:40.253,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What upsets them the most

51
0:02:42.095,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products

52
0:02:46.286,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and turned them on by default.

53
0:02:48.547,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's the default piece that matters.

54
0:02:50.541,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In short, the tech companies have democratized encryption.

55
0:02:55.165,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so, government officials like British Prime Minister David Cameron,

56
0:02:58.986,000 --> 0:03:02,000
they believe that all communications -- emails, texts, voice calls --

57
0:03:03.857,000 --> 0:03:05,000
all of these should be available to governments,

58
0:03:06.469,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and encryption is making that difficult.

59
0:03:09.478,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, look -- I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view.

60
0:03:12.886,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We live in a dangerous time in a dangerous world,

61
0:03:15.442,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and there really are bad people out there.

62
0:03:17.466,000 --> 0:03:2,000
There are terrorists and other serious national security threats

63
0:03:20.605,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to monitor.

64
0:03:25.345,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But those surveillance features come at a cost.

65
0:03:29.357,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The reason for that is

66
0:03:30.536,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop,

67
0:03:33.046,000 --> 0:03:34,000
or a drug dealer's cell phone.

68
0:03:34.902,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We all use the same communications devices.

69
0:03:38.577,000 --> 0:03:41,000
What that means is that if the drug dealers' telephone calls

70
0:03:42.276,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or the terrorists' telephone calls can be intercepted,

71
0:03:44.845,000 --> 0:03:45,000
then so can the rest of ours, too.

72
0:03:46.865,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And I think we really need to ask:

73
0:03:48.516,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Should a billion people around the world be using devices

74
0:03:51.667,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that are wiretap friendly?

75
0:03:55.407,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So the scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described --

76
0:03:59.179,000 --> 0:04:01,000
this is not imaginary.

77
0:04:01.622,000 --> 0:04:02,000
In 2009,

78
0:04:02.798,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks --

79
0:04:06.869,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests

80
0:04:10.384,000 --> 0:04:11,000
from the police --

81
0:04:11.574,000 --> 0:04:13,000
those systems were compromised by the Chinese government,

82
0:04:14.266,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because the Chinese government wanted to figure out

83
0:04:16.687,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which of their own agents the US government was monitoring.

84
0:04:20.269,000 --> 0:04:21,000
By the same token,

85
0:04:21.564,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network

86
0:04:25.007,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of Vodafone Greece -- Greece's largest telephone company --

87
0:04:28.205,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was compromised by an unknown entity,

88
0:04:30.808,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and that feature, the surveillance feature,

89
0:04:32.872,000 --> 0:04:34,000
was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister

90
0:04:35.174,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and members of the Greek cabinet.

91
0:04:37.313,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught.

92
0:04:41.955,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And really, this gets to the very problem with these surveillance features,

93
0:04:45.676,000 --> 0:04:46,000
or backdoors.

94
0:04:46.96,000 --> 0:04:49,000
When you build a backdoor into a communications network

95
0:04:50.186,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or piece of technology,

96
0:04:51.511,000 --> 0:04:54,000
you have no way of controlling who's going to go through it.

97
0:04:55.243,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You have no way of controlling

98
0:04:56.712,000 --> 0:04:58,000
whether it'll be used by your side or the other side,

99
0:04:59.506,000 --> 0:05:,000
by good guys, or by bad guys.

100
0:05:01.98,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And so for that reason, I think that it's better

101
0:05:04.523,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to build networks to be as secure as possible.

102
0:05:08.271,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Yes, this means that in the future,

103
0:05:10.704,000 --> 0:05:12,000
encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult.

104
0:05:13.28,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It means that the police are going to have a tougher time

105
0:05:15.949,000 --> 0:05:16,000
catching bad guys.

106
0:05:17.309,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But the alternative would mean to live in a world

107
0:05:19.889,000 --> 0:05:22,000
where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled

108
0:05:23.544,000 --> 0:05:26,000
by criminals, by stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies.

109
0:05:27.294,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And I don't want to live in that kind of world.

110
0:05:30.102,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And so right now, you probably have the tools

111
0:05:32.841,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to thwart many kinds of government surveillance

112
0:05:35.183,000 --> 0:05:37,000
already on your phones and already in your pockets,

113
0:05:38.19,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you just might not realize how strong and how secure those tools are,

114
0:05:41.993,000 --> 0:05:44,000
or how weak the other ways you've used to communicate really are.

115
0:05:46.737,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And so, my message to you is this:

116
0:05:50.11,000 --> 0:05:51,000
We need to use these tools.

117
0:05:52.239,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We need to secure our telephone calls.

118
0:05:54.567,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We need to secure our text messages.

119
0:05:56.95,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I want you to use these tools.

120
0:05:58.626,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues:

121
0:06:02.006,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Use these encrypted communications tools.

122
0:06:04.454,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Don't just use them because they're cheap and easy,

123
0:06:07.154,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but use them because they're secure.

124
0:06:09.182,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Thank you.

125
0:06:10.461,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

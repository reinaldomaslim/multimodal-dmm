2
0:00:12.555,000 --> 0:00:14,000
How many of you are creatives,

3
0:00:14.868,000 --> 0:00:17,000
designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists,

4
0:00:18.516,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or maybe you just have a really big imagination?

5
0:00:20.927,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Show of hands? (Cheers)

6
0:00:22.799,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That's most of you.

7
0:00:25.154,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I have some news for us creatives.

8
0:00:28.534,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Over the course of the next 20 years,

9
0:00:33.291,000 --> 0:00:35,000
more will change around the way we do our work

10
0:00:37.202,000 --> 0:00:39,000
than has happened in the last 2,000.

11
0:00:40.331,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In fact, I think we're at the dawn of a new age in human history.

12
0:00:45.465,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, there have been four major historical eras defined by the way we work.

13
0:00:51.224,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The Hunter-Gatherer Age lasted several million years.

14
0:00:54.983,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And then the Agricultural Age lasted several thousand years.

15
0:00:59.015,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The Industrial Age lasted a couple of centuries.

16
0:01:02.529,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And now the Information Age has lasted just a few decades.

17
0:01:06.84,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And now today, we're on the cusp of our next great era as a species.

18
0:01:13.116,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Welcome to the Augmented Age.

19
0:01:15.82,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In this new era, your natural human capabilities are going to be augmented

20
0:01:19.537,000 --> 0:01:22,000
by computational systems that help you think,

21
0:01:22.629,000 --> 0:01:24,000
robotic systems that help you make,

22
0:01:24.839,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and a digital nervous system

23
0:01:26.511,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that connects you to the world far beyond your natural senses.

24
0:01:31.257,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Let's start with cognitive augmentation.

25
0:01:33.223,000 --> 0:01:35,000
How many of you are augmented cyborgs?

26
0:01:35.953,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:38.627,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I would actually argue that we're already augmented.

28
0:01:42.108,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Imagine you're at a party,

29
0:01:43.636,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and somebody asks you a question that you don't know the answer to.

30
0:01:47.18,000 --> 0:01:5,000
If you have one of these, in a few seconds, you can know the answer.

31
0:01:51.689,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But this is just a primitive beginning.

32
0:01:54.683,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Even Siri is just a passive tool.

33
0:01:58.48,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In fact, for the last three-and-a-half million years,

34
0:02:01.885,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the tools that we've had have been completely passive.

35
0:02:06.023,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They do exactly what we tell them and nothing more.

36
0:02:09.702,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Our very first tool only cut where we struck it.

37
0:02:13.642,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The chisel only carves where the artist points it.

38
0:02:17.163,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And even our most advanced tools do nothing without our explicit direction.

39
0:02:22.828,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In fact, to date, and this is something that frustrates me,

40
0:02:26.033,000 --> 0:02:27,000
we've always been limited

41
0:02:27.505,000 --> 0:02:3,000
by this need to manually push our wills into our tools --

42
0:02:31.03,000 --> 0:02:33,000
like, manual, literally using our hands,

43
0:02:33.351,000 --> 0:02:34,000
even with computers.

44
0:02:35.892,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But I'm more like Scotty in "Star Trek."

45
0:02:38.379,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:40.253,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I want to have a conversation with a computer.

47
0:02:42.423,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I want to say, "Computer, let's design a car,"

48
0:02:45.417,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the computer shows me a car.

49
0:02:46.98,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And I say, "No, more fast-looking, and less German,"

50
0:02:49.612,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and bang, the computer shows me an option.

51
0:02:51.799,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:54.028,000 --> 0:02:56,000
That conversation might be a little ways off,

53
0:02:56.358,000 --> 0:02:58,000
probably less than many of us think,

54
0:02:59.047,000 --> 0:03:,000
but right now,

55
0:03:00.834,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we're working on it.

56
0:03:02.009,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Tools are making this leap from being passive to being generative.

57
0:03:06.651,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Generative design tools use a computer and algorithms

58
0:03:09.983,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to synthesize geometry

59
0:03:12.615,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to come up with new designs all by themselves.

60
0:03:15.816,000 --> 0:03:17,000
All it needs are your goals and your constraints.

61
0:03:18.588,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I'll give you an example.

62
0:03:20.02,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In the case of this aerial drone chassis,

63
0:03:22.832,000 --> 0:03:24,000
all you would need to do is tell it something like,

64
0:03:25.482,000 --> 0:03:26,000
it has four propellers,

65
0:03:26.779,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you want it to be as lightweight as possible,

66
0:03:28.934,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and you need it to be aerodynamically efficient.

67
0:03:31.228,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Then what the computer does is it explores the entire solution space:

68
0:03:36.166,000 --> 0:03:39,000
every single possibility that solves and meets your criteria --

69
0:03:40.117,000 --> 0:03:41,000
millions of them.

70
0:03:41.583,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It takes big computers to do this.

71
0:03:43.582,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But it comes back to us with designs

72
0:03:45.561,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that we, by ourselves, never could've imagined.

73
0:03:49.146,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And the computer's coming up with this stuff all by itself --

74
0:03:52.082,000 --> 0:03:53,000
no one ever drew anything,

75
0:03:53.784,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and it started completely from scratch.

76
0:03:56.858,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And by the way, it's no accident

77
0:03:59.269,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that the drone body looks just like the pelvis of a flying squirrel.

78
0:04:03.107,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:05.86,000 --> 0:04:07,000
It's because the algorithms are designed to work

80
0:04:08.186,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the same way evolution does.

81
0:04:10.535,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What's exciting is we're starting to see this technology

82
0:04:13.219,000 --> 0:04:14,000
out in the real world.

83
0:04:14.402,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We've been working with Airbus for a couple of years

84
0:04:16.878,000 --> 0:04:17,000
on this concept plane for the future.

85
0:04:18.811,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's a ways out still.

86
0:04:20.905,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But just recently we used a generative-design AI

87
0:04:24.709,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to come up with this.

88
0:04:27.429,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This is a 3D-printed cabin partition that's been designed by a computer.

89
0:04:32.606,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's stronger than the original yet half the weight,

90
0:04:35.454,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and it will be flying in the Airbus A320 later this year.

91
0:04:39.225,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So computers can now generate;

92
0:04:40.808,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they can come up with their own solutions to our well-defined problems.

93
0:04:46.497,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But they're not intuitive.

94
0:04:47.831,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They still have to start from scratch every single time,

95
0:04:50.941,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and that's because they never learn.

96
0:04:54.188,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Unlike Maggie.

97
0:04:55.978,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:57.583,000 --> 0:05:,000
Maggie's actually smarter than our most advanced design tools.

99
0:05:01.287,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What do I mean by that?

100
0:05:02.751,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If her owner picks up that leash,

101
0:05:04.365,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Maggie knows with a fair degree of certainty

102
0:05:06.457,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it's time to go for a walk.

103
0:05:07.885,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And how did she learn?

104
0:05:09.094,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Well, every time the owner picked up the leash, they went for a walk.

105
0:05:12.442,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And Maggie did three things:

106
0:05:14.344,000 --> 0:05:15,000
she had to pay attention,

107
0:05:16.237,000 --> 0:05:18,000
she had to remember what happened

108
0:05:18.343,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and she had to retain and create a pattern in her mind.

109
0:05:23.249,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Interestingly, that's exactly what

110
0:05:25.368,000 --> 0:05:27,000
computer scientists have been trying to get AIs to do

111
0:05:27.915,000 --> 0:05:28,000
for the last 60 or so years.

112
0:05:30.503,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Back in 1952,

113
0:05:31.876,000 --> 0:05:34,000
they built this computer that could play Tic-Tac-Toe.

114
0:05:36.901,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Big deal.

115
0:05:38.849,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Then 45 years later, in 1997,

116
0:05:41.873,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Deep Blue beats Kasparov at chess.

117
0:05:45.866,000 --> 0:05:49,000
2011, Watson beats these two humans at Jeopardy,

118
0:05:50.858,000 --> 0:05:52,000
which is much harder for a computer to play than chess is.

119
0:05:53.81,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In fact, rather than working from predefined recipes,

120
0:05:57.646,000 --> 0:06:,000
Watson had to use reasoning to overcome his human opponents.

121
0:06:02.213,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And then a couple of weeks ago,

122
0:06:04.676,000 --> 0:06:08,000
DeepMind's AlphaGo beats the world's best human at Go,

123
0:06:08.962,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which is the most difficult game that we have.

124
0:06:11.198,000 --> 0:06:13,000
In fact, in Go, there are more possible moves

125
0:06:14.118,000 --> 0:06:16,000
than there are atoms in the universe.

126
0:06:18.03,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So in order to win,

127
0:06:19.88,000 --> 0:06:21,000
what AlphaGo had to do was develop intuition.

128
0:06:22.918,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And in fact, at some points, AlphaGo's programmers didn't understand

129
0:06:27.052,000 --> 0:06:29,000
why AlphaGo was doing what it was doing.

130
0:06:31.271,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And things are moving really fast.

131
0:06:32.955,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I mean, consider -- in the space of a human lifetime,

132
0:06:36.206,000 --> 0:06:38,000
computers have gone from a child's game

133
0:06:39.74,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to what's recognized as the pinnacle of strategic thought.

134
0:06:43.819,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What's basically happening

135
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is computers are going from being like Spock

136
0:06:49.594,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to being a lot more like Kirk.

137
0:06:51.567,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:55.209,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Right? From pure logic to intuition.

139
0:07:00.004,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Would you cross this bridge?

140
0:07:02.429,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Most of you are saying, "Oh, hell no!"

141
0:07:04.776,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

142
0:07:06.108,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And you arrived at that decision in a split second.

143
0:07:08.789,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You just sort of knew that bridge was unsafe.

144
0:07:11.241,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And that's exactly the kind of intuition

145
0:07:13.254,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that our deep-learning systems are starting to develop right now.

146
0:07:17.542,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Very soon, you'll literally be able

147
0:07:19.273,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to show something you've made, you've designed,

148
0:07:21.503,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to a computer,

149
0:07:22.68,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and it will look at it and say,

150
0:07:24.193,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"Sorry, homie, that'll never work. You have to try again."

151
0:07:27.674,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Or you could ask it if people are going to like your next song,

152
0:07:31.593,000 --> 0:07:33,000
or your next flavor of ice cream.

153
0:07:35.369,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Or, much more importantly,

154
0:07:37.972,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you could work with a computer to solve a problem

155
0:07:40.36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that we've never faced before.

156
0:07:42.021,000 --> 0:07:43,000
For instance, climate change.

157
0:07:43.446,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We're not doing a very good job on our own,

158
0:07:45.49,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we could certainly use all the help we can get.

159
0:07:47.759,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That's what I'm talking about,

160
0:07:49.241,000 --> 0:07:51,000
technology amplifying our cognitive abilities

161
0:07:51.82,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so we can imagine and design things that were simply out of our reach

162
0:07:55.396,000 --> 0:07:57,000
as plain old un-augmented humans.

163
0:07:59.804,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So what about making all of this crazy new stuff

164
0:08:02.769,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that we're going to invent and design?

165
0:08:05.772,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I think the era of human augmentation is as much about the physical world

166
0:08:09.889,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as it is about the virtual, intellectual realm.

167
0:08:13.653,000 --> 0:08:14,000
How will technology augment us?

168
0:08:16.081,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In the physical world, robotic systems.

169
0:08:19.44,000 --> 0:08:2,000
OK, there's certainly a fear

170
0:08:21.2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that robots are going to take jobs away from humans,

171
0:08:23.712,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and that is true in certain sectors.

172
0:08:25.994,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But I'm much more interested in this idea

173
0:08:28.896,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that humans and robots working together are going to augment each other,

174
0:08:33.93,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and start to inhabit a new space.

175
0:08:36.012,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is our applied research lab in San Francisco,

176
0:08:38.398,000 --> 0:08:41,000
where one of our areas of focus is advanced robotics,

177
0:08:41.564,000 --> 0:08:43,000
specifically, human-robot collaboration.

178
0:08:44.854,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And this is Bishop, one of our robots.

179
0:08:47.637,000 --> 0:08:48,000
As an experiment, we set it up

180
0:08:49.45,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to help a person working in construction doing repetitive tasks --

181
0:08:53.804,000 --> 0:08:57,000
tasks like cutting out holes for outlets or light switches in drywall.

182
0:08:58.022,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:01.697,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So, Bishop's human partner can tell what to do in plain English

184
0:09:04.832,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and with simple gestures,

185
0:09:06.161,000 --> 0:09:07,000
kind of like talking to a dog,

186
0:09:07.632,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and then Bishop executes on those instructions

187
0:09:09.799,000 --> 0:09:1,000
with perfect precision.

188
0:09:11.715,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We're using the human for what the human is good at:

189
0:09:14.728,000 --> 0:09:16,000
awareness, perception and decision making.

190
0:09:17.085,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And we're using the robot for what it's good at:

191
0:09:19.349,000 --> 0:09:2,000
precision and repetitiveness.

192
0:09:22.072,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Here's another cool project that Bishop worked on.

193
0:09:24.463,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The goal of this project, which we called the HIVE,

194
0:09:27.562,000 --> 0:09:3,000
was to prototype the experience of humans, computers and robots

195
0:09:31.437,000 --> 0:09:34,000
all working together to solve a highly complex design problem.

196
0:09:35.613,000 --> 0:09:36,000
The humans acted as labor.

197
0:09:37.088,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They cruised around the construction site, they manipulated the bamboo --

198
0:09:40.585,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which, by the way, because it's a non-isomorphic material,

199
0:09:43.365,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is super hard for robots to deal with.

200
0:09:45.263,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But then the robots did this fiber winding,

201
0:09:47.309,000 --> 0:09:49,000
which was almost impossible for a human to do.

202
0:09:49.784,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then we had an AI that was controlling everything.

203
0:09:53.429,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It was telling the humans what to do, telling the robots what to do

204
0:09:56.743,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and keeping track of thousands of individual components.

205
0:09:59.682,000 --> 0:10:,000
What's interesting is,

206
0:10:00.886,000 --> 0:10:03,000
building this pavilion was simply not possible

207
0:10:04.051,000 --> 0:10:08,000
without human, robot and AI augmenting each other.

208
0:10:09.71,000 --> 0:10:12,000
OK, I'll share one more project. This one's a little bit crazy.

209
0:10:13.054,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We're working with Amsterdam-based artist Joris Laarman and his team at MX3D

210
0:10:17.546,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to generatively design and robotically print

211
0:10:20.448,000 --> 0:10:22,000
the world's first autonomously manufactured bridge.

212
0:10:24.135,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So, Joris and an AI are designing this thing right now, as we speak,

213
0:10:27.844,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in Amsterdam.

214
0:10:29.04,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And when they're done, we're going to hit "Go,"

215
0:10:31.385,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and robots will start 3D printing in stainless steel,

216
0:10:34.72,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and then they're going to keep printing, without human intervention,

217
0:10:38.027,000 --> 0:10:39,000
until the bridge is finished.

218
0:10:40.919,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So, as computers are going to augment our ability

219
0:10:43.871,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to imagine and design new stuff,

220
0:10:46.045,000 --> 0:10:48,000
robotic systems are going to help us build and make things

221
0:10:48.964,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that we've never been able to make before.

222
0:10:52.167,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But what about our ability to sense and control these things?

223
0:10:56.351,000 --> 0:11:,000
What about a nervous system for the things that we make?

224
0:11:00.406,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Our nervous system, the human nervous system,

225
0:11:02.942,000 --> 0:11:04,000
tells us everything that's going on around us.

226
0:11:06.006,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But the nervous system of the things we make is rudimentary at best.

227
0:11:09.714,000 --> 0:11:12,000
For instance, a car doesn't tell the city's public works department

228
0:11:13.301,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that it just hit a pothole at the corner of Broadway and Morrison.

229
0:11:16.455,000 --> 0:11:18,000
A building doesn't tell its designers

230
0:11:18.511,000 --> 0:11:2,000
whether or not the people inside like being there,

231
0:11:21.219,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and the toy manufacturer doesn't know

232
0:11:24.253,000 --> 0:11:26,000
if a toy is actually being played with --

233
0:11:26.284,000 --> 0:11:28,000
how and where and whether or not it's any fun.

234
0:11:29.44,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Look, I'm sure that the designers imagined this lifestyle for Barbie

235
0:11:33.278,000 --> 0:11:34,000
when they designed her.

236
0:11:34.526,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:35.997,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But what if it turns out that Barbie's actually really lonely?

238
0:11:38.927,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

239
0:11:43.086,000 --> 0:11:44,000
If the designers had known

240
0:11:44.398,000 --> 0:11:46,000
what was really happening in the real world

241
0:11:46.529,000 --> 0:11:48,000
with their designs -- the road, the building, Barbie --

242
0:11:49.136,000 --> 0:11:51,000
they could've used that knowledge to create an experience

243
0:11:51.854,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that was better for the user.

244
0:11:53.278,000 --> 0:11:54,000
What's missing is a nervous system

245
0:11:55.093,000 --> 0:11:58,000
connecting us to all of the things that we design, make and use.

246
0:11:59.735,000 --> 0:12:02,000
What if all of you had that kind of information flowing to you

247
0:12:03.314,000 --> 0:12:05,000
from the things you create in the real world?

248
0:12:07.252,000 --> 0:12:08,000
With all of the stuff we make,

249
0:12:08.727,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we spend a tremendous amount of money and energy --

250
0:12:11.186,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in fact, last year, about two trillion dollars --

251
0:12:13.586,000 --> 0:12:15,000
convincing people to buy the things we've made.

252
0:12:16.464,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But if you had this connection to the things that you design and create

253
0:12:19.876,000 --> 0:12:2,000
after they're out in the real world,

254
0:12:21.627,000 --> 0:12:24,000
after they've been sold or launched or whatever,

255
0:12:25.265,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we could actually change that,

256
0:12:26.909,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and go from making people want our stuff,

257
0:12:29.98,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to just making stuff that people want in the first place.

258
0:12:33.438,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The good news is, we're working on digital nervous systems

259
0:12:36.249,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that connect us to the things we design.

260
0:12:40.185,000 --> 0:12:41,000
We're working on one project

261
0:12:41.836,000 --> 0:12:44,000
with a couple of guys down in Los Angeles called the Bandito Brothers

262
0:12:45.572,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and their team.

263
0:12:47.003,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And one of the things these guys do is build insane cars

264
0:12:50.46,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that do absolutely insane things.

265
0:12:54.725,000 --> 0:12:55,000
These guys are crazy --

266
0:12:56.199,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

267
0:12:57.259,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in the best way.

268
0:13:00.813,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And what we're doing with them

269
0:13:02.6,000 --> 0:13:04,000
is taking a traditional race-car chassis

270
0:13:05.064,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and giving it a nervous system.

271
0:13:06.673,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So we instrumented it with dozens of sensors,

272
0:13:09.755,000 --> 0:13:11,000
put a world-class driver behind the wheel,

273
0:13:12.414,000 --> 0:13:15,000
took it out to the desert and drove the hell out of it for a week.

274
0:13:15.795,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And the car's nervous system captured everything

275
0:13:18.31,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that was happening to the car.

276
0:13:19.816,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We captured four billion data points;

277
0:13:22.461,000 --> 0:13:24,000
all of the forces that it was subjected to.

278
0:13:24.795,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And then we did something crazy.

279
0:13:27.088,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We took all of that data,

280
0:13:28.612,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and plugged it into a generative-design AI we call "Dreamcatcher."

281
0:13:33.09,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So what do get when you give a design tool a nervous system,

282
0:13:37.078,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and you ask it to build you the ultimate car chassis?

283
0:13:40.543,000 --> 0:13:41,000
You get this.

284
0:13:44.113,000 --> 0:13:47,000
This is something that a human could never have designed.

285
0:13:48.527,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Except a human did design this,

286
0:13:50.439,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but it was a human that was augmented by a generative-design AI,

287
0:13:54.772,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a digital nervous system

288
0:13:56.027,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and robots that can actually fabricate something like this.

289
0:13:59.5,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So if this is the future, the Augmented Age,

290
0:14:03.119,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and we're going to be augmented cognitively, physically and perceptually,

291
0:14:07.404,000 --> 0:14:08,000
what will that look like?

292
0:14:09.396,000 --> 0:14:12,000
What is this wonderland going to be like?

293
0:14:12.741,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I think we're going to see a world

294
0:14:14.474,000 --> 0:14:17,000
where we're moving from things that are fabricated

295
0:14:17.566,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to things that are farmed.

296
0:14:19.979,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Where we're moving from things that are constructed

297
0:14:23.456,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to that which is grown.

298
0:14:25.954,000 --> 0:14:27,000
We're going to move from being isolated

299
0:14:28.166,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to being connected.

300
0:14:30.454,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And we'll move away from extraction

301
0:14:32.889,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to embrace aggregation.

302
0:14:35.787,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I also think we'll shift from craving obedience from our things

303
0:14:39.578,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to valuing autonomy.

304
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Thanks to our augmented capabilities,

305
0:14:44.259,000 --> 0:14:46,000
our world is going to change dramatically.

306
0:14:47.396,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We're going to have a world with more variety, more connectedness,

307
0:14:50.666,000 --> 0:14:52,000
more dynamism, more complexity,

308
0:14:52.977,000 --> 0:14:54,000
more adaptability and, of course,

309
0:14:55.319,000 --> 0:14:56,000
more beauty.

310
0:14:57.051,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The shape of things to come

311
0:14:58.639,000 --> 0:15:,000
will be unlike anything we've ever seen before.

312
0:15:00.953,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Why?

313
0:15:02.136,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Because what will be shaping those things is this new partnership

314
0:15:05.915,000 --> 0:15:08,000
between technology, nature and humanity.

315
0:15:11.099,000 --> 0:15:14,000
That, to me, is a future well worth looking forward to.

316
0:15:14.927,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Thank you all so much.

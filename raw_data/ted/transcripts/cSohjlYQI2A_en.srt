1
0:00:15.704,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We are losing our listening.

2
0:00:18.759,000 --> 0:00:21,000
We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening,

3
0:00:22.704,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but we're not very good at it.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We retain just 25 percent of what we hear.

5
0:00:26.791,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Now -- not you, not this talk,

6
0:00:28.317,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but that is generally true.

7
0:00:29.866,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:31.285,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Let's define listening as making meaning from sound.

9
0:00:34.892,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's a mental process,

10
0:00:36.495,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and it's a process of extraction.

11
0:00:39.145,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We use some pretty cool techniques to do this.

12
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
One of them is pattern recognition.

13
0:00:43.093,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Crowd noises) So in a cocktail party like this,

14
0:00:45.469,000 --> 0:00:49,000
if I say, "David, Sara, pay attention" -- some of you just sat up.

15
0:00:49.778,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal,

16
0:00:53.471,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and especially our name.

17
0:00:55.511,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Differencing is another technique we use.

18
0:00:57.574,000 --> 0:01:,000
If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes,

19
0:01:00.754,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Pink noise) you would literally cease to hear it.

20
0:01:03.352,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We listen to differences; we discount sounds that remain the same.

21
0:01:08.312,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And then there is a whole range of filters.

22
0:01:11.125,000 --> 0:01:13,000
These filters take us from all sound

23
0:01:13.601,000 --> 0:01:15,000
down to what we pay attention to.

24
0:01:15.696,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters.

25
0:01:19.779,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But they actually create our reality in a way,

26
0:01:22.353,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now.

27
0:01:25.384,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'll give you one example of that.

28
0:01:27.174,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Intention is very important in sound, in listening.

29
0:01:30.494,000 --> 0:01:31,000
When I married my wife,

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I promised her I would listen to her every day

31
0:01:34.944,000 --> 0:01:35,000
as if for the first time.

32
0:01:37.23,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now that's something I fall short of on a daily basis.

33
0:01:40.51,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:41.547,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But it's a great intention to have in a relationship.

35
0:01:44.169,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:45.878,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But that's not all.

37
0:01:47.053,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Sound places us in space and in time.

38
0:01:50.029,000 --> 0:01:52,000
If you close your eyes right now in this room,

39
0:01:52.982,000 --> 0:01:54,000
you're aware of the size of the room

40
0:01:55.013,000 --> 0:01:58,000
from the reverberation and the bouncing of the sound off the surfaces;

41
0:01:58.855,000 --> 0:02:,000
you're aware of how many people are around you,

42
0:02:01.146,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because of the micro-noises you're receiving.

43
0:02:03.765,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And sound places us in time as well,

44
0:02:06.372,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because sound always has time embedded in it.

45
0:02:09.856,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In fact, I would suggest that our listening is the main way

46
0:02:12.802,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that we experience the flow of time

47
0:02:14.972,000 --> 0:02:15,000
from past to future.

48
0:02:17.069,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So, "Sonority is time and meaning" -- a great quote.

49
0:02:20.019,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I said at the beginning, we're losing our listening.

50
0:02:22.484,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Why did I say that?

51
0:02:23.918,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Well, there are a lot of reasons for this.

52
0:02:25.976,000 --> 0:02:27,000
First of all, we invented ways of recording --

53
0:02:28.205,000 --> 0:02:31,000
first writing, then audio recording and now video recording as well.

54
0:02:31.971,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The premium on accurate and careful listening has simply disappeared.

55
0:02:36.675,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Secondly, the world is now so noisy,

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Noise) with this cacophony going on visually and auditorily,

57
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it's just hard to listen;

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
it's tiring to listen.

59
0:02:48.426,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Many people take refuge in headphones,

60
0:02:50.899,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but they turn big, public spaces like this,

61
0:02:53.976,000 --> 0:02:54,000
shared soundscapes,

62
0:02:55.396,000 --> 0:02:59,000
into millions of tiny, little personal sound bubbles.

63
0:02:59.83,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In this scenario, nobody's listening to anybody.

64
0:03:03.147,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We're becoming impatient.

65
0:03:05.218,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We don't want oratory anymore; we want sound bites.

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously, I think --

67
0:03:12.729,000 --> 0:03:13,000
by personal broadcasting.

68
0:03:14.74,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I don't know how much listening there is in this conversation,

69
0:03:18.231,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which is sadly very common, especially in the UK.

70
0:03:21.715,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We're becoming desensitized.

71
0:03:23.41,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Our media have to scream at us with these kinds of headlines

72
0:03:26.889,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in order to get our attention.

73
0:03:28.881,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And that means it's harder for us to pay attention

74
0:03:31.336,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to the quiet, the subtle, the understated.

75
0:03:35.587,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is a serious problem that we're losing our listening.

76
0:03:38.532,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is not trivial,

77
0:03:40.523,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because listening is our access to understanding.

78
0:03:44.226,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Conscious listening always creates understanding,

79
0:03:47.711,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and only without conscious listening

80
0:03:50.365,000 --> 0:03:51,000
can these things happen.

81
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
A world where we don't listen to each other at all

82
0:03:55.246,000 --> 0:03:57,000
is a very scary place indeed.

83
0:03:59.014,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So I'd like to share with you five simple exercises,

84
0:04:02.36,000 --> 0:04:03,000
tools you can take away with you,

85
0:04:04.074,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to improve your own conscious listening.

86
0:04:06.29,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Would you like that?

87
0:04:07.47,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Audience: Yes!

88
0:04:08.66,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Good. The first one is silence.

89
0:04:11.612,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise

90
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to reset your ears and to recalibrate,

91
0:04:17.996,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so that you can hear the quiet again.

92
0:04:20.123,000 --> 0:04:21,000
If you can't get absolute silence,

93
0:04:21.822,000 --> 0:04:23,000
go for quiet, that's absolutely fine.

94
0:04:24.823,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Second, I call this "the mixer."

95
0:04:27.52,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Noise) So even if you're in a noisy environment like this --

96
0:04:31.033,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we all spend a lot of time in places like this --

97
0:04:33.782,000 --> 0:04:37,000
listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear?

98
0:04:37.878,000 --> 0:04:39,000
How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to?

99
0:04:40.86,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You can do it in a beautiful place as well, like in a lake.

100
0:04:44.098,000 --> 0:04:45,000
How many birds am I hearing?

101
0:04:45.609,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Where are they? Where are those ripples?

102
0:04:47.839,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening.

103
0:04:52.456,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Third, this exercise I call "savoring," and this is a beautiful exercise.

104
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's about enjoying mundane sounds.

105
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This, for example, is my tumble dryer.

106
0:05:01.513,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Dryer)

107
0:05:02.635,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's a waltz -- one, two, three; one, two, three; one, two, three.

108
0:05:07.141,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I love it!

109
0:05:08.387,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Or just try this one on for size.

110
0:05:10.583,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Coffee grinder)

111
0:05:19.713,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Wow!

112
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So, mundane sounds can be really interesting --

113
0:05:23.663,000 --> 0:05:24,000
if you pay attention.

114
0:05:24.88,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I call that the "hidden choir" -- it's around us all the time.

115
0:05:28.394,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The next exercise is probably the most important of all of these,

116
0:05:32.241,000 --> 0:05:33,000
if you just take one thing away.

117
0:05:33.936,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This is listening positions --

118
0:05:35.581,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the idea that you can move your listening position

119
0:05:39.06,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to what's appropriate to what you're listening to.

120
0:05:41.899,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This is playing with those filters.

121
0:05:43.669,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Remember I gave you those filters?

122
0:05:45.347,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's starting to play with them as levers,

123
0:05:47.398,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to get conscious about them and to move to different places.

124
0:05:50.299,000 --> 0:05:52,000
These are just some of the listening positions,

125
0:05:52.562,000 --> 0:05:54,000
or scales of listening positions, that you can use.

126
0:05:54.993,000 --> 0:05:55,000
There are many.

127
0:05:56.183,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Have fun with that. It's very exciting.

128
0:05:58.685,000 --> 0:06:,000
And finally, an acronym.

129
0:06:00.811,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You can use this in listening, in communication.

130
0:06:03.73,000 --> 0:06:05,000
If you're in any one of those roles --

131
0:06:05.97,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and I think that probably is everybody who's listening to this talk --

132
0:06:09.765,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the acronym is RASA,

133
0:06:11.472,000 --> 0:06:14,000
which is the Sanskrit word for "juice" or "essence."

134
0:06:15.503,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And RASA stands for "Receive," which means pay attention to the person;

135
0:06:20.336,000 --> 0:06:23,000
"Appreciate," making little noises like "hmm," "oh," "OK";

136
0:06:23.762,000 --> 0:06:26,000
"Summarize" -- the word "so" is very important in communication;

137
0:06:27.173,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and "Ask," ask questions afterwards.

138
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now sound is my passion, it's my life.

139
0:06:32.576,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I wrote a whole book about it. So I live to listen.

140
0:06:35.134,000 --> 0:06:37,000
That's too much to ask for most people.

141
0:06:38.014,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously

142
0:06:41.985,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in order to live fully --

143
0:06:44.115,000 --> 0:06:47,000
connected in space and in time to the physical world around us,

144
0:06:47.829,000 --> 0:06:49,000
connected in understanding to each other,

145
0:06:50.379,000 --> 0:06:51,000
not to mention spiritually connected,

146
0:06:52.225,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation

147
0:06:56.061,000 --> 0:06:57,000
at its heart.

148
0:06:57.91,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That's why we need to teach listening in our schools as a skill.

149
0:07:03.777,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Why is it not taught? It's crazy.

150
0:07:06.174,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And if we can teach listening in our schools,

151
0:07:08.657,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we can take our listening off that slippery slope

152
0:07:11.419,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about,

153
0:07:13.989,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time,

154
0:07:17.741,000 --> 0:07:18,000
or at least capable of doing it.

155
0:07:19.545,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Now, I don't know how to do that,

156
0:07:21.45,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but this is TED,

157
0:07:23.447,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and I think the TED community is capable of anything.

158
0:07:26.541,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other,

159
0:07:29.825,000 --> 0:07:3,000
take this mission out.

160
0:07:31.054,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And let's get listening taught in schools,

161
0:07:33.131,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and transform the world in one generation

162
0:07:35.153,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to a conscious, listening world -- a world of connection,

163
0:07:37.899,000 --> 0:07:38,000
a world of understanding

164
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and a world of peace.

165
0:07:40.91,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Thank you for listening to me today.

166
0:07:42.689,000 --> 0:07:44,000

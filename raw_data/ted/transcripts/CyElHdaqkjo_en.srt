1
0:00:12.68,000 --> 0:00:15,000
You know, I didn't set out to be a parenting expert.

2
0:00:16.52,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In fact, I'm not very interested in parenting, per Se.

3
0:00:21.08,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's just that there's a certain style of parenting these days

4
0:00:25.04,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that is kind of messing up kids,

5
0:00:28.239,000 --> 0:00:33,000
impeding their chances to develop into theirselves.

6
0:00:33.32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
There's a certain style of parenting these days

7
0:00:35.56,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that's getting in the way.

8
0:00:36.92,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I guess what I'm saying is,

9
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we spend a lot of time being very concerned

10
0:00:40.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
about parents who aren't involved enough in the lives of their kids

11
0:00:44.32,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and their education or their upbringing,

12
0:00:46.28,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and rightly so.

13
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But at the other end of the spectrum,

14
0:00:50.4,000 --> 0:00:52,000
there's a lot of harm going on there as well,

15
0:00:53.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
where parents feel a kid can't be successful

16
0:00:56.08,000 --> 0:01:,000
unless the parent is protecting and preventing at every turn

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and hovering over every happening, and micromanaging every moment,

18
0:01:03.92,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and steering their kid towards some small subset of colleges and careers.

19
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When we raise kids this way,

20
0:01:13.4,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I'll say we,

21
0:01:15.12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because Lord knows, in raising my two teenagers,

22
0:01:17.92,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I've had these tendencies myself,

23
0:01:20.68,000 --> 0:01:23,000
our kids end up leading a kind of checklisted childhood.

24
0:01:25.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And here's what the checklisted childhood looks like.

25
0:01:27.92,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We keep them safe and sound

26
0:01:30.84,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and fed and watered,

27
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and then we want to be sure they go to the right schools,

28
0:01:36.24,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that they're in the right classes at the right schools,

29
0:01:38.84,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and that they get the right grades in the right classes in the right schools.

30
0:01:42.484,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But not just the grades, the scores,

31
0:01:44.24,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and not just the grades and scores, but the accolades and the awards

32
0:01:47.48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and the sports, the activities, the leadership.

33
0:01:49.695,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We tell our kids, don't just join a club,

34
0:01:51.64,000 --> 0:01:53,000
start a club, because colleges want to see that.

35
0:01:53.92,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And check the box for community service.

36
0:01:55.88,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I mean, show the colleges you care about others.

37
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:00.28,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And all of this is done to some hoped-for degree of perfection.

39
0:02:05.24,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We expect our kids to perform at a level of perfection

40
0:02:07.88,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we were never asked to perform at ourselves,

41
0:02:11.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and so because so much is required,

42
0:02:13.44,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we think,

43
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
well then, of course we parents have to argue with every teacher

44
0:02:17.92,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and principal and coach and referee

45
0:02:20.52,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and act like our kid's concierge

46
0:02:23.44,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and personal handler

47
0:02:25.88,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and secretary.

48
0:02:27.72,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And then with our kids, our precious kids,

49
0:02:29.92,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we spend so much time nudging,

50
0:02:32.08,000 --> 0:02:36,000
cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling, nagging as the case may be,

51
0:02:36.52,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to be sure they're not screwing up,

52
0:02:39.4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
not closing doors,

53
0:02:41.92,000 --> 0:02:43,000
not ruining their future,

54
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
some hoped-for admission

55
0:02:46.72,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to a tiny handful of colleges

56
0:02:49.36,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that deny almost every applicant.

57
0:02:54.68,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And here's what it feels like to be a kid in this checklisted childhood.

58
0:03:00.12,000 --> 0:03:02,000
First of all, there's no time for free play.

59
0:03:02.64,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There's no room in the afternoons,

60
0:03:04.32,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because everything has to be enriching, we think.

61
0:03:07.36,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's as if every piece of homework, every quiz, every activity

62
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is a make-or-break moment for this future we have in mind for them,

63
0:03:15.32,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we absolve them of helping out around the house,

64
0:03:18.28,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and we even absolve them of getting enough sleep

65
0:03:21.68,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as long as they're checking off the items on their checklist.

66
0:03:26.6,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And in the checklisted childhood, we say we just want them to be happy,

67
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but when they come home from school,

68
0:03:32.52,000 --> 0:03:35,000
what we ask about all too often first

69
0:03:35.68,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is their homework and their grades.

70
0:03:38.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And they see in our faces

71
0:03:40.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that our approval, that our love,

72
0:03:43.36,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that their very worth,

73
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:46,000
comes from A's.

74
0:03:46.88,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And then we walk alongside them

75
0:03:49.48,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and offer clucking praise like a trainer at the Westminster Dog Show --

76
0:03:54.2,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:55.44,000 --> 0:04:,000
coaxing them to just jump a little higher and soar a little farther,

78
0:04:00.76,000 --> 0:04:03,000
day after day after day.

79
0:04:03.84,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And when they get to high school,

80
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:07,000
they don't say, "Well, what might I be interested in studying

81
0:04:08.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or doing as an activity?"

82
0:04:09.8,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They go to counselors and they say,

83
0:04:11.52,000 --> 0:04:14,000
"What do I need to do to get into the right college?"

84
0:04:15.12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And then, when the grades start to roll in in high school,

85
0:04:18.08,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and they're getting some B's,

86
0:04:19.68,000 --> 0:04:21,000
or God forbid some C's,

87
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:23,000
they frantically text their friends

88
0:04:24.04,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and say, "Has anyone ever gotten into the right college with these grades?"

89
0:04:29.959,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And our kids,

90
0:04:31.519,000 --> 0:04:34,000
regardless of where they end up at the end of high school,

91
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they're breathless.

92
0:04:37.4,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They're brittle.

93
0:04:38.64,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They're a little burned out.

94
0:04:40.48,000 --> 0:04:41,000
They're a little old before their time,

95
0:04:42.4,000 --> 0:04:46,000
wishing the grown-ups in their lives had said, "What you've done is enough,

96
0:04:46.44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
this effort you've put forth in childhood is enough."

97
0:04:49.44,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And they're withering now under high rates of anxiety and depression

98
0:04:53.72,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and some of them are wondering,

99
0:04:55.96,000 --> 0:04:59,000
will this life ever turn out to have been worth it?

100
0:05:01.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Well, we parents,

101
0:05:03.56,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we parents are pretty sure it's all worth it.

102
0:05:06.96,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We seem to behave --

103
0:05:08.2,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it's like we literally think they will have no future

104
0:05:10.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
if they don't get into one of these tiny set of colleges or careers

105
0:05:15.68,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we have in mind for them.

106
0:05:17.92,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid

107
0:05:21.04,000 --> 0:05:23,000
they won't have a future we can brag about

108
0:05:23.4,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to our friends and with stickers on the backs of our cars.

109
0:05:29.6,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Yeah.

110
0:05:30.84,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Applause)

111
0:05:36.92,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But if you look at what we've done,

112
0:05:39.48,000 --> 0:05:42,000
if you have the courage to really look at it,

113
0:05:43.04,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you'll see that not only do our kids think their worth comes

114
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:47,000
from grades and scores,

115
0:05:47.76,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but that when we live right up inside their precious developing minds

116
0:05:51.68,000 --> 0:05:55,000
all the time, like our very own version of the movie "Being John Malkovich,"

117
0:05:56.28,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we send our children the message:

118
0:05:58.24,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"Hey kid, I don't think you can actually achieve any of this without me."

119
0:06:03.48,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And so with our overhelp,

120
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
our overprotection and overdirection and hand-holding,

121
0:06:08.72,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we deprive our kids of the chance to build self-efficacy,

122
0:06:12.76,000 --> 0:06:15,000
which is a really fundamental tenet of the human psyche,

123
0:06:16.48,000 --> 0:06:18,000
far more important than that self-esteem they get

124
0:06:19.12,000 --> 0:06:2,000
every time we applaud.

125
0:06:21.12,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Self-efficacy is built when one sees that one's own actions lead to outcomes,

126
0:06:27.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
not --

127
0:06:28.56,000 --> 0:06:29,000
There you go.

128
0:06:29.8,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:33.6,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Not one's parents' actions on one's behalf,

130
0:06:37.4,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but when one's own actions lead to outcomes.

131
0:06:40.2,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So simply put,

132
0:06:41.72,000 --> 0:06:46,000
if our children are to develop self-efficacy, and they must,

133
0:06:47.08,000 --> 0:06:51,000
then they have to do a whole lot more of the thinking, planning, deciding,

134
0:06:51.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
doing, hoping, coping, trial and error,

135
0:06:55.56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
dreaming and experiencing of life

136
0:06:58.72,000 --> 0:06:59,000
for themselves.

137
0:07:01.28,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, am I saying

138
0:07:03.8,000 --> 0:07:05,000
every kid is hard-working and motivated

139
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and doesn't need a parent's involvement or interest in their lives,

140
0:07:09.36,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and we should just back off and let go?

141
0:07:12.04,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Hell no.

142
0:07:13.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:14.52,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That is not what I'm saying.

144
0:07:16.24,000 --> 0:07:19,000
What I'm saying is, when we treat grades and scores and accolades and awards

145
0:07:19.88,000 --> 0:07:21,000
as the purpose of childhood,

146
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
all in furtherance of some hoped-for admission to a tiny number of colleges

147
0:07:25.8,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or entrance to a small number of careers,

148
0:07:28.8,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that that's too narrow a definition of success for our kids.

149
0:07:33.2,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And even though we might help them achieve some short-term wins

150
0:07:36.76,000 --> 0:07:37,000
by overhelping --

151
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
like they get a better grade if we help them do their homework,

152
0:07:42.32,000 --> 0:07:45,000
they might end up with a longer childhood résumé when we help --

153
0:07:47.12,000 --> 0:07:5,000
what I'm saying is that all of this comes at a long-term cost

154
0:07:50.52,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to their sense of self.

155
0:07:52.6,000 --> 0:07:54,000
What I'm saying is, we should be less concerned

156
0:07:55.04,000 --> 0:07:56,000
with the specific set of colleges

157
0:07:56.88,000 --> 0:07:59,000
they might be able to apply to or might get into

158
0:08:00.12,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and far more concerned that they have the habits, the mindset, the skill set,

159
0:08:05.04,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the wellness, to be successful wherever they go.

160
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:11,000
What I'm saying is,

161
0:08:11.24,000 --> 0:08:15,000
our kids need us to be a little less obsessed with grades and scores

162
0:08:15.84,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and a whole lot more interested

163
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
in childhood providing a foundation for their success

164
0:08:23.28,000 --> 0:08:25,000
built on things like love

165
0:08:27.24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and chores.

166
0:08:28.48,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

167
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:35.24,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Did I just say chores? Did I just say chores? I really did.

169
0:08:39.92,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But really, here's why.

170
0:08:43.28,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The longest longitudinal study of humans ever conducted

171
0:08:46.96,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is called the Harvard Grant Study.

172
0:08:49.159,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It found that professional success in life,

173
0:08:51.52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which is what we want for our kids,

174
0:08:54.12,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that professional success in life comes from having done chores as a kid,

175
0:08:57.92,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and the earlier you started, the better,

176
0:08:59.96,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that a roll-up-your-sleeves- and-pitch-in mindset,

177
0:09:02.36,000 --> 0:09:04,000
a mindset that says, there's some unpleasant work,

178
0:09:04.76,000 --> 0:09:06,000
someone's got to do it, it might as well be me,

179
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a mindset that says,

180
0:09:08.24,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I will contribute my effort to the betterment of the whole,

181
0:09:11.36,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that that's what gets you ahead in the workplace.

182
0:09:14.44,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now, we all know this. You know this.

183
0:09:17.36,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Applause)

184
0:09:20.2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We all know this, and yet, in the checklisted childhood,

185
0:09:23.8,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we absolve our kids of doing the work of chores around the house,

186
0:09:27.6,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and then they end up as young adults in the workplace

187
0:09:30.12,000 --> 0:09:32,000
still waiting for a checklist,

188
0:09:32.36,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but it doesn't exist,

189
0:09:33.84,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and more importantly, lacking the impulse, the instinct

190
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to roll up their sleeves and pitch in

191
0:09:39.4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and look around and wonder, how can I be useful to my colleagues?

192
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:47,000
How can I anticipate a few steps ahead to what my boss might need?

193
0:09:48.28,000 --> 0:09:51,000
A second very important finding from the Harvard Grant Study

194
0:09:52.92,000 --> 0:09:53,000
said that happiness in life

195
0:09:55.72,000 --> 0:09:56,000
comes from love,

196
0:09:57.6,000 --> 0:09:58,000
not love of work,

197
0:09:59.48,000 --> 0:10:01,000
love of humans:

198
0:10:02.4,000 --> 0:10:05,000
our spouse, our partner, our friends, our family.

199
0:10:06.6,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So childhood needs to teach our kids how to love,

200
0:10:10.32,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and they can't love others if they don't first love themselves,

201
0:10:13.32,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and they won't love themselves if we can't offer them unconditional love.

202
0:10:17.32,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Applause)

203
0:10:21.6,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Right.

204
0:10:24.24,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And so,

205
0:10:26.04,000 --> 0:10:28,000
instead of being obsessed with grades and scores

206
0:10:28.32,000 --> 0:10:3,000
when our precious offspring come home from school,

207
0:10:31.24,000 --> 0:10:32,000
or we come home from work,

208
0:10:32.76,000 --> 0:10:34,000
we need to close our technology, put away our phones,

209
0:10:35.56,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and look them in the eye

210
0:10:36.96,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and let them see the joy that fills our faces

211
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
when we see our child for the first time in a few hours.

212
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And then we have to say,

213
0:10:45.28,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"How was your day?

214
0:10:47.84,000 --> 0:10:49,000
What did you like about today?"

215
0:10:50.68,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And when your teenage daughter says, "Lunch," like mine did,

216
0:10:54.44,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I want to hear about the math test,

217
0:10:56.52,000 --> 0:10:57,000
not lunch,

218
0:10:57.96,000 --> 0:11:,000
you have to still take an interest in lunch.

219
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You gotta say, "What was great about lunch today?"

220
0:11:04.2,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They need to know they matter to us as humans,

221
0:11:07.6,000 --> 0:11:09,000
not because of their GPA.

222
0:11:11.64,000 --> 0:11:13,000
All right, so you're thinking, chores and love,

223
0:11:13.88,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that sounds all well and good, but give me a break.

224
0:11:16.4,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The colleges want to see top scores and grades

225
0:11:19.4,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and accolades and awards, and I'm going to tell you, sort of.

226
0:11:25.08,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The very biggest brand-name schools are asking that of our young adults,

227
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but here's the good news.

228
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Contrary to what the college rankings racket would have us believe --

229
0:11:38.28,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Applause)

230
0:11:44.04,000 --> 0:11:46,000
you don't have to go to one of the biggest brand name schools

231
0:11:46.96,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to be happy and successful in life.

232
0:11:48.72,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Happy and successful people went to state school,

233
0:11:51.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
went to a small college no one has heard of,

234
0:11:53.88,000 --> 0:11:54,000
went to community college,

235
0:11:55.48,000 --> 0:11:57,000
went to a college over here and flunked out.

236
0:11:58.24,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Applause)

237
0:12:05.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The evidence is in this room, is in our communities,

238
0:12:08.24,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that this is the truth.

239
0:12:09.96,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And if we could widen our blinders

240
0:12:11.68,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and be willing to look at a few more colleges,

241
0:12:13.96,000 --> 0:12:16,000
maybe remove our own egos from the equation,

242
0:12:17.52,000 --> 0:12:2,000
we could accept and embrace this truth and then realize,

243
0:12:21.2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
it is hardly the end of the world

244
0:12:23.2,000 --> 0:12:26,000
if our kids don't go to one of those big brand-name schools.

245
0:12:27.96,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And more importantly,

246
0:12:29.24,000 --> 0:12:34,000
if their childhood has not been lived according to a tyrannical checklist

247
0:12:34.36,000 --> 0:12:36,000
then when they get to college,

248
0:12:36.52,000 --> 0:12:37,000
whichever one it is,

249
0:12:38.48,000 --> 0:12:41,000
well, they'll have gone there on their own volition,

250
0:12:41.6,000 --> 0:12:43,000
fueled by their own desire,

251
0:12:44.08,000 --> 0:12:47,000
capable and ready to thrive there.

252
0:12:49.36,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I have to admit something to you.

253
0:12:51.76,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I've got two kids I mentioned, Sawyer and Avery.

254
0:12:54.88,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They're teenagers.

255
0:12:56.6,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And once upon a time,

256
0:12:58.48,000 --> 0:13:,000
I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery

257
0:13:01.12,000 --> 0:13:02,000
like little bonsai trees --

258
0:13:02.92,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Laughter)

259
0:13:05.28,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that I was going to carefully clip and prune

260
0:13:08.24,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and shape into some perfect form of a human

261
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that might just be perfect enough to warrant them admission

262
0:13:15.68,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to one of the most highly selective colleges.

263
0:13:19.04,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But I've come to realize, after working with thousands of other people's kids --

264
0:13:23.64,000 --> 0:13:24,000
(Laughter)

265
0:13:26.48,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and raising two kids of my own,

266
0:13:30.2,000 --> 0:13:32,000
my kids aren't bonsai trees.

267
0:13:33.8,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They're wildflowers

268
0:13:36.4,000 --> 0:13:38,000
of an unknown genus and species --

269
0:13:39.24,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

270
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and it's my job to provide a nourishing environment,

271
0:13:44.6,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to strengthen them through chores

272
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and to love them so they can love others and receive love

273
0:13:51.32,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and the college, the major, the career,

274
0:13:54.44,000 --> 0:13:55,000
that's up to them.

275
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
My job is not to make them become what I would have them become,

276
0:14:01.84,000 --> 0:14:05,000
but to support them in becoming their glorious selves.

277
0:14:07.4,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Thank you.

278
0:14:08.64,000 --> 0:14:14,000
(Applause)

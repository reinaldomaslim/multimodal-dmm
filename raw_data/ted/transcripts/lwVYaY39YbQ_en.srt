1
0:00:12.892,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to tell you a story about a girl.

2
0:00:16.335,000 --> 0:00:18,000
But I can't tell you her real name.

3
0:00:18.835,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So let's just call her Hadiza.

4
0:00:21.381,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Hadiza is 20.

5
0:00:23.459,000 --> 0:00:24,000
She's shy,

6
0:00:24.634,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but she has a beautiful smile that lights up her face.

7
0:00:28.779,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But she's in constant pain.

8
0:00:32.463,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And she will likely be on medication for the rest of her life.

9
0:00:36.866,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Do you want to know why?

10
0:00:39.784,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Hadiza is a Chibok girl,

11
0:00:42.665,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped

12
0:00:45.922,000 --> 0:00:46,000
by Boko Haram terrorists.

13
0:00:48.29,000 --> 0:00:5,000
She managed to escape, though,

14
0:00:50.823,000 --> 0:00:53,000
by jumping off the truck that was carrying the girls.

15
0:00:54.044,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But when she landed, she broke both her legs,

16
0:00:57.361,000 --> 0:01:,000
and she had to crawl on her tummy to hide in the bushes.

17
0:01:00.805,000 --> 0:01:04,000
She told me she was terrified that Boko Haram would come back for her.

18
0:01:05.524,000 --> 0:01:09,000
She was one of 57 girls who would escape by jumping off trucks that day.

19
0:01:10.175,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This story, quite rightly, caused ripples

20
0:01:12.74,000 --> 0:01:13,000
around the world.

21
0:01:14.136,000 --> 0:01:17,000
People like Michelle Obama, Malala and others

22
0:01:17.43,000 --> 0:01:19,000
lent their voices in protest,

23
0:01:19.546,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and at about the same time -- I was living in London at the time --

24
0:01:22.831,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I was sent from London to Abuja to cover the World Economic Forum

25
0:01:27.498,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that Nigeria was hosting for the first time.

26
0:01:30.475,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But when we arrived, it was clear that there was only one story in town.

27
0:01:35.729,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We put the government under pressure.

28
0:01:37.598,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We asked tough questions about what they were doing

29
0:01:40.184,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to bring these girls back.

30
0:01:42.199,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Understandably,

31
0:01:43.947,000 --> 0:01:45,000
they weren't too happy with our line of questioning,

32
0:01:46.778,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and let's just say we received our fair share of "alternative facts."

33
0:01:50.551,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:53.256,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Influential Nigerians were telling us at the time

35
0:01:56.478,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that we were naïve,

36
0:01:58.499,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we didn't understand the political situation in Nigeria.

37
0:02:02.72,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But they also told us

38
0:02:04.839,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that the story of the Chibok girls

39
0:02:07.471,000 --> 0:02:08,000
was a hoax.

40
0:02:10.085,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,

41
0:02:12.809,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and there are still people in Nigeria today

42
0:02:15.123,000 --> 0:02:17,000
who believe that the Chibok girls were never kidnapped.

43
0:02:18.751,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Yet I was talking to people like these --

44
0:02:22.221,000 --> 0:02:23,000
devastated parents,

45
0:02:23.95,000 --> 0:02:27,000
who told us that on the day Boko Haram kidnapped their daughters,

46
0:02:28.028,000 --> 0:02:32,000
they ran into the Sambisa Forest after the trucks carrying their daughters.

47
0:02:32.626,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They were armed with machetes, but they were forced to turn back

48
0:02:36.378,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because Boko Haram had guns.

49
0:02:39.165,000 --> 0:02:42,000
For two years, inevitably, the news agenda moved on,

50
0:02:42.852,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and for two years,

51
0:02:44.606,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we didn't hear much about the Chibok girls.

52
0:02:47.789,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Everyone presumed they were dead.

53
0:02:50.053,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But in April last year,

54
0:02:52.064,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I was able to obtain this video.

55
0:02:54.856,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is a still from the video

56
0:02:56.62,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,

57
0:03:00.743,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and through a source, I obtained this video.

58
0:03:03.929,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But before I could publish it,

59
0:03:05.49,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I had to travel to the northeast of Nigeria

60
0:03:08.539,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to talk to the parents, to verify it.

61
0:03:11.137,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I didn't have to wait too long for confirmation.

62
0:03:15.45,000 --> 0:03:18,000
One of the mothers, when she watched the video, told me

63
0:03:18.804,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that if she could have reached into the laptop

64
0:03:21.528,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and pulled our her child from the laptop,

65
0:03:25.571,000 --> 0:03:26,000
she would have done so.

66
0:03:28.023,000 --> 0:03:31,000
For those of you who are parents, like myself, in the audience,

67
0:03:31.269,000 --> 0:03:33,000
you can only imagine the anguish

68
0:03:34.121,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that that mother felt.

69
0:03:37.421,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This video would go on to kick-start negotiation talks with Boko Haram.

70
0:03:43.999,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And a Nigerian senator told me that because of this video

71
0:03:47.991,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they entered into those talks,

72
0:03:50.008,000 --> 0:03:53,000
because they had long presumed that the Chibok girls were dead.

73
0:03:54.459,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Twenty-one girls were freed in October last year.

74
0:03:59.185,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Sadly, nearly 200 of them still remain missing.

75
0:04:03.511,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I must confess that I have not been a dispassionate observer

76
0:04:07.732,000 --> 0:04:08,000
covering this story.

77
0:04:08.942,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I am furious when I think about the wasted opportunities

78
0:04:14.052,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to rescue these girls.

79
0:04:15.265,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I am furious when I think about what the parents have told me,

80
0:04:19.189,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that if these were daughters of the rich and the powerful,

81
0:04:21.987,000 --> 0:04:23,000
they would have been found much earlier.

82
0:04:26.101,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I am furious

83
0:04:28.133,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that the hoax narrative,

84
0:04:30.085,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I firmly believe,

85
0:04:31.987,000 --> 0:04:33,000
caused a delay;

86
0:04:34.123,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it was part of the reason for the delay in their return.

87
0:04:38.5,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This illustrates to me the deadly danger of fake news.

88
0:04:43.039,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So what can we do about it?

89
0:04:45.703,000 --> 0:04:46,000
There are some very smart people,

90
0:04:47.644,000 --> 0:04:49,000
smart engineers at Google and Facebook,

91
0:04:50.127,000 --> 0:04:55,000
who are trying to use technology to stop the spread of fake news.

92
0:04:55.216,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But beyond that, I think everybody here -- you and I --

93
0:04:59.991,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we have a role to play in that.

94
0:05:02.202,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We are the ones who share the content.

95
0:05:04.519,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We are the ones who share the stories online.

96
0:05:07.054,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In this day and age, we're all publishers,

97
0:05:10.355,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we have responsibility.

98
0:05:12.87,000 --> 0:05:14,000
In my job as a journalist,

99
0:05:15.204,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I check, I verify.

100
0:05:17.256,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.

101
0:05:21.44,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Why is this person telling me this story?

102
0:05:24.34,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What do they have to gain by sharing this information?

103
0:05:27.863,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Do they have a hidden agenda?

104
0:05:30.502,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I really believe that we must all start to ask tougher questions

105
0:05:36.017,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of information that we discover online.

106
0:05:41.493,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Research shows that some of us don't even read beyond headlines

107
0:05:47.248,000 --> 0:05:49,000
before we share stories.

108
0:05:49.375,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Who here has done that?

109
0:05:51.764,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I know I have.

110
0:05:54.255,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But what if

111
0:05:57.115,000 --> 0:06:01,000
we stopped taking information that we discover at face value?

112
0:06:02.07,000 --> 0:06:05,000
What if we stop to think about the consequence

113
0:06:05.667,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of the information that we pass on

114
0:06:08.14,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and its potential to incite violence or hatred?

115
0:06:12.415,000 --> 0:06:16,000
What if we stop to think about the real-life consequences

116
0:06:16.974,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of the information that we share?

117
0:06:19.925,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Thank you very much for listening.

118
0:06:21.749,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Applause)

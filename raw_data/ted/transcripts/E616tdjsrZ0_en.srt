0:00:12.031,000 --> 0:00:14,000
You don't really look at a toothbrush and say,

3
0:00:14.562,000 --> 0:00:15,000
"I'm great!"

4
0:00:15.737,000 --> 0:00:17,000
But when you look at an Afro pick, which is a grooming tool,

5
0:00:18.598,000 --> 0:00:2,000
it can remind you in your subconscious to, like,

6
0:00:20.873,000 --> 0:00:22,000
really be proud and, like, "All right."

7
0:00:24.008,000 --> 0:00:25,000
[Small thing.]

8
0:00:25.542,000 --> 0:00:26,000
[Big idea.]

9
0:00:29.492,000 --> 0:00:32,000
An Afro pick is a utilitarian tool

10
0:00:32.913,000 --> 0:00:35,000
used to maintain the Afro hairstyle.

11
0:00:36.787,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I think the Afro pick was designed

12
0:00:39.278,000 --> 0:00:41,000
for the ergonomics of creating something

13
0:00:41.741,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that felt like you were running fingers through your hair.

14
0:00:44.502,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The shape, even the depth that it goes in -- it's like a hand.

15
0:00:47.832,000 --> 0:00:5,000
You have plastic or nylon teeth,

16
0:00:51.218,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and then you have the stainless steel or the nickel teeth.

17
0:00:54.458,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I always prefer the metal tooth

18
0:00:56.705,000 --> 0:00:57,000
just 'cause I like the sound

19
0:00:58.433,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and the ones I know have the black power fist on the handle.

20
0:01:01.921,000 --> 0:01:03,000
When I think of black hair in America,

21
0:01:04.121,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I think of something that's been policed.

22
0:01:06.571,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Back in the days, it was expected for black people

23
0:01:09.201,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to chemically treat their hair.

24
0:01:10.889,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Whether that's healthy for them is a secondary thing to blending in.

25
0:01:15.082,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In the 50s, dancer Ruth Beckford and a lot of jazz singers

26
0:01:18.563,000 --> 0:01:19,000
were tired of straightening their hair,

27
0:01:20.472,000 --> 0:01:23,000
so they said, all right, we're going to just let it grow naturally

28
0:01:23.673,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and started rocking natural, close-cropped hair.

29
0:01:26.557,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And in the 60s, that style evolved

30
0:01:29.591,000 --> 0:01:3,000
with the formation of the Afro,

31
0:01:31.341,000 --> 0:01:34,000
which was the cropped hair, natural, picked out

32
0:01:34.494,000 --> 0:01:36,000
into a more spherical shape.

33
0:01:37.251,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You had civil rights leaders, activists, that adopted the hairstyle

34
0:01:42.09,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as a means of rebellion and black pride.

35
0:01:44.943,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And then you had musicians like James Brown,

36
0:01:47.032,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who was infamously known for chemically straightening his hair,

37
0:01:50.202,000 --> 0:01:51,000
reject that and go natural.

38
0:01:51.751,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It went hand-in-hand with his music,

39
0:01:53.519,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so he had songs like "Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud."

40
0:01:56.417,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The black is beautiful movement

41
0:01:58.172,000 --> 0:02:,000
is just rejecting the notion that to be black

42
0:02:01.135,000 --> 0:02:04,000
or to have darker skin, to have a curlier grade of hair,

43
0:02:04.754,000 --> 0:02:06,000
was something to be ashamed of.

44
0:02:06.921,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I have one of my favorite pictures of my mother

45
0:02:09.422,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and my grandmother,

46
0:02:10.734,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and my grandmother had a small 'fro,

47
0:02:13.143,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and that was in the 60s.

48
0:02:14.821,000 --> 0:02:18,000
African hair combs date back to 3500 BCE.

49
0:02:18.871,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The oldest African combs are found in ancient Egypt and Sudan,

50
0:02:23.706,000 --> 0:02:25,000
so they were making pyramids and combs.

51
0:02:26.398,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The way the ancient African combs were embellished

52
0:02:29.459,000 --> 0:02:32,000
represented status or tribal affiliation.

53
0:02:32.923,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's no coincidence that the fist on the modern Afro pick

54
0:02:37.405,000 --> 0:02:39,000
also sets the tone for affiliation

55
0:02:39.952,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and what set you claim.

56
0:02:42.015,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And then there's the Black Power movement.

57
0:02:44.255,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Most movements need their icons, right?

58
0:02:46.389,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You have the fist, you have the 'fro.

59
0:02:48.731,000 --> 0:02:5,000
These things coincide with the Black Panther aesthetic,

60
0:02:51.439,000 --> 0:02:53,000
where you could kind of spot your tribe from afar,

61
0:02:54.069,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because you're not just keeping a pick in, like, your beauty kit.

62
0:02:57.142,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It's in your back pocket,

63
0:02:58.696,000 --> 0:03:,000
purposely with the first outside of it,

64
0:03:01.091,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and in your hair, you'll rock it in your 'fro.

65
0:03:03.489,000 --> 0:03:04,000
If I think about iconic Afros,

66
0:03:05.424,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I definitely think about Angela Davis.

67
0:03:07.71,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Her 'fro personifies elegance, style,

68
0:03:10.788,000 --> 0:03:11,000
freedom, rebellion.

69
0:03:12.571,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You feel all of these feelings at once

70
0:03:14.451,000 --> 0:03:17,000
when you see Angela Davis fighting for her life in federal court.

71
0:03:17.731,000 --> 0:03:2,000
By the 80s, the Afro style became less radical.

72
0:03:21.313,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The Afro picks are still produced to this day

73
0:03:23.808,000 --> 0:03:24,000
with the clenched fist,

74
0:03:24.983,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so it's the remnants of the movement

75
0:03:26.948,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in the everyday object.

76
0:03:29.193,000 --> 0:03:31,000
When I was young, it was just, like, another object.

77
0:03:31.951,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It was a comb.

78
0:03:33.168,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But as I became more enlightened

79
0:03:35.408,000 --> 0:03:37,000
to really understand the roots and the origin

80
0:03:37.888,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and the intentionality of the design

81
0:03:40.48,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and why the fist and all of these things ...

82
0:03:44.716,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I woke up.

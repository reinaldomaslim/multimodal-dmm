1
0:00:12.935,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today I am going to teach you

2
0:00:15.049,000 --> 0:00:18,000
how to play my favorite game:

3
0:00:18.809,000 --> 0:00:21,000
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

4
0:00:22.292,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's the only game in the world that I know of

5
0:00:25.612,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that allows you, the player,

6
0:00:27.679,000 --> 0:00:29,000
the opportunity to experience

7
0:00:30.098,000 --> 0:00:34,000
10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less.

8
0:00:34.486,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is true, so if you play this game with me today

9
0:00:36.998,000 --> 0:00:38,000
for just one single minute,

10
0:00:39.001,000 --> 0:00:42,000
you will get to feel joy, relief, love, surprise,

11
0:00:42.701,000 --> 0:00:45,000
pride, curiosity, excitement, awe and wonder,

12
0:00:45.767,000 --> 0:00:46,000
contentment, and creativity,

13
0:00:47.365,000 --> 0:00:48,000
all in the span of one minute.

14
0:00:48.904,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So this sounds pretty good, right? Now you're willing to play.

15
0:00:51.236,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In order to teach you this game,

16
0:00:52.799,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'm going to need some volunteers

17
0:00:54.172,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to come up onstage really quickly,

18
0:00:56.075,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and we're going to do a little hands-on demo.

19
0:00:57.553,000 --> 0:00:59,000
While they're coming up, I should let you know,

20
0:00:59.594,000 --> 0:01:01,000
this game was invented 10 years ago

21
0:01:02.056,000 --> 0:01:05,000
by an artists' collective in Austria named Monochrom.

22
0:01:05.353,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So thank you, Monochrom.

23
0:01:07.098,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Okay, so most people are familiar

24
0:01:09.141,000 --> 0:01:1,000
with traditional, two-person thumb-wrestling.

25
0:01:11.133,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Sunni, let's just remind them.

26
0:01:12.721,000 --> 0:01:14,000
One, two, three, four, I declare a thumb war, and we wrestle,

27
0:01:15.507,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and of course Sunni beats me because she's the best.

28
0:01:17.607,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

29
0:01:21.411,000 --> 0:01:22,000
we're the gamer generation.

30
0:01:22.822,000 --> 0:01:24,000
There are a billion gamers on the planet now,

31
0:01:25.173,000 --> 0:01:26,000
so we need more of a challenge.

32
0:01:26.727,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So the first thing we need is more thumbs.

33
0:01:30.106,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So Eric, come on over.

34
0:01:31.8,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So we could get three thumbs together,

35
0:01:34.611,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and Peter could join us.

36
0:01:37.069,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We could even have four thumbs together,

37
0:01:38.789,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the way you win

38
0:01:40.316,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is you're the first person to pin someone else's thumb.

39
0:01:43.513,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This is really important. You can't, like,

40
0:01:45.371,000 --> 0:01:47,000
wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute.

41
0:01:47.908,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That is not how you win.

42
0:01:49.403,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Ah, who did that? Eric you did that.

43
0:01:50.738,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So Eric would have won. He was the first person to pin my thumb.

44
0:01:53.54,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Okay, so that's the first rule,

45
0:01:54.95,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and we can see that three or four

46
0:01:56.809,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node,

47
0:01:59.988,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but if you feel ambitious, you don't have to hold back.

48
0:02:02.63,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We can really go for it.

49
0:02:03.995,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So you can see up here.

50
0:02:06.161,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Now the only other rule you need to remember is,

51
0:02:09.133,000 --> 0:02:11,000
gamer generation, we like a challenge.

52
0:02:11.4,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I happen to notice you all have

53
0:02:13.047,000 --> 0:02:14,000
some thumbs you're not using.

54
0:02:14.883,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So I think we should kind of get some more involved.

55
0:02:17.89,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And if we had just four people,

56
0:02:19.66,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we would do it just like this,

57
0:02:21.498,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we would try and wrestle

58
0:02:23.184,000 --> 0:02:24,000
both thumbs at the same time.

59
0:02:24.965,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Perfect.

60
0:02:26.272,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, if we had more people in the room,

61
0:02:28.386,000 --> 0:02:29,000
instead of just wrestling in a closed node,

62
0:02:30.265,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we might reach out and try and grab some other people.

63
0:02:33.048,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And in fact, that's what we're going to do right now.

64
0:02:34.769,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We're going to try and get all, something like,

65
0:02:37.321,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I don't know, 1,500 thumbs in this room

66
0:02:40.297,000 --> 0:02:41,000
connected in a single node.

67
0:02:41.61,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And we have to connect both levels,

68
0:02:44.65,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so if you're up there, you're going to be

69
0:02:47.096,000 --> 0:02:49,000
reaching down and reaching up.

70
0:02:49.309,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now — (Laughter) —

71
0:02:50.983,000 --> 0:02:51,000
before we get started --

72
0:02:52.875,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is great. You're excited to play. —

73
0:02:55.908,000 --> 0:02:58,000
before we get started, can I have the slides back up here really quick,

74
0:02:58.988,000 --> 0:02:59,000
because if you get good at this game,

75
0:03:00.945,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I want you to know there are some advanced levels.

76
0:03:03.581,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So this is the kind of simple level, right?

77
0:03:06.493,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But there are advanced configurations.

78
0:03:08.405,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is called the Death Star Configuration.

79
0:03:10.415,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Any Star Wars fans?

80
0:03:12.122,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And this one's called the Möbius Strip.

81
0:03:14.47,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Any science geeks, you get that one.

82
0:03:16.29,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This is the hardest level. This is the extreme.

83
0:03:19.194,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So we'll stick with the normal one for now,

84
0:03:21.208,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I'm going to give you 30 seconds,

85
0:03:23.15,000 --> 0:03:25,000
every thumb into the node,

86
0:03:25.175,000 --> 0:03:26,000
connect the upper and the lower levels,

87
0:03:26.648,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you guys go on down there.

88
0:03:28.15,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Thirty seconds. Into the network. Make the node.

89
0:03:33.178,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Stand up! It's easier if you stand up.

90
0:03:35.932,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Everybody, up up up up up!

91
0:03:39.871,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Stand up, my friends.

92
0:03:43.161,000 --> 0:03:44,000
All right.

93
0:03:44.193,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Don't start wrestling yet.

94
0:03:47.001,000 --> 0:03:49,000
If you have a free thumb, wave it around,

95
0:03:49.781,000 --> 0:03:52,000
make sure it gets connected.

96
0:03:53.002,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Okay. We need to do a last-minute thumb check.

97
0:03:55.694,000 --> 0:03:58,000
If you have a free thumb, wave it around to make sure.

98
0:03:59.027,000 --> 0:04:,000
Grab that thumb!

99
0:04:00.52,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Reach behind you. There you go.

100
0:04:01.863,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Any other thumbs?

101
0:04:03.421,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Okay, on the count of three, you're going to go.

102
0:04:05.936,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Try to keep track. Grab, grab, grab it.

103
0:04:08.649,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Okay? One, two, three, go!

104
0:04:11.179,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:18.52,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Did you win? You got it? You got it? Excellent!

106
0:04:21.532,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Applause)

107
0:04:24.049,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Well done. Thank you. Thank you very much.

108
0:04:27.591,000 --> 0:04:28,000
All right.

109
0:04:28.996,000 --> 0:04:31,000
While you are basking in the glow

110
0:04:32.408,000 --> 0:04:33,000
of having won your first

111
0:04:34.21,000 --> 0:04:35,000
massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game,

112
0:04:35.825,000 --> 0:04:37,000
let's do a quick recap on the positive emotions.

113
0:04:38.415,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So curiosity.

114
0:04:40.354,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I said "massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling."

115
0:04:42.326,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You were like, "What the hell is she talking about?"

116
0:04:44.126,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So I provoked a little curiosity.

117
0:04:46.003,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Creativity: it took creativity to solve the problem

118
0:04:48.672,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of getting all the thumbs into the node.

119
0:04:50.031,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'm reaching around and I'm reaching up.

120
0:04:51.444,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So you used creativity. That was great.

121
0:04:52.998,000 --> 0:04:54,000
How about surprise? The actual feeling

122
0:04:55.25,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising.

123
0:04:57.912,000 --> 0:04:58,000
You heard that sound go up in the room.

124
0:04:59.772,000 --> 0:05:,000
We had excitement. As you started to wrestle,

125
0:05:01.611,000 --> 0:05:03,000
maybe you're starting to win or this person's, like, really into it,

126
0:05:03.816,000 --> 0:05:05,000
so you kind of get the excitement going.

127
0:05:06.302,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We have relief. You got to stand up.

128
0:05:08.245,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You've been sitting for awhile, so the physical relief,

129
0:05:10.003,000 --> 0:05:11,000
getting to shake it out.

130
0:05:11.32,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We had joy. You were laughing, smiling. Look at your faces. This room is full of joy.

131
0:05:15.88,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We had some contentment.

132
0:05:17.84,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I didn't see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing,

133
0:05:21.529,000 --> 0:05:22,000
so you were totally content to be playing.

134
0:05:23.522,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The most important three emotions,

135
0:05:25.21,000 --> 0:05:28,000
awe and wonder, we had everybody connected physically for a minute.

136
0:05:28.822,000 --> 0:05:29,000
When was the last time you were at TED

137
0:05:30.421,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room?

138
0:05:33.25,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And it's truly awesome and wondrous.

139
0:05:34.896,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And speaking of physical connection,

140
0:05:36.74,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin,

141
0:05:39.743,000 --> 0:05:42,000
you release oxytocin, you feel bonded to everyone in the room.

142
0:05:42.92,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly

143
0:05:45.436,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is to hold someone else's hand for at least six seconds.

144
0:05:47.935,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds,

145
0:05:50.487,000 --> 0:05:51,000
so we are all now biochemically primed

146
0:05:52.267,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to love each other. That is great.

147
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And the last emotion of pride.

148
0:05:57.044,000 --> 0:05:59,000
How many people are like me. Just admit it.

149
0:05:59.848,000 --> 0:06:,000
You lost both your thumbs.

150
0:06:00.994,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It just didn't work out for you.

151
0:06:02.943,000 --> 0:06:04,000
That's okay, because you learned a new skill today.

152
0:06:05.506,000 --> 0:06:07,000
You learned, from scratch, a game you never knew before.

153
0:06:08.27,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now you know how to play it. You can teach other people.

154
0:06:09.976,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So congratulations.

155
0:06:11.544,000 --> 0:06:13,000
How many of you won just won thumb?

156
0:06:13.865,000 --> 0:06:14,000
All right. I have very good news for you.

157
0:06:15.236,000 --> 0:06:16,000
According to the official rules

158
0:06:16.368,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling,

159
0:06:18.364,000 --> 0:06:21,000
this makes you a grandmaster of the game.

160
0:06:22.145,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Because there aren't that many people who know how to play,

161
0:06:24.377,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we have to kind of accelerate the program

162
0:06:26.576,000 --> 0:06:27,000
more than a game like chess.

163
0:06:28.169,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So congratulations, grandmasters.

164
0:06:29.962,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Win one thumb once, you will become a grandmaster.

165
0:06:32.453,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Did anybody win both their thumbs?

166
0:06:34.482,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Yes. Awesome. Okay.

167
0:06:35.981,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status.

168
0:06:38.904,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You guys, according to the rules,

169
0:06:40.67,000 --> 0:06:43,000
are legendary grandmasters, so congratulations.

170
0:06:44.346,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I will just leave you with this tip, if you want to play again.

171
0:06:47.075,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster,

172
0:06:48.863,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you've got your two nodes going on.

173
0:06:50.949,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Pick off the one that looks easiest.

174
0:06:52.671,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They're not paying attention. They look kind of weak.

175
0:06:54.652,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Focus on that one and do something crazy

176
0:06:56.736,000 --> 0:06:57,000
with this arm.

177
0:06:58.072,000 --> 0:07:,000
As soon as you win, suddenly stop.

178
0:07:00.401,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Everybody is thrown off. You go in for the kill.

179
0:07:02.201,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That's how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling.

180
0:07:04.767,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game.

181
0:07:07.294,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Wooo! (Applause)

182
0:07:09.13,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Thank you. (Applause)

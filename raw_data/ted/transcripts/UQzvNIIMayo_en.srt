1
0:00:14.372,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Consider the following statement:

2
0:00:16.627,000 --> 0:00:19,000
human beings only use 10 percent of their brain capacity.

3
0:00:21.23,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you

4
0:00:23.553,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that while Morgan Freeman delivered this line

5
0:00:25.68,000 --> 0:00:27,000
with the gravitas that makes him a great actor,

6
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:3,000
this statement is entirely false.

7
0:00:30.981,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:32.085,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The truth is, human beings use 100 percent of their brain capacity.

9
0:00:37.348,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The brain is a highly efficient, energy-demanding organ

10
0:00:40.927,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that gets fully utilized

11
0:00:43.173,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and even though it is at full capacity being used,

12
0:00:47.688,000 --> 0:00:49,000
it suffers from a problem of information overload.

13
0:00:50.196,000 --> 0:00:53,000
There's far too much in the environment than it can fully process.

14
0:00:53.785,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So to solve this problem of overload,

15
0:00:56.897,000 --> 0:00:57,000
evolution devised a solution,

16
0:00:58.881,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which is the brain's attention system.

17
0:01:01.332,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Attention allows us

18
0:01:03.442,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to notice, select and direct the brain's computational resources

19
0:01:07.982,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to a subset of all that's available.

20
0:01:10.799,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We can think of attention as the leader of the brain.

21
0:01:13.871,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Wherever attention goes, the rest of the brain follows.

22
0:01:16.934,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In some sense, it's your brain's boss.

23
0:01:19.879,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And over the last 15 years,

24
0:01:21.503,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I've been studying the human brain's attention system.

25
0:01:24.066,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In all of our studies, I've been very interested in one question.

26
0:01:28.037,000 --> 0:01:32,000
If it is indeed the case that our attention is the brain's boss,

27
0:01:32.117,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is it a good boss?

28
0:01:33.434,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Does it actually guide us well?

29
0:01:36.244,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And to dig in on this big question, I wanted to know three things.

30
0:01:39.895,000 --> 0:01:42,000
First, how does attention control our perception?

31
0:01:44.688,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Second, why does it fail us,

32
0:01:46.657,000 --> 0:01:49,000
often leaving us feeling foggy and distracted?

33
0:01:50.76,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And third, can we do anything about this fogginess,

34
0:01:53.776,000 --> 0:01:56,000
can we train our brain to pay better attention?

35
0:01:57.312,000 --> 0:02:02,000
To have more strong and stable attention in the work that we do in our lives.

36
0:02:03.593,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse

37
0:02:07.292,000 --> 0:02:08,000
into how we're going to look at this.

38
0:02:09.133,000 --> 0:02:1,000
A very poignant example

39
0:02:11.135,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of how our attention ends up getting utilized.

40
0:02:15.41,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And I want to do it using the example of somebody that I know quite well.

41
0:02:20.919,000 --> 0:02:23,000
He ends up being part of a very large group of people that we work with,

42
0:02:24.507,000 --> 0:02:26,000
for whom attention is a matter of life and death.

43
0:02:27.571,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Think of medical professionals

44
0:02:29.896,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or firefighters

45
0:02:31.416,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or soldiers or marines.

46
0:02:34.173,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is the story of a marine captain, Captain Jeff Davis.

47
0:02:38.347,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And the scene that I'm going to share with you, as you can see,

48
0:02:41.339,000 --> 0:02:43,000
is not about his time in the battlefield.

49
0:02:43.744,000 --> 0:02:45,000
He was actually on a bridge, in Florida.

50
0:02:46.871,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But instead of looking at the scenery around him,

51
0:02:49.283,000 --> 0:02:5,000
seeing the beautiful vistas

52
0:02:50.903,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and noticing the cool ocean breezes,

53
0:02:53.49,000 --> 0:02:56,000
he was driving fast and contemplating driving off that bridge.

54
0:02:58.41,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And he would later tell me that it took all of everything he had not to do so.

55
0:03:03.685,000 --> 0:03:04,000
You see, he'd just returned from Iraq.

56
0:03:06.082,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And while his body was on that bridge,

57
0:03:08.145,000 --> 0:03:11,000
his mind, his attention, was thousands of miles away.

58
0:03:11.407,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He was gripped with suffering.

59
0:03:13.736,000 --> 0:03:15,000
His mind was worried and preoccupied

60
0:03:16.466,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and had stressful memories and, really, dread for his future.

61
0:03:20.862,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And I'm really glad that he didn't take his life.

62
0:03:25.069,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Because he, as a leader, knew that he wasn't the only one

63
0:03:28.054,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that was probably suffering;

64
0:03:29.482,000 --> 0:03:31,000
many of his fellow marines probably were, too.

65
0:03:31.68,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And in the year 2008, he partnered with me in the first-of-its-kind project

66
0:03:36.951,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that actually allowed us to test and offer something called mindfulness training

67
0:03:41.569,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to active-duty military personnel.

68
0:03:44.03,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But before I tell you about what mindfulness training is,

69
0:03:47.27,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or the results of that study,

70
0:03:49.007,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I think it's important to understand how attention works in the brain.

71
0:03:54.395,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So what we do in the laboratory

72
0:03:56.244,000 --> 0:04:,000
is that many of our studies of attention involve brain-wave recordings.

73
0:04:00.95,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In these brain wave recordings, people wear funny-looking caps

74
0:04:04.22,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that are sort of like swimming caps, that have electrodes embedded in them.

75
0:04:07.99,000 --> 0:04:1,000
These electrodes pick up the ongoing brain electrical activity.

76
0:04:12.117,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And they do it with millisecond temporal precision.

77
0:04:15.268,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So we can see these small yet detectable voltage fluctuations over time.

78
0:04:20.929,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And doing this, we can very precisely plot the timing of the brain's activity.

79
0:04:26.969,000 --> 0:04:28,000
About 170 milliseconds

80
0:04:29.75,000 --> 0:04:32,000
after we show our research participants a face on the screen,

81
0:04:33.284,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we see a very reliable, detectable brain signature.

82
0:04:37.03,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It happens right at the back of the scalp,

83
0:04:39.442,000 --> 0:04:42,000
above the regions of the brain that are involved in face processing.

84
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, this happens so reliably and so on cue,

85
0:04:47.379,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as the brain's face detector,

86
0:04:49.362,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that we've even given this brain-wave component a name.

87
0:04:51.967,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We call it the N170 component.

88
0:04:54.427,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And we use this component in many of our studies.

89
0:04:57.235,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It allows us to see the impact that attention may have on our perception.

90
0:05:03.022,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I'm going to give you a sense of the kind of experiments

91
0:05:05.753,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that we actually do in the lab.

92
0:05:07.276,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We would show participants images like this one.

93
0:05:09.895,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You should see a face and a scene overlaid on each other.

94
0:05:14.037,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And what we do is we ask our participants

95
0:05:16.14,000 --> 0:05:19,000
as they're viewing a series of these types of overlaid images,

96
0:05:19.887,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to do something with their attention.

97
0:05:22.212,000 --> 0:05:24,000
On some trials, we'll ask them to pay attention to the face.

98
0:05:25.759,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And to make sure they're doing that,

99
0:05:27.602,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we ask them to tell us, by pressing a button,

100
0:05:30.204,000 --> 0:05:32,000
if the face appeared to be male or female.

101
0:05:33.046,000 --> 0:05:34,000
On other trials,

102
0:05:34.292,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we ask them to tell what the scene was -- was it indoor or outdoor?

103
0:05:38.704,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And in this way, we can manipulate attention

104
0:05:40.792,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and confirm that the participants were actually doing what we said.

105
0:05:45.371,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Our hypotheses about attention were as follows:

106
0:05:49.014,000 --> 0:05:53,000
if attention is indeed doing its job and affecting perception,

107
0:05:53.395,000 --> 0:05:55,000
maybe it works like an amplifier.

108
0:05:56.252,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And what I mean by this

109
0:05:57.451,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is that when we direct attention to the face,

110
0:05:59.674,000 --> 0:06:01,000
it becomes clearer and more salient,

111
0:06:02.326,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's easier to see.

112
0:06:03.97,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But when we direct it to the scene, the face becomes barely perceptible

113
0:06:07.947,000 --> 0:06:09,000
as we process the scene information.

114
0:06:10.823,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So what we wanted to do

115
0:06:12.061,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is look at this brain-wave component of face detection, the N170,

116
0:06:16.179,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and see if it changed at all

117
0:06:18.229,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as a function of where our participants were paying attention --

118
0:06:21.261,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to the scene or the face.

119
0:06:23.323,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And here's what we found.

120
0:06:24.974,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We found that when they paid attention to the face,

121
0:06:27.435,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the N170 was larger.

122
0:06:29.276,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And when they paid attention to the scene, as you can see in red, it was smaller.

123
0:06:33.141,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And that gap you see between the blue and red lines

124
0:06:35.796,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is pretty powerful.

125
0:06:37.06,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What it tells us is that attention,

126
0:06:39.03,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which is really the only thing that changed,

127
0:06:41.138,000 --> 0:06:43,000
since the images they viewed were identical in both cases --

128
0:06:43.972,000 --> 0:06:44,000
attention changes perception.

129
0:06:45.783,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And it does so very fast.

130
0:06:47.751,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Within 170 milliseconds of actually seeing a face.

131
0:06:51.911,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In our follow-up studies, we wanted to see what would happen,

132
0:06:54.824,000 --> 0:06:56,000
how could we perturb or diminish this effect.

133
0:06:57.775,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And our hunch was that if you put people in a very stressful environment,

134
0:07:02.347,000 --> 0:07:04,000
if you distract them with disturbing, negative images,

135
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
images of suffering and violence --

136
0:07:07.879,000 --> 0:07:09,000
sort of like what you might see on the news, unfortunately --

137
0:07:10.825,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that doing this might actually affect their attention.

138
0:07:13.407,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And that's indeed what we found.

139
0:07:15.053,000 --> 0:07:18,000
If we present stressful images while they're doing this experiment,

140
0:07:18.236,000 --> 0:07:21,000
this gap of attention shrinks, its power diminishes.

141
0:07:22.506,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So in some of our other studies,

142
0:07:24.864,000 --> 0:07:25,000
we wanted to see, OK, great --

143
0:07:26.397,000 --> 0:07:29,000
not great, actually, bad news that stress does this to the brain --

144
0:07:29.564,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but if it is the case that stress has this powerful influence on attention

145
0:07:33.593,000 --> 0:07:34,000
through external distraction,

146
0:07:35.49,000 --> 0:07:37,000
what if we don't need external distraction,

147
0:07:37.522,000 --> 0:07:38,000
what if we distract ourselves?

148
0:07:39.435,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And to do this,

149
0:07:40.768,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we had to basically come up with an experiment

150
0:07:42.951,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in which we could have people generate their own mind-wandering.

151
0:07:46.498,000 --> 0:07:47,000
This is having off-task thoughts

152
0:07:48.347,000 --> 0:07:51,000
while we're engaged in an ongoing task of some sort.

153
0:07:52.657,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And the trick to mind-wandering is that essentially, you bore people.

154
0:07:56.879,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So hopefully there's not a lot of mind-wandering happening right now.

155
0:08:00.395,000 --> 0:08:01,000
When we bore people,

156
0:08:01.736,000 --> 0:08:05,000
people happily generate all kinds of internal content to occupy themselves.

157
0:08:06.394,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So we devised what might be considered

158
0:08:08.244,000 --> 0:08:1,000
one of the world's most boring experiments.

159
0:08:10.268,000 --> 0:08:13,000
All the participants saw were a series of faces on the screen,

160
0:08:13.339,000 --> 0:08:14,000
one after another.

161
0:08:14.561,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They pressed the button every time they saw the face.

162
0:08:17.078,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That was pretty much it.

163
0:08:18.253,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Well, one trick was that sometimes, the face would be upside down,

164
0:08:21.627,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and it would happen very infrequently.

165
0:08:23.493,000 --> 0:08:25,000
On those trials they were told just to withhold the response.

166
0:08:26.752,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Pretty soon, we could tell that they were successfully mind-wandering,

167
0:08:30.062,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because they pressed the button when that face was upside down.

168
0:08:33.055,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Even though it's quite plain to see that it was upside down.

169
0:08:35.937,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So we wanted to know what happens when people have mind-wandering.

170
0:08:39.13,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And what we found was that,

171
0:08:41.208,000 --> 0:08:42,000
very similar to external stress

172
0:08:43.074,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and external distraction in the environment,

173
0:08:45.549,000 --> 0:08:47,000
internal distraction, our own mind wandering,

174
0:08:48.561,000 --> 0:08:5,000
also shrinks the gap of attention.

175
0:08:50.957,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It diminishes attention's power.

176
0:08:54.149,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So what do all of these studies tell us?

177
0:08:56.895,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They tell us that attention is very powerful

178
0:08:59.531,000 --> 0:09:01,000
in terms of affecting our perception.

179
0:09:02.323,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Even though it's so powerful, it's also fragile and vulnerable.

180
0:09:06.038,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And things like stress and mind-wandering diminish its power.

181
0:09:10.243,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But that's all in the context of these very controlled laboratory settings.

182
0:09:13.812,000 --> 0:09:14,000
What about in the real world?

183
0:09:15.257,000 --> 0:09:17,000
What about in our actual day-to-day life?

184
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What about now?

185
0:09:18.855,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Where is your attention right now?

186
0:09:21.196,000 --> 0:09:22,000
To kind of bring it back,

187
0:09:22.427,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I'd like to make a prediction about your attention

188
0:09:24.807,000 --> 0:09:25,000
for the remainder of my talk.

189
0:09:26.276,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Are you up for it?

190
0:09:27.768,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Here's the prediction.

191
0:09:29.474,000 --> 0:09:33,000
You will be unaware of what I'm saying for four out of the next eight minutes.

192
0:09:33.727,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:34.752,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's a challenge, so pay attention, please.

194
0:09:37.474,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now, why am I saying this?

195
0:09:40.577,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I'm surely going to assume that you're going to remain seated

196
0:09:44.299,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and, you know, graciously keep your eyes on me as I speak.

197
0:09:47.665,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But a growing body of literature suggests that we mind-wander,

198
0:09:52.204,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we take our mind away from the task at hand,

199
0:09:54.53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
about 50 percent of our waking moments.

200
0:09:57.625,000 --> 0:09:59,000
These might be small, little trips that we take away,

201
0:10:00.411,000 --> 0:10:01,000
private thoughts that we have.

202
0:10:02.649,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And when this mind-wandering happens,

203
0:10:05.292,000 --> 0:10:06,000
it can be problematic.

204
0:10:06.49,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now I don't think there will be any dire consequences

205
0:10:09.011,000 --> 0:10:1,000
with you all sitting here today,

206
0:10:10.6,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but imagine a military leader missing four minutes of a military briefing,

207
0:10:14.164,000 --> 0:10:18,000
or a judge missing four minutes of testimony.

208
0:10:18.494,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Or a surgeon or firefighter missing any time.

209
0:10:20.678,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The consequences in those cases could be dire.

210
0:10:24.03,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So we might ask why do we do this?

211
0:10:25.958,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Why do we mind-wander so much?

212
0:10:27.691,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Well, part of the answer is that our mind is an exquisite time-traveling master.

213
0:10:34.079,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It can actually time travel very easily.

214
0:10:36.069,000 --> 0:10:39,000
If we think of the mind as the metaphor of the music player, we see this.

215
0:10:39.577,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We can rewind the mind to the past

216
0:10:41.356,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to reflect on events that have already happened, right?

217
0:10:44.688,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Or we can go and fast-future, to plan for the next thing that we want to do.

218
0:10:49.021,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And we land in this mental time-travel mode of the past or the future

219
0:10:53.585,000 --> 0:10:54,000
very frequently.

220
0:10:54.847,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And we land there often without our awareness,

221
0:10:57.236,000 --> 0:10:58,000
most times without our awareness,

222
0:10:58.895,000 --> 0:10:59,000
even if we want to be paying attention.

223
0:11:00.784,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Think of just the last time you were trying to read a book,

224
0:11:03.577,000 --> 0:11:06,000
got to the bottom of the page with no idea what the words were saying.

225
0:11:06.917,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This happens to us.

226
0:11:08.782,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And when this happens, when we mind-wander without an awareness that we're doing it,

227
0:11:14.703,000 --> 0:11:15,000
there are consequences.

228
0:11:16.512,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We make errors.

229
0:11:18.135,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We miss critical information, sometimes.

230
0:11:20.912,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And we have difficulty making decisions.

231
0:11:24.492,000 --> 0:11:27,000
What's worse is when we experience stress.

232
0:11:28.061,000 --> 0:11:3,000
When we're in a moment of overwhelm.

233
0:11:30.506,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We don't just reflect on the past when we rewind,

234
0:11:33.8,000 --> 0:11:37,000
we end up being in the past ruminating, reliving or regretting

235
0:11:38.418,000 --> 0:11:39,000
events that have already happened.

236
0:11:40.506,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind.

237
0:11:43.251,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Not just to productively plan.

238
0:11:45.521,000 --> 0:11:47,000
But we end up catastrophizing or worrying

239
0:11:47.606,000 --> 0:11:48,000
about events that haven't happened yet

240
0:11:49.625,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and frankly may never happen.

241
0:11:51.307,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So at this point, you might be thinking to yourself, OK,

242
0:11:54.942,000 --> 0:11:56,000
mind-wandering's happening a lot.

243
0:11:57.22,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Often, it happens without our awareness.

244
0:11:59.719,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And under stress, it's even worse --

245
0:12:01.964,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we mind-wander more powerfully and more often.

246
0:12:04.434,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Is there anything we can possibly do about this?

247
0:12:07.306,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And I'm happy to say the answer is yes.

248
0:12:10.292,000 --> 0:12:11,000
From our work, we're learning

249
0:12:11.76,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that the opposite of a stressed and wandering mind is a mindful one.

250
0:12:17.387,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Mindfulness has to do with paying attention

251
0:12:20.061,000 --> 0:12:23,000
to our present-moment experience with awareness.

252
0:12:23.553,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And without any kind of emotional reactivity of what's happening.

253
0:12:27.99,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's about keeping that button right on play

254
0:12:30.113,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to experience the moment-to-moment unfolding of our lives.

255
0:12:33.863,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And mindfulness is not just a concept.

256
0:12:36.656,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's more like practice,

257
0:12:38.76,000 --> 0:12:42,000
you have to embody this mindful mode of being to have any benefits.

258
0:12:42.974,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And a lot of the work that we're doing, we're offering people programs

259
0:12:46.569,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that give our participants a suite of exercises

260
0:12:49.8,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that they should do daily

261
0:12:51.452,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in order to cultivate more moments of mindfulness in their life.

262
0:12:55.895,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And for many of the groups that we work with, high-stress groups,

263
0:12:59.038,000 --> 0:13:03,000
like I said -- soldiers, medical professionals --

264
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for them, as we know, mind-wandering can be really dire.

265
0:13:08.895,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So we want to make sure we offer them very accessible,

266
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
low time constraints to optimize the training,

267
0:13:15.22,000 --> 0:13:16,000
so they can benefit from it.

268
0:13:17.434,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And when we do this, what we can do is track to see what happens,

269
0:13:21.117,000 --> 0:13:22,000
not just in their regular lives

270
0:13:22.759,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but in the most demanding circumstances that they may have.

271
0:13:26.491,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Why do we want to do this?

272
0:13:27.769,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Well, we want to, for example, give it to students right around finals season.

273
0:13:31.475,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Or we want to give the training to accountants during tax season.

274
0:13:34.99,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Or soldiers and marines while they're deploying.

275
0:13:37.631,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Why is that?

276
0:13:38.83,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Because those are the moments

277
0:13:40.304,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in which their attention is most likely to be vulnerable,

278
0:13:43.011,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because of stress and mind-wandering.

279
0:13:45.712,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And those are also the moments

280
0:13:47.199,000 --> 0:13:49,000
in which we want their attention to be in peak shape

281
0:13:49.673,000 --> 0:13:5,000
so they can perform well.

282
0:13:51.346,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So what we do in our research

283
0:13:52.982,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is we have them take a series of attention tests.

284
0:13:55.613,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We track their attention at the beginning of some kind of high-stress interval,

285
0:13:59.364,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and then two months later, we track them again,

286
0:14:01.722,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and we want to see if there's a difference.

287
0:14:03.754,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Is there any benefit of offering them mindfulness training?

288
0:14:06.627,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Can we protect against the lapses in attention

289
0:14:08.808,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that might arise over high stress?

290
0:14:12.244,000 --> 0:14:13,000
So here's what we find.

291
0:14:13.792,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Over a high-stress interval,

292
0:14:15.229,000 --> 0:14:17,000
unfortunately, the reality is if we don't do anything at all,

293
0:14:18.131,000 --> 0:14:19,000
attention declines,

294
0:14:19.41,000 --> 0:14:22,000
people are worse at the end of this high-stress interval than before.

295
0:14:22.982,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But if we offer mindfulness training, we can protect against this.

296
0:14:27.061,000 --> 0:14:3,000
They stay stable, even though just like the other groups,

297
0:14:30.126,000 --> 0:14:31,000
they were experiencing high stress.

298
0:14:32.473,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And perhaps even more impressive

299
0:14:34.314,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is that if people take our training programs

300
0:14:36.425,000 --> 0:14:37,000
over, let's say, eight weeks,

301
0:14:38.101,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and they fully commit to doing the daily mindfulness exercises

302
0:14:41.883,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that allow them to learn how to be in the present moment,

303
0:14:46.282,000 --> 0:14:5,000
well, they actually get better over time, even though they're in high stress.

304
0:14:50.338,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And this last point is actually important to realize,

305
0:14:52.839,000 --> 0:14:53,000
because of what it suggests to us

306
0:14:54.552,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is that mindfulness exercises are very much like physical exercise:

307
0:14:58.887,000 --> 0:15:,000
if you don't do it, you don't benefit.

308
0:15:01.125,000 --> 0:15:03,000
But if you do engage in mindfulness practice,

309
0:15:03.633,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the more you do, the more you benefit.

310
0:15:07.176,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And I want to just bring it back to Captain Jeff Davis.

311
0:15:11.35,000 --> 0:15:13,000
As I mentioned to you at the beginning,

312
0:15:13.383,000 --> 0:15:15,000
his marines were involved in the very first project

313
0:15:15.919,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that we ever did, offering mindfulness training.

314
0:15:19.847,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And they showed this exact pattern, which was very heartening.

315
0:15:22.776,000 --> 0:15:24,000
We had offered them the mindfulness training

316
0:15:24.871,000 --> 0:15:26,000
right before they were deployed to Iraq.

317
0:15:27.22,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And upon their return, Captain Davis shared with us

318
0:15:30.098,000 --> 0:15:33,000
what he was feeling was the benefit of this program.

319
0:15:34.363,000 --> 0:15:36,000
He said that unlike last time,

320
0:15:37.264,000 --> 0:15:39,000
after this deployment, they were much more present.

321
0:15:40.665,000 --> 0:15:41,000
They were discerning.

322
0:15:42.173,000 --> 0:15:43,000
They were not as reactive.

323
0:15:43.963,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And in some cases, they were really more compassionate

324
0:15:46.512,000 --> 0:15:48,000
with the people they were engaging with and each other.

325
0:15:49.377,000 --> 0:15:5,000
He said in many ways,

326
0:15:50.6,000 --> 0:15:52,000
he felt that the mindfulness training program we offered

327
0:15:53.298,000 --> 0:15:54,000
gave them a really important tool

328
0:15:54.913,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to protect against developing post-traumatic stress disorder

329
0:15:59.005,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and even allowing it to turn into post-traumatic growth.

330
0:16:02.434,000 --> 0:16:03,000
To us, this was very compelling.

331
0:16:05.458,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And it ended up that Captain Davis and I --

332
0:16:07.629,000 --> 0:16:09,000
you know, this was about a decade ago, in 2008 --

333
0:16:09.939,000 --> 0:16:1,000
we've kept in touch all these years.

334
0:16:12.268,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And he himself has gone on to continue practicing mindfulness

335
0:16:16.011,000 --> 0:16:17,000
in a daily way.

336
0:16:17.748,000 --> 0:16:19,000
He was promoted to major,

337
0:16:20.138,000 --> 0:16:23,000
he actually then ended up retiring from the Marine Corps.

338
0:16:23.511,000 --> 0:16:27,000
He went on to get a divorce, to get remarried,

339
0:16:27.677,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to have a child, to get an MBA.

340
0:16:29.812,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And through all of these challenges and transitions and joys of his life,

341
0:16:34.314,000 --> 0:16:36,000
he kept up with his mindfulness practice.

342
0:16:37.138,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And as fate would have it, just a few months ago,

343
0:16:41.178,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Captain Davis suffered a massive heart attack, at the age of 46.

344
0:16:46.717,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And he ended up calling me a few weeks ago.

345
0:16:49.922,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And he said, "I want to tell you something.

346
0:16:52.644,000 --> 0:16:56,000
I know that the doctors who worked on me, they saved my heart,

347
0:16:56.882,000 --> 0:16:58,000
but mindfulness saved my life.

348
0:17:00.184,000 --> 0:17:02,000
The presence of mind I had to stop the ambulance

349
0:17:03.116,000 --> 0:17:07,000
that ended up taking me to the hospital," -- himself,

350
0:17:07.331,000 --> 0:17:11,000
the clarity of mind he had to notice when there was fear and anxiety happening

351
0:17:12.201,000 --> 0:17:14,000
but not be gripped by it --

352
0:17:14.365,000 --> 0:17:16,000
he said, "For me, these were the gifts of mindfulness."

353
0:17:17.301,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And I was so relieved to hear that he was OK.

354
0:17:19.844,000 --> 0:17:23,000
But really heartened to see that he had transformed his own attention.

355
0:17:25.252,000 --> 0:17:28,000
He went from having a really bad boss --

356
0:17:28.974,000 --> 0:17:3,000
an attention system that nearly drove him off a bridge --

357
0:17:31.847,000 --> 0:17:33,000
to one that was an exquisite leader and guide,

358
0:17:34.589,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and saved his life.

359
0:17:37.238,000 --> 0:17:4,000
So I want to actually end by sharing my call to action to all of you.

360
0:17:41.119,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And here it is.

361
0:17:42.382,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Pay attention to your attention.

362
0:17:45.77,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Alright?

363
0:17:46.957,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Pay attention to your attention

364
0:17:49.284,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and incorporate mindfulness training as part of your daily wellness toolkit,

365
0:17:54.433,000 --> 0:17:57,000
in order to tame your own wandering mind

366
0:17:57.672,000 --> 0:18:,000
and to allow your attention to be a trusted guide in your own life.

367
0:18:01.817,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Thank you.

368
0:18:02.993,000 --> 0:18:06,000
(Applause)

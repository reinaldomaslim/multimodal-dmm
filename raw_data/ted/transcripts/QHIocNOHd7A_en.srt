1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We're here today to announce

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the first synthetic cell,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
a cell made by

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
starting with the digital code in the computer,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
building the chromosome

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
from four bottles of chemicals,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
assembling that chromosome in yeast,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
transplanting it into

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a recipient bacterial cell

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and transforming that cell

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
into a new bacterial species.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So this is the first self-replicating species

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that we've had on the planet

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
whose parent is a computer.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It also is the first species

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to have its own website

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
encoded in its genetic code.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But we'll talk more about

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the watermarks in a minute.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This is a project that had its inception

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
15 years ago

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
when our team then --

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we called the institute TIGR --

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
was involved in sequencing

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the first two genomes in history.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We did Haemophilus influenzae

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that of Mycoplasma genitalium.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And as soon as

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we had these two sequences

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
of a self-replicating species,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
could there be even a smaller genome?

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Could we understand the basis of cellular life

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
at the genetic level?

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's been a 15-year quest

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
just to get to the starting point now

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to be able to answer those questions,

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because it's very difficult to eliminate

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
multiple genes from a cell.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You can only do them one at a time.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We decided early on

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that we had to take a synthetic route,

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
even though nobody had been there before,

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to see if we could synthesize

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a bacterial chromosome

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
so we could actually vary the gene content

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to understand the essential genes for life.

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That started our 15-year quest

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to get here.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But before we did the first experiments,

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we actually asked

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to undertake a review

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of what the risks, the challenges,

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the ethics around creating new

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
species in the laboratory were

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
because it hadn't been done before.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They spent about two years

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
reviewing that independently

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and published their results in Science in 1999.

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Ham and I took two years off

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
as a side project to sequence the human genome,

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but as soon as that was done

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we got back to the task at hand.

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
In 2002, we started

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a new institute,

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
where we set out two goals:

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
One, to understand

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the impact of our technology on the environment,

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and how to understand the environment better,

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and two, to start down this process

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
of making synthetic life

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to understand basic life.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In 2003,

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we published our first success.

78
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison

79
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
developed some new methods

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
for making error-free DNA

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
at a small level.

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Our first task was

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a virus that attacks only E. coli.

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So that was

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the phage phi X 174,

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
which was chosen for historical reasons.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It was the first DNA phage,

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
DNA virus, DNA genome

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that was actually sequenced.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So once we realized

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that we could make 5,000-base pair

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
viral-sized pieces,

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we thought, we at least have the means

95
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
then to try and make serially lots of these pieces

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to be able to eventually assemble them together

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to make this mega base chromosome.

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So, substantially larger than

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we even thought we would go initially.

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There were several steps to this. There were two sides:

101
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We had to solve the chemistry

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
for making large DNA molecules,

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and we had to solve the biological side

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
of how, if we had this new chemical entity,

105
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
how would we boot it up, activate it

106
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in a recipient cell.

107
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We had two teams working in parallel:

108
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
one team on the chemistry,

109
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and the other on trying to

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
be able to transplant

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
entire chromosomes

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to get new cells.

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
which is why we chose the smallest genome.

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to a much larger one.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
And we can walk through the reasons for that,

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but basically the small cell

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
took on the order of

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
one to two months to get results from,

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
whereas the larger, faster-growing cell

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
takes only two days.

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So there's only so many cycles we could go through

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in a year at six weeks per cycle.

125
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And you should know that basically

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
99, probably 99 percent plus

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of our experiments failed.

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So this was a debugging,

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
problem-solving scenario from the beginning

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because there was no recipe

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
of how to get there.

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So, one of the most important publications we had

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
was in 2007.

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Carole Lartigue led the effort

135
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
from one bacteria to another.

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that we've ever done

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because it showed how dynamic life was.

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And we knew, once that worked,

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that we actually had a chance

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
if we could make the synthetic chromosomes

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
to do the same with those.

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We didn't know that it was going to take us

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
several years more to get there.

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
In 2008,

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we reported the complete synthesis

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,

149
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,

150
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We think in part, because of its slow growth

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and, in part,

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to keep these events from happening.

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and was happy to eat

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the synthetic DNA that we gave it

159
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and never got transplantations.

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But at the time, that was the largest

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
molecule of a defined structure

162
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that had been made.

163
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And so both sides were progressing,

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but part of the synthesis

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and yeast would assemble these for us.

168
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It's an amazing step forward,

169
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but we had a problem because now we had

170
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.

171
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So in addition to doing the transplant,

172
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome

173
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
out of the eukaryotic yeast

174
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
into a form where we could transplant it

175
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
into a recipient cell.

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So our team developed new techniques

177
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
for actually growing, cloning

178
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.

179
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So we took the same mycoides genome

180
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that Carole had initially transplanted,

181
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and we grew that in yeast

182
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as an artificial chromosome.

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And we thought this would be a great test bed

184
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast

185
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and transplant them.

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
When we did these experiments, though,

187
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
we could get the chromosome out of yeast

188
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.

189
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
That little issue took the team two years to solve.

190
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
was actually methylated,

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,

193
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
from digesting the DNA.

194
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So what we found is if we took the chromosome

195
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
out of yeast and methylated it,

196
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we could then transplant it.

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Further advances came

198
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes

199
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
from the recipient capricolum cell.

200
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And once we had done that, now we can take

201
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.

202
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So last fall

203
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
when we published the results of that work in Science,

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
we all became overconfident

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and were sure we were only

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a few weeks away

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
from being able to now boot up

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
a chromosome out of yeast.

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Because of the problems with

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth

211
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
about a year and a half ago,

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we decided to synthesize

213
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,

214
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
knowing that we had the biology worked out on that

215
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
for transplantation.

216
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And Dan led the team for the synthesis

217
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,

219
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and it set us back three months

220
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because we had one error

221
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So the team developed new debugging software,

223
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
where we could test each synthetic fragment

224
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to see if it would grow in a background

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of wild type DNA.

226
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And we found that 10 out of the 11

227
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized

228
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
were completely accurate

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and compatible with

230
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
a life-forming sequence.

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We narrowed it down to one fragment;

232
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we sequenced it

233
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and found just one base pair had been deleted

234
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in an essential gene.

235
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So accuracy is essential.

236
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
There's parts of the genome

237
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
where it cannot tolerate even a single error,

238
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and then there's parts of the genome

239
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
where we can put in large blocks of DNA,

240
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
as we did with the watermarks,

241
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.

242
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So it took about three months to find that error

243
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and repair it.

244
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.

245
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we got a text from Dan

246
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
saying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.

247
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So, it's been a long route to get here:

248
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
15 years from the beginning.

249
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We felt

250
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
one of the tenets of this field

251
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
was to make absolutely certain

252
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we could distinguish synthetic DNA

253
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
from natural DNA.

254
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,

255
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
you have to think about all the pitfalls

256
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and things that could lead you

257
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to believe that you had done something when you hadn't,

258
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and, even worse, leading others to believe it.

259
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
So, we thought the worst problem would be

260
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
a single molecule contamination

261
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
of the native chromosome,

262
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
leading us to believe that we actually had

263
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
created a synthetic cell,

264
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
when it would have been just a contaminant.

265
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So early on, we developed the notion

266
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of putting in watermarks in the DNA

267
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to absolutely make clear

268
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that the DNA was synthetic.

269
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And the first chromosome we built

270
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in 2008 --

271
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the 500,000-base pair one --

272
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
we simply assigned

273
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the names of the authors of the chromosome

274
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
into the genetic code,

275
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but it was using just amino acid

276
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
single letter translations,

277
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.

278
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So the team actually developed a new code

279
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
within the code within the code.

280
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So it's a new code

281
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.

282
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing

283
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
messages in the genetic code for a long time,

284
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists

285
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because, if you write long messages

286
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
with the code that the mathematicians developed,

287
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
it would more than likely lead to

288
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
new proteins being synthesized

289
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
with unknown functions.

290
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed

291
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
actually puts frequent stop codons,

292
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
so it's a different alphabet

293
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but allows us to use

294
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
the entire English alphabet

295
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
with punctuation and numbers.

296
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So, there are four major watermarks

297
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.

298
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The first one actually contains within it

299
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
this code for interpreting

300
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
the rest of the genetic code.

301
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So in the remaining information,

302
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in the watermarks,

303
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
contain the names of, I think it's

304
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
46 different authors

305
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and key contributors

306
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to getting the project to this stage.

307
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And we also built in

308
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
a website address

309
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
so that if somebody decodes the code

310
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
within the code within the code,

311
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
they can send an email to that address.

312
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So it's clearly distinguishable

313
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
from any other species,

314
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
having 46 names in it,

315
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
its own web address.

316
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And we added three quotations,

317
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
because with the first genome

318
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound

319
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
than just signing the work.

320
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So we won't give the rest of the code,

321
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but we will give the three quotations.

322
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The first is,

323
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
"To live, to err,

324
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to fall, to triumph

325
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and to recreate life out of life."

326
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's a James Joyce quote.

327
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The second quotation is, "See things not as they are,

328
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but as they might be."

329
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
It's a quote from the "American Prometheus"

330
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
book on Robert Oppenheimer.

331
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:

332
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
"What I cannot build,

333
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I cannot understand."

334
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So, because this is as much a philosophical advance

335
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
as a technical advance in science,

336
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
we tried to deal with both the philosophical

337
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and the technical side.

338
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions

339
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
is that the extensive work

340
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that we've done --

341
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
asking for ethical review,

342
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
pushing the envelope

343
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
on that side as well as the technical side --

344
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,

345
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in the policy community

346
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and at the highest levels of the federal government.

347
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Even with this announcement,

348
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
as we did in 2003 --

349
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that work was funded by the Department of Energy,

350
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
so the work was reviewed

351
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
at the level of the White House,

352
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.

353
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And they came down on the side of open publication,

354
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
which is the right approach --

355
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
we've briefed the White House,

356
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we've briefed members of Congress,

357
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we've tried to take and push

358
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the policy issues

359
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
in parallel with the scientific advances.

360
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So with that, I would like

361
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to open it first to the floor for questions.

362
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Yes, in the back.

363
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Reporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,

364
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
how significant a breakthrough this is please?

365
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?

366
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.

367
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
It's significant to us.

368
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change

369
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
in how we view life.

370
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,

371
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
it's taken us 15 years to be able

372
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to do the experiment

373
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
we wanted to do 15 years ago

374
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
on understanding life at its basic level.

375
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
But we actually believe

376
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
this is going to be a very powerful set of tools

377
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and we're already starting

378
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
in numerous avenues

379
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to use this tool.

380
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
We have, at the Institute,

381
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
ongoing funding now from NIH

382
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
in a program with Novartis

383
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to try and use these new

384
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
synthetic DNA tools

385
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to perhaps make the flu vaccine

386
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that you might get next year.

387
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,

388
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Dan's team can now make these

389
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
in less than 24 hours.

390
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,

391
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
we think we can shorten that process

392
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
quite substantially.

393
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
In the vaccine area,

394
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Synthetic Genomics and the Institute

395
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
are forming a new vaccine company

396
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
because we think these tools can affect vaccines

397
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
to diseases that haven't been possible to date,

398
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
things where the viruses rapidly evolve,

399
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
such with rhinovirus.

400
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?

401
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Or, more importantly, HIV,

402
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
where the virus evolves so quickly

403
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
the vaccines that are made today

404
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
can't keep up

405
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
with those evolutionary changes.

406
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Also, at Synthetic Genomics,

407
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
we've been working

408
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
on major environmental issues.

409
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf

410
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
is a reminder.

411
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
We can't see CO2 --

412
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
we depend on scientific measurements for it

413
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and we see the beginning results

414
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
of having too much of it --

415
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
but we can see pre-CO2 now

416
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
floating on the waters

417
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.

418
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
We need some alternatives

419
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
for oil.

420
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
We have a program with Exxon Mobile

421
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
to try and develop new strains of algae

422
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide

423
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,

424
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries

425
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
to make normal gasoline

426
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and diesel fuel out of CO2.

427
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Those are just a couple of the approaches

428
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and directions that we're taking.

429
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
(Applause)

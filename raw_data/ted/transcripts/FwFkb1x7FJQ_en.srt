1
0:00:25.64,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In terms of invention,

2
0:00:26.88,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.

3
0:00:29.762,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on,

4
0:00:33.08,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but I think it's also the simplest.

5
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world.

6
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet,

7
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the number one cause of death in children under five.

8
0:00:46.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Which is ...?

9
0:00:48.68,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Water-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition?

10
0:00:52.2,000 --> 0:00:53,000
No.

11
0:00:53.88,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires --

12
0:00:57.52,000 --> 0:00:59,000
acute respiratory infections caused by this.

13
0:01:01.04,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Can you believe that?

14
0:01:02.88,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I find this shocking and somewhat appalling.

15
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels?

16
0:01:08.8,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Can't we make better stoves?

17
0:01:10.76,000 --> 0:01:14,000
How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year?

18
0:01:14.8,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes,

19
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes,

20
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which is charcoal.

21
0:01:24.24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:26.24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So this is a picture of rural Haiti.

23
0:01:28.44,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Haiti is now 98 percent deforested.

24
0:01:31.76,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You'll see scenes like this all over the island.

25
0:01:34.88,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It leads to all sorts of environmental problems

26
0:01:37.68,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and problems that affect people throughout the nation.

27
0:01:41.96,000 --> 0:01:43,000
A couple years ago there was severe flooding

28
0:01:44.04,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that led to thousands of deaths --

29
0:01:45.684,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that's directly attributable to the fact

30
0:01:47.64,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil.

31
0:01:50.64,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So the rains come --

32
0:01:51.92,000 --> 0:01:53,000
they go down the rivers and the flooding happens.

33
0:01:55.44,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this:

34
0:01:58.92,000 --> 0:01:59,000
people need to cook,

35
0:02:00.32,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it.

36
0:02:04.44,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage.

37
0:02:07.369,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.

38
0:02:10.013,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Fossil fuels are not available,

39
0:02:12.04,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.

40
0:02:16.96,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And so this is what they do.

41
0:02:19.12,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree,

42
0:02:23.32,000 --> 0:02:25,000
cut it down and make charcoal out of it.

43
0:02:27.44,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So not surprisingly,

44
0:02:28.68,000 --> 0:02:32,000
there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels.

45
0:02:34.36,000 --> 0:02:37,000
About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti

46
0:02:37.44,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.

47
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is one such volunteer

48
0:02:41.32,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked.

49
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the idea was that you could take waste paper;

50
0:02:47.64,000 --> 0:02:48,000
you could compress it

51
0:02:48.88,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and make briquettes that could be used for fuel.

52
0:02:51.56,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But this device was very slow.

53
0:02:53.6,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So our engineering students went to work on it

54
0:02:56.72,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and with some very simple changes,

55
0:02:58.84,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they were able to triple the throughput of this device.

56
0:03:01.92,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So you could imagine they were very excited about it.

57
0:03:04.48,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.

58
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn.

59
0:03:13.28,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So it was a little discouraging to the students.

60
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:17.64,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And in fact, if you look closely,

62
0:03:20.04,000 --> 0:03:22,000
right here you can see it says, "US Peace Corps."

63
0:03:23.64,000 --> 0:03:26,000
As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village.

64
0:03:27.48,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And while it was a good use of government paperwork

65
0:03:30.72,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village,

66
0:03:33.649,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it was 800 kilometers away.

67
0:03:35.76,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way

68
0:03:38.68,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.

69
0:03:41.64,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel

70
0:03:43.92,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that used something that was readily available on the local level.

71
0:03:47.28,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You see these all over Haiti as well.

72
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They're small-scale sugar mills.

73
0:03:50.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And the waste product from them

74
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
after you extract the juice from the sugarcane

75
0:03:54.8,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is called "bagasse."

76
0:03:56.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It has no other use.

77
0:03:57.6,000 --> 0:04:,000
It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals.

78
0:04:00.92,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.

79
0:04:06.04,000 --> 0:04:08,000
What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way

80
0:04:08.36,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel

81
0:04:11.36,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that would be something that people could easily cook with,

82
0:04:14.36,000 --> 0:04:15,000
something like charcoal.

83
0:04:16.6,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So over the next couple of years,

84
0:04:18.24,000 --> 0:04:21,000
students and I worked to develop a process.

85
0:04:21.92,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln

86
0:04:25.76,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.

87
0:04:28.96,000 --> 0:04:3,000
After some time, after setting it on fire,

88
0:04:31.28,000 --> 0:04:34,000
you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln,

89
0:04:35.28,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and then you end up with this carbonized material here.

90
0:04:39.08,000 --> 0:04:4,000
However, you can't burn this.

91
0:04:40.68,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.

92
0:04:45.399,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes.

93
0:04:49.68,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana,

94
0:04:53.12,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called "kokonte,"

95
0:04:56.478,000 --> 0:04:59,000
which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root.

96
0:04:59.96,000 --> 0:05:,000
And so what we did was we looked,

97
0:05:01.56,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti,

98
0:05:04.68,000 --> 0:05:06,000
under the name of "manioc."

99
0:05:06.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
In fact, it's grown all over the world --

100
0:05:08.817,000 --> 0:05:11,000
yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing --

101
0:05:11.92,000 --> 0:05:13,000
a very starchy root vegetable.

102
0:05:14.04,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it,

103
0:05:17.28,000 --> 0:05:21,000
which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.

104
0:05:21.44,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So we did this. We went down to Haiti.

105
0:05:24.64,000 --> 0:05:26,000
These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon,

106
0:05:27.32,000 --> 0:05:28,000
or Charcoal Institute.

107
0:05:29.04,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And these --

108
0:05:30.28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:31.52,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT.

110
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And these are the briquettes that we made.

111
0:05:41.04,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now I'm going to take you to a different continent.

112
0:05:44.32,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is India

113
0:05:45.56,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India.

114
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's cow dung.

115
0:05:50.2,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires,

116
0:05:54.4,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and this is where you see the health impacts

117
0:05:56.88,000 --> 0:06:,000
of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.

118
0:06:01.6,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Kids and women are especially affected by it,

119
0:06:03.84,000 --> 0:06:06,000
because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires.

120
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So we wanted to see

121
0:06:08.24,000 --> 0:06:11,000
if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there.

122
0:06:11.76,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane

123
0:06:14.2,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they didn't have cassava,

124
0:06:15.605,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but that didn't stop us.

125
0:06:17.4,000 --> 0:06:2,000
What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass.

126
0:06:21.24,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area.

127
0:06:24.64,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure,

128
0:06:28.28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which they used ordinarily for their fuel.

129
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And we did side-by-side tests,

130
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and here you can see the charcoal briquettes

131
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and here the cow dung.

132
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.

133
0:06:41.28,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.

134
0:06:43.88,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And so we were very happy, thus far.

135
0:06:46.2,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But one of the things that we found

136
0:06:47.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal,

137
0:06:50.76,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it didn't burn as long.

138
0:06:52.4,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And the briquettes crumbled a little bit

139
0:06:54.329,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.

140
0:06:57.52,000 --> 0:07:,000
So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette

141
0:07:00.76,000 --> 0:07:03,000
so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti.

142
0:07:05.32,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So we went back to MIT,

143
0:07:07.36,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we took out the Instron machine

144
0:07:09.6,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and we figured out what sort of forces you needed

145
0:07:12.32,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in order to compress a briquette to the level

146
0:07:14.44,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that you actually are getting improved performance out of it?

147
0:07:17.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this,

148
0:07:21.28,000 --> 0:07:27,000
we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process,

149
0:07:28.24,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there.

150
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And after some time,

151
0:07:35.4,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal,

152
0:07:40.24,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which actually now burns not only --

153
0:07:43.642,000 --> 0:07:46,000
actually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal.

154
0:07:47.4,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So now we're in a situation where we have a product,

155
0:07:49.96,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,

156
0:07:54.28,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which is a very wonderful place to be.

157
0:07:58.96,000 --> 0:08:02,000
In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year.

158
0:08:03.72,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There's a possibility of this being implemented

159
0:08:06.24,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and saving a good portion of those.

160
0:08:08.56,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars.

161
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:17,000
That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti --

162
0:08:17.56,000 --> 0:08:18,000
with a population of eight million

163
0:08:19.44,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and an average income of less than 400 dollars.

164
0:08:23.68,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project.

165
0:08:27.56,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And one of the things that I think is also interesting,

166
0:08:30.24,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis.

167
0:08:34.56,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts

168
0:08:37.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
of burning wood versus charcoal.

169
0:08:39.76,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths

170
0:08:43.88,000 --> 0:08:45,000
switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel.

171
0:08:46.88,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That's remarkable,

172
0:08:48.12,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees.

173
0:08:51.6,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But now we have a way

174
0:08:52.84,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.

175
0:08:56.96,000 --> 0:08:58,000
One of the really exciting things, though,

176
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month.

177
0:09:02.596,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And I think it's the coolest thing,

178
0:09:06.039,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and it's even lower tech than what you just saw,

179
0:09:08.303,000 --> 0:09:1,000
if you can imagine such a thing.

180
0:09:10.36,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Here it is.

181
0:09:11.6,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So what is this?

182
0:09:13.48,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This is corncobs turned into charcoal.

183
0:09:16.08,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes --

184
0:09:19.247,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it comes ready made.

185
0:09:20.6,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This is my $100 laptop, right here.

186
0:09:23.48,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And actually, like Nick, I brought samples.

187
0:09:26.52,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:28.76,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So we can pass these around.

189
0:09:32.52,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out.

190
0:09:36.628,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And I think one of the things

192
0:09:42.04,000 --> 0:09:46,000
which is also remarkable about this technology,

193
0:09:46.28,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is that the technology transfer is so easy.

194
0:09:49.08,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal,

195
0:09:51.24,000 --> 0:09:53,000
where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes

196
0:09:54.08,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and you have the extra step of cooking the binder,

197
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:57,000
this comes pre-briquetted.

198
0:09:58.12,000 --> 0:10:,000
And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now,

199
0:10:01.097,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.

200
0:10:04.32,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

201
0:10:06.6,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But once you see it, like you guys in the front row --

202
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
All right, yeah, OK.

203
0:10:10.4,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So anyway --

204
0:10:11.64,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

205
0:10:13.68,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Here it is.

206
0:10:14.92,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And this is, I think, a perfect example

207
0:10:17.4,000 --> 0:10:22,000
of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things.

208
0:10:22.64,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So not only do you have health benefits,

209
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
you have environmental benefits.

210
0:10:27.32,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But this is one of the incredibly rare situations

211
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
where you also have economic benefits.

212
0:10:33.52,000 --> 0:10:36,000
People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products.

213
0:10:36.6,000 --> 0:10:38,000
They can generate income from this.

214
0:10:38.64,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal

215
0:10:41.8,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and they can produce excess and sell it in the market

216
0:10:44.301,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to people who aren't making their own.

217
0:10:46.28,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs

218
0:10:48.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
between health and economics, or environment and economics.

219
0:10:51.84,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting

220
0:10:55.6,000 --> 0:11:,000
and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us.

221
0:11:03.12,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So when we talk about, now, the future we will create,

222
0:11:06.64,000 --> 0:11:08,000
one of the things that I think is necessary

223
0:11:08.68,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.

224
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in.

225
0:11:16.92,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday

226
0:11:21.04,000 --> 0:11:23,000
grinding grain for their families to eat.

227
0:11:24.96,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I mean the world where advanced building materials

228
0:11:27.36,000 --> 0:11:3,000
means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand,

229
0:11:30.8,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and where, when you work 10 hours a day,

230
0:11:32.96,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month.

231
0:11:37.32,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I mean the world

232
0:11:38.56,000 --> 0:11:44,000
where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water.

233
0:11:45.52,000 --> 0:11:48,000
That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California

234
0:11:49.28,000 --> 0:11:53,000
worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water.

235
0:11:53.8,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's a place where, for example, if this were India,

236
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
in this room, only three of us would have a car.

237
0:12:01.36,000 --> 0:12:02,000
If this were Afghanistan,

238
0:12:02.6,000 --> 0:12:05,000
only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet.

239
0:12:06.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
If this were Zambia --

240
0:12:08.52,000 --> 0:12:1,000
300 of you would be farmers,

241
0:12:11.24,000 --> 0:12:14,000
100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.

242
0:12:14.4,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.

243
0:12:19.28,000 --> 0:12:23,000
These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for.

244
0:12:24.04,000 --> 0:12:27,000
These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers,

245
0:12:27.92,000 --> 0:12:3,000
our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing.

246
0:12:32.28,000 --> 0:12:34,000
These are the solutions that we need to find.

247
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address.

248
0:12:41.2,000 --> 0:12:43,000
One of them is creating technologies

249
0:12:43.28,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise,

250
0:12:46.32,000 --> 0:12:48,000
so that people who are living below the poverty line

251
0:12:49.2,000 --> 0:12:5,000
can find a way to move out --

252
0:12:50.76,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and that they're not doing it

253
0:12:52.165,000 --> 0:12:55,000
using the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc.

254
0:12:55.8,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But there are new technologies and new products

255
0:12:58.015,000 --> 0:13:,000
that they can make on a small scale.

256
0:13:00.8,000 --> 0:13:01,000
The next thing I believe

257
0:13:02.04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers

258
0:13:06.44,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to add value to their own crops.

259
0:13:09.6,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And we need to rethink our development strategies,

260
0:13:12.28,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so that we're not promoting educational campaigns

261
0:13:15.56,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to get them to stop being farmers,

262
0:13:17.96,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but rather to stop being poor farmers.

263
0:13:20.76,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively.

264
0:13:24.56,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We need to work with the people in these communities

265
0:13:27.24,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and give them the resources and the tools that they need

266
0:13:30.12,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to solve their own problems.

267
0:13:31.84,000 --> 0:13:32,000
That's the best way to do it.

268
0:13:33.245,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We shouldn't be doing it from outside.

269
0:13:35.56,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now.

270
0:13:40.24,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Thank you.

271
0:13:41.48,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Applause)

272
0:13:46.76,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.

273
0:13:49.32,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Stay here.

274
0:13:51.36,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question --

275
0:13:54.28,000 --> 0:13:57,000
just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on.

276
0:13:57.72,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Amy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on

277
0:14:00.24,000 --> 0:14:02,000
are ways to do low-cost water quality testing,

278
0:14:02.441,000 --> 0:14:04,000
so that communities can maintain their own water systems,

279
0:14:05.2,000 --> 0:14:07,000
know when they're working, know when they treat them, etc.

280
0:14:07.939,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems.

281
0:14:10.6,000 --> 0:14:13,000
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection

282
0:14:14.005,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and improving the ability to be able to do that.

283
0:14:17.32,000 --> 0:14:2,000
CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale?

284
0:14:21.28,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists,

285
0:14:24.56,000 --> 0:14:28,000
or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale?

286
0:14:29.44,000 --> 0:14:31,000
AS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward.

287
0:14:32.234,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It's a difficult thing --

288
0:14:33.457,000 --> 0:14:35,000
it's a marketplace which is very fragmented

289
0:14:35.488,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and a consumer population with no income.

290
0:14:37.72,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States

291
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:42,000
for making things move forward.

292
0:14:42.56,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And we're a pretty small staff,

293
0:14:44.6,000 --> 0:14:45,000
which is me.

294
0:14:45.84,000 --> 0:14:46,000
(Laughter)

295
0:14:47.84,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So, you know, I do what I can with the students.

296
0:14:50.103,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We have 30 students a year go out into the field

297
0:14:52.366,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and try to implement this and move it forward.

298
0:14:54.84,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame,

299
0:14:58.36,000 --> 0:15:01,000
as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years;

300
0:15:02.32,000 --> 0:15:04,000
you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead.

301
0:15:04.487,000 --> 0:15:07,000
But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.

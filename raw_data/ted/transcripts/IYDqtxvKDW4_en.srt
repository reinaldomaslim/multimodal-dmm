1
0:00:12.868,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The most complex problems in our time

2
0:00:16.196,000 --> 0:00:18,000
can be solved with simple techniques,

3
0:00:19.166,000 --> 0:00:21,000
if we are able to dream.

4
0:00:22.991,000 --> 0:00:26,000
As a child, I discovered that creativity is the key

5
0:00:27.976,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to cross from dreams to reality.

6
0:00:33.57,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I learned this from my grandmother,

7
0:00:35.907,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Dr. Ruth Tichauer,

8
0:00:38.3,000 --> 0:00:42,000
a Jewish refugee that settled in the heart of the Andes.

9
0:00:43.729,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That is how I grew up:

10
0:00:46.442,000 --> 0:00:49,000
encouraged to see beyond any limitation.

11
0:00:50.982,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So part of my education included helping her

12
0:00:54.43,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in remote, indigenous communities.

13
0:00:57.864,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I cherish those memories,

14
0:01:00.113,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because they helped me to understand life outside the city,

15
0:01:07.04,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a life with a lot of possibilities,

16
0:01:10.418,000 --> 0:01:12,000
without barriers, as language or culture.

17
0:01:13.78,000 --> 0:01:17,000
During those trips, my grandmother used to recite a Kipling poem:

18
0:01:18.687,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"Something hidden. Go and find it.

19
0:01:22.296,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Go and look behind the Mountains.

20
0:01:24.978,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Something lost behind the mountains.

21
0:01:28.757,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Lost and waiting for you. Go!"

22
0:01:33.624,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In the coming years, I became a medical student.

23
0:01:38.299,000 --> 0:01:43,000
One of every hundred children born worldwide

24
0:01:43.547,000 --> 0:01:45,000
has some kind of heart disease.

25
0:01:47.214,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There's a part of this problem I think I can solve --

26
0:01:52.388,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the part of this problem I have spent my life working on.

27
0:01:59.904,000 --> 0:02:,000
The problem starts

28
0:02:02.279,000 --> 0:02:03,000
during pregnancy.

29
0:02:04.61,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The fetus needs to survive inside the mother.

30
0:02:08.808,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Survival depends on communication

31
0:02:13.321,000 --> 0:02:15,000
between the systemic and the pulmonary blood.

32
0:02:16.994,000 --> 0:02:17,000
At the moment of birth,

33
0:02:19.055,000 --> 0:02:21,000
this communication needs to stop.

34
0:02:22.474,000 --> 0:02:26,000
If it doesn't close, the baby has a hole in the heart.

35
0:02:27.398,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It is caused by prematurity and genetic conditions.

36
0:02:32.537,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But what we know today

37
0:02:35.556,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is that a lack of oxygen is also one of the causes.

38
0:02:41.119,000 --> 0:02:43,000
As you can see in the chart,

39
0:02:43.775,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the frequency of this kind of hole

40
0:02:48.387,000 --> 0:02:5,000
dramatically increases with altitude.

41
0:02:52.327,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Video: (Baby crying)

42
0:02:56.357,000 --> 0:02:59,000
When you look at patients with this condition,

43
0:02:59.649,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they seem desperate to breathe.

44
0:03:02.521,000 --> 0:03:07,000
To close the hole, major surgery used to be the only solution.

45
0:03:08.527,000 --> 0:03:12,000
One night, my friend Malte, were camping in the Amazon region.

46
0:03:14.385,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The only thing that would not burn in the fire was a green avocado branch.

47
0:03:21.088,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Then came a moment of inspiration.

48
0:03:24.513,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So we used the branch as a mold for our first invention.

49
0:03:29.11,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The holes in children's hearts can be closed with it.

50
0:03:32.509,000 --> 0:03:36,000
A coil is a piece of wire wrapped onto itself.

51
0:03:37.313,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It maybe doesn't look so fancy to you now,

52
0:03:40.76,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but that was our first successful attempt

53
0:03:44.989,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to create a device for this major problem.

54
0:03:49.671,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In this video, we can see how a very tiny catheter

55
0:03:52.832,000 --> 0:03:54,000
takes the coil to the heart.

56
0:03:55.393,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The coil then closes the hole.

57
0:03:57.721,000 --> 0:03:59,000
After that moment of inspiration,

58
0:04:00.55,000 --> 0:04:05,000
there came a very long time of effort

59
0:04:06.533,000 --> 0:04:07,000
developing a prototype.

60
0:04:08.495,000 --> 0:04:13,000
In vitro and in vivo studies took thousands of hours of work in the lab.

61
0:04:15.321,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The coil, if it works, can save lives.

62
0:04:20.202,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I returned from Germany to Bolivia,

63
0:04:22.638,000 --> 0:04:24,000
thinking that wherever we go,

64
0:04:25.166,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we have the opportunity to make a difference.

65
0:04:29.278,000 --> 0:04:33,000
With my wife and partner, Dr. Alexandra Heath,

66
0:04:33.802,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we started to see patients.

67
0:04:35.492,000 --> 0:04:39,000
After successfully treating patients with our coil,

68
0:04:39.817,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we felt really enthusiastic.

69
0:04:42.688,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But we live in a place

70
0:04:46.554,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that is 12,000 feet high.

71
0:04:51.694,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And,

72
0:04:54.284,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the patients there need a special device to solve their heart condition.

73
0:04:59.865,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The hole in altitude patients is different,

74
0:05:02.352,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because the orifice between the arteries is larger.

75
0:05:06.479,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Most patients cannot afford to be treated on time,

76
0:05:11.405,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and they die.

77
0:05:13.973,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The first coil could successfully treat

78
0:05:17.616,000 --> 0:05:21,000
only half of the patients in Bolivia.

79
0:05:23.577,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The search started again.

80
0:05:26.942,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We went back to the drawing board.

81
0:05:31.574,000 --> 0:05:32,000
After many trials,

82
0:05:33.031,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and with the help of my grandmother's indigenous friends in the mountains,

83
0:05:38.078,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we obtained a new device.

84
0:05:40.753,000 --> 0:05:45,000
For centuries, indigenous women told stories by weaving complex patterns

85
0:05:46.631,000 --> 0:05:47,000
on looms,

86
0:05:48.262,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and an unexpected skill helped us for the new device.

87
0:05:53.673,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We take this traditional method of weaving

88
0:05:56.507,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and make a design made by a smart material

89
0:06:00.927,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that records shape.

90
0:06:03.236,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It seems this time,

91
0:06:05.755,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the weaving allows us to create a seamless device

92
0:06:10.506,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that doesn't rust

93
0:06:13.072,000 --> 0:06:16,000
because it's made of only one piece.

94
0:06:17.427,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It can change by itself into very complex structures

95
0:06:21.931,000 --> 0:06:24,000
by a procedure that took decades to develop.

96
0:06:26.903,000 --> 0:06:28,000
As you can see, the device enters the body

97
0:06:29.746,000 --> 0:06:3,000
through the natural channels.

98
0:06:32.173,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Doctors have only to close the catheter through the hole.

99
0:06:36.104,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Our device expands, places itself

100
0:06:38.972,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and closes the hole.

101
0:06:42.375,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We have this beautiful delivery system

102
0:06:45.315,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that is so simple to use

103
0:06:47.383,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because it works by itself.

104
0:06:50.422,000 --> 0:06:54,000
No open surgery was necessary.

105
0:06:55.494,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Applause)

106
0:07:04.006,000 --> 0:07:06,000
As doctors, we fight with diseases

107
0:07:06.713,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that take a long time and effort to heal -- if they do.

108
0:07:11.443,000 --> 0:07:13,000
This is the child from before,

109
0:07:14.1,000 --> 0:07:15,000
after the procedure.

110
0:07:15.78,000 --> 0:07:16,000
As you can see --

111
0:07:17.423,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Applause)

112
0:07:22.007,000 --> 0:07:25,000
As you can see, once the device is in place,

113
0:07:25.13,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the patient is 100 percent healed.

114
0:07:28.622,000 --> 0:07:29,000
From start to finish,

115
0:07:30.075,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the whole procedure takes only 30 minutes.

116
0:07:35.183,000 --> 0:07:39,000
That's very rewarding from the medical and human point of view.

117
0:07:40.444,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We are so proud that some of our former patients

118
0:07:47.011,000 --> 0:07:49,000
are part of our team --

119
0:07:50.643,000 --> 0:07:53,000
a team, thanks to added close interaction

120
0:07:54.491,000 --> 0:07:56,000
with patients that work with us.

121
0:07:57.799,000 --> 0:08:,000
Together, we have only one idea:

122
0:08:01.103,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the best solutions need to be simple.

123
0:08:05.53,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We lost the fear of creating something new.

124
0:08:09.523,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The path, it's not easy.

125
0:08:12.191,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Many obstacles arise all the time.

126
0:08:15.934,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But we receive strength from our patients.

127
0:08:19.971,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Their resilience and courage

128
0:08:24.233,000 --> 0:08:26,000
inspire our creativity.

129
0:08:27.311,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Our goal is to make sure

130
0:08:30.282,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that no child is left behind,

131
0:08:34.36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
not because of cost or access.

132
0:08:39.367,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So we have to start a foundation

133
0:08:42.355,000 --> 0:08:44,000
with a one-to-one model.

134
0:08:45.831,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We will give one device for free

135
0:08:49.061,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to make sure that every child is treated.

136
0:08:53.6,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We are in many countries now,

137
0:08:56.482,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but we need to be everywhere.

138
0:09:00.926,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This whole thing began

139
0:09:03.931,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with one impossible idea

140
0:09:06.819,000 --> 0:09:08,000
as will continue it, really:

141
0:09:10.698,000 --> 0:09:14,000
No child is left behind.

142
0:09:15.67,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Muchas gracias.

143
0:09:17.498,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Applause)

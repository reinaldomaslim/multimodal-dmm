2
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I go to parties,

3
0:00:16.835,000 --> 0:00:17,000
it doesn't usually take very long

4
0:00:18.619,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for people to find out

5
0:00:19.659,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that I'm a scientist and I study sex.

6
0:00:22.767,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And then I get asked questions.

7
0:00:27.668,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And the questions usually have a very particular format.

8
0:00:30.835,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They start with the phrase,

9
0:00:32.067,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"A friend told me,"

10
0:00:33.968,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and then they end with the phrase,

11
0:00:35.868,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Is this true?"

12
0:00:37.785,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And most of the time

13
0:00:39.171,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'm glad to say that I can answer them,

14
0:00:41.29,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but sometimes I have to say,

15
0:00:43.137,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"I'm really sorry,

16
0:00:44.27,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but I don't know

17
0:00:45.454,000 --> 0:00:48,000
because I'm not that kind of a doctor."

18
0:00:48.538,000 --> 0:00:49,000
That is, I'm not a clinician,

19
0:00:50.454,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I'm a comparative biologist who studies anatomy.

20
0:00:53.645,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And my job is to look at lots of different species of animals

21
0:00:56.578,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and try to figure out how their tissues and organs work

22
0:00:59.895,000 --> 0:01:,000
when everything's going right,

23
0:01:01.396,000 --> 0:01:02,000
rather than trying to figure out

24
0:01:03.014,000 --> 0:01:04,000
how to fix things when they go wrong,

25
0:01:04.597,000 --> 0:01:05,000
like so many of you.

26
0:01:05.798,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And what I do is I look for similarities and differences

27
0:01:08.197,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in the solutions that they've evolved

28
0:01:10.464,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for fundamental biological problems.

29
0:01:12.048,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So today I'm here to argue

30
0:01:13.897,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that this is not at all

31
0:01:17.763,000 --> 0:01:18,000
an esoteric Ivory Tower activity

32
0:01:19.664,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that we find at our universities,

33
0:01:20.981,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but that broad study

34
0:01:22.964,000 --> 0:01:24,000
across species, tissue types and organ systems

35
0:01:25.916,000 --> 0:01:26,000
can produce insights

36
0:01:27.551,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that have direct implications for human health.

37
0:01:30.935,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And this is true both of my recent project

38
0:01:33.433,000 --> 0:01:34,000
on sex differences in the brain,

39
0:01:35.157,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and my more mature work

40
0:01:37.076,000 --> 0:01:39,000
on the anatomy and function of penises.

41
0:01:39.91,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And now you know why I'm fun at parties.

42
0:01:42.54,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:43.508,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So today I'm going to give you an example

44
0:01:45.791,000 --> 0:01:46,000
drawn from my penis study

45
0:01:47.508,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to show you how knowledge

46
0:01:49.125,000 --> 0:01:5,000
drawn from studies of one organ system

47
0:01:50.892,000 --> 0:01:52,000
provided insights into a very different one.

48
0:01:53.873,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Now I'm sure as everyone in the audience already knows --

49
0:01:56.891,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week --

50
0:02:00.407,000 --> 0:02:03,000
penises are structures that transfer sperm

51
0:02:04.158,000 --> 0:02:05,000
from one individual to another.

52
0:02:05.458,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And the slide behind me

53
0:02:06.958,000 --> 0:02:07,000
barely scratches the surface

54
0:02:08.691,000 --> 0:02:09,000
of how widespread they are in animals.

55
0:02:10.656,000 --> 0:02:11,000
There's an enormous amount of anatomical variation.

56
0:02:12.641,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You find muscular tubes, modified legs, modified fins,

57
0:02:16.515,000 --> 0:02:19,000
as well as the mammalian fleshy, inflatable cylinder

58
0:02:20.361,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that we're all familiar with --

59
0:02:21.996,000 --> 0:02:23,000
or at least half of you are.

60
0:02:24.278,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:26.679,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I think we see this tremendous variation

62
0:02:29.417,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because it's a really effective solution

63
0:02:32.568,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to a very basic biological problem,

64
0:02:34.734,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and that is getting sperm in a position

65
0:02:37.217,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to meet up with eggs and form zygotes.

66
0:02:39.769,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now the penis isn't actually required for internal fertiliztion,

67
0:02:43.718,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but when internal fertilization evolves,

68
0:02:46.184,000 --> 0:02:48,000
penises often follow.

69
0:02:48.184,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And the question I get when I start talking about this most often is,

70
0:02:52.601,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"What made you interested in this subject?"

71
0:02:55.517,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And the answer is skeletons.

72
0:02:59.467,000 --> 0:03:01,000
You wouldn't think that skeletons and penises

73
0:03:02.034,000 --> 0:03:03,000
have very much to do with one another.

74
0:03:03.885,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And that's because we tend to think of skeletons

75
0:03:06.017,000 --> 0:03:07,000
as stiff lever systems

76
0:03:07.667,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that produce speed or power.

77
0:03:09.35,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And my first forays into biological research,

78
0:03:12.917,000 --> 0:03:14,000
doing dinosaur paleontology as an undergraduate,

79
0:03:15.735,000 --> 0:03:16,000
were really squarely in that realm.

80
0:03:17.286,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But when I went to graduate school to study biomechanics,

81
0:03:20.403,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I really wanted to find a dissertation project

82
0:03:22.868,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that would expand our knowledge of skeletal function.

83
0:03:25.767,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I tried a bunch of different stuff.

84
0:03:27.569,000 --> 0:03:28,000
A lot of it didn't pan out.

85
0:03:29.217,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But then one day I started thinking

86
0:03:31.051,000 --> 0:03:32,000
about the mammalian penis.

87
0:03:32.833,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And it's really an odd sort of structure.

88
0:03:36.851,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Before it can be used for internal fertilization,

89
0:03:39.668,000 --> 0:03:4,000
its mechanical behavior has to change

90
0:03:41.151,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in a really dramatic fashion.

91
0:03:42.868,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Most of the time it's a flexible organ.

92
0:03:45.466,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's easy to bend.

93
0:03:46.75,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But before it's brought into use

94
0:03:48.744,000 --> 0:03:49,000
during copulation

95
0:03:49.962,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it has to become rigid,

96
0:03:51.72,000 --> 0:03:53,000
it has to become difficult to bend.

97
0:03:53.735,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And moreover, it has to work.

98
0:03:55.752,000 --> 0:03:57,000
A reproductive system that fails to function

99
0:03:58.502,000 --> 0:04:01,000
produces an individual that has no offspring,

100
0:04:01.817,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and that individual is then kicked out of the gene pool.

101
0:04:04.988,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so I thought, "Here's a problem

102
0:04:07.449,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that just cries out for a skeletal system --

103
0:04:10.697,000 --> 0:04:13,000
not one like this one,

104
0:04:13.909,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but one like this one --

105
0:04:16.966,000 --> 0:04:18,000
because, functionally,

106
0:04:19.383,000 --> 0:04:2,000
a skeleton is any system

107
0:04:20.95,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that supports tissue and transmits forces.

108
0:04:23.982,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I already knew that animals like this earthworm,

109
0:04:26.332,000 --> 0:04:27,000
indeed most animals,

110
0:04:27.778,000 --> 0:04:28,000
don't support their tissues

111
0:04:29.071,000 --> 0:04:3,000
by draping them over bones.

112
0:04:30.865,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Instead they're more like reinforced water balloons.

113
0:04:33.698,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They use a skeleton that we call a hydrostatic skeleton.

114
0:04:37.565,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And a hydrostatic skeleton

115
0:04:39.631,000 --> 0:04:4,000
uses two elements.

116
0:04:41.549,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The skeletal support comes from an interaction

117
0:04:43.699,000 --> 0:04:44,000
between a pressurized fluid

118
0:04:45.473,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and a surrounding wall of tissue

119
0:04:47.079,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that's held in tension and reinforced with fibrous proteins.

120
0:04:51.55,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the interaction is crucial.

121
0:04:53.798,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Without both elements you have no support.

122
0:04:57.166,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If you have fluid

123
0:04:58.448,000 --> 0:05:,000
with no wall to surround it

124
0:05:00.482,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and keep pressure up,

125
0:05:01.916,000 --> 0:05:02,000
you have a puddle.

126
0:05:03.82,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And if you have just the wall

127
0:05:05.92,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with no fluid inside of it to put the wall in tension,

128
0:05:07.654,000 --> 0:05:08,000
you've got a little wet rag.

129
0:05:09.604,000 --> 0:05:11,000
When you look at a penis in cross section,

130
0:05:12.236,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it has a lot of the hallmarks

131
0:05:14.669,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of a hydrostatic skeleton.

132
0:05:16.719,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It has a central space

133
0:05:18.228,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of spongy erectile tissue

134
0:05:19.748,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that fills with fluid -- in this case blood --

135
0:05:22.326,000 --> 0:05:24,000
surrounded by a wall of tissue

136
0:05:24.725,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that's rich in a stiff structural protein called collagen.

137
0:05:28.576,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But at the time when I started this project,

138
0:05:31.076,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the best explanation I could find for penal erection

139
0:05:34.277,000 --> 0:05:38,000
was that the wall surrounded these spongy tissues,

140
0:05:38.561,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the spongy tissues filled with blood

141
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and pressure rose and voila! it became erect.

142
0:05:43.528,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And that explained to me expansion --

143
0:05:47.493,000 --> 0:05:5,000
made sense: more fluid, you get tissues that expand --

144
0:05:51.06,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but it didn't actually explain erection.

145
0:05:54.077,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Because there was no mechanism in this explanation

146
0:05:57.968,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for making this structure hard to bend.

147
0:06:00.935,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And no one had systematically looked at the wall tissue.

148
0:06:03.651,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So I thought, wall tissue's important in skeletons.

149
0:06:06.253,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It has to be part of the explanation.

150
0:06:08.619,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this was the point

151
0:06:11.154,000 --> 0:06:13,000
at which my graduate adviser said,

152
0:06:13.751,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"Whoa! Hold on. Slow down."

153
0:06:17.134,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Because after about six months of me talking about this,

154
0:06:20.502,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I think he finally figured out

155
0:06:21.818,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that I was really serious about the penis thing.

156
0:06:24.867,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter)

157
0:06:27.914,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So he sat me down, and he warned me.

158
0:06:29.963,000 --> 0:06:31,000
He was like, "Be careful going down this path.

159
0:06:32.139,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I'm not sure this project's going to pan out."

160
0:06:34.906,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Because he was afraid I was walking into a trap.

161
0:06:37.438,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I was taking on a socially embarrassing question

162
0:06:42.255,000 --> 0:06:44,000
with an answer that he thought

163
0:06:44.59,000 --> 0:06:46,000
might not be particularly interesting.

164
0:06:46.972,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And that was because

165
0:06:48.505,000 --> 0:06:49,000
every hydrostatic skeleton

166
0:06:50.023,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that we had found in nature up to that point

167
0:06:52.091,000 --> 0:06:53,000
had the same basic elements.

168
0:06:53.888,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It had the central fluid,

169
0:06:55.105,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it had the surrounding wall,

170
0:06:56.905,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and the reinforcing fibers in the wall

171
0:07:00.041,000 --> 0:07:02,000
were arranged in crossed helices

172
0:07:02.459,000 --> 0:07:04,000
around the long axis of the skeleton.

173
0:07:04.516,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So the image behind me

174
0:07:05.837,000 --> 0:07:06,000
shows a piece of tissue

175
0:07:07.466,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in one of these cross helical skeletons

176
0:07:09.491,000 --> 0:07:11,000
cut so that you're looking at the surface of the wall.

177
0:07:12.024,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The arrow shows you the long axis.

178
0:07:13.742,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And you can see two layers of fibers,

179
0:07:15.592,000 --> 0:07:16,000
one in blue and one in yellow,

180
0:07:17.293,000 --> 0:07:19,000
arranged in left-handed and right-handed angles.

181
0:07:20.091,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And if you weren't just looking at a little section of the fibers,

182
0:07:22.34,000 --> 0:07:24,000
those fibers would be going in helices

183
0:07:25.041,000 --> 0:07:26,000
around the long axis of the skeleton --

184
0:07:26.791,000 --> 0:07:28,000
something like a Chinese finger trap,

185
0:07:28.924,000 --> 0:07:29,000
where you stick your fingers in and they get stuck.

186
0:07:30.825,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And these skeletons have a particular set of behaviors,

187
0:07:33.908,000 --> 0:07:35,000
which I'm going to demonstrate in a film.

188
0:07:35.94,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's a model skeleton

189
0:07:37.091,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that I made out of a piece of cloth

190
0:07:39.274,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that I wrapped around an inflated balloon.

191
0:07:41.827,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The cloth's cut on the bias.

192
0:07:43.525,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So you can see that the fibers wrap in helices,

193
0:07:46.274,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and those fibers can reorient as the skeleton moves,

194
0:07:50.586,000 --> 0:07:51,000
which means the skeleton's flexible.

195
0:07:52.015,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It lengthens, shortens and bends really easily

196
0:07:54.488,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in response to internal or external forces.

197
0:07:58.035,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now my adviser's concern

198
0:07:59.331,000 --> 0:08:01,000
was what if the penile wall tissue

199
0:08:01.697,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is just the same as any other hydrostatic skeleton.

200
0:08:03.371,000 --> 0:08:04,000
What are you going to contribute?

201
0:08:05.298,000 --> 0:08:06,000
What new thing are you contributing

202
0:08:06.765,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to our knowledge of biology?

203
0:08:08.413,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I thought, "Yeah, he does have a really good point here."

204
0:08:11.831,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So I spent a long, long time thinking about it.

205
0:08:13.581,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And one thing kept bothering me,

206
0:08:15.715,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and that's, when they're functioning,

207
0:08:18.165,000 --> 0:08:19,000
penises don't wiggle.

208
0:08:20.098,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

209
0:08:22.437,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So something interesting had to be going on.

210
0:08:25.338,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So I went ahead, collected wall tissue,

211
0:08:28.639,000 --> 0:08:29,000
prepared it so it was erect,

212
0:08:30.238,000 --> 0:08:32,000
sectioned it, put it on slides

213
0:08:32.437,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and then stuck it under the microscope to have a look,

214
0:08:35.089,000 --> 0:08:4,000
fully expecting to see crossed helices of collagen of some variety.

215
0:08:40.125,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But instead I saw this.

216
0:08:42.523,000 --> 0:08:45,000
There's an outer layer and an inner layer.

217
0:08:45.524,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The arrow shows you the long axis of the skeleton.

218
0:08:48.074,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I was really surprised at this.

219
0:08:50.643,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Everyone I showed it

220
0:08:51.588,000 --> 0:08:52,000
was really surprised at this.

221
0:08:52.788,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Why was everyone surprised at this?

222
0:08:54.325,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That's because we knew theoretically

223
0:08:57.309,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that there was another way

224
0:09:00.124,000 --> 0:09:03,000
of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton,

225
0:09:03.158,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and that was with fibers at zero degrees

226
0:09:05.429,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure.

227
0:09:09.295,000 --> 0:09:12,000
The thing is, no one had ever seen it before in nature.

228
0:09:12.857,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And now I was looking at one.

229
0:09:15.557,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Those fibers in that particular orientation

230
0:09:18.291,000 --> 0:09:21,000
give the skeleton a very, very different behavior.

231
0:09:21.506,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm going to show a model

232
0:09:22.691,000 --> 0:09:23,000
made out of exactly the same materials.

233
0:09:24.636,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So it'll be made of the same cotton cloth,

234
0:09:26.694,000 --> 0:09:29,000
same balloon, same internal pressure.

235
0:09:29.983,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But the only difference

236
0:09:32.45,000 --> 0:09:34,000
is that the fibers are arranged differently.

237
0:09:34.832,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And you'll see that, unlike the cross helical model,

238
0:09:37.483,000 --> 0:09:39,000
this model resists extension and contraction

239
0:09:40.433,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and resists bending.

240
0:09:41.884,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Now what that tells us

241
0:09:42.918,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is that wall tissues are doing so much more

242
0:09:45.014,000 --> 0:09:47,000
than just covering the vascular tissues.

243
0:09:47.517,000 --> 0:09:5,000
They're an integral part of the penile skeleton.

244
0:09:51.011,000 --> 0:09:53,000
If the wall around the erectile tissue wasn't there,

245
0:09:53.548,000 --> 0:09:55,000
if it wasn't reinforced in this way,

246
0:09:55.713,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the shape would change,

247
0:09:56.865,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but the inflated penis would not resist bending,

248
0:09:59.249,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and erection simply wouldn't work.

249
0:10:01.296,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's an observation with obvious medical applications

250
0:10:03.897,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in humans as well,

251
0:10:05.679,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but it's also relevant in a broad sense, I think,

252
0:10:08.614,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to the design of prosthetics, soft robots,

253
0:10:11.046,000 --> 0:10:12,000
basically anything

254
0:10:12.113,000 --> 0:10:15,000
where changes of shape and stiffness are important.

255
0:10:15.431,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So to sum up:

256
0:10:17.179,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Twenty years ago,

257
0:10:18.396,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I had a college adviser tell me,

258
0:10:20.146,000 --> 0:10:22,000
when I went to the college and said,

259
0:10:22.197,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"I'm kind of interested in anatomy,"

260
0:10:23.346,000 --> 0:10:24,000
they said, "Anatomy's a dead science."

261
0:10:25.23,000 --> 0:10:27,000
He couldn't have been more wrong.

262
0:10:27.847,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I really believe that we still have a lot to learn

263
0:10:30.58,000 --> 0:10:33,000
about the normal structure and function of our bodies.

264
0:10:33.713,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Not just about its genetics and molecular biology,

265
0:10:36.527,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but up here in the meat end of the scale.

266
0:10:39.926,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We've got limits on our time.

267
0:10:41.361,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We often focus on one disease,

268
0:10:43.626,000 --> 0:10:44,000
one model, one problem,

269
0:10:44.81,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but my experience suggests

270
0:10:46.384,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that we should take the time

271
0:10:48.162,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to apply ideas broadly between systems

272
0:10:50.727,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and just see where it takes us.

273
0:10:52.601,000 --> 0:10:55,000
After all, if ideas about invertebrate skeletons

274
0:10:56.201,000 --> 0:10:57,000
can give us insights

275
0:10:57.667,000 --> 0:10:59,000
about mammalian reproductive systems,

276
0:10:59.752,000 --> 0:11:03,000
there could be lots of other wild and productive connections

277
0:11:03.801,000 --> 0:11:05,000
lurking out there just waiting to be found.

278
0:11:06.25,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Thank you.

279
0:11:08.102,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Applause)

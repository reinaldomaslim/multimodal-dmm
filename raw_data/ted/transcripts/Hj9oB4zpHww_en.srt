1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm going to speak today about the relationship

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
between science and human values.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now, it's generally understood that

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
questions of morality --

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
questions of good and evil and right and wrong --

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
are questions about which science officially has no opinion.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's thought that science can help us

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
get what we value,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but it can never tell us what we ought to value.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
probably here -- think that science will never answer

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the most important questions in human life:

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
questions like, "What is worth living for?"

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"What is worth dying for?"

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
"What constitutes a good life?"

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So, I'm going to argue

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that this is an illusion -- that the separation between

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
science and human values is an illusion --

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and actually quite a dangerous one

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
at this point in human history.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, it's often said that science

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because science deals with facts,

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's often thought that there's no description

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
of the way the world is

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that can tell us how the world ought to be.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Values are a certain kind of fact.

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
concerned about our fellow primates

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
than we are about insects, as indeed we are,

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of potential happiness and suffering.

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, the crucial thing to notice here

39
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is that this is a factual claim:

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and the possibilities of experience

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And there's no notion,

45
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
no version of human morality

46
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and human values that I've ever come across

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that is not at some point reducible

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to a concern about conscious experience

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and its possible changes.

50
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Even if you get your values from religion,

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
even if you think that good and evil ultimately

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
relate to conditions after death --

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
either to an eternity of happiness with God

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
or an eternity of suffering in hell --

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And to say that such changes can persist after death

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
is itself a factual claim,

58
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
which, of course, may or may not be true.

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in this life, for human beings,

61
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we know that there is a continuum of such facts.

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state,

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong --

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
where mothers cannot feed their children,

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
where people are murdered indiscriminately.

67
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum

68
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
towards something quite a bit more idyllic,

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And we know -- we know --

71
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that there are right and wrong answers

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to how to move in this space.

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?

74
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Probably not.

75
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,

76
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
so that when bad things happened to them

77
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.

78
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There are truths to be known

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
about how human communities flourish,

80
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
whether or not we understand these truths.

81
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And morality relates to these truths.

82
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.

83
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --

84
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
from the level of the genome

85
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
on up to the level of economic systems

86
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and political arrangements.

87
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But if we're going to talk about human well-being

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.

89
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is realized in the brain --

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
whatever happens after death.

92
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,

93
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in this life, his personality --

94
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
his rather unfortunate personality --

95
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is the product of his brain.

96
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So the contributions of culture --

97
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
if culture changes us, as indeed it does,

98
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it changes us by changing our brains.

99
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is

100
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in how human beings flourish

101
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
can, at least in principle, be understood

102
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in the context of a maturing science of the mind --

103
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
neuroscience, psychology, etc.

104
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So, what I'm arguing is that

105
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
value's reduced to facts --

106
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to facts about the conscious experience

107
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of conscious beings.

108
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And we can therefore visualize a space

109
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of possible changes in the experience of these beings.

110
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,

111
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
with peaks and valleys that correspond

112
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,

113
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
both personal and collective.

114
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And one thing to notice is that perhaps

115
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
there are states of human well-being

116
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that we rarely access, that few people access.

117
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And these await our discovery.

118
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called

119
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
mystical or spiritual.

120
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access

121
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because of how our minds are structured

122
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but other minds possibly could access them.

123
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying

124
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that science is guaranteed to map this space,

125
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or that we will have scientific answers to every

126
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
conceivable moral question.

127
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult

128
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,

129
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,

130
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.

131
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But if questions affect human well-being

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.

134
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And just admitting this --

135
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
just admitting that there are right and wrong answers

136
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to the question of how humans flourish --

137
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
will change the way we talk about morality,

138
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and will change our expectations

139
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of human cooperation in the future.

140
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
For instance, there are 21 states in our country

141
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,

142
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,

143
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.

144
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,

145
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
are subjected to this every year.

146
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.

147
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We're not talking about Connecticut.

148
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.

149
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The creator of the universe himself

150
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
has told us not to spare the rod,

151
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
lest we spoil the child --

152
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.

153
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But we can ask the obvious question:

154
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Is it a good idea, generally speaking,

155
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to subject children to pain

156
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and violence and public humiliation

157
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development

158
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and good behavior?

159
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Is there any doubt

161
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that this question has an answer,

162
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and that it matters?

163
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, many of you might worry

164
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that the notion of well-being is truly undefined,

165
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.

166
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And so, how therefore can there be an

167
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
objective notion of well-being?

168
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.

169
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The concept of physical health is undefined.

170
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.

171
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
When this statue was carved

172
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the average life expectancy was probably 30.

173
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's now around 80 in the developed world.

174
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes

175
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in such a way that not being able to run a marathon

176
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.

177
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.

178
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Notice that the fact that the concept of health

180
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is open, genuinely open for revision,

181
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
does not make it vacuous.

182
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The distinction between a healthy person

183
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and a dead one

184
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.

185
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:

186
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
There may be equivalent ways to thrive;

187
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society

188
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
so as to maximize human flourishing.

189
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Now, why wouldn't this

190
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
undermine an objective morality?

191
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Well think of how we talk about food:

192
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I would never be tempted to argue to you

193
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that there must be one right food to eat.

194
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There is clearly a range of materials

195
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that constitute healthy food.

196
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction

197
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
between food and poison.

198
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The fact that there are many right answers

199
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to the question, "What is food?"

200
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
does not tempt us

201
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.

202
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Many people worry

203
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that a universal morality would require

204
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.

205
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,

206
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
it must always be wrong to lie,

207
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and if you can find an exception,

208
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
well then there's no such thing as moral truth.

209
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Why would we think this?

210
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.

211
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Now, if you're going to play good chess,

212
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,"

213
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
is very good to follow.

214
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But it clearly admits some exceptions.

215
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.

216
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.

217
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.

218
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The fact that there are exceptions here does not

219
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
change that at all.

220
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves

221
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.

222
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Consider the great problem of women's bodies:

223
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
What to do about them?

224
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Well this is one thing you can do about them:

225
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
You can cover them up.

226
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community

227
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that while we may not like this,

228
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we might think of this as "wrong"

229
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in Boston or Palo Alto,

230
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who are we to say

231
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that the proud denizens of an ancient culture

232
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
are wrong to force their wives and daughters

233
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to live in cloth bags?

234
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong

235
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to beat them with lengths of steel cable,

236
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or throw battery acid in their faces

237
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?

238
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Well, who are we not to say this?

239
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Who are we to pretend

240
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that we know so little about human well-being

241
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?

242
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --

243
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.

244
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
But what does voluntary mean

245
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in a community where,

246
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
when a girl gets raped,

247
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
her father's first impulse,

248
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
rather often, is to murder her out of shame?

249
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:

250
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Your daughter gets raped,

251
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and what you want to do is kill her.

252
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
What are the chances that represents

253
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
a peak of human flourishing?

254
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the

255
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
perfect solution in our own society.

256
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
For instance,

257
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere

258
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
in the civilized world.

259
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Now, granted, for many men

260
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.

261
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
(Laughter)

262
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But if we are in a reflective mood,

263
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
we can ask,

264
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
"Is this the perfect expression

265
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
of psychological balance

266
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"

267
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I mean, is this the optimal environment

268
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in which to raise our children?

269
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place

270
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
on the spectrum

271
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
between these two extremes

272
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that represents a place of better balance.

273
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

274
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Perhaps there are many such places --

275
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
again, given other changes in human culture

276
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.

277
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But the thing to notice is that there will be

278
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
many more ways not to be on a peak.

279
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Now the irony, from my perspective,

280
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me

281
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions

282
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
are religious demagogues of one form or another.

283
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions

284
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,

285
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes

286
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and condition of human and animal well-being.

287
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
In fact, the endurance of religion

288
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
as a lens through which most people view moral questions

289
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
has separated most moral talk

290
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
from real questions of human and animal suffering.

291
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
This is why we spend our time

292
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
talking about things like gay marriage

293
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation

294
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.

295
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need

296
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
a universal conception of human values.

297
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Now, what stands in the way of this?

298
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Well, one thing to notice is that we

299
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
do something different when talking about morality --

300
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
especially secular, academic, scientist types.

301
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion

302
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.

303
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning

304
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
meditating on compassion,

305
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component

306
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
of human happiness.

307
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;

308
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping

309
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and torturing and killing young women.

310
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion

311
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
about how to profitably use one's time.

312
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

313
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Most Western intellectuals

314
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
look at this situation

315
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama

316
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to be really right about -- really right about --

317
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about

318
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that admits of a real argument

319
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that potentially falls within the purview of science.

320
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.

321
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other

322
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that should persuade the other."

323
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Notice that we don't do this in science.

324
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
On the left you have Edward Witten.

325
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
He's a string theorist.

326
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
If you ask the smartest physicists around

327
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
who is the smartest physicist around,

328
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.

329
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.

330
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Laughter)

331
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference

332
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and said,"String theory is bogus.

333
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to

334
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
view the universe at a small scale.

335
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
I'm not a fan."

336
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Laughter)

337
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;

338
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I don't understand string theory.

339
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.

340
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Laughter)

341
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.

342
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But this is just the point.

343
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Whenever we are talking about facts

344
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
certain opinions must be excluded.

345
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.

346
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
That is what it is for knowledge to count.

347
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
How have we convinced ourselves

348
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,

349
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
or moral talent, or moral genius even?

350
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
How have we convinced ourselves

351
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that every opinion has to count?

352
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
How have we convinced ourselves

353
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that every culture has a point of view

354
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
on these subjects worth considering?

355
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Does the Taliban

356
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
have a point of view on physics

357
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that is worth considering? No.

358
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Laughter)

359
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
How is their ignorance any less obvious

360
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
on the subject of human well-being?

361
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
(Applause)

362
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.

363
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
It needs people like ourselves to admit

364
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that there are right and wrong answers

365
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
to questions of human flourishing,

366
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and morality relates

367
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to that domain of facts.

368
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
It is possible

369
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
for individuals, and even for whole cultures,

370
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
to care about the wrong things,

371
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
which is to say that it's possible for them

372
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead

373
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to needless human suffering.

374
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.

375
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
We live in a world in which

376
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
the boundaries between nations mean less and less,

377
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and they will one day mean nothing.

378
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
We live in a world filled with destructive technology,

379
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
and this technology cannot be uninvented;

380
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
it will always be easier

381
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
to break things than to fix them.

382
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious

383
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
that we can no more

384
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
respect and tolerate

385
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
vast differences in notions of human well-being

386
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
than we can respect or tolerate vast differences

387
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
in the notions about how disease spreads,

388
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.

389
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
We simply must converge

390
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.

391
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.

392
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Thank you very much.

393
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
(Applause)

394
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
Chris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.

395
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,

396
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
hearing some of this, may well be doing the

397
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.

398
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Language seems to be really important here.

399
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
When you're talking about the veil,

400
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.

401
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.

402
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And some of them would say something else. They would say,

403
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
"No, you know, this is a celebration

404
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
of female specialness,

405
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" --

406
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --

407
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
"that male lust is not to be trusted."

408
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
I mean, can you engage in a conversation

409
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?

410
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,

411
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
watching the clock ticking,

412
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
but the question is:

413
0:19:49.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
What is voluntary in a context

414
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
where men have certain expectations,

415
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:58,000
and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way

416
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
if you don't veil yourself?

417
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:02,000
And so, if anyone in this room

418
0:20:02.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
wanted to wear a veil,

419
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:07,000
or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --

420
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:1,000
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,

421
0:20:10.26,000 --> 0:20:13,000
but we have to be honest about

422
0:20:13.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
the constraints that these women are placed under.

423
0:20:15.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager

424
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
to always take their word for it,

425
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
especially when it's 120 degrees out

426
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and you're wearing a full burqa.

427
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
CA: A lot of people want to believe in this

428
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
concept of moral progress.

429
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:31,000
But can you reconcile that?

430
0:20:31.26,000 --> 0:20:33,000
I think I understood you to say that you could

431
0:20:33.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
reconcile that with a world that doesn't become

432
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.

433
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:4,000
Paint your picture of what

434
0:20:40.26,000 --> 0:20:43,000
rolling the clock 50 years forward,

435
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
100 years forward, how you would like to think of

436
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
the world, balancing moral progress

437
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:51,000
with richness.

438
0:20:51.26,000 --> 0:20:53,000
SH: Well, I think once you admit

439
0:20:53.26,000 --> 0:20:56,000
that we are on the path toward understanding our minds

440
0:20:56.26,000 --> 0:20:59,000
at the level of the brain in some important detail,

441
0:20:59.26,000 --> 0:21:01,000
then you have to admit

442
0:21:01.26,000 --> 0:21:05,000
that we are going to understand all of the positive

443
0:21:05.26,000 --> 0:21:07,000
and negative qualities

444
0:21:07.26,000 --> 0:21:09,000
of ourselves in much greater detail.

445
0:21:09.26,000 --> 0:21:11,000
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion

446
0:21:11.26,000 --> 0:21:13,000
like empathy and compassion,

447
0:21:13.26,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and we're going to understand the factors

448
0:21:15.26,000 --> 0:21:17,000
that encourage it -- whether they're genetic,

449
0:21:17.26,000 --> 0:21:19,000
whether they're how people talk to one another,

450
0:21:19.26,000 --> 0:21:21,000
whether they're economic systems,

451
0:21:21.26,000 --> 0:21:24,000
and insofar as we begin to shine light on that

452
0:21:24.26,000 --> 0:21:26,000
we are inevitably going to converge

453
0:21:26.26,000 --> 0:21:28,000
on that fact space.

454
0:21:28.26,000 --> 0:21:3,000
So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.

455
0:21:30.26,000 --> 0:21:33,000
It's not going to be like

456
0:21:33.26,000 --> 0:21:35,000
veiling my daughter from birth

457
0:21:35.26,000 --> 0:21:38,000
is just as good as teaching her

458
0:21:38.26,000 --> 0:21:42,000
to be confident and well-educated

459
0:21:42.26,000 --> 0:21:45,000
in the context of men who do desire women.

460
0:21:45.26,000 --> 0:21:49,000
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know

461
0:21:49.26,000 --> 0:21:52,000
that compulsory veiling is a bad idea --

462
0:21:52.26,000 --> 0:21:54,000
but at a certain point

463
0:21:54.26,000 --> 0:21:57,000
we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved

464
0:21:57.26,000 --> 0:22:,000
and actually interrogate them.

465
0:22:00.26,000 --> 0:22:03,000
Do people love their daughters

466
0:22:03.26,000 --> 0:22:06,000
just as much in these systems?

467
0:22:06.26,000 --> 0:22:08,000
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.

468
0:22:08.26,000 --> 0:22:11,000
CA: And if the results come out that actually they do,

469
0:22:11.26,000 --> 0:22:14,000
are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment

470
0:22:14.26,000 --> 0:22:16,000
on some of these issues?

471
0:22:16.26,000 --> 0:22:19,000
SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,

472
0:22:19.26,000 --> 0:22:21,000
that you can love someone

473
0:22:21.26,000 --> 0:22:24,000
in the context of a truly delusional belief system.

474
0:22:24.26,000 --> 0:22:26,000
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son

475
0:22:26.26,000 --> 0:22:29,000
was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,

476
0:22:29.26,000 --> 0:22:32,000
I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."

477
0:22:32.26,000 --> 0:22:34,000
If you get all those parts aligned,

478
0:22:34.26,000 --> 0:22:37,000
yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.

479
0:22:37.26,000 --> 0:22:39,000
But again, then we have to talk about

480
0:22:39.26,000 --> 0:22:41,000
well-being in a larger context.

481
0:22:41.26,000 --> 0:22:43,000
It's all of us in this together,

482
0:22:43.26,000 --> 0:22:47,000
not one man feeling ecstasy

483
0:22:47.26,000 --> 0:22:49,000
and then blowing himself up on a bus.

484
0:22:49.26,000 --> 0:22:51,000
CA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to

485
0:22:51.26,000 --> 0:22:53,000
continue for hours.

486
0:22:53.26,000 --> 0:22:55,000
We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.

487
0:22:55.26,000 --> 0:22:57,000
SH: Really an honor. Thank you.

488
0:22:57.26,000 --> 0:23:,000
(Applause)

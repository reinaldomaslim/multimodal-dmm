1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Every presentation needs this slide in it.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Do you see?

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
All the points, all the lines --

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it's incredible.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It is the network;

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and in my case, the network has been important in media,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
because I get to connect to people.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Isn't it amazing?

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Through that, I connect to people.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And the way that I've been doing it

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
has been multifaceted.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I put together projects like Earth Sandwich,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
where I ask people

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to try and simultaneously place

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
two pieces of bread

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And people started laying bread in tribute,

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and eventually a team was able to do it

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
between New Zealand and Spain.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Connecting to people in projects

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
like YoungmeNowme for example.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to find a childhood photograph of themselves

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and restage it as an adult.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is the same person --

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Poignant.

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This was a Mother's Day gift.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Particularly creepy.

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Applause)

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
My favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
with a little baby on her lap,

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the next photo is a 220-lb man

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.

44
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But this project changed the way

45
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that I thought about connecting to people.

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is project called Ray.

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and had no idea who generated the audio.

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Somebody said, "You have to listen to this."

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And this is what came to me.

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Recording: Hi, my name is Ray,

52
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and on yesterday my daughter called me

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because she was stressed out

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because of things that were going on on her job

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that she felt was quite unfair.

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort,

57
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and I didn't really know what to tell her,

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because we have to deal with so much mess in our society.

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So I was led to write this song just for her,

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
just to give her some encouragement

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
for all employees under stress

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Here's how the song goes.

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000

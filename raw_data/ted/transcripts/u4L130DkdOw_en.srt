1
0:00:13.309,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What images do we see from the rest of the world?

2
0:00:16.714,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We see natural disasters,

3
0:00:19.138,000 --> 0:00:2,000
war, terror.

4
0:00:21.036,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We see refugees,

5
0:00:22.833,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and we see horrible diseases.

6
0:00:24.325,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Right?

7
0:00:25.5,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We see beautiful beaches,

8
0:00:27.167,000 --> 0:00:28,000
cute animals,

9
0:00:28.474,000 --> 0:00:29,000
beautiful nature,

10
0:00:29.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
cultural rites and stuff.

11
0:00:32.557,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And then we're supposed to make the connection in our head

12
0:00:35.904,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and create a worldview out of this.

13
0:00:37.681,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And how is that possible?

14
0:00:39.482,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I mean, the world seems so strange.

15
0:00:42.517,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I don't think it is.

16
0:00:44.137,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I don't think the world is that strange, actually.

17
0:00:47.236,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I've got an idea.

18
0:00:48.748,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So, imagine the world as a street,

19
0:00:52.146,000 --> 0:00:55,000
where the poorest live on one end and the richest on the other,

20
0:00:55.976,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and everyone in the world lives on this street.

21
0:00:58.741,000 --> 0:01:,000
You live there, I live there,

22
0:01:01.041,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the neighbors we have are the ones with the same income.

23
0:01:04.83,000 --> 0:01:06,000
People that live in the same block as me,

24
0:01:07.778,000 --> 0:01:12,000
they are from other countries, other cultures, other religions.

25
0:01:13.202,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The street might look something like this.

26
0:01:15.615,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I was curious.

27
0:01:17.652,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In Sweden where I live,

28
0:01:19.606,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I've been meeting quite a lot of students.

29
0:01:22.165,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I wanted to know,

30
0:01:23.559,000 --> 0:01:26,000
where would they think they belong on a street like this?

31
0:01:26.676,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So we changed these houses into people.

32
0:01:30.204,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is the seven billion people that live in the world.

33
0:01:33.939,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And just by living in Sweden, most likely you belong there,

34
0:01:37.902,000 --> 0:01:38,000
which is the richest group.

35
0:01:39.788,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But the students, when you ask them,

36
0:01:42.046,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they think they are in the middle.

37
0:01:44.599,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And how can you understand the world

38
0:01:46.853,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when you see all these scary images from the world,

39
0:01:50.28,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and you think you live in the middle, while you're actually atop?

40
0:01:54.183,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Not very easy.

41
0:01:55.881,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So I sent out photographers

42
0:01:57.924,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to 264 homes in 50 countries -- so far, still counting --

43
0:02:03.104,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and in each home, the photographers take the same set of photos.

44
0:02:07.555,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They take the bed,

45
0:02:09.215,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the stove,

46
0:02:10.436,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the toys

47
0:02:11.703,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and about 135 other things.

48
0:02:14.577,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we have 40,000 images or something at the moment,

49
0:02:17.709,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and it looks something like this.

50
0:02:20.89,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Here we see, it says on the top,

51
0:02:22.79,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"Families in the world by income,"

52
0:02:24.831,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and we have the street represented just beneath it, you can see.

53
0:02:28.389,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And then we see some of the families we have visited.

54
0:02:31.049,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We have the poorer to the left, the richer to the right,

55
0:02:33.809,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and everybody else in between, as the concept says.

56
0:02:37.03,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We can go down and see the different families we have been to so far.

57
0:02:41.191,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Here, for instance, we have a family in Zimbabwe,

58
0:02:43.602,000 --> 0:02:46,000
one in India, one in Russia, and one in Mexico, for instance.

59
0:02:47.192,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So we can go around and look at the families this way.

60
0:02:49.819,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But of course, we can choose if we want to see some certain countries

61
0:02:53.155,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and compare them,

62
0:02:54.341,000 --> 0:02:56,000
or regions, or if we want, to see other things.

63
0:02:56.647,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So let's go to the front doors

64
0:02:58.81,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and see what they look like.

65
0:03:00.778,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Go here, and this is the world by front doors, ordered by income.

66
0:03:06.231,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And we can see the big difference

67
0:03:08.436,000 --> 0:03:12,000
from India, Philippines, China, Ukraine, in these examples, for instance.

68
0:03:13.323,000 --> 0:03:14,000
What if we go into the home?

69
0:03:15.811,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We can look at beds.

70
0:03:19.073,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is what beds can look like.

71
0:03:21.318,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Doesn't look like the glossy magazines.

72
0:03:23.452,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Doesn't look like the scary images in the media.

73
0:03:26.266,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So remember that the students in Sweden,

74
0:03:28.913,000 --> 0:03:3,000
they thought they were in the middle of the world income.

75
0:03:31.647,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So let's go there.

76
0:03:33.05,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We zoom in here by filtering the street to the middle,

77
0:03:38.736,000 --> 0:03:39,000
like this,

78
0:03:40.052,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and then I ask the students:

79
0:03:41.791,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Is this what your bedroom looks like?

80
0:03:43.988,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And they would actually not feel very at home.

81
0:03:47.567,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So we go down and see, do they feel more at home here?

82
0:03:51.279,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And they would say,

83
0:03:52.454,000 --> 0:03:54,000
no, this is not what a Swedish typical bedroom looks like.

84
0:03:55.299,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We go up here,

85
0:03:57.748,000 --> 0:04:,000
and suddenly, they feel sort of at home.

86
0:04:00.979,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And we can see here in this image,

87
0:04:02.774,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we see bedrooms in China, Netherlands,

88
0:04:05.569,000 --> 0:04:08,000
South Korea, France and the United States, for instance.

89
0:04:09.365,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So we can click here.

90
0:04:10.557,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If we want to know more about the family, the home in which this bed stands,

91
0:04:15.03,000 --> 0:04:18,000
we can just click it and go to the family,

92
0:04:18.097,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and we can see all the images from that family.

93
0:04:21.445,000 --> 0:04:22,000
We can go this way, too.

94
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And of course, this is free for anyone to use.

95
0:04:25.416,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So just go here, and please add more images, of course.

96
0:04:29.225,000 --> 0:04:32,000
My personal favorite that everyone always tries to make me not show,

97
0:04:32.958,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I'm going to show you now, and that's toilets,

98
0:04:35.157,000 --> 0:04:37,000
because you're not really allowed to look at people's toilets,

99
0:04:38.131,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but now we can just do it, right?

100
0:04:39.799,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So here (Laughter) we have a lot of toilets.

101
0:04:42.236,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They look pretty much as we're used to, right?

102
0:04:44.607,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And they are in China, Netherlands, United States, Nepal and so forth,

103
0:04:48.047,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Ukraine, France.

104
0:04:49.935,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And they look pretty similar, right?

105
0:04:51.764,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But remember, we are in the top.

106
0:04:54.41,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So what about checking all the toilets?

107
0:04:59.457,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now it looks a bit different, doesn't it?

108
0:05:01.963,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So this way we can visually browse through categories of imagery,

109
0:05:07.878,000 --> 0:05:08,000
using photos as data.

110
0:05:09.908,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But not everything works as a photo.

111
0:05:13.161,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Sometimes it's easier to understand what people do,

112
0:05:16.421,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so we also do video snippets of everyday activities,

113
0:05:20.116,000 --> 0:05:22,000
such as washing hands, doing laundry,

114
0:05:22.582,000 --> 0:05:23,000
brushing teeth, and so on.

115
0:05:24.248,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And I'm going to show you a short snippet of tooth-brushing,

116
0:05:27.116,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and we’re going to start at the top.

117
0:05:31.861,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So we see people brushing their teeth.

118
0:05:34.996,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Pretty interesting to see

119
0:05:37.239,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the same type of plastic toothbrush is being used in all these places

120
0:05:41.867,000 --> 0:05:42,000
in the same way, right?

121
0:05:44.74,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Some are more serious than others --

122
0:05:46.524,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:47.554,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but still, the toothbrush is there.

124
0:05:49.281,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And then, coming down to this poorer end,

125
0:05:51.958,000 --> 0:05:53,000
then we will see people start using sticks,

126
0:05:55.768,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and they will sometimes use their finger to brush their teeth.

127
0:06:00.016,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So this particular woman in Malawi,

128
0:06:02.513,000 --> 0:06:03,000
when she brushes her teeth,

129
0:06:04.129,000 --> 0:06:06,000
she scrapes some mud off from her wall

130
0:06:06.256,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and she mixes it with water, and then she's brushing.

131
0:06:09.184,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Therefore, in the Dollar Street material,

132
0:06:11.978,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we have tagged this image

133
0:06:14.112,000 --> 0:06:16,000
not only as her wall, which it is,

134
0:06:16.508,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but also as her toothpaste,

135
0:06:18.959,000 --> 0:06:2,000
because that is also what she uses it for.

136
0:06:22.489,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So we can say, in the poorer end of the street,

137
0:06:25.196,000 --> 0:06:27,000
you will use a stick or your finger,

138
0:06:27.672,000 --> 0:06:3,000
you come to the middle, you will start using a toothbrush,

139
0:06:30.839,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and then you come up to the top,

140
0:06:32.512,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and you will start using one each.

141
0:06:34.351,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Pretty nice, not sharing a toothbrush with your grandma.

142
0:06:37.278,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And you can also look at some countries.

143
0:06:40.148,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Here, we have the income distribution within the US,

144
0:06:43.029,000 --> 0:06:44,000
most people in the middle.

145
0:06:44.747,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We have a family we visited in the richer end, the Howards.

146
0:06:48.73,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We can see their home here.

147
0:06:50.501,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And we also visited a family in the poorer end, down here.

148
0:06:54.024,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And then what we can do now is we can do instant comparisons

149
0:06:57.614,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of things in their homes.

150
0:06:59.262,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Let's look in their cutlery drawer.

151
0:07:01.79,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So, observe the Hadleys:

152
0:07:03.892,000 --> 0:07:06,000
they have all their cutlery in a green plastic box.

153
0:07:07.482,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and they have a few different types and some of them are plastic,

154
0:07:11.435,000 --> 0:07:14,000
while the Howards, they have this wooden drawer

155
0:07:14.636,000 --> 0:07:16,000
with small wooden compartments in it

156
0:07:16.836,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and a section for each type of cutlery.

157
0:07:20.392,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We can add more families,

158
0:07:22.289,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and we can see kitchen sinks,

159
0:07:24.853,000 --> 0:07:26,000
or maybe living rooms.

160
0:07:27.416,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Of course, we can do the same in other countries.

161
0:07:29.845,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So we go to China, we pick three families.

162
0:07:33.434,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we look at their houses,

163
0:07:35.145,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we can look at their sofas,

164
0:07:37.005,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we can look at their stoves.

165
0:07:38.899,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And when you see these stoves,

166
0:07:40.783,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I think it's obvious that it's a stupid thing

167
0:07:43.619,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that usually, when we think about other countries,

168
0:07:46.835,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we think they have a certain way of doing things.

169
0:07:49.387,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But look at these stoves.

170
0:07:50.803,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Very different, right,

171
0:07:52.303,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because it depends on what income level you have,

172
0:07:54.648,000 --> 0:07:55,000
how you're going to cook your food.

173
0:07:56.533,000 --> 0:08:,000
But the cool thing is when we start comparing across countries.

174
0:08:00.591,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So here we have China and the US.

175
0:08:03.338,000 --> 0:08:06,000
See the big overlap between these two.

176
0:08:06.97,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So we picked the two homes we have already seen in these countries,

177
0:08:10.871,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the Wus and the Howards.

178
0:08:13.38,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Standing in their bedroom,

179
0:08:14.784,000 --> 0:08:17,000
pretty hard to tell which one is China and which one is the US, right?

180
0:08:18.792,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Both have brown leather sofas,

181
0:08:21.107,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and they have similar play structures.

182
0:08:23.211,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Most likely both are made in China,

183
0:08:24.991,000 --> 0:08:25,000
so, I mean, that's not very strange --

184
0:08:26.848,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:27.983,000 --> 0:08:28,000
but that is similar.

186
0:08:29.32,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We can of course go down to the other end of the street,

187
0:08:32.103,000 --> 0:08:33,000
adding Nigeria.

188
0:08:33.736,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So let's compare two homes in China and Nigeria.

189
0:08:37.689,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Looking at the family photos,

190
0:08:39.529,000 --> 0:08:42,000
they do not look like they have a lot in common, do they?

191
0:08:42.688,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But start seeing their ceiling.

192
0:08:44.738,000 --> 0:08:46,000
They have a plastic shield and grass.

193
0:08:47.512,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They have the same kind of sofa,

194
0:08:49.891,000 --> 0:08:51,000
they store their grain in similar ways,

195
0:08:53.243,000 --> 0:08:54,000
they're going to have fish for dinner,

196
0:08:55.119,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and they're boiling their water in identical ways.

197
0:08:58.471,000 --> 0:09:,000
So if we would visit any of these homes,

198
0:09:01.378,000 --> 0:09:04,000
there's a huge risk that we would say we know anything

199
0:09:05.142,000 --> 0:09:09,000
about the specific way you do things in China or Nigeria,

200
0:09:09.482,000 --> 0:09:11,000
while, looking at this, it's quite obvious --

201
0:09:12.111,000 --> 0:09:14,000
this is how you do things on this income level.

202
0:09:14.389,000 --> 0:09:18,000
That is what you can see when you go through the imagery in Dollar Street.

203
0:09:18.774,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So going back to the figures,

204
0:09:20.982,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the seven billion people of the world,

205
0:09:23.202,000 --> 0:09:24,000
now we're going to do a quick recap.

206
0:09:25.17,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We're going to look at comparisons of things in the poorest group:

207
0:09:29.106,000 --> 0:09:3,000
beds,

208
0:09:30.449,000 --> 0:09:31,000
roofs,

209
0:09:32.569,000 --> 0:09:33,000
cooking.

210
0:09:33.806,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And observe, in all these comparisons,

211
0:09:36.043,000 --> 0:09:37,000
their homes are chosen

212
0:09:37.817,000 --> 0:09:39,000
so they are in completely different places of the world.

213
0:09:40.541,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But what we see is pretty identical.

214
0:09:42.728,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So the poorest billion cooking

215
0:09:44.493,000 --> 0:09:46,000
would look somewhat the same in these two places;

216
0:09:47.491,000 --> 0:09:48,000
you might not have shoes;

217
0:09:49.234,000 --> 0:09:5,000
eating, if you don't have a spoon;

218
0:09:51.667,000 --> 0:09:54,000
storing salt would be similar whether you're in Asia or in Africa;

219
0:09:55.611,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and going to the toilet would be pretty much the same experience

220
0:09:58.841,000 --> 0:09:59,000
whether you're in Nigeria or Nepal.

221
0:10:00.858,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In the middle, we have a huge group of five billion,

222
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but here we can see you will have electric light, most likely;

223
0:10:07.7,000 --> 0:10:08,000
you will no longer sleep on the floor;

224
0:10:09.676,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you will store your salt in a container;

225
0:10:12.044,000 --> 0:10:13,000
you will have more than one spoon;

226
0:10:13.887,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you will have more than one pen;

227
0:10:16.127,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the ceiling is no longer leaking that much;

228
0:10:18.797,000 --> 0:10:19,000
you will have shoes;

229
0:10:20.386,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you might have a phone,

230
0:10:22.131,000 --> 0:10:23,000
toys,

231
0:10:23.309,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and produce waste.

232
0:10:24.841,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Coming to our group up here,

233
0:10:27.154,000 --> 0:10:29,000
similar shoes, Jordan, US.

234
0:10:30.041,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We have sofas, fruits, hairbrushes,

235
0:10:34.048,000 --> 0:10:35,000
bookshelves,

236
0:10:35.254,000 --> 0:10:37,000
toilet paper in Tanzania, Palestine,

237
0:10:38.142,000 --> 0:10:39,000
hard to distinguish

238
0:10:39.366,000 --> 0:10:43,000
if we would sit in US, Palestine or Tanzania from this one.

239
0:10:43.763,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Vietnam, Kenya:

240
0:10:45.566,000 --> 0:10:49,000
wardrobes, lamps, black dogs, floors, soap,

241
0:10:50.578,000 --> 0:10:52,000
laundry, clocks, computers,

242
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
phones, and so on, right?

243
0:10:55.34,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So we have a lot of similarities all over the world,

244
0:10:58.607,000 --> 0:11:,000
and the images we see in the media,

245
0:11:01.005,000 --> 0:11:04,000
they show us the world is a very, very strange place.

246
0:11:05.002,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But when we look at the Dollar Street images,

247
0:11:07.313,000 --> 0:11:08,000
they do not look like that.

248
0:11:09.23,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So using Dollar Street,

249
0:11:11.531,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we can use photos as data,

250
0:11:13.858,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and country stereotypes --

251
0:11:15.565,000 --> 0:11:17,000
they simply fall apart.

252
0:11:18.294,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So the person staring back at us from the other side of the world

253
0:11:21.959,000 --> 0:11:23,000
actually looks quite a lot like you.

254
0:11:24.804,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And that implies both a call to action

255
0:11:28.546,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and a reason for hope.

256
0:11:30.693,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Thank you.

257
0:11:31.884,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Applause)

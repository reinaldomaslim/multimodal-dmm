1
0:00:12.373,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Bruno Giussani: Commissioner, thank you for coming to TED.

2
0:00:15.196,000 --> 0:00:16,000
António Guterres: Pleasure.

3
0:00:16.537,000 --> 0:00:17,000
BG: Let's start with a figure.

4
0:00:18.013,000 --> 0:00:22,000
During 2015, almost one million refugees and migrants arrived in Europe

5
0:00:22.178,000 --> 0:00:23,000
from many different countries,

6
0:00:23.677,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of course, from Syria and Iraq, but also from Afghanistan

7
0:00:26.399,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and Bangladesh and Eritrea and elsewhere.

8
0:00:28.885,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And there have been reactions of two different kinds:

9
0:00:31.409,000 --> 0:00:34,000
welcoming parties and border fences.

10
0:00:35.148,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But I want to look at it a little bit

11
0:00:37.229,000 --> 0:00:39,000
from the short-term and the long-term perspective.

12
0:00:40.083,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And the first question is very simple:

13
0:00:43.599,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Why has the movement of refugees spiked so fast in the last six months?

14
0:00:48.091,000 --> 0:00:51,000
AG: Well, I think, basically, what triggered this huge increase

15
0:00:51.408,000 --> 0:00:52,000
was the Syrian refugee group.

16
0:00:53.353,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There has been an increased movement into Europe from Africa, from Asia,

17
0:00:58.113,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but slowly growing, and all of a sudden we had this massive increase

18
0:01:01.963,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in the first months of this year.

19
0:01:04.421,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Why? I think there are three reasons,

20
0:01:06.313,000 --> 0:01:08,000
two long-term ones and the trigger.

21
0:01:08.37,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The long-term ones, in relation to Syrians,

22
0:01:10.942,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is that hope is less and less clear for people.

23
0:01:17.573,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I mean, they look at their own country

24
0:01:19.629,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and they don't see much hope to go back home,

25
0:01:22.334,000 --> 0:01:23,000
because there is no political solution,

26
0:01:24.303,000 --> 0:01:27,000
so there is no light at the end of the tunnel.

27
0:01:27.382,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Second, the living conditions

28
0:01:29.03,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of the Syrians in the neighboring countries have been deteriorating.

29
0:01:32.38,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We just had research with the World Bank,

30
0:01:34.657,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and 87 percent of the Syrians in Jordan

31
0:01:39.017,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and 93 percent of the Syrians in Lebanon

32
0:01:41.942,000 --> 0:01:43,000
live below the national poverty lines.

33
0:01:44.828,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Only half of the children go to school,

34
0:01:47.785,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which means that people are living very badly.

35
0:01:50.831,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Not only are they refugees, out of home,

36
0:01:52.779,000 --> 0:01:54,000
not only have they suffered what they have suffered,

37
0:01:55.255,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but they are living in very, very dramatic conditions.

38
0:01:57.848,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And then the trigger was when all of a sudden,

39
0:02:00.192,000 --> 0:02:01,000
international aid decreased.

40
0:02:01.919,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The World Food Programme was forced, for lack of resources,

41
0:02:04.736,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to cut by 30 percent food support to the Syrian refugees.

42
0:02:07.824,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They're not allowed to work,

43
0:02:09.271,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so they are totally dependent on international support,

44
0:02:12.823,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and they felt, "The world is abandoning us."

45
0:02:15.151,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And that, in my opinion, was the trigger.

46
0:02:17.135,000 --> 0:02:18,000
All of a sudden, there was a rush,

47
0:02:18.794,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and people started to move in large numbers

48
0:02:20.833,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and, to be absolutely honest,

49
0:02:22.415,000 --> 0:02:24,000
if I had been in the same situation

50
0:02:24.638,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and I would have been brave enough to do it,

51
0:02:26.769,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I think I would have done the same.

52
0:02:28.496,000 --> 0:02:32,000
BG: But I think what surprised many people is it's not only sudden,

53
0:02:32.785,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but it wasn't supposed to be sudden.

54
0:02:35.009,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The war in Syria has been happening for five years.

55
0:02:37.446,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Millions of refugees are in camps and villages and towns around Syria.

56
0:02:41.13,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You have yourself warned about the situation

57
0:02:43.534,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and about the consequences of a breakdown of Libya, for example,

58
0:02:46.841,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and yet Europe looked totally unprepared.

59
0:02:50.618,000 --> 0:02:52,000
AG: Well, unprepared because divided,

60
0:02:53.101,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and when you are divided, you don't want to recognize the reality.

61
0:02:56.403,000 --> 0:02:57,000
You prefer to postpone decisions,

62
0:02:58.284,000 --> 0:03:,000
because you do not have the capacity to make them.

63
0:03:00.744,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And the proof is that even when the spike occurred,

64
0:03:04.23,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Europe remained divided

65
0:03:05.557,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and was unable to put in place a mechanism to manage the situation.

66
0:03:11.25,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You talk about one million people.

67
0:03:12.965,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It looks enormous,

68
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but the population of the European Union is 550 million people,

69
0:03:19.084,000 --> 0:03:23,000
which means we are talking about one per every [550] Europeans.

70
0:03:23.473,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, in Lebanon, we have one refugee per three Lebanese.

71
0:03:27.426,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And Lebanon? Struggling, of course, but it's managing.

72
0:03:31.681,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So, the question is: is this something that could have been managed

73
0:03:35.971,000 --> 0:03:38,000
if -- not mentioning the most important thing,

74
0:03:39.016,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which would have been addressing the root causes,

75
0:03:41.412,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but forgetting about root causes for now,

76
0:03:43.412,000 --> 0:03:44,000
looking at the phenomenon as it is --

77
0:03:45.261,000 --> 0:03:49,000
if Europe were able to come together in solidarity

78
0:03:49.575,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to create an adequate reception capacity of entry points?

79
0:03:53.739,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But for that, the countries at entry points need to be massively supported,

80
0:03:58.447,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and then screening the people with security checks

81
0:04:01.476,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and all the other mechanisms,

82
0:04:02.905,000 --> 0:04:05,000
distributing those that are coming into all European countries,

83
0:04:06.434,000 --> 0:04:08,000
according to the possibilities of each country.

84
0:04:08.691,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I mean, if you look at the relocation program

85
0:04:10.991,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that was approved by the Commission, always too little too late,

86
0:04:14.078,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or by the Council, too little too late --

87
0:04:16.024,000 --> 0:04:17,000
BG: It's already breaking down.

88
0:04:17.533,000 --> 0:04:19,000
AG: My country is supposed to receive four thousand.

89
0:04:20.014,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Four thousand in Portugal means nothing.

90
0:04:22.045,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So this is perfectly manageable if it is managed,

91
0:04:25.838,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but in the present circumstances, the pressure is at the point of entry,

92
0:04:29.272,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and then, as people move in this chaotic way through the Balkans,

93
0:04:32.755,000 --> 0:04:35,000
then they come to Germany, Sweden, basically, and Austria.

94
0:04:36.125,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They are the three countries that are, in the end, receiving the refugees.

95
0:04:39.655,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The rest of Europe is looking without doing much.

96
0:04:42.211,000 --> 0:04:44,000
BG: Let me try to bring up three questions,

97
0:04:44.594,000 --> 0:04:45,000
playing a bit devil's advocate.

98
0:04:46.115,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I'll try to ask them, make them blunt.

99
0:04:49.061,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But I think the questions are very present

100
0:04:51.124,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in the minds of many people in Europe right now,

101
0:04:53.401,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The first, of course, is about numbers.

102
0:04:55.356,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You say 550 million versus one million is not much, but realistically,

103
0:05:00.186,000 --> 0:05:01,000
how many people can Europe take?

104
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
AG: Well, that is a question that has no answer,

105
0:05:05.696,000 --> 0:05:08,000
because refugees have the right to be protected.

106
0:05:09.947,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And there is such a thing as international law,

107
0:05:13.138,000 --> 0:05:17,000
so there is no way you can say, "I take 10,000 and that's finished."

108
0:05:17.531,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I remind you of one thing:

109
0:05:19.342,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in Turkey, at the beginning of the crisis, I remember one minister saying,

110
0:05:23.242,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"Turkey will be able to receive up to 100,000 people."

111
0:05:26.241,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Turkey has now two million three-hundred thousand

112
0:05:29.71,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or something of the sort, if you count all refugees.

113
0:05:32.182,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So I don't think it's fair to say how many we can take.

114
0:05:36.395,000 --> 0:05:39,000
What it is fair to say is: how we can we organize ourselves

115
0:05:39.965,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to assume our international responsibilities?

116
0:05:42.734,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And Europe has not been able to do so,

117
0:05:45.208,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because basically, Europe is divided because there is no solidarity

118
0:05:48.783,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in the European project.

119
0:05:49.986,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And it's not only about refugees; there are many other areas.

120
0:05:53.136,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And let's be honest, this is the moment in which we need more Europe

121
0:05:56.794,000 --> 0:05:57,000
instead of less Europe.

122
0:05:58.354,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But as the public less and less believes in European institutions,

123
0:06:02.997,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it is also each time more difficult to convince the public

124
0:06:06.303,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that we need more Europe to solve these problems.

125
0:06:08.629,000 --> 0:06:09,000
BG: We seem to be at the point

126
0:06:10.1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
where the numbers turn into political shifts, particularly domestically.

127
0:06:13.535,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We saw it again this weekend in France,

128
0:06:15.431,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but we have seen it over and over in many countries:

129
0:06:17.907,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in Poland and in Denmark and in Switzerland and elsewhere,

130
0:06:20.664,000 --> 0:06:23,000
where the mood changes radically because of the numbers,

131
0:06:24.237,000 --> 0:06:3,000
although they are not very significant in absolute numbers.

132
0:06:30.471,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The Prime Minister of --

133
0:06:32.548,000 --> 0:06:33,000
AG: But, if I may, on these:

134
0:06:34.294,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I mean, what does a European see at home

135
0:06:37.619,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in a village where there are no migrants?

136
0:06:40.239,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What a European sees is, on television,

137
0:06:44.891,000 --> 0:06:48,000
every single day, a few months ago, opening the news every single day,

138
0:06:49.315,000 --> 0:06:51,000
a crowd coming, uncontrolled,

139
0:06:51.777,000 --> 0:06:52,000
moving from border to border,

140
0:06:53.541,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and the images on television were of hundreds

141
0:06:55.745,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or thousands of people moving.

142
0:06:57.436,000 --> 0:07:,000
And the idea is that nobody is taking care of it --

143
0:07:00.64,000 --> 0:07:03,000
this is happening without any kind of management.

144
0:07:04.013,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And so their idea was, "They are coming to my village."

145
0:07:06.862,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So there was this completely false idea that Europe was being invaded

146
0:07:10.959,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and our way of life is going to change, and everything will --

147
0:07:14.744,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And the problem is that if this had been properly managed,

148
0:07:18.633,000 --> 0:07:19,000
if people had been properly received,

149
0:07:20.519,000 --> 0:07:24,000
welcomed, sheltered at point of entry, screened at point of entry,

150
0:07:25.258,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and the moved by plane to different European countries,

151
0:07:27.971,000 --> 0:07:29,000
this would not have scared people.

152
0:07:30.153,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But, unfortunately, we have a lot of people scared,

153
0:07:32.82,000 --> 0:07:35,000
just because Europe was not able to do the job properly.

154
0:07:35.867,000 --> 0:07:36,000
BG: But there are villages in Germany

155
0:07:37.883,000 --> 0:07:4,000
with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees.

156
0:07:41.243,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So, what's your position?

157
0:07:43.241,000 --> 0:07:44,000
How do you imagine these people reacting?

158
0:07:45.232,000 --> 0:07:47,000
AG: If there would be a proper management of the situation

159
0:07:48.129,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and the proper distribution of people all over Europe,

160
0:07:51.233,000 --> 0:07:53,000
you would always have the percentage that I mentioned:

161
0:07:54.233,000 --> 0:07:55,000
one per each 2,000.

162
0:07:56.059,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It is because things are not properly managed

163
0:07:58.352,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that in the end we have situations

164
0:08:00.136,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that are totally impossible to live with, and of course if you have a village --

165
0:08:06.577,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in Lebanon, there are many villages

166
0:08:08.278,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that have more Syrians than Lebanese; Lebanon has been living with that.

167
0:08:11.71,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I'm not asking for the same to happen in Europe,

168
0:08:14.001,000 --> 0:08:17,000
for all European villages to have more refugees than inhabitants.

169
0:08:17.212,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What I am asking is for Europe to do the job properly,

170
0:08:20.291,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and to be able to organize itself to receive people

171
0:08:23.736,000 --> 0:08:25,000
as other countries in the world were forced to do in the past.

172
0:08:26.688,000 --> 0:08:29,000
BG: So, if you look at the global situation not only at Europe --

173
0:08:29.776,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Applause)

174
0:08:31.089,000 --> 0:08:32,000
BG: Yes!

175
0:08:32.264,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Applause)

176
0:08:36.922,000 --> 0:08:39,000
BG: If you look at the global situation, so, not only at Europe,

177
0:08:39.967,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I know you can make a long list of countries

178
0:08:42.095,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that are not really stepping up,

179
0:08:45.242,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but I'm more interested in the other part --

180
0:08:47.714,000 --> 0:08:49,000
is there somebody who's doing the right thing?

181
0:08:50.402,000 --> 0:08:52,000
AG: Well, 86 percent of the refugees in the world

182
0:08:52.857,000 --> 0:08:54,000
are in the developing world.

183
0:08:54.936,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And if you look at countries like Ethiopia --

184
0:08:58.28,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Ethiopia has received more than 600,000 refugees.

185
0:09:02.486,000 --> 0:09:04,000
All the borders in Ethiopia are open.

186
0:09:05.304,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And they have, as a policy,

187
0:09:07.196,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they call the "people to people" policy that every refugee should be received.

188
0:09:11.316,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And they have South Sudanese,

189
0:09:12.919,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they have Sudanese, they have Somalis.

190
0:09:14.951,000 --> 0:09:15,000
They have all the neighbors.

191
0:09:16.832,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They have Eritreans.

192
0:09:18.929,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And, in general,

193
0:09:20.248,000 --> 0:09:24,000
African countries are extremely welcoming of refugees coming,

194
0:09:24.452,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and I would say that in the Middle East

195
0:09:27.048,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and in Asia, we have seen a tendency for borders to be open.

196
0:09:32.265,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now we see some problems with the Syrian situation,

197
0:09:35.654,000 --> 0:09:39,000
as the Syrian situation evolved into also a major security crisis,

198
0:09:39.935,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but the truth is that for a large period,

199
0:09:42.052,000 --> 0:09:43,000
all borders in the Middle East were open.

200
0:09:44.068,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The truth is that for Afghans,

201
0:09:45.544,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the borders of Pakistan and Iran were open for, at the time,

202
0:09:48.401,000 --> 0:09:49,000
six million Afghans that came.

203
0:09:50.318,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So I would say that even today, the trend in the developing world

204
0:09:54.163,000 --> 0:09:56,000
has been for borders to be open.

205
0:09:56.513,000 --> 0:10:,000
The trend in the developed world is for these questions to become

206
0:10:00.949,000 --> 0:10:02,000
more and more complex,

207
0:10:03.079,000 --> 0:10:05,000
especially when there is, in the public opinion,

208
0:10:05.674,000 --> 0:10:1,000
a mixture of discussions between refugee protections on one side

209
0:10:10.781,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and security questions -- in my opinion, misinterpreted -- on the other side.

210
0:10:14.444,000 --> 0:10:15,000
BG: We'll come back to that too,

211
0:10:16.009,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers

212
0:10:18.773,000 --> 0:10:19,000
from the World Food Programme.

213
0:10:20.257,000 --> 0:10:22,000
That reflects the general underfunding of the organizations

214
0:10:23.114,000 --> 0:10:25,000
working on these issues.

215
0:10:26.155,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now that the world seems to have woken up,

216
0:10:28.734,000 --> 0:10:3,000
are you getting more funding and more support,

217
0:10:30.949,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or it's still the same?

218
0:10:32.386,000 --> 0:10:33,000
AG: We are getting more support.

219
0:10:34.209,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I would say that we are coming close to the levels of last year.

220
0:10:39.1,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We were much worse during the summer.

221
0:10:41.799,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But that is clearly insufficient to address the needs of the people

222
0:10:45.681,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and address the needs of the countries

223
0:10:47.595,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that are supporting the people.

224
0:10:49.118,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And here we have a basic review of the criteria, the objectives,

225
0:10:55.068,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the priorities of development cooperation that is required.

226
0:10:57.884,000 --> 0:11:,000
For instance, Lebanon and Jordan are middle-income countries.

227
0:11:00.911,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Because they are middle-income countries,

228
0:11:02.909,000 --> 0:11:04,000
they cannot receive soft loans or grants from the World Bank.

229
0:11:05.844,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Now, today this doesn't make any sense,

230
0:11:08.067,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because they are providing a global public good.

231
0:11:10.42,000 --> 0:11:11,000
They have millions of refugees there,

232
0:11:12.254,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and to be honest, they are pillars of stability in the region,

233
0:11:15.768,000 --> 0:11:16,000
with all the difficulties they face,

234
0:11:17.53,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and the first line of defense of our collective security.

235
0:11:20.244,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So it doesn't make sense

236
0:11:21.431,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that these countries are not a first priority

237
0:11:23.598,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in development cooperation policies.

238
0:11:25.367,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And they are not.

239
0:11:26.55,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And not only do the refugees live in very dramatic circumstances

240
0:11:29.976,000 --> 0:11:3,000
inside those countries,

241
0:11:31.23,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but the local communities themselves are suffering,

242
0:11:34.08,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because salaries went down,

243
0:11:37.491,000 --> 0:11:38,000
because there are more unemployed,

244
0:11:39.162,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because prices and rents went up.

245
0:11:42.238,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And, of course, if you look at today's situation

246
0:11:46.206,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of the indicators in these countries,

247
0:11:49.328,000 --> 0:11:54,000
it is clear that, especially their poor groups of the population,

248
0:11:54.835,000 --> 0:11:57,000
are living worse and worse because of the crisis they are facing.

249
0:11:58.094,000 --> 0:11:59,000
BG: Who should be providing this support?

250
0:12:00.102,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Country by country, international organizations, the European Union?

251
0:12:03.447,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Who should be coming up with this support?

252
0:12:05.519,000 --> 0:12:06,000
AG: We need to join all efforts.

253
0:12:07.088,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's clear that bilateral cooperation is essential.

254
0:12:09.657,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It's clear that multilateral cooperation is essential.

255
0:12:12.444,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's clear that international financial institutions should have flexibility

256
0:12:16.063,000 --> 0:12:18,000
in order to be able to invest more massively

257
0:12:18.806,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in support to these countries.

258
0:12:20.356,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We need to combine all the instruments and to understand that today,

259
0:12:23.626,000 --> 0:12:25,000
in protracted situations, at a certain moment,

260
0:12:26.096,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that it doesn't make sense anymore to make a distinction

261
0:12:28.79,000 --> 0:12:31,000
between humanitarian aid and development aid

262
0:12:32.463,000 --> 0:12:34,000
or development processes.

263
0:12:34.836,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Because you are talking about children in school,

264
0:12:38.463,000 --> 0:12:39,000
you are talking about health,

265
0:12:39.896,000 --> 0:12:41,000
you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded.

266
0:12:42.752,000 --> 0:12:45,000
You are talking about things that require a long-term perspective,

267
0:12:46.345,000 --> 0:12:47,000
a development perspective

268
0:12:47.702,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and not only an emergency humanitarian aid perspective.

269
0:12:51.147,000 --> 0:12:53,000
BG: I would like your comment on something

270
0:12:53.195,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that was in newspapers this morning.

271
0:12:54.972,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It is a statement made by the current front-runner

272
0:13:00.368,000 --> 0:13:03,000
for the Republican nomination for US President, Donald Trump.

273
0:13:03.738,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Yesterday, he said this.

274
0:13:05.128,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

275
0:13:06.153,000 --> 0:13:07,000
No, listen to this. It's interesting.

276
0:13:07.969,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I quote: "I am calling for a total and complete shutdown

277
0:13:10.863,000 --> 0:13:11,000
of Muslims entering the US,

278
0:13:12.585,000 --> 0:13:16,000
until our country's representatives can figure out what's going on."

279
0:13:17.425,000 --> 0:13:18,000
How do you react to that?

280
0:13:18.808,000 --> 0:13:2,000
AG: Well, it's not only Donald Trump.

281
0:13:20.916,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We have seen several people around the world

282
0:13:23.206,000 --> 0:13:25,000
with political responsibility saying, for instance,

283
0:13:25.643,000 --> 0:13:27,000
that Muslims refugees should not be received.

284
0:13:28.108,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And the reason why they say this

285
0:13:31.632,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is because they think that by doing or saying this,

286
0:13:34.755,000 --> 0:13:36,000
they are protecting the security of their countries.

287
0:13:37.361,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Now, I've been in government.

288
0:13:38.818,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I am very keen on the need for governments

289
0:13:41.12,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to protect the security of their countries

290
0:13:43.589,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and their people.

291
0:13:44.764,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But if you say, like that,

292
0:13:47.711,000 --> 0:13:49,000
in the US or in any European country,

293
0:13:50.241,000 --> 0:13:53,000
"We are going to close our doors to Muslim refugees,"

294
0:13:54.211,000 --> 0:13:57,000
what you are saying is the best possible help

295
0:13:57.347,000 --> 0:13:59,000
for the propaganda of terrorist organizations.

296
0:14:00.146,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Because what you are saying --

297
0:14:01.782,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Applause)

298
0:14:07.381,000 --> 0:14:12,000
What you are saying will be heard by all the Muslims in your own country,

299
0:14:12.988,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and it will pave the way for the recruitment

300
0:14:15.085,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and the mechanisms that, through technology,

301
0:14:17.73,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Daesh and al-Nusra, al-Qaeda, and all those other groups

302
0:14:21.609,000 --> 0:14:23,000
are today penetrating in our societies.

303
0:14:24.031,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And it's just telling them, "You are right, we are against you."

304
0:14:28.176,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So obviously, this is creating in societies that are all multiethnic,

305
0:14:34.59,000 --> 0:14:35,000
multi-religious, multicultural,

306
0:14:36.363,000 --> 0:14:39,000
this is creating a situation in which, really,

307
0:14:39.759,000 --> 0:14:42,000
it is much easier for the propaganda of these terrorist organizations

308
0:14:43.173,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to be effective in recruiting people for terror acts

309
0:14:48.31,000 --> 0:14:51,000
within the countries where these kinds of sentences are expressed.

310
0:14:52.248,000 --> 0:14:54,000
BG: Have the recent attacks in Paris and the reactions to them

311
0:14:55.255,000 --> 0:14:56,000
made your job more difficult?

312
0:14:57.262,000 --> 0:14:58,000
AG: Undoubtedly.

313
0:14:58.645,000 --> 0:14:59,000
BG: In what sense?

314
0:15:00.992,000 --> 0:15:04,000
AG: In the sense that, I mean, for many people the first reaction

315
0:15:05.332,000 --> 0:15:08,000
in relation to these kinds of terrorist attacks is: close all borders --

316
0:15:08.776,000 --> 0:15:12,000
not understanding that the terrorist problem in Europe is largely homegrown.

317
0:15:13.245,000 --> 0:15:17,000
We have thousands and thousands of European fighters in Syria and in Iraq,

318
0:15:18.242,000 --> 0:15:22,000
so this is not something that you solve by just not allowing Syrians to come in.

319
0:15:22.496,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And I must say, I am convinced

320
0:15:24.976,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that the passport that appeared,

321
0:15:29.172,000 --> 0:15:32,000
I believe, was put by the person who has blown --

322
0:15:32.943,000 --> 0:15:33,000
BG: -- himself up, yeah.

323
0:15:34.498,000 --> 0:15:35,000
AG: [I believe] it was on purpose,

324
0:15:36.433,000 --> 0:15:39,000
because part of the strategies of Daesh is against refugees,

325
0:15:40.075,000 --> 0:15:43,000
because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate

326
0:15:43.512,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and are fleeing to the crusaders.

327
0:15:45.988,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And I think that is part of Daesh's strategy to make Europe react,

328
0:15:50.075,000 --> 0:15:52,000
closing its doors to Muslim refugees

329
0:15:52.49,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and having an hostility towards Muslims inside Europe,

330
0:15:56.205,000 --> 0:15:59,000
exactly to facilitate Daesh's work.

331
0:15:59.751,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And my deep belief is that it was not the refugee movement

332
0:16:04.283,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that triggered terrorism.

333
0:16:05.988,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I think, as I said,

334
0:16:07.172,000 --> 0:16:1,000
essentially terrorism in Europe is today a homegrown movement

335
0:16:10.723,000 --> 0:16:13,000
in relation to the global situation that we are facing,

336
0:16:14.042,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and what we need is exactly to prove these groups wrong,

337
0:16:18.486,000 --> 0:16:21,000
by welcoming and integrating effectively

338
0:16:21.983,000 --> 0:16:23,000
those that are coming from that part of the world.

339
0:16:24.41,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And another thing that I believe is that to a large extent,

340
0:16:27.45,000 --> 0:16:29,000
what we are today paying for in Europe

341
0:16:29.937,000 --> 0:16:31,000
is the failures of integration models

342
0:16:32.131,000 --> 0:16:35,000
that didn't work in the '60s, in the '70s, in the '80s,

343
0:16:35.296,000 --> 0:16:37,000
in relation to big migration flows that took place at that time

344
0:16:38.291,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and generated what is today in many of the people, for instance,

345
0:16:42.104,000 --> 0:16:44,000
of the second generation of communities,

346
0:16:44.871,000 --> 0:16:48,000
a situation of feeling marginalized,

347
0:16:49.026,000 --> 0:16:5,000
having no jobs,

348
0:16:50.44,000 --> 0:16:51,000
having improper education,

349
0:16:52.003,000 --> 0:16:57,000
living in some of the neighborhoods that are not adequately provided

350
0:16:57.252,000 --> 0:16:59,000
by public infrastructure.

351
0:16:59.518,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And this kind of uneasiness, sometimes even anger,

352
0:17:04.375,000 --> 0:17:06,000
that exists in this second generation

353
0:17:06.868,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is largely due to the failure of integration policies,

354
0:17:09.915,000 --> 0:17:12,000
to the failure of what should have been a much stronger investment

355
0:17:13.82,000 --> 0:17:17,000
in creating the conditions for people to live together and respect each other.

356
0:17:18.232,000 --> 0:17:19,000
For me it is clear.

357
0:17:19.564,000 --> 0:17:22,000
(Applause)

358
0:17:22.829,000 --> 0:17:25,000
For me it is clear that all societies will be multiethnic, multicultural,

359
0:17:26.723,000 --> 0:17:27,000
multi-religious in the future.

360
0:17:28.666,000 --> 0:17:31,000
To try to avoid it is, in my opinion, impossible.

361
0:17:32.42,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And for me it's a good thing that they will be like that,

362
0:17:35.344,000 --> 0:17:38,000
but I also recognize that, for that to work properly,

363
0:17:38.746,000 --> 0:17:39,000
you need a huge investment

364
0:17:40.726,000 --> 0:17:42,000
in the social cohesion of your own societies.

365
0:17:43.186,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And Europe, to a large extent, failed in that investment

366
0:17:46.884,000 --> 0:17:49,000
in the past few decades.

367
0:17:50.121,000 --> 0:17:53,000
BG: Question: You are stepping down from your job at the end of the year,

368
0:17:54.141,000 --> 0:17:55,000
after 10 years.

369
0:17:55.698,000 --> 0:17:56,000
If you look back at 2005,

370
0:17:57.159,000 --> 0:18:,000
when you entered that office for the first time, what do you see?

371
0:18:01.491,000 --> 0:18:02,000
AG: Well, look:

372
0:18:04.466,000 --> 0:18:09,000
In 2005, we were helping one million people go back home

373
0:18:09.867,000 --> 0:18:12,000
in safety and dignity, because conflicts had ended.

374
0:18:13.692,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Last year, we helped 124,000.

375
0:18:17.659,000 --> 0:18:22,000
In 2005, we had about 38 million people displaced by conflict in the world.

376
0:18:22.771,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Today, we have more than 60 million.

377
0:18:26.052,000 --> 0:18:29,000
At that time, we had had, recently,

378
0:18:29.143,000 --> 0:18:31,000
some conflicts that were solved.

379
0:18:32.393,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Now, we see a multiplication of new conflicts

380
0:18:34.724,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and the old conflicts never died:

381
0:18:36.589,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Afghanistan, Somalia, Democratic Republic of Congo.

382
0:18:39.969,000 --> 0:18:43,000
It is clear that the world today is much more dangerous than it was.

383
0:18:44.049,000 --> 0:18:46,000
It is clear that the capacity of the international community

384
0:18:46.917,000 --> 0:18:48,000
to prevent conflicts and to timely solve them,

385
0:18:49.817,000 --> 0:18:53,000
is, unfortunately, much worse than what it was 10 years ago.

386
0:18:53.995,000 --> 0:18:55,000
There are no clear power relations in the world,

387
0:18:56.764,000 --> 0:18:58,000
no global governance mechanisms that work,

388
0:18:59.281,000 --> 0:19:01,000
which means that we live in a situation

389
0:19:02.084,000 --> 0:19:06,000
where impunity and unpredictability tend to prevail, and that means

390
0:19:07.034,000 --> 0:19:09,000
that more and more people suffer,

391
0:19:09.473,000 --> 0:19:11,000
namely those that are displaced by conflicts.

392
0:19:11.89,000 --> 0:19:13,000
BG: It's a tradition in American politics

393
0:19:13.92,000 --> 0:19:16,000
that when a President leaves the Oval Office for the last time,

394
0:19:17.574,000 --> 0:19:19,000
he leaves a handwritten note on the desk for his successor

395
0:19:20.375,000 --> 0:19:22,000
that walks in a couple of hours later.

396
0:19:22.5,000 --> 0:19:25,000
If you had to write such a note to your successor, Filippo Grandi,

397
0:19:25.709,000 --> 0:19:26,000
what would you write?

398
0:19:26.885,000 --> 0:19:29,000
AG: Well, I don't think I would write any message.

399
0:19:29.973,000 --> 0:19:31,000
You know, one of the terrible things when one leaves an office

400
0:19:32.972,000 --> 0:19:34,000
is to try to become the backseat driver,

401
0:19:35.726,000 --> 0:19:37,000
always telling the new one what to do.

402
0:19:38.637,000 --> 0:19:39,000
So that, I will not do.

403
0:19:40.177,000 --> 0:19:41,000
If I had to say something to him,

404
0:19:42.145,000 --> 0:19:44,000
it would be, "Be yourself, and do your best."

405
0:19:44.753,000 --> 0:19:46,000
BG: Commissioner, thank you for the job you do.

406
0:19:47.023,000 --> 0:19:48,000
Thank you for coming to TED.

407
0:19:48.552,000 --> 0:19:52,000

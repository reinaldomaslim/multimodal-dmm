0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello.

2
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to introduce you to someone.

3
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This is Jomny.

4
0:00:19.625,000 --> 0:00:21,000
That's "Jonny" but spelled accidentally with an "m,"

5
0:00:22.583,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in case you were wondering,

6
0:00:23.917,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because we're not all perfect.

7
0:00:25.417,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Jomny is an alien

8
0:00:27.458,000 --> 0:00:3,000
who has been sent to earth with a mission to study humans.

9
0:00:30.542,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Jomny is feeling lost and alone and far from home,

10
0:00:34.417,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I think we've all felt this way.

11
0:00:37.667,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Or, at least I have.

12
0:00:39.458,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I wrote this story about this alien at a moment in my life

13
0:00:42.458,000 --> 0:00:44,000
when I was feeling particularly alien.

14
0:00:44.542,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I had just moved to Cambridge and started my doctoral program at MIT,

15
0:00:47.833,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I was feeling intimidated and isolated and very much like I didn't belong.

16
0:00:53.667,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But I had a lifeline of sorts.

17
0:00:55.792,000 --> 0:00:59,000
See, I was writing jokes for years and years

18
0:01:00.042,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and sharing them on social media,

19
0:01:02.375,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I found that I was turning to doing this more and more.

20
0:01:06.25,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, for many people, the internet can feel like a lonely place.

21
0:01:10.333,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It can feel like this,

22
0:01:11.667,000 --> 0:01:13,000
a big, endless, expansive void

23
0:01:14.458,000 --> 0:01:17,000
where you can constantly call out to it but no one's ever listening.

24
0:01:18.708,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But I actually found a comfort in speaking out to the void.

25
0:01:22.208,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I found, in sharing my feelings with the void,

26
0:01:24.667,000 --> 0:01:26,000
eventually the void started to speak back.

27
0:01:28.375,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And it turns out that the void isn't this endless lonely expanse at all,

28
0:01:31.833,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but instead it's full of all sorts of other people,

29
0:01:34.292,000 --> 0:01:37,000
also staring out into it and also wanting to be heard.

30
0:01:37.625,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, there have been many bad things that have come from social media.

31
0:01:41.417,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I'm not trying to dispute that at all.

32
0:01:43.292,000 --> 0:01:46,000
To be online at any given point is to feel so much sadness

33
0:01:47.208,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and anger and violence.

34
0:01:49.542,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It can feel like the end of the world.

35
0:01:51.417,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Yet, at the same time, I'm conflicted

36
0:01:53.292,000 --> 0:01:56,000
because I can't deny the fact that so many of my closest friends

37
0:01:56.958,000 --> 0:01:58,000
are people that I had met originally online.

38
0:02:00.458,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I think that's partly because there's this confessional nature

39
0:02:03.75,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to social media.

40
0:02:05.75,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It can feel like you are writing in this personal, intimate diary

41
0:02:09.667,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that's completely private,

42
0:02:11.167,000 --> 0:02:14,000
yet at the same time you want everyone in the world to read it.

43
0:02:14.458,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I think part of that, the joy of that

44
0:02:17.25,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is that we get to experience things from perspectives from people

45
0:02:20.5,000 --> 0:02:22,000
who are completely different from ourselves,

46
0:02:22.583,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and sometimes that's a nice thing.

47
0:02:24.25,000 --> 0:02:25,000
For example, when I first joined Twitter,

48
0:02:26.25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I found that so many of the people that I was following

49
0:02:29.125,000 --> 0:02:31,000
were talking about mental health and going to therapy

50
0:02:31.833,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in ways that had none of the stigma that they often do

51
0:02:35.25,000 --> 0:02:37,000
when we talk about these issues in person.

52
0:02:37.792,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Through them, the conversation around mental health was normalized,

53
0:02:41.458,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they helped me realize that going to therapy was something

54
0:02:44.5,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that would help me as well.

55
0:02:46.125,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, for many people,

56
0:02:47.958,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it sounds like a scary idea to be talking about all these topics

57
0:02:52.458,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so publicly and so openly on the internet.

58
0:02:55.375,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I feel like a lot of people think that it is a big, scary thing

59
0:03:00.208,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to be online if you're not already perfectly and fully formed.

60
0:03:04.375,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But I think the internet can be actually a great place to not know,

61
0:03:07.792,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I think we can treat that with excitement,

62
0:03:11.792,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because to me there's something important about sharing your imperfections

63
0:03:16.417,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and your insecurities and your vulnerabilities

64
0:03:19.583,000 --> 0:03:2,000
with other people.

65
0:03:22.083,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:23.875,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, when someone shares that they feel sad or afraid

67
0:03:27.458,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or alone, for example,

68
0:03:29.167,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it actually makes me feel less alone,

69
0:03:31.333,000 --> 0:03:34,000
not by getting rid of any of my loneliness

70
0:03:34.458,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but by showing me that I am not alone

71
0:03:36.917,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in feeling lonely.

72
0:03:38.333,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And as a writer and as an artist,

73
0:03:40.083,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I care very much about making this comfort of being vulnerable

74
0:03:43.75,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a communal thing, something that we can share with each other.

75
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I'm excited about externalizing the internal,

76
0:03:49.542,000 --> 0:03:53,000
about taking those invisible personal feelings that I don't have words for,

77
0:03:54.5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
holding them to the light, putting words to them,

78
0:03:57.042,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and then sharing them with other people

79
0:03:58.958,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in the hopes that it might help them find words to find their feelings as well.

80
0:04:02.697,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now, I know that sounds like a big thing,

81
0:04:05.083,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but ultimately I'm interested in putting all these things

82
0:04:07.792,000 --> 0:04:09,000
into small, approachable packages,

83
0:04:10.333,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because when we can hide them into these smaller pieces,

84
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I think they are easier to approach, I think they're more fun.

85
0:04:15.958,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I think they can more easily help us see our shared humanness.

86
0:04:18.917,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Sometimes that takes the form of a short story,

87
0:04:21.333,000 --> 0:04:24,000
sometimes that takes the form of a cute book of illustrations, for example.

88
0:04:24.917,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And sometimes that takes the form

89
0:04:26.542,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of a silly joke that I'll throw on the internet.

90
0:04:29.041,000 --> 0:04:32,000
For example, a few months ago, I posted this app idea

91
0:04:32.541,000 --> 0:04:33,000
for a dog-walking service

92
0:04:34.5,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where a dog shows up at your door and you have to get out of the house

93
0:04:37.833,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and go for a walk.

94
0:04:39.125,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:42.333,000 --> 0:04:44,000
If there are app developers in the audience,

96
0:04:44.5,000 --> 0:04:45,000
please find me after the talk.

97
0:04:46.875,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Or, I like to share every time I feel anxious about sending an email.

98
0:04:50.5,000 --> 0:04:51,000
When I sign my emails "Best,"

99
0:04:51.958,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it's short for "I am trying my best,"

100
0:04:54.083,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which is short for "Please don't hate me, I promise I'm trying my best!"

101
0:04:58.708,000 --> 0:05:,000
Or my answer to the classic icebreaker,

102
0:05:01.25,000 --> 0:05:03,000
if I could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, I would.

103
0:05:04.083,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I am very lonely.

104
0:05:05.417,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:09.75,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I find that when I post things like these online,

106
0:05:13.667,000 --> 0:05:14,000
the reaction is very similar.

107
0:05:15.125,000 --> 0:05:16,000
People come together to share a laugh,

108
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to share in that feeling,

109
0:05:18.333,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and then to disburse just as quickly.

110
0:05:20.458,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:22.042,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Yes, leaving me once again alone.

112
0:05:26.25,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But I think sometimes these little gatherings can be quite meaningful.

113
0:05:30.625,000 --> 0:05:32,000
For example, when I graduated from architecture school

114
0:05:33.208,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I moved to Cambridge,

115
0:05:34.542,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I posted this question:

116
0:05:36.042,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"How many people in your life have you already had

117
0:05:38.435,000 --> 0:05:39,000
your last conversation with?"

118
0:05:40.958,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I was thinking about my own friends who had moved away

119
0:05:44.792,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to different cities and different countries, even,

120
0:05:47.167,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and how hard it would be for me to keep in touch with them.

121
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But other people started replying and sharing their own experiences.

122
0:05:53.25,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Somebody talked about a family member they had a falling out with.

123
0:05:56.417,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Someone talked about a loved one who had passed away

124
0:05:59.083,000 --> 0:06:,000
quickly and unexpectedly.

125
0:06:00.708,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Someone else talked about their friends from school

126
0:06:03.167,000 --> 0:06:04,000
who had moved away as well.

127
0:06:04.875,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But then something really nice started happening.

128
0:06:07.625,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Instead of just replying to me,

129
0:06:09.167,000 --> 0:06:11,000
people started replying to each other,

130
0:06:11.583,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and they started to talk to each other and share their own experiences

131
0:06:14.917,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and comfort each other

132
0:06:16.333,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and encourage each other to reach out to that friend

133
0:06:19.292,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that they hadn't spoken to in a while

134
0:06:21.125,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or that family member that they had a falling out with.

135
0:06:23.75,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And eventually, we got this little tiny microcommunity.

136
0:06:28.542,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It felt like this support group formed

137
0:06:31.042,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of all sorts of people coming together.

138
0:06:33.667,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I think every time we post online,

139
0:06:36.792,000 --> 0:06:37,000
every time we do this, there's a chance

140
0:06:38.708,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that these little microcommunities can form.

141
0:06:40.875,000 --> 0:06:44,000
There's a chance that all sorts of different creatures

142
0:06:44.917,000 --> 0:06:46,000
can come together and be drawn together.

143
0:06:47.125,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And sometimes, through the muck of the internet,

144
0:06:49.417,000 --> 0:06:51,000
you get to find a kindred spirit.

145
0:06:53.333,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Sometimes that's in the reading the replies

146
0:06:56.375,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and the comments sections and finding a reply that is particularly kind

147
0:06:59.875,000 --> 0:07:,000
or insightful or funny.

148
0:07:01.583,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Sometimes that's in going to follow someone

149
0:07:04.5,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and seeing that they already follow you back.

150
0:07:07.25,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And sometimes that's in looking at someone that you know in real life

151
0:07:10.542,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and seeing the things that you write and the things that they write

152
0:07:13.75,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and realizing that you share so many of the same interests as they do,

153
0:07:17.083,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and that brings them closer together to you.

154
0:07:19.292,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Sometimes, if you're lucky,

155
0:07:21.5,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you get to meet another alien.

156
0:07:24.874,000 --> 0:07:26,000
[when two aliebns find each other in a strange place,

157
0:07:27.375,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it feels a litle more like home]

158
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But I am worried, too, because as we all know,

159
0:07:31.208,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the internet for the most part doesn't feel like this.

160
0:07:34.25,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We all know that for the most part,

161
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the internet feels like a place where we misunderstand each other,

162
0:07:39.708,000 --> 0:07:42,000
where we come into conflict with each other,

163
0:07:44.583,000 --> 0:07:49,000
where there's all sorts of confusion and screaming and yelling and shouting,

164
0:07:49.875,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and it feels like there's too much of everything.

165
0:07:52.208,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It feels like chaos,

166
0:07:53.583,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I don't know how to square away the bad parts with the good,

167
0:07:57.833,000 --> 0:07:58,000
because as we know and as we've seen,

168
0:07:59.667,000 --> 0:08:02,000
the bad parts can really, really hurt us.

169
0:08:04.417,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It feels to me that the platforms that we use to inhabit these online spaces

170
0:08:09.5,000 --> 0:08:11,000
have been designed either ignorantly or willfully

171
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to allow for harassment and abuse, to propagate misinformation,

172
0:08:15.917,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to enable hatred and hate speech and the violence that comes from it,

173
0:08:19.625,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and it feels like none of our current platforms

174
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
are doing enough to address and to fix that.

175
0:08:24.792,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But still, and maybe probably unfortunately,

176
0:08:28.5,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'm still drawn to these online spaces, as many others are,

177
0:08:32.167,000 --> 0:08:36,000
because sometimes it just feels like that's where all the people are.

178
0:08:36.458,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I feel silly

179
0:08:38.292,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and stupid sometimes

180
0:08:40.417,000 --> 0:08:44,000
for valuing these small moments of human connection in times like these.

181
0:08:45.332,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But I've always operated under this idea

182
0:08:47.667,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that these little moments of humanness are not superfluous.

183
0:08:52.542,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They're not retreats from the world at all,

184
0:08:54.625,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but instead they're the reasons why we come to these spaces.

185
0:08:57.5,000 --> 0:09:,000
They are important and vital and they affirm and they give us life.

186
0:09:02.333,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And they are these tiny, temporary sanctuaries

187
0:09:05.167,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that show us that we are not as alone as we think we are.

188
0:09:09.792,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And so yes, even though life is bad and everyone's sad

189
0:09:12.625,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and one day we're all going to die --

190
0:09:15.375,000 --> 0:09:16,000
[look. life is bad. everyones sad.

191
0:09:17.042,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We're all gona die, but i alredy bought this inflatable bouncey castle

192
0:09:20.375,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so are u gona take Ur shoes off or not]

193
0:09:22.333,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I think the inflatable metaphorical bouncy castle in this case

194
0:09:26.917,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is really our relationships and our connections to other people.

195
0:09:34.542,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And so one night,

196
0:09:35.875,000 --> 0:09:38,000
when I was feeling particularly sad and hopeless about the world,

197
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I shouted out to the void,

198
0:09:41.208,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to the lonely darkness.

199
0:09:42.542,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I said, "At this point, logging on to social media

200
0:09:45.708,000 --> 0:09:47,000
feels like holding someone's hand at the end of the world."

201
0:09:48.708,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And this time, instead of the void responding,

202
0:09:51.208,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it was people who showed up,

203
0:09:53.875,000 --> 0:09:56,000
who started replying to me and then who started talking to each other,

204
0:09:57.583,000 --> 0:10:,000
and slowly this little tiny community formed.

205
0:10:00.833,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Everybody came together to hold hands.

206
0:10:03.875,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And in these dangerous and unsure times,

207
0:10:08.083,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in the midst of it all,

208
0:10:10.208,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I think the thing that we have to hold on to is other people.

209
0:10:14.625,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And I know that is a small thing made up of small moments,

210
0:10:19.083,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but I think it is one tiny, tiny sliver of light

211
0:10:22.542,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in all the darkness.

212
0:10:24.375,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Thank you.

213
0:10:25.667,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Applause)

214
0:10:30.208,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Thank you.

215
0:10:31.5,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Applause)

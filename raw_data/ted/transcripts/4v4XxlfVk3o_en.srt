1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So I think data can actually make us more human.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We're collecting and creating all kinds of data about how we're living our lives,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Recently, a wise media theorist Tweeted,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"The 19th century culture was defined by the novel,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the 20th century culture was defined by the cinema,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and the culture of the 21st century

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
will be defined by the interface."

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And I believe this is going to prove true.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Our lives are being driven by data,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and the presentation of that data is an opportunity

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for us to make some amazing interfaces that tell great stories.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So I'm going to show you a few of the projects

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that I've been working on over the last couple years

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that reflect on our lives and our systems.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This is a project called Flight Patterns.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
What you're looking at is airplane traffic

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
over North America for a 24-hour period.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
As you see, everything starts to fade to black,

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and you see people going to sleep.

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Followed by that, you see on the West coast

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
planes moving across, the red-eye flights to the East coast.

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And you'll see everybody waking up on the East coast,

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
followed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
You see San Francisco and Los Angeles

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
start to make their journeys down to Hawaii in the lower left-hand corner.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I think it's one thing to say there's 140,000 planes

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
being monitored by the federal government at any one time,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is a time-lapse image of that exact same data,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but I've color-coded it by type,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us.

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I started making these, and I put them into Google Maps

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and allow you to zoom in and see individual airports

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and the patterns that are occurring there.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So here we can see the white represents low altitudes,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the blue are higher altitudes.

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And you can zoom in. This is taking a look at Atlanta.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You can see this is a major shipping airport,

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and there's all kinds of activity there.

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You can also toggle between altitude

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
for model and manufacturer.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
See again, the diversity.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And you can scroll around and see

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
some of the different airports and the different patterns that they have.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This is scrolling up the East coast.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You can see some of the chaos that's happening in New York

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
with the air traffic controllers

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
having to deal with all those major airports next to each other.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So zooming back out real quick,

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we see, again, the U.S. -- you get Florida down in the right-hand corner.

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Moving across to the West coast,

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
you see San Francisco and Los Angeles --

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
big low-traffic zones

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
across Nevada and Arizona.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And that's us down there in L.A. and Long Beach on the bottom.

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I started taking a look as well at different perimeters,

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.

60
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is looking at ascending versus descending flights.

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And you can see, over time, the ways the airports change.

62
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You see the holding patterns that start to develop

63
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in the bottom of the screen.

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And you can see, eventually the airport actually flips directions.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So this is another project that I worked on with the Sensible Cities Lab at MIT.

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is visualizing international communications.

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So it's how New York communicates

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
with other international cities.

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And we set this up as a live globe in the Museum of Modern Art in New York

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for the Design the Elastic Mind exhibition.

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset,

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so you could see the changing relationship

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and some demographic info

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
coming through AT&T's data and revealing itself.

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and CurrentCity.org.

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So you're seeing the daily ebb and flow

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city,

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
until we approach New Year's Eve, where everybody says, "Happy New Year!"

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So this is an interactive tool

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that you can move around and see different parts of the city.

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is looking at another event. This is called Queen's Day.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So again, you get this daily ebb and flow

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of people sending SMS messages from different parts of the city.

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And then you're going to see people start to gather in the center of the city

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to celebrate the night before,

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which happens right here.

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then you can see people celebrating the next day.

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So now on to something completely different.

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Some of you may recognize this.

94
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And it's this amazing robot that plays chess extremely well,

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
except for one thing: it's not a robot at all.

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
There's actually a legless man that sits in that box

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and controls this chess player.

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This was the inspiration for a web service by Amazon

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
called the Mechanical Turk -- named after this guy.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And it's based on the premise that there are certain things

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that are easy for people, but really difficult for computers.

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So they made this web service and said,

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"Any programmer can write a piece of software

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and tap into the minds of thousands of people."

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The nerdy side of me thought, "Wow, this is amazing.

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I can tap into thousands of people's minds."

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And the other nerdy side of me thought,

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"This is horrible. This is completely bizarre.

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
What does this mean for the future of mankind,

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
where we're all plugged into this borg?"

112
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I was probably being a little extreme.

113
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But what does this mean when we have no context for what it is that we're working on,

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and we're just doing these little labors?

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So I created this drawing tool.

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I said, "I'll pay you two cents for your contribution."

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I started collecting sheep.

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I collected a lot, a lot of different sheep.

120
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Lots of sheep.

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I took the first 10,000 sheep that I collected,

122
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.com

123
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep.

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You can't pick individual sheep,

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And juxtaposed against this grid,

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
you see actually, by rolling over each individual one,

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.

129
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I think there's something really interesting

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to watching people as they go through this creative toil --

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
something we can all relate to,

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this creative process of trying to come up with something from nothing.

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I think it was really interesting to juxtapose this humanity

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
versus this massive distributed grid.

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Kind of amazing what some people did.

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So here's a few statistics from the project.

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Approximate collection rate of 11 sheep per hour,

138
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which would make a working wage of 69 cents per hour.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
There were 662 rejected sheep

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that didn't meet "sheep-like" criteria and were thrown out of the flock.

141
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

142
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The amount of time spent drawing ranged from four seconds to 46 minutes.

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication.

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And there were 7,599 people that contributed to the project,

145
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or were unique IP addresses --

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
so about how many people contributed.

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But only one of them out of the 7,599 said this.

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Which I was pretty surprised by.

150
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I expected people to be wondering, "Why did I draw a sheep?"

151
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I think it's a pretty valid question.

152
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep.

153
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Sheep were the first animal

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts,

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the first to be selectively bred for production traits,

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the first animal to be cloned.

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Obviously, we think of sheep as followers.

158
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And there's this reference to "Le Petit Prince"

159
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
where the narrator asks the prince to draw a sheep.

160
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He draws sheep after sheep.

161
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box.

162
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And he says, "It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.

163
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It's about your own interpretation and doing something different."

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And I like that.

165
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So this is a clip from Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times."

166
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's showing Charlie Chaplin dealing with some of the major changes

167
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
during the Industrial Revolution.

168
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So there were no longer shoe makers,

169
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but now there are people slapping soles on people's shoes.

170
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed a lot.

171
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So I thought this was an interesting clip

172
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to divide into 16 pieces

173
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and feed into the Mechanical Turk with a drawing tool.

174
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This basically allowed -- what you see on the left side is the original frame,

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and on the right side you see that frame

176
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
as interpreted by 16 people

177
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
who have no idea what it is they're doing.

178
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And this was the inspiration for a project

179
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that I worked on with my friend Takashi Kawashima.

180
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We decided to use the Mechanical Turk for exactly what it was meant for,

181
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which is making money.

182
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces,

183
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.

184
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We asked people to draw what it was that they saw.

185
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But here there was no sheep-like criteria.

186
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
People, if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face,

187
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it actually made it into the bill.

188
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So what you see is actually a representation of how well people did

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
what it was they were asked to do.

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So we took these hundred dollar bills,

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.com,

192
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions.

193
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And you can also trade real hundred-dollar bills for fake hundred-dollar bills

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and make a donation to the Hundred Dollar Laptop Project,

195
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
which is now known as One Laptop Per Child.

196
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is again showing all the different contributions.

197
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You see some people did beautiful stipple renderings,

198
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
like this one on top --

199
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
spent a long time making realistic versions.

200
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.

201
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Here on the right-hand side in the middle

202
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you see this one guy writing, "$0.01!!! Really?"

203
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
That's all I'm getting paid for this?

204
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So the last Mechanical Turk project I'm going to talk to you about

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is called Bicycle Built for 2000.

207
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is a collaboration with my friend Daniel Massey.

208
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You may recognize these two guys.

209
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is Max Mathews and John Kelly from Bell Labs in the '60s,

210
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
where they created the song "Daisy Bell,"

211
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
which was the world's first singing computer.

212
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You may recognize it from "2001: A Space Odyssey."

213
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song,

214
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as a reference to when computers became human.

215
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So we resynthesized this song.

216
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This is what that sounded like.

217
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We broke down all the individual notes

218
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
in the singing as well as the phonemes in the singing.

219
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000

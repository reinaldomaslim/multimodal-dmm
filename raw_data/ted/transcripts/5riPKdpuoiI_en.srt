1
0:00:13.344,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Aquatic noises)

2
0:00:20.811,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So this video was taken

3
0:00:22.714,000 --> 0:00:24,000
at Aquarius undersea laboratory

4
0:00:25.146,000 --> 0:00:26,000
four miles off the coast of Key Largo,

5
0:00:26.999,000 --> 0:00:28,000
about 60 feet below the surface.

6
0:00:29.577,000 --> 0:00:3,000
NASA uses this extreme environment

7
0:00:31.301,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to train astronauts and aquanauts,

8
0:00:33.725,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and last year, they invited us along for the ride.

9
0:00:37.087,000 --> 0:00:39,000
All the footage was taken from our open ROV,

10
0:00:39.971,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which is a robot that we built in our garage.

11
0:00:44.458,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So ROV stands for Remote Operated Vehicle,

12
0:00:48.026,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which in our case means our little robot

13
0:00:49.553,000 --> 0:00:51,000
sends live video

14
0:00:51.817,000 --> 0:00:52,000
across that ultra-thin tether

15
0:00:53.735,000 --> 0:00:55,000
back to the computer topside.

16
0:00:56.163,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's open source, meaning we publish

17
0:00:58.141,000 --> 0:01:,000
and share all of our design files

18
0:01:00.186,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and all of our code online,

19
0:01:01.694,000 --> 0:01:03,000
allowing anyone to modify

20
0:01:03.728,000 --> 0:01:05,000
or improve or change the design.

21
0:01:06.077,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's built with mostly off-the-shelf parts

22
0:01:08.38,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and costs about 1,000 times cheaper

23
0:01:10.215,000 --> 0:01:11,000
than the ROVs James Cameron used

24
0:01:12.094,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to explore the Titanic.

25
0:01:15.699,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So ROVs aren't new.

26
0:01:17.909,000 --> 0:01:18,000
They've been around for decades.

27
0:01:19.617,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Scientists use ROVs to explore the oceans.

28
0:01:22.653,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Oil and gas companies use them for exploration

29
0:01:25.472,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and construction.

30
0:01:27.019,000 --> 0:01:29,000
What we've built isn't unique.

31
0:01:29.781,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's how we've built it that's really unique.

32
0:01:32.655,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I want to give you a quick story of how it got started.

33
0:01:35.636,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So a few years ago, my friend Eric and I

34
0:01:37.907,000 --> 0:01:39,000
decided we wanted to explore this underwater cave

35
0:01:40.107,000 --> 0:01:41,000
in the foothills of the Sierras.

36
0:01:41.965,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We had heard this story about lost gold

37
0:01:43.868,000 --> 0:01:45,000
from a Gold Rush-era robbery, and we wanted to go up there.

38
0:01:46.386,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Unfortunately, we didn't have any money

39
0:01:48.044,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and we didn't have any tools to do it.

40
0:01:49.867,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So Eric had an initial design idea for a robot,

41
0:01:53.067,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but we didn't have all the parts figured out,

42
0:01:55.84,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so we did what anybody would do in our situation:

43
0:01:58.052,000 --> 0:02:,000
we asked the Internet for help.

44
0:02:00.09,000 --> 0:02:02,000
More specifically, we created this website,

45
0:02:02.622,000 --> 0:02:04,000
openROV.com, and shared our intentions and our plans

46
0:02:05.517,000 --> 0:02:07,000
For the first few months, it was just Eric and I

47
0:02:07.907,000 --> 0:02:09,000
talking back to each other on the forums,

48
0:02:10.437,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but pretty soon, we started to get feedback

49
0:02:12.525,000 --> 0:02:13,000
from makers and hobbyists,

50
0:02:14.368,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and then actually professional ocean engineers

51
0:02:16.362,000 --> 0:02:19,000
who had some suggestions for what we should do.

52
0:02:19.894,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We kept working on it. We learned a lot.

53
0:02:21.658,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We kept prototyping, and eventually,

54
0:02:23.683,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we decided we wanted to go to the cave. We were ready.

55
0:02:26.402,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So about that time, our little expedition became quite a story,

56
0:02:29.842,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and it got picked up in The New York Times.

57
0:02:31.863,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And we were pretty much just overwhelmed

58
0:02:33.675,000 --> 0:02:34,000
with interest from people who wanted a kit

59
0:02:35.458,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that they could build this open ROV themselves.

60
0:02:37.979,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So we decided to put the project on Kickstarter,

61
0:02:41.268,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and when we did,

62
0:02:42.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we raised our funding goal in about two hours,

63
0:02:44.575,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and all of a sudden, had this money to make these kits.

64
0:02:47.78,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But then we had to learn how to make them.

65
0:02:49.975,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I mean, we had to learn small batch manufacturing.

66
0:02:52.14,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So we quickly learned that our garage

67
0:02:55.4,000 --> 0:02:57,000
was not big enough to hold our growing operation.

68
0:02:58.079,000 --> 0:03:,000
But we were able to do it, we got all the kits made,

69
0:03:00.235,000 --> 0:03:02,000
thanks a lot to TechShop, which was a big help to us,

70
0:03:02.942,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and we shipped these kits all over the world

71
0:03:05.927,000 --> 0:03:06,000
just before Christmas of last year,

72
0:03:07.756,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so it was just a few months ago.

73
0:03:09.538,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But we're already starting to get video

74
0:03:11.446,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and photos back from all over the world,

75
0:03:13.044,000 --> 0:03:16,000
including this shot from under the ice in Antarctica.

76
0:03:16.074,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We've also learned the penguins love robots.

77
0:03:19.474,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:21.487,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So we're still publishing all the designs online,

79
0:03:24.655,000 --> 0:03:26,000
encouraging anyone to build these themselves.

80
0:03:26.773,000 --> 0:03:28,000
That's the only way that we could have done this.

81
0:03:29.176,000 --> 0:03:3,000
By being open source, we've created

82
0:03:30.835,000 --> 0:03:32,000
this distributed R&D network,

83
0:03:33.099,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and we're moving faster than any venture-backed counterpart.

84
0:03:36.895,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But the actual robot is really only half the story.

85
0:03:40.1,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The real potential, the long term potential,

86
0:03:42.596,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is with this community of DIY ocean explorers

87
0:03:45.273,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that are forming all over the globe.

88
0:03:47.669,000 --> 0:03:48,000
What can we discover

89
0:03:49.203,000 --> 0:03:5,000
when there's thousands of these devices

90
0:03:51.107,000 --> 0:03:53,000
roaming the seas?

91
0:03:53.153,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So you're probably all wondering: the cave.

92
0:03:55.429,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Did you find the gold?

93
0:03:57.255,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well, we didn't find any gold,

94
0:03:58.807,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but we decided that what we found was much more valuable.

95
0:04:02.036,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It was the glimpse into a potential future

96
0:04:04.508,000 --> 0:04:05,000
for ocean exploration.

97
0:04:06.183,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It's something that's not limited to the James Camerons of the world,

98
0:04:09.093,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but something that we're all participating in.

99
0:04:11.688,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's an underwater world

100
0:04:13.021,000 --> 0:04:15,000
we're all exploring together.

101
0:04:15.532,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Thank you.

102
0:04:17.707,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Applause)

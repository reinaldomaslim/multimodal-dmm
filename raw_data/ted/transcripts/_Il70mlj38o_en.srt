2
0:00:13.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
At 7:45 a.m., I open the doors to a building

3
0:00:19.607,000 --> 0:00:23,000
dedicated to building, yet only breaks me down.

4
0:00:24.515,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I march down hallways cleaned up after me every day

5
0:00:28.725,000 --> 0:00:31,000
by regular janitors,

6
0:00:31.922,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but I never have the decency to honor their names.

7
0:00:36.094,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Lockers left open like teenage boys' mouths

8
0:00:39.262,000 --> 0:00:41,000
when teenage girls wear clothes that covers

9
0:00:41.813,000 --> 0:00:45,000
their insecurities but exposes everything else.

10
0:00:46.652,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Masculinity mimicked by men who grew up with no fathers,

11
0:00:50.47,000 --> 0:00:53,000
camouflage worn by bullies who are dangerously armed

12
0:00:54.312,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but need hugs.

13
0:00:55.671,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Teachers paid less than what it costs them to be here.

14
0:00:58.939,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Oceans of adolescents come here to receive lessons

15
0:01:02.605,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but never learn to swim,

16
0:01:04.874,000 --> 0:01:06,000
part like the Red Sea when the bell rings.

17
0:01:07.016,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is a training ground.

18
0:01:09.794,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My high school is Chicago,

19
0:01:12.101,000 --> 0:01:15,000
diverse and segregated on purpose.

20
0:01:15.362,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Social lines are barbed wire.

21
0:01:18.875,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Labels like "Regulars" and "Honors" resonate.

22
0:01:24.131,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I am an Honors but go home with Regular students

23
0:01:28.515,000 --> 0:01:31,000
who are soldiers in territory that owns them.

24
0:01:31.883,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This is a training ground to sort out the Regulars

25
0:01:35.537,000 --> 0:01:37,000
from the Honors, a reoccurring cycle

26
0:01:37.795,000 --> 0:01:4,000
built to recycle the trash of this system.

27
0:01:41.581,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Trained at a young age to capitalize,

28
0:01:44.575,000 --> 0:01:47,000
letters taught now that capitalism raises you

29
0:01:47.579,000 --> 0:01:49,000
but you have to step on someone else to get there.

30
0:01:50.428,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is a training ground where one group

31
0:01:53.621,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is taught to lead and the other is made to follow.

32
0:01:56.528,000 --> 0:01:58,000
No wonder so many of my people spit bars,

33
0:01:59.163,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because the truth is hard to swallow.

34
0:02:02.027,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The need for degrees has left so many people frozen.

35
0:02:06.296,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Homework is stressful,

36
0:02:08.436,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but when you go home every day and your home is work,

37
0:02:11.036,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you don't want to pick up any assignments.

38
0:02:13.013,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Reading textbooks is stressful,

39
0:02:14.987,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but reading does not matter when you feel

40
0:02:17.243,000 --> 0:02:19,000
your story is already written,

41
0:02:19.299,000 --> 0:02:21,000
either dead or getting booked.

42
0:02:21.375,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Taking tests is stressful,

43
0:02:24.2,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but bubbling in a Scantron does not stop

44
0:02:26.788,000 --> 0:02:28,000
bullets from bursting.

45
0:02:28.979,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I hear education systems are failing,

46
0:02:33.564,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but I believe they're succeeding at what they're built to do --

47
0:02:36.106,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to train you, to keep you on track,

48
0:02:38.244,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to track down an American dream that has failed

49
0:02:41.55,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so many of us all.

50
0:02:45.508,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Applause)

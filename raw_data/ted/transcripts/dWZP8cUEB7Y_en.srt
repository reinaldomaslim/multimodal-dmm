1
0:00:15.609,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I would like to talk to you about why many ehealth projects fail.

2
0:00:20.157,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I really think that the most important thing of it

3
0:00:22.902,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is that we stopped listening to patients.

4
0:00:25.85,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And one thing we did at Radboud University

5
0:00:27.901,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is we appointed a Chief Listening Officer.

6
0:00:29.936,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Not in a very scientific way --

7
0:00:31.567,000 --> 0:00:34,000
she puts up a little cup of coffee or a cup of tea

8
0:00:34.952,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and asks patients, family, relatives,

9
0:00:37.619,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"What's up?

10
0:00:38.806,000 --> 0:00:39,000
How could we help you?"

11
0:00:40.723,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And we think, we like to think,

12
0:00:42.391,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that this is one of the major problems

13
0:00:44.244,000 --> 0:00:46,000
why all -- maybe not all --

14
0:00:46.396,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but most of the ehealth projects fail,

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
since we stopped listening.

16
0:00:50.466,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This is my weight scale.

17
0:00:52.136,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's a very simple thing. It's got one knob, on/off.

18
0:00:55.317,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And every morning I hop on it.

19
0:00:58.108,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And yes, I've got a challenge,

20
0:01:00.059,000 --> 0:01:01,000
as you might see.

21
0:01:01.889,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.

22
0:01:04.899,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But the thing is that it's made this simple

23
0:01:07.496,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that whenever I hop on,

24
0:01:09.111,000 --> 0:01:11,000
it sends my data to Google Health as well.

25
0:01:12.551,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And it's collected by my general practitioner as well,

26
0:01:15.837,000 --> 0:01:18,000
so he can see what's my problem in weight,

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
not on the very moment that I need cardiologic support

28
0:01:22.961,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or something like it,

29
0:01:24.176,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but also looking backward.

30
0:01:26.834,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But there's another thing.

31
0:01:28.218,000 --> 0:01:29,000
As some of you might know,

32
0:01:29.721,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I've got more than 4000 followers on Twitter.

33
0:01:32.071,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So every morning, I hop on my weight scale

34
0:01:35.713,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and before I'm in my car,

35
0:01:37.001,000 --> 0:01:38,000
people start talking to me,

36
0:01:38.334,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien."

37
0:01:40.656,000 --> 0:01:41,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:41.831,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But that's the nicest thing that could happen,

39
0:01:43.998,000 --> 0:01:44,000
since this is peer pressure.

40
0:01:45.577,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Peer pressure used to help patients --

41
0:01:49.261,000 --> 0:01:5,000
since this could be used for obesity,

42
0:01:51.127,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it could be used to stop patients from smoking.

43
0:01:54.744,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But on the other hand,

44
0:01:56.007,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it also could be used to get people out of their chairs

45
0:01:59.564,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity

46
0:02:03.214,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to get more control of their health.

47
0:02:05.486,000 --> 0:02:07,000
As of next week, it will soon be available,

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
there will be this little blood-pressure meter

49
0:02:10.598,000 --> 0:02:12,000
connected to an iPhone or something or other.

50
0:02:13.84,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And people will be able, from their homes,

51
0:02:16.612,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to take their blood pressure,

52
0:02:18.192,000 --> 0:02:19,000
send it to their doctor

53
0:02:19.905,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and eventually share it with others, for instance,

54
0:02:22.615,000 --> 0:02:23,000
for over a 100 dollars.

55
0:02:24.546,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And this is the point where patients get into position

56
0:02:27.539,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and can collect, not only their own control again,

57
0:02:30.523,000 --> 0:02:31,000
be captain of their own ship,

58
0:02:32.468,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but also can help us in health care

59
0:02:34.809,000 --> 0:02:35,000
due to the challenges that we face,

60
0:02:36.811,000 --> 0:02:38,000
like health-care cost explosion,

61
0:02:39.673,000 --> 0:02:4,000
doubled demand and things like that,

62
0:02:41.544,000 --> 0:02:43,000
make techniques that are easy to use

63
0:02:43.75,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and start with this to embrace patients in the team.

64
0:02:47.118,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And you can do this with techniques like this,

65
0:02:49.403,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but also by crowdsourcing.

66
0:02:51.372,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And one of the things we did,

67
0:02:52.999,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.

68
0:02:56.35,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Music)

69
0:04:04.095,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Heart-beat)

70
0:04:08.341,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We've all got navigation controls in our car.

71
0:04:11.001,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We maybe even have it in our cellphone.

72
0:04:13.663,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We perfectly know where all the ATMs are,

73
0:04:16.056,000 --> 0:04:17,000
just about the city of Maastricht.

74
0:04:17.989,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.

75
0:04:21.049,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And sure, we could find fast food chains.

76
0:04:24.129,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But where would be the nearest AED to help this patient?

77
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We asked around, and nobody knew.

78
0:04:30.931,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Nobody knew where the nearest lifesaving AED

79
0:04:33.866,000 --> 0:04:34,000
was to be obtained right now.

80
0:04:35.946,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So what we did, we crowdsourced the Netherlands.

81
0:04:38.402,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We set up a website, and asked the crowd,

82
0:04:41.106,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"If you see an AED, please submit it,

83
0:04:43.442,000 --> 0:04:45,000
tell us where it is, tell us when it's open,"

84
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
since sometimes in office hours it's closed, of course.

85
0:04:49.246,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And over 10,000 AEDs in the Netherlands

86
0:04:51.446,000 --> 0:04:52,000
already have been submitted.

87
0:04:52.908,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The next step we took was to find the applications for it.

88
0:04:55.829,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And we built an iPad application.

89
0:04:57.905,000 --> 0:05:,000
We made an application for Layar: Augmented Reality,

90
0:05:00.954,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to find these AEDs.

91
0:05:02.722,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht,

92
0:05:05.029,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and somebody collapses, you can use your iPhone,

93
0:05:07.653,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and within the next weeks also your Microsoft cellphone,

94
0:05:11.223,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to find the nearest AED,

95
0:05:12.662,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which can save lives.

96
0:05:14.692,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And as of today,

97
0:05:16.02,000 --> 0:05:18,000
we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU,

98
0:05:18.738,000 --> 0:05:19,000
which is what the product is called,

99
0:05:20.477,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but also AED4US.

100
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level.

101
0:05:24.804,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And ask all of our colleagues in the rest of the world,

102
0:05:27.771,000 --> 0:05:29,000
colleague universities, to help us

103
0:05:29.842,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to find and work and act like a hub

104
0:05:32.49,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to crowdsource all these AEDs all around the world,

105
0:05:35.844,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses,

106
0:05:38.833,000 --> 0:05:41,000
might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you,

107
0:05:42.338,000 --> 0:05:43,000
you can find this.

108
0:05:43.935,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The other thing we would like to ask

109
0:05:45.674,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is of companies also all over the world

110
0:05:47.773,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that will be able to help us validate these AEDs.

111
0:05:50.83,000 --> 0:05:51,000
These might be courier services

112
0:05:52.672,000 --> 0:05:53,000
or cable guys, for instance,

113
0:05:54.387,000 --> 0:05:56,000
just to see whether the AED that is submitted

114
0:05:56.773,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is still in place.

115
0:05:58.363,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So please help us on this one

116
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and try to make not only health a little bit better,

117
0:06:03.236,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but take control of it.

118
0:06:04.428,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Thank you.

119
0:06:05.618,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.872,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'd like to start, if I may,

2
0:00:14.416,000 --> 0:00:16,000
with the story of the Paisley snail.

3
0:00:17.14,000 --> 0:00:2,000
On the evening of the 26th of August, 1928,

4
0:00:20.355,000 --> 0:00:22,000
May Donoghue took a train from Glasgow

5
0:00:22.729,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to the town of Paisley, seven miles east of the city,

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and there at the Wellmeadow Café,

7
0:00:27.573,000 --> 0:00:3,000
she had a Scots ice cream float,

8
0:00:30.699,000 --> 0:00:31,000
a mix of ice cream and ginger beer

9
0:00:32.546,000 --> 0:00:33,000
bought for her by a friend.

10
0:00:34.501,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The ginger beer came in a brown, opaque bottle

11
0:00:36.902,000 --> 0:00:39,000
labeled "D. Stevenson, Glen Lane, Paisley."

12
0:00:40.765,000 --> 0:00:42,000
She drank some of the ice cream float,

13
0:00:42.841,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but as the remaining ginger beer was poured

14
0:00:44.675,000 --> 0:00:45,000
into her tumbler,

15
0:00:46.071,000 --> 0:00:48,000
a decomposed snail

16
0:00:48.524,000 --> 0:00:5,000
floated to the surface of her glass.

17
0:00:51.106,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Three days later, she was admitted

18
0:00:52.65,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to the Glasgow Royal Infirmary

19
0:00:54.156,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and diagnosed with severe gastroenteritis

20
0:00:56.214,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and shock.

21
0:00:58.167,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The case of Donoghue vs. Stevenson that followed

22
0:01:01.435,000 --> 0:01:03,000
set a very important legal precedent:

23
0:01:04.08,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Stevenson, the manufacturer of the ginger beer,

24
0:01:05.811,000 --> 0:01:07,000
was held to have a clear duty of care

25
0:01:08.588,000 --> 0:01:09,000
towards May Donoghue,

26
0:01:10.036,000 --> 0:01:12,000
even though there was no contract between them,

27
0:01:12.138,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and, indeed, she hadn't even bought the drink.

28
0:01:14.955,000 --> 0:01:17,000
One of the judges, Lord Atkin, described it like this:

29
0:01:17.974,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You must take care to avoid acts or omissions

30
0:01:20.884,000 --> 0:01:22,000
which you can reasonably foresee

31
0:01:22.952,000 --> 0:01:25,000
would be likely to injure your neighbor.

32
0:01:26.18,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Indeed, one wonders that without a duty of care,

33
0:01:28.523,000 --> 0:01:29,000
how many people would have had to suffer

34
0:01:30.269,000 --> 0:01:33,000
from gastroenteritis before Stevenson eventually went out of business.

35
0:01:33.993,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now please hang on to that Paisley snail story,

36
0:01:36.374,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because it's an important principle.

37
0:01:39.607,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Last year, the Hansard Society, a nonpartisan charity

38
0:01:42.101,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which seeks to strengthen parliamentary democracy

39
0:01:44.007,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and encourage greater public involvement in politics

40
0:01:47.244,000 --> 0:01:49,000
published, alongside their annual audit

41
0:01:49.831,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of political engagement, an additional section

42
0:01:52.704,000 --> 0:01:55,000
devoted entirely to politics and the media.

43
0:01:55.827,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Here are a couple of rather depressing observations

44
0:01:58.202,000 --> 0:02:,000
from that survey.

45
0:02:00.21,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Tabloid newspapers do not appear

46
0:02:02.375,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to advance the political citizenship of their readers,

47
0:02:05.208,000 --> 0:02:06,000
relative even to those

48
0:02:06.781,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who read no newspapers whatsoever.

49
0:02:10.007,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Tabloid-only readers are twice as likely to agree

50
0:02:12.999,000 --> 0:02:13,000
with a negative view of politics

51
0:02:14.85,000 --> 0:02:16,000
than readers of no newspapers.

52
0:02:17.425,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They're not just less politically engaged.

53
0:02:19.418,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They are consuming media that reinforces

54
0:02:21.866,000 --> 0:02:22,000
their negative evaluation of politics,

55
0:02:23.828,000 --> 0:02:26,000
thereby contributing to a fatalistic and cynical

56
0:02:26.931,000 --> 0:02:29,000
attitude to democracy and their own role within it.

57
0:02:30.266,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Little wonder that the report concluded that

58
0:02:32.426,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in this respect, the press, particularly the tabloids,

59
0:02:35.616,000 --> 0:02:37,000
appear not to be living up to the importance

60
0:02:37.955,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of their role in our democracy.

61
0:02:40.591,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now I doubt if anyone in this room would seriously

62
0:02:42.65,000 --> 0:02:43,000
challenge that view.

63
0:02:44.097,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But if Hansard are right, and they usually are,

64
0:02:46.713,000 --> 0:02:47,000
then we've got a very serious problem on our hands,

65
0:02:48.689,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and it's one that I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes

66
0:02:51.324,000 --> 0:02:53,000
focusing upon.

67
0:02:53.353,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Since the Paisley snail,

68
0:02:55.036,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and especially over the past decade or so,

69
0:02:57.5,000 --> 0:02:58,000
a great deal of thinking has been developed

70
0:02:59.419,000 --> 0:03:,000
around the notion of a duty of care

71
0:03:01.278,000 --> 0:03:03,000
as it relates to a number of aspects of civil society.

72
0:03:03.817,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Generally a duty of care arises when one individual

73
0:03:06.561,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or a group of individuals undertakes an activity

74
0:03:09.295,000 --> 0:03:11,000
which has the potential to cause harm to another,

75
0:03:11.825,000 --> 0:03:13,000
either physically, mentally or economically.

76
0:03:14.539,000 --> 0:03:16,000
This is principally focused on obvious areas,

77
0:03:17.01,000 --> 0:03:2,000
such as our empathetic response to children and young people,

78
0:03:20.052,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to our service personnel, and to the elderly and infirm.

79
0:03:22.778,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It is seldom, if ever, extended to equally important arguments

80
0:03:26.971,000 --> 0:03:3,000
around the fragility of our present system of government,

81
0:03:31.221,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to the notion that honesty, accuracy and impartiality

82
0:03:34.73,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are fundamental to the process of building

83
0:03:36.874,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and embedding an informed,

84
0:03:38.603,000 --> 0:03:4,000
participatory democracy.

85
0:03:41.36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And the more you think about it,

86
0:03:42.781,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the stranger that is.

87
0:03:44.612,000 --> 0:03:45,000
A couple of years ago, I had the pleasure

88
0:03:46.074,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of opening a brand new school

89
0:03:47.828,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in the northeast of England.

90
0:03:49.399,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It had been renamed by its pupils as Academy 360.

91
0:03:52.938,000 --> 0:03:53,000
As I walked through their impressive,

92
0:03:54.79,000 --> 0:03:55,000
glass-covered atrium,

93
0:03:56.165,000 --> 0:03:57,000
in front of me, emblazoned on the wall

94
0:03:57.983,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in letters of fire

95
0:03:59.531,000 --> 0:04:02,000
was Marcus Aurelius's famous injunction:

96
0:04:02.632,000 --> 0:04:04,000
If it's not true, don't say it;

97
0:04:05.487,000 --> 0:04:08,000
if it's not right, don't do it.

98
0:04:08.57,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The head teacher saw me staring at it,

99
0:04:10.558,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and he said, "Oh, that's our school motto."

100
0:04:13.35,000 --> 0:04:14,000
On the train back to London,

101
0:04:15.077,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

102
0:04:16.931,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I kept thinking, can it really have taken us

103
0:04:19.49,000 --> 0:04:21,000
over 2,000 years to come to terms

104
0:04:21.701,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with that simple notion

105
0:04:23.566,000 --> 0:04:25,000
as being our minimum expectation of each other?

106
0:04:26.518,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Isn't it time that we develop this concept

107
0:04:29.126,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of a duty of care

108
0:04:30.795,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and extended it to include a care

109
0:04:33.221,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for our shared but increasingly endangered democratic values?

110
0:04:36.485,000 --> 0:04:37,000
After all, the absence of a duty of care

111
0:04:38.342,000 --> 0:04:39,000
within many professions

112
0:04:39.932,000 --> 0:04:41,000
can all too easily amount to accusations of negligence,

113
0:04:42.435,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and that being the case, can we be really comfortable with the thought

114
0:04:45.542,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that we're in effect being negligent

115
0:04:47.843,000 --> 0:04:49,000
in respect of the health of our own societies

116
0:04:50.634,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and the values that necessarily underpin them?

117
0:04:53.369,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Could anyone honestly suggest, on the evidence,

118
0:04:56.364,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that the same media which Hansard so roundly condemned

119
0:04:59.62,000 --> 0:05:02,000
have taken sufficient care to avoid behaving

120
0:05:02.907,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in ways which they could reasonably have foreseen

121
0:05:06.349,000 --> 0:05:08,000
would be likely to undermine or even damage

122
0:05:08.45,000 --> 0:05:1,000
our inherently fragile democratic settlement.

123
0:05:11.284,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now there will be those who will argue

124
0:05:13.305,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that this could all too easily drift into a form

125
0:05:15.078,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of censorship, albeit self-censorship,

126
0:05:17.085,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but I don't buy that argument.

127
0:05:19.041,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It has to be possible

128
0:05:21.1,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to balance freedom of expression

129
0:05:23.2,000 --> 0:05:26,000
with wider moral and social responsibilities.

130
0:05:26.407,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Let me explain why by taking the example

131
0:05:28.258,000 --> 0:05:3,000
from my own career as a filmmaker.

132
0:05:31.161,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Throughout that career, I never accepted

133
0:05:32.968,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that a filmmaker should set about putting

134
0:05:34.595,000 --> 0:05:37,000
their own work outside or above what he or she

135
0:05:37.645,000 --> 0:05:38,000
believed to be a decent set of values

136
0:05:39.595,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for their own life, their own family,

137
0:05:42.944,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and the future of the society in which we all live.

138
0:05:46.535,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I'd go further.

139
0:05:47.859,000 --> 0:05:5,000
A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work

140
0:05:51.153,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to a point at which it becomes less than true

141
0:05:53.197,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to the world they themselves wish to inhabit.

142
0:05:56.637,000 --> 0:05:59,000
As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers

143
0:06:00.023,000 --> 0:06:02,000
are all required to face up to the social expectations

144
0:06:02.547,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium

145
0:06:06.302,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with their well-honed professional skills.

146
0:06:09.676,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Obviously this is not a mandated duty,

147
0:06:12.563,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist

148
0:06:15.045,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or even blogger, it strikes me as being utterly inescapable.

149
0:06:18.865,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We should always remember that our notion

150
0:06:21.464,000 --> 0:06:23,000
of individual freedom and its partner, creative freedom,

151
0:06:24.355,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is comparatively new

152
0:06:26.15,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in the history of Western ideas,

153
0:06:28.412,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and for that reason, it's often undervalued

154
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and can be very quickly undermined.

155
0:06:32.693,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's a prize easily lost,

156
0:06:34.92,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and once lost, once surrendered,

157
0:06:36.683,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it can prove very, very hard to reclaim.

158
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And its first line of defense

159
0:06:41.525,000 --> 0:06:43,000
has to be our own standards,

160
0:06:43.876,000 --> 0:06:46,000
not those enforced on us by a censor or legislation,

161
0:06:47.615,000 --> 0:06:48,000
our own standards and our own integrity.

162
0:06:49.438,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Our integrity as we deal with those

163
0:06:51.432,000 --> 0:06:52,000
with whom we work

164
0:06:52.98,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and our own standards as we operate within society.

165
0:06:56.605,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And these standards of ours

166
0:06:58.075,000 --> 0:07:01,000
need to be all of a piece with a sustainable social agenda.

167
0:07:01.34,000 --> 0:07:03,000
They're part of a collective responsibility,

168
0:07:03.453,000 --> 0:07:05,000
the responsibility of the artist or the journalist

169
0:07:05.583,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to deal with the world as it really is,

170
0:07:07.957,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and this, in turn, must go hand in hand

171
0:07:10.406,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with the responsibility of those governing society

172
0:07:12.824,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to also face up to that world,

173
0:07:14.901,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and not to be tempted to misappropriate

174
0:07:17.276,000 --> 0:07:19,000
the causes of its ills.

175
0:07:19.853,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Yet, as has become strikingly clear

176
0:07:22.499,000 --> 0:07:24,000
over the last couple of years,

177
0:07:24.567,000 --> 0:07:26,000
such responsibility has to a very great extent

178
0:07:26.601,000 --> 0:07:29,000
been abrogated by large sections of the media.

179
0:07:29.644,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And as a consequence, across the Western world,

180
0:07:31.584,000 --> 0:07:34,000
the over-simplistic policies of the parties of protest

181
0:07:34.883,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and their appeal to a largely disillusioned,

182
0:07:37.268,000 --> 0:07:38,000
older demographic,

183
0:07:38.657,000 --> 0:07:4,000
along with the apathy and obsession with the trivial

184
0:07:40.865,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that typifies at least some of the young,

185
0:07:42.763,000 --> 0:07:44,000
taken together, these and other similarly

186
0:07:44.821,000 --> 0:07:46,000
contemporary aberrations

187
0:07:46.902,000 --> 0:07:48,000
are threatening to squeeze the life

188
0:07:48.949,000 --> 0:07:51,000
out of active, informed debate and engagement,

189
0:07:52.523,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and I stress active.

190
0:07:55.05,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The most ardent of libertarians might argue

191
0:07:57.327,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that Donoghue v. Stevenson should have been thrown out of court

192
0:08:00.321,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and that Stevenson would eventually have gone out of business

193
0:08:02.439,000 --> 0:08:05,000
if he'd continued to sell ginger beer with snails in it.

194
0:08:05.856,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But most of us, I think, accept some small role

195
0:08:09.27,000 --> 0:08:12,000
for the state to enforce a duty of care,

196
0:08:12.348,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and the key word here is reasonable.

197
0:08:15.02,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Judges must ask, did they take reasonable care

198
0:08:18.6,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and could they have reasonably foreseen

199
0:08:20.015,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the consequences of their actions?

200
0:08:22.213,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Far from signifying overbearing state power,

201
0:08:25.195,000 --> 0:08:28,000
it's that small common sense test of reasonableness

202
0:08:28.72,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that I'd like us to apply to those in the media

203
0:08:31.379,000 --> 0:08:33,000
who, after all, set the tone and the content

204
0:08:33.65,000 --> 0:08:36,000
for much of our democratic discourse.

205
0:08:36.967,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Democracy, in order to work, requires that

206
0:08:39.687,000 --> 0:08:41,000
reasonable men and women take the time to understand and debate

207
0:08:42.635,000 --> 0:08:44,000
difficult, sometimes complex issues,

208
0:08:44.967,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and they do so in an atmosphere which strives

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
for the type of understanding that leads to,

210
0:08:49.659,000 --> 0:08:51,000
if not agreement, then at least a productive

211
0:08:51.726,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and workable compromise.

212
0:08:54.093,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Politics is about choices,

213
0:08:56.45,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and within those choices, politics is about priorities.

214
0:09:00.441,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's about reconciling conflicting preferences

215
0:09:02.979,000 --> 0:09:07,000
wherever and whenever possibly based on fact.

216
0:09:08.195,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But if the facts themselves are distorted,

217
0:09:10.666,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the resolutions are likely only to create further conflict,

218
0:09:14.389,000 --> 0:09:15,000
with all the stresses and strains on society

219
0:09:16.276,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that inevitably follow.

220
0:09:18.492,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The media have to decide:

221
0:09:20.439,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Do they see their role as being to inflame

222
0:09:23.613,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or to inform?

223
0:09:25.943,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Because in the end, it comes down to a combination

224
0:09:28.805,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of trust and leadership.

225
0:09:31.296,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Fifty years ago this week, President John F. Kennedy

226
0:09:33.873,000 --> 0:09:34,000
made two epoch-making speeches,

227
0:09:35.479,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the first on disarmament and the second on civil rights.

228
0:09:38.976,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The first led almost immediately

229
0:09:41.078,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty,

230
0:09:42.659,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and the second led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act,

231
0:09:45.724,000 --> 0:09:48,000
both of which represented giant leaps forward.

232
0:09:49.31,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Democracy, well-led and well-informed,

233
0:09:51.715,000 --> 0:09:53,000
can achieve very great things,

234
0:09:54.208,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but there's a precondition.

235
0:09:55.881,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We have to trust that those making those decisions

236
0:09:59.192,000 --> 0:10:01,000
are acting in the best interest not of themselves

237
0:10:01.659,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but of the whole of the people.

238
0:10:03.423,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We need factually-based options,

239
0:10:06.502,000 --> 0:10:07,000
clearly laid out,

240
0:10:07.741,000 --> 0:10:08,000
not those of a few powerful

241
0:10:09.139,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and potentially manipulative corporations

242
0:10:11.236,000 --> 0:10:13,000
pursuing their own frequently narrow agendas,

243
0:10:13.603,000 --> 0:10:15,000
but accurate, unprejudiced information

244
0:10:16.032,000 --> 0:10:18,000
with which to make our own judgments.

245
0:10:18.408,000 --> 0:10:19,000
If we want to provide decent, fulfilling lives

246
0:10:20.302,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for our children and our children's children,

247
0:10:22.613,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we need to exercise to the very greatest degree possible

248
0:10:25.73,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that duty of care for a vibrant,

249
0:10:27.442,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and hopefully a lasting, democracy.

250
0:10:30.339,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Thank you very much for listening to me.

251
0:10:32.422,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Applause)

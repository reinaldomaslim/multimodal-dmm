1
0:00:13.6,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I am British.

2
0:00:15.56,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:17.72,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Applause)

4
0:00:20.88,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Never before has the phrase "I am British" elicited so much pity.

5
0:00:24.68,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:26.8,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I come from an island where many of us like to believe

7
0:00:29.56,000 --> 0:00:32,000
there's been a lot of continuity over the last thousand years.

8
0:00:33.4,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We tend to have historically imposed change on others

9
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but done much less of it ourselves.

10
0:00:39.36,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So it came as an immense shock to me

11
0:00:41.84,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when I woke up on the morning of June 24

12
0:00:44.64,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to discover that my country had voted to leave the European Union,

13
0:00:48.52,000 --> 0:00:49,000
my Prime Minister had resigned,

14
0:00:50.4,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and Scotland was considering a referendum

15
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that could bring to an end the very existence of the United Kingdom.

16
0:00:58.92,000 --> 0:01:,000
So that was an immense shock for me,

17
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and it was an immense shock for many people,

18
0:01:05.08,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but it was also something that, over the following several days,

19
0:01:08.56,000 --> 0:01:1,000
created a complete political meltdown

20
0:01:11.32,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in my country.

21
0:01:12.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
There were calls for a second referendum,

22
0:01:15.04,000 --> 0:01:17,000
almost as if, following a sports match,

23
0:01:17.6,000 --> 0:01:19,000
we could ask the opposition for a replay.

24
0:01:20.88,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Everybody was blaming everybody else.

25
0:01:23.36,000 --> 0:01:24,000
People blamed the Prime Minister

26
0:01:24.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
for calling the referendum in the first place.

27
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They blamed the leader of the opposition for not fighting it hard enough.

28
0:01:30.64,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The young accused the old.

29
0:01:31.92,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The educated blamed the less well-educated.

30
0:01:35.44,000 --> 0:01:38,000
That complete meltdown was made even worse

31
0:01:38.56,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by the most tragic element of it:

32
0:01:40.68,000 --> 0:01:43,000
levels of xenophobia and racist abuse in the streets of Britain

33
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:46,000
at a level that I have never seen before

34
0:01:46.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in my lifetime.

35
0:01:49.8,000 --> 0:01:53,000
People are now talking about whether my country is becoming a Little England,

36
0:01:54.2,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or, as one of my colleagues put it,

37
0:01:56.32,000 --> 0:02:,000
whether we're about to become a 1950s nostalgia theme park

38
0:02:00.52,000 --> 0:02:02,000
floating in the Atlantic Ocean.

39
0:02:02.56,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:05.84,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But my question is really,

41
0:02:08.4,000 --> 0:02:12,000
should we have the degree of shock that we've experienced since?

42
0:02:13.44,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Was it something that took place overnight?

43
0:02:15.84,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Or are there deeper structural factors that have led us to where we are today?

44
0:02:20.36,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So I want to take a step back and ask two very basic questions.

45
0:02:24.96,000 --> 0:02:26,000
First, what does Brexit represent,

46
0:02:27.88,000 --> 0:02:28,000
not just for my country,

47
0:02:29.44,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but for all of us around the world?

48
0:02:32.2,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And second, what can we do about it?

49
0:02:35.4,000 --> 0:02:37,000
How should we all respond?

50
0:02:37.76,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So first, what does Brexit represent?

51
0:02:40.96,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

52
0:02:43.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Brexit teaches us many things about our society

53
0:02:47.92,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and about societies around the world.

54
0:02:51.4,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It highlights in ways that we seem embarrassingly unaware of

55
0:02:54.64,000 --> 0:02:55,000
how divided our societies are.

56
0:02:56.84,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The vote split along lines of age, education, class and geography.

57
0:03:03.2,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Young people didn't turn out to vote in great numbers,

58
0:03:06.12,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but those that did wanted to remain.

59
0:03:08.36,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Older people really wanted to leave the European Union.

60
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Geographically, it was London and Scotland that most strongly committed

61
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to being part of the European Union,

62
0:03:17.68,000 --> 0:03:21,000
while in other parts of the country there was very strong ambivalence.

63
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously.

64
0:03:27.4,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But more profoundly, the vote teaches us something

65
0:03:30.28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
about the nature of politics today.

66
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Contemporary politics is no longer just about right and left.

67
0:03:36.92,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's no longer just about tax and spend.

68
0:03:39.68,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's about globalization.

69
0:03:41.64,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The fault line of contemporary politics is between those that embrace globalization

70
0:03:46.48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and those that fear globalization.

71
0:03:50.32,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Applause)

72
0:03:55.68,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If we look at why those who wanted to leave --

73
0:03:58.36,000 --> 0:04:,000
we call them "Leavers," as opposed to "Remainers" --

74
0:04:00.92,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we see two factors in the opinion polls

75
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that really mattered.

76
0:04:04.56,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The first was immigration, and the second sovereignty,

77
0:04:07.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and these represent a desire for people to take back control of their own lives

78
0:04:13.4,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and the feeling that they are unrepresented by politicians.

79
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But those ideas are ones that signify fear and alienation.

80
0:04:23.96,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They represent a retreat back towards nationalism and borders

81
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in ways that many of us would reject.

82
0:04:31.6,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What I want to suggest is the picture is more complicated than that,

83
0:04:34.84,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that liberal internationalists,

84
0:04:36.4,000 --> 0:04:39,000
like myself, and I firmly include myself in that picture,

85
0:04:39.64,000 --> 0:04:41,000
need to write ourselves back into the picture

86
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:46,000
in order to understand how we've got to where we are today.

87
0:04:47.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
When we look at the voting patterns across the United Kingdom,

88
0:04:50.32,000 --> 0:04:52,000
we can visibly see the divisions.

89
0:04:53.24,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The blue areas show Remain

90
0:04:55.6,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the red areas Leave.

91
0:04:57.72,000 --> 0:04:58,000
When I looked at this,

92
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
what personally struck me was the very little time in my life

93
0:05:02.88,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I've actually spent in many of the red areas.

94
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I suddenly realized that, looking at the top 50 areas in the UK

95
0:05:11.28,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that have the strongest Leave vote,

96
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I've spent a combined total of four days of my life in those areas.

97
0:05:19.56,000 --> 0:05:2,000
In some of those places,

98
0:05:21.08,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I didn't even know the names of the voting districts.

99
0:05:24.68,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It was a real shock to me,

100
0:05:26.56,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and it suggested that people like me

101
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who think of ourselves as inclusive, open and tolerant,

102
0:05:32.76,000 --> 0:05:34,000
perhaps don't know our own countries and societies

103
0:05:35.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
nearly as well as we like to believe.

104
0:05:38.12,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Applause)

105
0:05:48.2,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And the challenge that comes from that is we need to find a new way

106
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to narrate globalization to those people,

107
0:05:55.12,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to recognize that for those people who have not necessarily been to university,

108
0:05:59.52,000 --> 0:06:01,000
who haven't necessarily grown up with the Internet,

109
0:06:01.96,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that don't get opportunities to travel,

110
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they may be unpersuaded by the narrative that we find persuasive

111
0:06:07.88,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in our often liberal bubbles.

112
0:06:10.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Applause)

113
0:06:15.88,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It means that we need to reach out more broadly and understand.

114
0:06:19.52,000 --> 0:06:25,000
In the Leave vote, a minority have peddled the politics of fear and hatred,

115
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:27,000
creating lies and mistrust

116
0:06:28.08,000 --> 0:06:3,000
around, for instance, the idea that the vote on Europe

117
0:06:31.04,000 --> 0:06:35,000
could reduce the number of refugees and asylum-seekers coming to Europe,

118
0:06:35.2,000 --> 0:06:38,000
when the vote on leaving had nothing to do with immigration

119
0:06:38.48,000 --> 0:06:39,000
from outside the European Union.

120
0:06:41.12,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But for a significant majority of the Leave voters

121
0:06:44.68,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the concern was disillusionment with the political establishment.

122
0:06:48.36,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This was a protest vote for many,

123
0:06:50.56,000 --> 0:06:52,000
a sense that nobody represented them,

124
0:06:53.04,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that they couldn't find a political party that spoke for them,

125
0:06:56.48,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and so they rejected that political establishment.

126
0:07:01.44,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This replicates around Europe and much of the liberal democratic world.

127
0:07:06.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We see it with the rise in popularity of Donald Trump in the United States,

128
0:07:11.44,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with the growing nationalism of Viktor Orbán in Hungary,

129
0:07:15.52,000 --> 0:07:19,000
with the increase in popularity of Marine Le Pen in France.

130
0:07:20.24,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The specter of Brexit is in all of our societies.

131
0:07:25.08,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So the question I think we need to ask is my second question,

132
0:07:28.12,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which is how should we collectively respond?

133
0:07:31.28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
For all of us who care about creating liberal, open, tolerant societies,

134
0:07:37.28,000 --> 0:07:39,000
we urgently need a new vision,

135
0:07:39.96,000 --> 0:07:42,000
a vision of a more tolerant, inclusive globalization,

136
0:07:43.68,000 --> 0:07:46,000
one that brings people with us rather than leaving them behind.

137
0:07:48.64,000 --> 0:07:49,000
That vision of globalization

138
0:07:50.6,000 --> 0:07:54,000
is one that has to start by a recognition of the positive benefits of globalization.

139
0:07:55.44,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The consensus amongst economists

140
0:07:58.04,000 --> 0:08:,000
is that free trade, the movement of capital,

141
0:08:00.84,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the movement of people across borders

142
0:08:02.8,000 --> 0:08:04,000
benefit everyone on aggregate.

143
0:08:05.56,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The consensus amongst international relations scholars

144
0:08:08.28,000 --> 0:08:1,000
is that globalization brings interdependence,

145
0:08:10.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
which brings cooperation and peace.

146
0:08:13.88,000 --> 0:08:17,000
But globalization also has redistributive effects.

147
0:08:18.36,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It creates winners and losers.

148
0:08:21.12,000 --> 0:08:23,000
To take the example of migration,

149
0:08:23.28,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we know that immigration is a net positive for the economy as a whole

150
0:08:26.96,000 --> 0:08:28,000
under almost all circumstances.

151
0:08:30.36,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But we also have to be very aware

152
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that there are redistributive consequences,

153
0:08:36.24,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that importantly, low-skilled immigration

154
0:08:39.72,000 --> 0:08:43,000
can lead to a reduction in wages for the most impoverished in our societies

155
0:08:44.159,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and also put pressure on house prices.

156
0:08:46.32,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That doesn't detract from the fact that it's positive,

157
0:08:48.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but it means more people have to share in those benefits

158
0:08:51.799,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and recognize them.

159
0:08:55.2,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In 2002, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan,

160
0:09:00.12,000 --> 0:09:02,000
gave a speech at Yale University,

161
0:09:03.04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and that speech was on the topic of inclusive globalization.

162
0:09:07.04,000 --> 0:09:1,000
That was the speech in which he coined that term.

163
0:09:10.12,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And he said, and I paraphrase,

164
0:09:12.92,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"The glass house of globalization has to be open to all

165
0:09:18.28,000 --> 0:09:2,000
if it is to remain secure.

166
0:09:21.28,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Bigotry and ignorance

167
0:09:24.56,000 --> 0:09:3,000
are the ugly face of exclusionary and antagonistic globalization."

168
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
That idea of inclusive globalization was briefly revived in 2008

169
0:09:36.36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in a conference on progressive governance

170
0:09:38.96,000 --> 0:09:41,000
involving many of the leaders of European countries.

171
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But amid austerity and the financial crisis of 2008,

172
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the concept disappeared almost without a trace.

173
0:09:50.28,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Globalization has been taken to support a neoliberal agenda.

174
0:09:54.76,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It's perceived to be part of an elite agenda

175
0:09:57.72,000 --> 0:09:59,000
rather than something that benefits all.

176
0:10:00.32,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And it needs to be reclaimed on a far more inclusive basis

177
0:10:03.96,000 --> 0:10:04,000
than it is today.

178
0:10:05.72,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So the question is, how can we achieve that goal?

179
0:10:09.48,000 --> 0:10:13,000
How can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation

180
0:10:14.24,000 --> 0:10:17,000
while on the other hand refusing vehemently

181
0:10:17.68,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to give in to xenophobia and nationalism?

182
0:10:21.48,000 --> 0:10:23,000
That is the question for all of us.

183
0:10:23.64,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And I think, as a social scientist,

184
0:10:25.48,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that social science offers some places to start.

185
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Our transformation has to be about both ideas and about material change,

186
0:10:34.24,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and I want to give you four ideas as a starting point.

187
0:10:37.88,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The first relates to the idea of civic education.

188
0:10:42.44,000 --> 0:10:43,000
What stands out from Brexit

189
0:10:44.24,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is the gap between public perception and empirical reality.

190
0:10:48.32,000 --> 0:10:51,000
It's been suggested that we've moved to a postfactual society,

191
0:10:52.04,000 --> 0:10:54,000
where evidence and truth no longer matter,

192
0:10:54.72,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and lies have equal status to the clarity of evidence.

193
0:10:58.84,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So how can we --

194
0:11:00.12,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Applause)

195
0:11:02.84,000 --> 0:11:07,000
How can we rebuild respect for truth and evidence into our liberal democracies?

196
0:11:08.04,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It has to begin with education,

197
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but it has to start with the recognition that there are huge gaps.

198
0:11:14.44,000 --> 0:11:18,000
In 2014, the pollster Ipsos MORI

199
0:11:18.64,000 --> 0:11:21,000
published a survey on attitudes to immigration,

200
0:11:21.96,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and it showed that as numbers of immigrants increase,

201
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
so public concern with immigration also increases,

202
0:11:29.24,000 --> 0:11:31,000
although it obviously didn't unpack causality,

203
0:11:31.68,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because this could equally be to do not so much with numbers

204
0:11:34.84,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but the political and media narrative around it.

205
0:11:37.8,000 --> 0:11:4,000
But the same survey also revealed

206
0:11:41.6,000 --> 0:11:43,000
huge public misinformation

207
0:11:43.76,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and misunderstanding about the nature of immigration.

208
0:11:47.52,000 --> 0:11:5,000
For example, in these attitudes in the United Kingdom,

209
0:11:50.76,000 --> 0:11:52,000
the public believed that levels of asylum

210
0:11:53.52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
were a greater proportion of immigration than they were,

211
0:11:56.96,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but they also believed the levels of educational migration

212
0:12:00.44,000 --> 0:12:03,000
were far lower as a proportion of overall migration

213
0:12:03.56,000 --> 0:12:04,000
than they actually are.

214
0:12:05.08,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So we have to address this misinformation,

215
0:12:07.76,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the gap between perception and reality on key aspects of globalization.

216
0:12:12.28,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And that can't just be something that's left to our schools,

217
0:12:15.12,000 --> 0:12:17,000
although that's important to begin at an early age.

218
0:12:17.56,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It has to be about lifelong civic participation

219
0:12:20.64,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and public engagement that we all encourage as societies.

220
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
The second thing that I think is an opportunity

221
0:12:28.8,000 --> 0:12:32,000
is the idea to encourage more interaction across diverse communities.

222
0:12:33.44,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

223
0:12:37.76,000 --> 0:12:39,000
One of the things that stands out for me very strikingly,

224
0:12:40.76,000 --> 0:12:42,000
looking at immigration attitudes in the United Kingdom,

225
0:12:43.64,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is that ironically, the regions of my country

226
0:12:46.44,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that are the most tolerant of immigrants

227
0:12:48.369,000 --> 0:12:5,000
have the highest numbers of immigrants.

228
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So for instance, London and the Southeast have the highest numbers of immigrants,

229
0:12:55.52,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and they are also by far the most tolerant areas.

230
0:12:58.68,000 --> 0:13:01,000
It's those areas of the country that have the lowest levels of immigration

231
0:13:02.32,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that actually are the most exclusionary and intolerant towards migrants.

232
0:13:07.4,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So we need to encourage exchange programs.

233
0:13:09.76,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We need to ensure that older generations who maybe can't travel

234
0:13:13.24,000 --> 0:13:15,000
get access to the Internet.

235
0:13:15.4,000 --> 0:13:17,000
We need to encourage, even on a local and national level,

236
0:13:18.12,000 --> 0:13:19,000
more movement, more participation,

237
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
more interaction with people who we don't know

238
0:13:22.72,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and whose views we might not necessarily agree with.

239
0:13:26.88,000 --> 0:13:28,000
The third thing that I think is crucial, though,

240
0:13:29.24,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and this is really fundamental,

241
0:13:31.04,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is we have to ensure that everybody shares

242
0:13:33.36,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in the benefits of globalization.

243
0:13:36.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
This illustration from the Financial Times post-Brexit is really striking.

244
0:13:41.28,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It shows tragically that those people who voted to leave the European Union

245
0:13:45.04,000 --> 0:13:47,000
were those who actually benefited the most materially

246
0:13:47.88,000 --> 0:13:49,000
from trade with the European Union.

247
0:13:51.08,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But the problem is that those people in those areas

248
0:13:53.64,000 --> 0:13:55,000
didn't perceive themselves to be beneficiaries.

249
0:13:56.32,000 --> 0:13:58,000
They didn't believe that they were actually getting access

250
0:13:59.12,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to material benefits of increased trade and increased mobility around the world.

251
0:14:05.8,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I work on questions predominantly to do with refugees,

252
0:14:09.6,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and one of the ideas I spent a lot of my time preaching,

253
0:14:12.28,000 --> 0:14:14,000
mainly to developing countries around the world,

254
0:14:15.08,000 --> 0:14:18,000
is that in order to encourage the integration of refugees,

255
0:14:18.68,000 --> 0:14:2,000
we can't just benefit the refugee populations,

256
0:14:21.04,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we also have to address the concerns of the host communities in local areas.

257
0:14:27.48,000 --> 0:14:28,000
But in looking at that,

258
0:14:28.84,000 --> 0:14:31,000
one of the policy prescriptions is that we have to provide

259
0:14:31.88,000 --> 0:14:34,000
disproportionately better education facilities, health facilities,

260
0:14:35.52,000 --> 0:14:36,000
access to social services

261
0:14:37.32,000 --> 0:14:39,000
in those regions of high immigration

262
0:14:39.6,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to address the concerns of those local populations.

263
0:14:42.44,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But while we encourage that around the developing world,

264
0:14:45.12,000 --> 0:14:46,000
we don't take those lessons home

265
0:14:46.72,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and incorporate them in our own societies.

266
0:14:50.52,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Furthermore, if we're going to really take seriously

267
0:14:53.56,000 --> 0:14:56,000
the need to ensure people share in the economic benefits,

268
0:14:56.92,000 --> 0:14:59,000
our businesses and corporations need a model of globalization

269
0:15:00.6,000 --> 0:15:03,000
that recognizes that they, too, have to take people with them.

270
0:15:05.44,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The fourth and final idea I want to put forward

271
0:15:08.52,000 --> 0:15:1,000
is an idea that we need more responsible politics.

272
0:15:12.08,000 --> 0:15:15,000
There's very little social science evidence

273
0:15:15.24,000 --> 0:15:17,000
that compares attitudes on globalization.

274
0:15:18.08,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But from the surveys that do exist,

275
0:15:20.64,000 --> 0:15:24,000
what we can see is there's huge variation across different countries

276
0:15:25.4,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and time periods in those countries

277
0:15:27.72,000 --> 0:15:28,000
for attitudes and tolerance

278
0:15:29.12,000 --> 0:15:32,000
of questions like migration and mobility on the one hand

279
0:15:32.84,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and free trade on the other.

280
0:15:34.92,000 --> 0:15:39,000
But one hypothesis that I think emerges from a cursory look at that data

281
0:15:40.2,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is the idea that polarized societies are far less tolerant of globalization.

282
0:15:46.32,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It's the societies like Sweden in the past,

283
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
like Canada today,

284
0:15:50.6,000 --> 0:15:51,000
where there is a centrist politics,

285
0:15:52.44,000 --> 0:15:54,000
where right and left work together,

286
0:15:54.52,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that we encourage supportive attitudes towards globalization.

287
0:15:58.56,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And what we see around the world today is a tragic polarization,

288
0:16:02.4,000 --> 0:16:05,000
a failure to have dialogue between the extremes in politics,

289
0:16:05.44,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and a gap in terms of that liberal center ground

290
0:16:08.24,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that can encourage communication and a shared understanding.

291
0:16:12.08,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We might not achieve that today,

292
0:16:13.72,000 --> 0:16:16,000
but at the very least we have to call upon our politicians and our media

293
0:16:17.56,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to drop a language of fear and be far more tolerant of one another.

294
0:16:21.36,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Applause)

295
0:16:29.8,000 --> 0:16:31,000
These ideas are very tentative,

296
0:16:32.6,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and that's in part because this needs to be an inclusive and shared project.

297
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I am still British.

298
0:16:40.92,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I am still European.

299
0:16:43.64,000 --> 0:16:46,000
I am still a global citizen.

300
0:16:47.2,000 --> 0:16:49,000
For those of us who believe

301
0:16:49.24,000 --> 0:16:53,000
that our identities are not mutually exclusive,

302
0:16:53.36,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we have to all work together

303
0:16:56.4,000 --> 0:16:59,000
to ensure that globalization takes everyone with us

304
0:17:00.12,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and doesn't leave people behind.

305
0:17:02.36,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Only then will we truly reconcile democracy and globalization.

306
0:17:07.96,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Thank you.

307
0:17:09.2,000 --> 0:17:21,000
(Applause)

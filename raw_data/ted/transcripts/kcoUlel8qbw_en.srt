1
0:00:13.489,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Aja Monet: Our story begins like all great, young love stories.

2
0:00:17.753,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Phillip Agnew: She slid in my DMs ...

3
0:00:19.627,000 --> 0:00:2,000
AM: He liked about 50 of my photos,

4
0:00:21.538,000 --> 0:00:23,000
back-to-back, in the middle of the night --

5
0:00:23.687,000 --> 0:00:27,000
PA: What I saw was an artist committed to truth and justice --

6
0:00:28.196,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and she's beautiful, but I digress.

7
0:00:30.808,000 --> 0:00:32,000
AM: Our story actually begins across many worlds,

8
0:00:33.608,000 --> 0:00:36,000
over maqluba and red wine in Palestine.

9
0:00:37.006,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But how did we get there?

10
0:00:39.887,000 --> 0:00:4,000
PA: Well, I was born in Chicago,

11
0:00:41.666,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the son of a preacher and a teacher.

12
0:00:43.743,000 --> 0:00:47,000
My ears first rung with church songs sung by my mother on Saturday mornings.

13
0:00:48.253,000 --> 0:00:5,000
My father's South Side sermons summoned me.

14
0:00:50.732,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My first words were more notes than quotes.

15
0:00:54.044,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was music that molded me.

16
0:00:56.088,000 --> 0:01:,000
Later on, it was Florida A&M University that first introduced me to organizing.

17
0:01:00.849,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In 2012, a young black male named Trayvon Martin was murdered,

18
0:01:04.137,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it changed my life and millions of others'.

19
0:01:06.642,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We were a ragtag group of college kids and not-quite adults

20
0:01:10.164,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who had decided enough was enough.

21
0:01:12.476,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Art and organizing became our answer to anger and anxiety.

22
0:01:16.623,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We built a movement and it traveled around the world

23
0:01:19.18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and to Palestine, in 2015.

24
0:01:21.331,000 --> 0:01:23,000
AM: I was born to a single mother

25
0:01:23.861,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the Pink House projects of Brooklyn, New York.

26
0:01:26.699,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Maddened by survival,

27
0:01:28.187,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I gravitated inwards towards books, poems and my brother's hand-me-down Walkman.

28
0:01:32.993,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I saw train-station theater,

29
0:01:35.479,000 --> 0:01:37,000
subwoofing streets and hood murals.

30
0:01:38.421,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In high school, I found a community of metaphor magicians

31
0:01:41.931,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and truth-telling poets

32
0:01:43.751,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in an organization called Urban Word NYC.

33
0:01:46.677,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Adopted by the Black Arts movement,

34
0:01:49.005,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I won the legendary Nuyorican Poets Cafe Grand Slam title.

35
0:01:52.75,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Applause and cheers)

36
0:01:54.227,000 --> 0:01:56,000
At Sarah Lawrence College, I worked with artists

37
0:01:56.617,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to respond to Hurricane Katrina and the earthquake;

38
0:02:00.228,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I discovered the impact of poetry

39
0:02:02.951,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the ability to not just articulate our feelings,

40
0:02:05.872,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but to get us to work towards changing things

41
0:02:09.437,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and doing something about it,

42
0:02:11.54,000 --> 0:02:14,000
when a friend, Maytha Alhassen, invited me to Palestine ...

43
0:02:14.63,000 --> 0:02:16,000
PA: We were a delegation of artists and organizers,

44
0:02:17.082,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we immersed ourselves in Palestinian culture,

45
0:02:19.535,000 --> 0:02:2,000
music, their stories.

46
0:02:21.519,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Late into the night,

47
0:02:22.696,000 --> 0:02:25,000
we would have discussions about the role of art in politics

48
0:02:26.119,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the role of politics in art.

49
0:02:28.42,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Aja and I disagree.

50
0:02:30.079,000 --> 0:02:31,000
AM: Oh, we disagree.

51
0:02:31.825,000 --> 0:02:34,000
PA: But we quite quickly and unsurprisingly fell in love.

52
0:02:35.388,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Exhibit A:

53
0:02:36.563,000 --> 0:02:37,000
me working my magic.

54
0:02:38.077,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:40.561,000 --> 0:02:41,000
AM: Obvious, isn't it?

56
0:02:42.608,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Four months later, this artist --

57
0:02:45.81,000 --> 0:02:46,000
PA: and this organizer --

58
0:02:47.81,000 --> 0:02:53,000
AM: moved into a little home with a big backyard, in Miami.

59
0:02:54.636,000 --> 0:02:55,000
PA: (Sighs)

60
0:02:56.005,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Listen, five months before this ever happened,

61
0:02:58.674,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I predicted it all.

62
0:02:59.933,000 --> 0:03:,000
I'm going to tell you --

63
0:03:01.108,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a friend sat me down and said,

64
0:03:02.605,000 --> 0:03:03,000
"You've done so much for organizing,

65
0:03:04.356,000 --> 0:03:05,000
when are you going to settle down?"

66
0:03:06.095,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I looked him straight in the face

67
0:03:07.729,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and I said, "The only way that it would ever happen

68
0:03:10.211,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is if it is a collision.

69
0:03:11.409,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This woman would have to knock me completely off course."

70
0:03:14.69,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I didn't know how right I was.

71
0:03:16.539,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:17.564,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Our first few months were like any between young lovers:

73
0:03:20.553,000 --> 0:03:24,000
filled with hot, passionate, all-night ...

74
0:03:24.648,000 --> 0:03:25,000
AM: nonstop ...

75
0:03:26.64,000 --> 0:03:27,000
PA: discussions.

76
0:03:27.815,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:28.84,000 --> 0:03:31,000
PA: Aja challenged everything I knew and understood about the world.

78
0:03:32.241,000 --> 0:03:33,000
She forced me --

79
0:03:33.659,000 --> 0:03:34,000
AM: lovingly --

80
0:03:34.925,000 --> 0:03:36,000
PA: to see our organizing work with new eyes.

81
0:03:37.078,000 --> 0:03:38,000
She helped me see the unseen things

82
0:03:38.825,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and how artists illuminate our interior worlds.

83
0:03:41.103,000 --> 0:03:44,000
AM: There were many days I did not want to get up out of bed

84
0:03:44.358,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and face the exterior world.

85
0:03:46.784,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I was discouraged.

86
0:03:48.191,000 --> 0:03:5,000
There was so much loss and death

87
0:03:51.125,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and artists were being used to numb, lull and exploit.

88
0:03:55.555,000 --> 0:04:,000
While winning awards, accolades and grants soothed so many egos,

89
0:04:01.109,000 --> 0:04:03,000
people were still dying

90
0:04:03.366,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and I was seeking community.

91
0:04:05.568,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Meeting Phillip brought so much joy, love, truth into my life,

92
0:04:11.888,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and it pulled me out of isolation.

93
0:04:14.593,000 --> 0:04:16,000
He showed me that community and relationships

94
0:04:17.459,000 --> 0:04:19,000
wasn't just about building great movements.

95
0:04:20.209,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It was integral in creating powerful, meaningful art,

96
0:04:23.943,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and neither could be done in solitude.

97
0:04:26.748,000 --> 0:04:3,000
PA: Yeah, we realized many of our artist and organizer friends were also lost

98
0:04:30.915,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in these cycles of sadness,

99
0:04:32.991,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and we were in movements that often found themselves at funerals.

100
0:04:36.859,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We asked ourselves

101
0:04:38.033,000 --> 0:04:4,000
what becomes of a generation all too familiar

102
0:04:40.449,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with the untimely ends of lives streamed daily on our Timelines?

103
0:04:44.353,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It was during one of our late-night discussions

104
0:04:46.889,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that we saw beyond art and organizing

105
0:04:49.692,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and began to see that art was organizing.

106
0:04:52.461,000 --> 0:04:53,000
AM: The idea was set:

107
0:04:53.992,000 --> 0:04:57,000
art was an anchor, not an accessory to movement.

108
0:04:58.46,000 --> 0:05:,000
Our home was a home of radical imagination;

109
0:05:01.15,000 --> 0:05:03,000
an instrument of our nurturing hearts;

110
0:05:03.405,000 --> 0:05:08,000
a place of risk where were dared to laugh, love, cry, debate.

111
0:05:08.728,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Art, books, records and all this stuff decorated our walls,

112
0:05:14.256,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and there was lizards --

113
0:05:17.371,000 --> 0:05:21,000
walls of palm trees that guided our guests into our backyard,

114
0:05:22.202,000 --> 0:05:25,000
where our neighbors would come and feel right at home.

115
0:05:25.846,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The wind --

116
0:05:27.021,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the wind was an affirmation for the people who walked into the space.

117
0:05:31.223,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And we learned that in a world --

118
0:05:33.393,000 --> 0:05:35,000
a bewildering world of so much distraction --

119
0:05:36.149,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we were able to cultivate a space where people could come and be present,

120
0:05:40.918,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and artists and organizers could find refuge.

121
0:05:44.508,000 --> 0:05:46,000
PA: This became Smoke Signals Studio.

122
0:05:47.27,000 --> 0:05:51,000
AM: As we struggle to clothe, house, feed and educate our communities;

123
0:05:52.27,000 --> 0:05:56,000
our spirits hunger for connection, joy and purpose;

124
0:05:56.454,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and as our bodies are out on the front lines,

125
0:05:59.21,000 --> 0:06:01,000
our souls still need to be fed,

126
0:06:02.043,000 --> 0:06:05,000
or else we succumb to despair and depression.

127
0:06:05.396,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Our art possesses rhythmic communication,

128
0:06:09.837,000 --> 0:06:1,000
coded emotional cues,

129
0:06:11.381,000 --> 0:06:14,000
improvised feelings of critical thought.

130
0:06:14.686,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Our social movements should be like jazz:

131
0:06:18.108,000 --> 0:06:2,000
encouraging active participation,

132
0:06:20.938,000 --> 0:06:21,000
listening,

133
0:06:22.205,000 --> 0:06:23,000
spontaneity and freedom.

134
0:06:23.725,000 --> 0:06:25,000
What people see as a party ...

135
0:06:26.13,000 --> 0:06:28,000
PA: is actually a movement meeting.

136
0:06:28.649,000 --> 0:06:3,000
See, we aren't all protest and pain.

137
0:06:31.3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Here's a place to be loved,

138
0:06:33.021,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to be felt, to be heard,

139
0:06:34.959,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and where we prepare for the most pressing political issues

140
0:06:38.344,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in our neighborhoods.

141
0:06:40.17,000 --> 0:06:42,000
See, laws never change culture,

142
0:06:42.955,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but culture always changes laws.

143
0:06:47.041,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Art --

144
0:06:48.232,000 --> 0:06:5,000
(Applause)

145
0:06:50.471,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Art as organizing is even changing and opening doors

146
0:06:53.312,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in places seen as the opposite of freedom.

147
0:06:55.578,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Our weekly poetry series

148
0:06:57.233,000 --> 0:07:,000
is transforming the lives of men incarcerated at Dade Correctional,

149
0:07:00.591,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and we're so excited to bring you all the published work of one of those men,

150
0:07:04.235,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Echo Martinez.

151
0:07:05.44,000 --> 0:07:06,000
In the intro, he says ...

152
0:07:07.401,000 --> 0:07:1,000
AM: "Poetry for the people is a sick pen's penicillin.

153
0:07:10.812,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's a cuff key to a prisoner's dreams.

154
0:07:13.607,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The Molotov in the ink.

155
0:07:15.452,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It is knowledge, it is overstanding,

156
0:07:17.359,000 --> 0:07:19,000
it is tasting ingredients in everything you've been force-fed,

157
0:07:20.294,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but most of all, it's a reminder that we all have voices,

158
0:07:23.182,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we all can be heard even if we have to scream."

159
0:07:26.466,000 --> 0:07:31,000
In 2018, we created our first annual Maroon Poetry Festival

160
0:07:32.017,000 --> 0:07:34,000
at the TACOLCY Center in Liberty City.

161
0:07:34.802,000 --> 0:07:38,000
There, the Last Poets, Sonia Sanchez, Emory Douglas

162
0:07:39.252,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and the late, great Ntozake Shange,

163
0:07:41.64,000 --> 0:07:45,000
performed and met with local artists and organizers.

164
0:07:46.369,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We were able to honor them

165
0:07:48.221,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for their commitment to radical truth-telling.

166
0:07:51.213,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And in addition to that,

167
0:07:52.863,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we transformed a public park

168
0:07:55.29,000 --> 0:08:,000
into the physical manifestation of the world we are organizing for.

169
0:08:00.382,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Everything that we put into poetry,

170
0:08:02.247,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we put into the art, into the creativity,

171
0:08:05.128,000 --> 0:08:07,000
into the curated kids' games

172
0:08:07.308,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and into the stunning stage design.

173
0:08:09.739,000 --> 0:08:11,000
PA: Our work is in a long line of cultural organizers

174
0:08:12.417,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that understood to use art to animate a radical future.

175
0:08:16.535,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Artists like June Jordan,

176
0:08:18.349,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Emory Douglas

177
0:08:20.017,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and Nina Simone.

178
0:08:21.316,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They understood what many of us are just now realizing --

179
0:08:24.577,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that to get people to build the ship,

180
0:08:26.417,000 --> 0:08:28,000
you've got to get them to long for the sea;

181
0:08:28.483,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that data rarely moves people, but great art always does.

182
0:08:32.745,000 --> 0:08:33,000
This understanding --

183
0:08:33.989,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

184
0:08:36.469,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This understanding informed the thinking

185
0:08:38.41,000 --> 0:08:4,000
behind the Dream Defenders' "Freedom Papers,"

186
0:08:40.6,000 --> 0:08:43,000
a radical political vision for the future of Florida

187
0:08:43.813,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that talked about people over profits.

188
0:08:46.193,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Now, we could have done a policy paper.

189
0:08:48.652,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Instead, artists and organizers came together in their poetry

190
0:08:52.375,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to create incredible murals

191
0:08:54.295,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and did the video that we see behind us.

192
0:08:56.763,000 --> 0:08:59,000
We joined the political precision of the Black Panther Party

193
0:09:00.499,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and the beautiful poetry of Puerto Rican poet Martín Espada

194
0:09:04.076,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to bring our political vision to life.

195
0:09:07.457,000 --> 0:09:13,000
AM: Now thousands of Floridians across age, race, gender and class

196
0:09:13.504,000 --> 0:09:17,000
see the "Freedom Papers" as a vision for the future of their lives.

197
0:09:17.792,000 --> 0:09:22,000
For decades, our artists and our art has been used to exploit,

198
0:09:23.373,000 --> 0:09:24,000
lull, numb,

199
0:09:24.874,000 --> 0:09:25,000
sell things to us

200
0:09:26.534,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and to displace our communities,

201
0:09:28.875,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but we believe that the personal is political

202
0:09:33.52,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and the heart is measured by what is done,

203
0:09:37.204,000 --> 0:09:38,000
not what one feels.

204
0:09:38.989,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And so art as organizing is not just concerned with artists' intentions,

205
0:09:43.86,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but their actual impact.

206
0:09:45.89,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Great art is not a monologue.

207
0:09:48.146,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Great art is a dialogue between the artist and the people.

208
0:09:53.454,000 --> 0:09:55,000
PA: Four years ago, this artist ...

209
0:09:56.253,000 --> 0:09:58,000
AM: and this organizer ...

210
0:09:58.51,000 --> 0:10:,000
PA: found that we were not just a match.

211
0:10:01.019,000 --> 0:10:02,000
AM: We were a mirror.

212
0:10:02.438,000 --> 0:10:04,000
PA: Our worlds truly did collide,

213
0:10:05.375,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and in many ways ...

214
0:10:06.628,000 --> 0:10:07,000
AM: they combined.

215
0:10:08.367,000 --> 0:10:09,000
PA: We learned so much about movement,

216
0:10:10.256,000 --> 0:10:13,000
about love and about art at its most impactful:

217
0:10:13.797,000 --> 0:10:17,000
when it articulates the impossible and when it erodes individualism,

218
0:10:18.107,000 --> 0:10:22,000
when it plays into the gray places of our black and white worlds,

219
0:10:22.761,000 --> 0:10:24,000
when it does what our democracy does not,

220
0:10:25.403,000 --> 0:10:27,000
when it reminds us that we are not islands,

221
0:10:28.021,000 --> 0:10:31,000
when it adorns every street but Wall Street and Madison Avenue,

222
0:10:31.823,000 --> 0:10:33,000
when it reminds us that we are not islands

223
0:10:34.333,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and refuses to succumb to the numbness,

224
0:10:36.864,000 --> 0:10:37,000
when it indicts empire

225
0:10:38.681,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and inspires each and every one of us to love,

226
0:10:41.538,000 --> 0:10:42,000
tell the truth

227
0:10:42.713,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and make revolution irresistible.

228
0:10:46.157,000 --> 0:10:47,000
AM: For the wizards --

229
0:10:47.332,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Applause)

230
0:10:51.639,000 --> 0:10:54,000
AM: For the wizards and ways of our defiance,

231
0:10:56.4,000 --> 0:11:,000
love-riot visions of our rising, risen, raised selves.

232
0:11:01.329,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The overcoming grace --

233
0:11:03.131,000 --> 0:11:04,000
fires, bitter tongues,

234
0:11:04.979,000 --> 0:11:06,000
wise as rickety rocking chairs,

235
0:11:07.742,000 --> 0:11:09,000
suffering salt and sand skies.

236
0:11:10.487,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Memories unshackled and shining stitches

237
0:11:14.131,000 --> 0:11:15,000
on a stretch-marked heart.

238
0:11:16.405,000 --> 0:11:19,000
For the flowers that bloom in midnight scars.

239
0:11:20.273,000 --> 0:11:23,000
How we suffered and sought a North Star.

240
0:11:23.583,000 --> 0:11:25,000
When there was no light, we glowed.

241
0:11:26.292,000 --> 0:11:28,000
We sparked this rejoice,

242
0:11:28.937,000 --> 0:11:29,000
this righteous delight.

243
0:11:30.901,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We have a cause to take joy in.

244
0:11:33.666,000 --> 0:11:35,000
How we weathered and persisted,

245
0:11:35.941,000 --> 0:11:36,000
tenacious,

246
0:11:37.115,000 --> 0:11:39,000
no stone unturned.

247
0:11:39.163,000 --> 0:11:42,000
How we witnessed the horror of mankind

248
0:11:42.818,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and did not become that which horrified us.

249
0:11:47.437,000 --> 0:11:48,000
PA: Thank you.

250
0:11:48.612,000 --> 0:11:49,000
AM: Thank you.

251
0:11:49.787,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

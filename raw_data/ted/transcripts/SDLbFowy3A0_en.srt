1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:19,000
well hello this is Sophie it's it's it's

2
0:00:19.06,000 --> 0:00:22,000
alright don't worry everything's gonna

3
0:00:20.529,000 --> 0:00:24,000
be fine

4
0:00:22.739,000 --> 0:00:27,000
there are some people on the balcony

5
0:00:24.939,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that are very happy to be out there now

6
0:00:28.259,000 --> 0:00:34,000
so this is Sophie not Sophia no Sophie

7
0:00:32.079,000 --> 0:00:38,000
now she has a French name now you wonder

8
0:00:34.42,000 --> 0:00:4,000
why so Sophie for most people is the

9
0:00:38.62,000 --> 0:00:42,000
incarnation of terror really she's far

10
0:00:40.99,000 --> 0:00:45,000
too leggy she's far too hairy and she's

11
0:00:42.88,000 --> 0:00:48,000
far too big to ever be trusted but to me

12
0:00:46.47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Sophie is a fantastic feat of

13
0:00:49.12,000 --> 0:00:54,000
bioengineering you see Sophie is a

14
0:00:51.7,000 --> 0:00:55,000
testimony to all those creatures that

15
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:58,000
have managed to survive since the

16
0:00:56.35,000 --> 0:01:,000
beginning of times all those animals

17
0:00:58.48,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that have managed to have offspring

18
0:01:01.15,000 --> 0:01:07,000
generation after generation until this

19
0:01:03.76,000 --> 0:01:09,000
day you see over 1 billion years ago the

20
0:01:08.11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
first primitive cells have started to

21
0:01:10.689,000 --> 0:01:16,000
evolve on this planet he took spiders

22
0:01:13.71,000 --> 0:01:19,000
430 million years to become what they

23
0:01:16.81,000 --> 0:01:23,000
are now one of the most versatile one of

24
0:01:20.439,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the most diverse and one of the most

25
0:01:24.749,000 --> 0:01:32,000
evolved group of predators to ever walk

26
0:01:29.59,000 --> 0:01:34,000
this earth it's actually quite sporty to

27
0:01:32.889,000 --> 0:01:4,000
give a speech while wrangling a

28
0:01:34.81,000 --> 0:01:43,000
tarantula I have to say so we shouldn't

29
0:01:41.499,000 --> 0:01:46,000
forget that Sophie and in fact all of us

30
0:01:44.649,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we all are a testimony to all those

31
0:01:47.35,000 --> 0:01:52,000
ruthless battles that actually we're won

32
0:01:49.869,000 --> 0:01:55,000
consistently by all our ancestors all

33
0:01:52.659,000 --> 0:02:,000
our predecessors in fact all of us every

34
0:01:56.619,000 --> 0:02:03,000
single one of one of you is in fact and

35
0:02:00.749,000 --> 0:02:06,000
interrupted 1 billion years old success

36
0:02:03.67,000 --> 0:02:08,000
story and in the case of Sophie that

37
0:02:06.88,000 --> 0:02:12,000
success is partly due to what she has in

38
0:02:09.64,000 --> 0:02:15,000
chess just on the rise in there she has

39
0:02:13.3,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a pair of venom glands that are attached

40
0:02:16.57,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to a pair of fangs and those fangs are

41
0:02:18.97,000 --> 0:02:23,000
folded into a mouth

42
0:02:21.4,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so without those fangs and without this

43
0:02:24.549,000 --> 0:02:27,000
venom Sophie would have never managed to

44
0:02:26.83,000 --> 0:02:29,000
survive

45
0:02:27.549,000 --> 0:02:32,000
now many animals have evolved to venom

46
0:02:30.7,000 --> 0:02:34,000
systems in order to survive nowadays any

47
0:02:33.459,000 --> 0:02:38,000
species of venomous snakes any species

48
0:02:35.379,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of spider any species of scorpion has

49
0:02:39.22,000 --> 0:02:46,000
its own venom signature if you want made

50
0:02:42.79,000 --> 0:02:48,000
out of dozen if not hundreds chemical

51
0:02:46.269,000 --> 0:02:51,000
compounds and all of those compounds

52
0:02:48.819,000 --> 0:02:55,000
have evolved purely for one purpose

53
0:02:52.079,000 --> 0:02:58,000
disable and eventually kill now venom

54
0:02:56.379,000 --> 0:03:,000
can actually act in many different ways

55
0:02:58.69,000 --> 0:03:04,000
venom believe me can make you feel pains

56
0:03:01.359,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that you've never felt before venom can

57
0:03:04.78,000 --> 0:03:09,000
also make your heart stop within minutes

58
0:03:07.9,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or it can turn your blood into jelly

59
0:03:09.97,000 --> 0:03:15,000
venom can also paralyze you almost

60
0:03:13.06,000 --> 0:03:19,000
instantly or it can just eat your flesh

61
0:03:16.269,000 --> 0:03:23,000
away like acid now all these pretty

62
0:03:19.569,000 --> 0:03:25,000
gruesome stories I know but me to me

63
0:03:24.129,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it's kind of music to my ears it's what

64
0:03:26.56,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I love so why is that well it's not

65
0:03:30.04,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because I'm a nutcase no just imaging

66
0:03:34.299,000 --> 0:03:39,000
just imaging what we could do if we

67
0:03:36.879,000 --> 0:03:42,000
could harvest all those sir powerful

68
0:03:39.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
compounds and use them to our benefit

69
0:03:42.959,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that would be amazing right what if we

70
0:03:46.03,000 --> 0:03:5,000
could I don't know produce new

71
0:03:47.849,000 --> 0:03:51,000
antibiotics with those venom what if we

72
0:03:50.379,000 --> 0:03:54,000
could actually help people that are

73
0:03:51.91,000 --> 0:03:57,000
suffering from diabetes or hypertension

74
0:03:55.169,000 --> 0:04:,000
well in fact all those applications are

75
0:03:58.81,000 --> 0:04:01,000
already being developed by scientists

76
0:04:01.09,000 --> 0:04:05,000
just like me

77
0:04:02.349,000 --> 0:04:08,000
everywhere around the world as I speak

78
0:04:05.34,000 --> 0:04:11,000
you see hypertension is actually treated

79
0:04:08.799,000 --> 0:04:12,000
regularly with a medication that has

80
0:04:11.41,000 --> 0:04:15,000
been developed from the toxin that is

81
0:04:13.329,000 --> 0:04:18,000
produced by a South American Viper

82
0:04:16.32,000 --> 0:04:2,000
people that have type 2 diabetes can be

83
0:04:19.15,000 --> 0:04:23,000
monitored using actually the toxin

84
0:04:21.13,000 --> 0:04:26,000
produced by a lizard from North America

85
0:04:23.349,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and in hospitals all around the world a

86
0:04:26.77,000 --> 0:04:32,000
new protocol is being developed to use a

87
0:04:29.05,000 --> 0:04:34,000
toxin from a marine snail for

88
0:04:32.8,000 --> 0:04:36,000
anesthetics

89
0:04:34.38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you see venom is that kind of huge

90
0:04:37.23,000 --> 0:04:42,000
library of venom of chemical compounds

91
0:04:40.71,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that are available to us that are

92
0:04:42.39,000 --> 0:04:49,000
produced by hundreds of thousands of

93
0:04:44.73,000 --> 0:04:51,000
life creatures and sorry she just wants

94
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to go for a little walk

95
0:04:52.37,000 --> 0:04:58,000
spider saloon actually thought to

96
0:04:56.01,000 --> 0:05:02,000
produce over 10 million different kinds

97
0:04:58.92,000 --> 0:05:04,000
of compounds with potential therapeutic

98
0:05:02.25,000 --> 0:05:06,000
application ten millions and do you know

99
0:05:05.49,000 --> 0:05:09,000
how many scientists actually have

100
0:05:07.08,000 --> 0:05:14,000
managed to study so far about 0.01

101
0:05:10.32,000 --> 0:05:17,000
percent so that mean that there is still

102
0:05:14.12,000 --> 0:05:19,000
99.99% of all those compounds that are

103
0:05:17.34,000 --> 0:05:21,000
out there completely unknown and are

104
0:05:19.65,000 --> 0:05:24,000
just waiting to be harvested and tested

105
0:05:21.99,000 --> 0:05:26,000
which is fantastic you see so far

106
0:05:24.87,000 --> 0:05:3,000
scientists have concentrated efforts on

107
0:05:27.18,000 --> 0:05:34,000
very charismatic very dangerous animals

108
0:05:30.98,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Vipers and cobras or scorpions and black

109
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:39,000
widows but what about all those little

110
0:05:36.84,000 --> 0:05:41,000
birds that we have actually are all

111
0:05:39.57,000 --> 0:05:43,000
around us you know like that spider that

112
0:05:42.24,000 --> 0:05:46,000
leaves behind your couch you know the

113
0:05:44.43,000 --> 0:05:48,000
one that decide to just shoot through

114
0:05:47.07,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the floor when you're watching TV and

115
0:05:48.93,000 --> 0:05:51,000
freak you out you have that one at home

116
0:05:51.45,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as well

117
0:05:52.88,000 --> 0:05:57,000
well what about those guys do they

118
0:05:55.95,000 --> 0:05:59,000
actually produce some kind of amazing

119
0:05:58.38,000 --> 0:06:02,000
compound in their tiny body as well

120
0:06:00.72,000 --> 0:06:05,000
well our honest answer a few months ago

121
0:06:03.24,000 --> 0:06:08,000
would have been we have no clue but now

122
0:06:06.66,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that my students and myself has started

123
0:06:08.64,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to look into it I can tell you those

124
0:06:10.8,000 --> 0:06:15,000
guys actually are producing very very

125
0:06:13.68,000 --> 0:06:17,000
interesting compounds and I'm going to

126
0:06:16.62,000 --> 0:06:19,000
tell you more about that in a second but

127
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:22,000
first I would like to tell you more

128
0:06:20.13,000 --> 0:06:26,000
about this we are looking into it how

129
0:06:22.5,000 --> 0:06:28,000
does one look into it well first of all

130
0:06:26.52,000 --> 0:06:31,000
my students and I have to capture a lot

131
0:06:28.71,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of spiders so how do we do that well

132
0:06:31.82,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you'd be surprised

133
0:06:33.72,000 --> 0:06:39,000
once one start to look one finds a lot

134
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of spiders they actually live everywhere

135
0:06:39.9,000 --> 0:06:43,000
around us within a couple of hours we

136
0:06:42.03,000 --> 0:06:46,000
are capable of CAP catching maybe two

137
0:06:44.46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
three four hundred spiders and we

138
0:06:46.95,000 --> 0:06:5,000
bring them back to my laboratory and we

139
0:06:49.32,000 --> 0:06:53,000
house each of them in its own individual

140
0:06:51.69,000 --> 0:06:56,000
home and we give each of them a little

141
0:06:54.27,000 --> 0:06:58,000
meal so now I know what you're thinking

142
0:06:56.94,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I think these guys nuts he has a spider

143
0:06:59.07,000 --> 0:07:06,000
B&B at work no no it's not exactly that

144
0:07:04.11,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and it's not the kind of venture I would

145
0:07:06.42,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I would advise you to start no once we

146
0:07:10.23,000 --> 0:07:15,000
are done with that we wait a few days

147
0:07:12.18,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and then we anesthetize the spiders once

148
0:07:15.6,000 --> 0:07:19,000
they're asleep we run a tiny little

149
0:07:18.21,000 --> 0:07:22,000
electric current through the body and

150
0:07:20.1,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that contracts their venom glands then

151
0:07:22.95,000 --> 0:07:27,000
under a microscope we can feel tiny

152
0:07:25.11,000 --> 0:07:3,000
little droplets of venom appearing so we

153
0:07:28.17,000 --> 0:07:33,000
take a hair thin glass tube a capillary

154
0:07:30.6,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and we collect the tiny droplets then we

155
0:07:33.93,000 --> 0:07:36,000
take the spider and we put it back into

156
0:07:35.76,000 --> 0:07:4,000
its home and we start again with another

157
0:07:37.53,000 --> 0:07:42,000
one because spiders are completely

158
0:07:41.13,000 --> 0:07:44,000
unharmed during the process it means

159
0:07:43.32,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that a few days later once they've

160
0:07:45.03,000 --> 0:07:48,000
produced a little bit of venom again and

161
0:07:46.92,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that they've recovered we can release

162
0:07:48.51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
them back in the wild it takes literally

163
0:07:52.13,000 --> 0:07:58,000
hundreds of spiders to just produce the

164
0:07:55.08,000 --> 0:08:01,000
equivalent of one raindrop of venom so

165
0:07:58.53,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that drop is incredibly precious to us

166
0:08:01.29,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and once we have it we freeze it and we

167
0:08:04.41,000 --> 0:08:08,000
then pass it in a machine that will

168
0:08:06.3,000 --> 0:08:11,000
separate and purify every chemical

169
0:08:09.24,000 --> 0:08:13,000
compound that is in that venom we're

170
0:08:11.88,000 --> 0:08:14,000
speaking about tiny amounts we are

171
0:08:13.71,000 --> 0:08:18,000
actually speaking about tenth of a

172
0:08:15.63,000 --> 0:08:19,000
millionth of a liter of compound but we

173
0:08:18.81,000 --> 0:08:21,000
can dilute that compound

174
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
several thousand times in its own volume

175
0:08:22.23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
of water and then test it against a

176
0:08:24.51,000 --> 0:08:31,000
whole range of nasty stuff like cancer

177
0:08:27.72,000 --> 0:08:34,000
cells or bacteria and this this is when

178
0:08:32.34,000 --> 0:08:38,000
the very exciting part of my job starts

179
0:08:35.46,000 --> 0:08:41,000
because this is pure scientific gambling

180
0:08:38.58,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's kind of Las Vegas baby for me it's

181
0:08:41.599,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we spent so many hours so much resources

182
0:08:46.4,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so much time trying to get those

183
0:08:49.83,000 --> 0:08:54,000
compounds ready and then we test them

184
0:08:51.93,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and most of the time nothing happens

185
0:08:55.22,000 --> 0:09:,000
nothing at all but once in a while just

186
0:08:58.35,000 --> 0:09:02,000
once in a while we

187
0:09:00.3,000 --> 0:09:04,000
get that particular compound that has

188
0:09:02.37,000 --> 0:09:07,000
absolutely amazing effect that's the

189
0:09:04.86,000 --> 0:09:08,000
jackpot and when I'm saying that

190
0:09:07.38,000 --> 0:09:11,000
actually I should take out something

191
0:09:09.09,000 --> 0:09:15,000
else from my pocket be afraid be very

192
0:09:11.64,000 --> 0:09:17,000
afraid now in that little tube I have

193
0:09:15.93,000 --> 0:09:19,000
actually a very common spider the kind

194
0:09:18.15,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of spiders that you could find in your

195
0:09:20.34,000 --> 0:09:24,000
shed that you could find in your

196
0:09:22.08,000 --> 0:09:28,000
basement or that you could find in your

197
0:09:24.36,000 --> 0:09:3,000
sewer pipe understand in your toilet now

198
0:09:28.47,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that little spider happens to produce

199
0:09:30.95,000 --> 0:09:37,000
amazingly powerful antimicrobial

200
0:09:33.18,000 --> 0:09:41,000
compounds it is even capable of killing

201
0:09:38.1,000 --> 0:09:43,000
those drug resistant bacteria that are

202
0:09:41.22,000 --> 0:09:46,000
giving us so much trouble that are often

203
0:09:43.17,000 --> 0:09:48,000
making media headlines now honestly if I

204
0:09:46.47,000 --> 0:09:52,000
was living in new sewer pipe I'd produce

205
0:09:48.45,000 --> 0:09:56,000
antibiotics too but that little spider

206
0:09:53.25,000 --> 0:09:59,000
actually may hold the answer to a very

207
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:10:02,000
very serious concern we have you see

208
0:09:59.52,000 --> 0:10:05,000
around the world every single day about

209
0:10:02.87,000 --> 0:10:07,000
1,700 people died because of

210
0:10:05.81,000 --> 0:10:11,000
antimicrobial resistant infections

211
0:10:08.42,000 --> 0:10:15,000
multiply that by 365 and you're reaching

212
0:10:12.3,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the staggering number of 700,000 people

213
0:10:15.57,000 --> 0:10:21,000
dead every single year because

214
0:10:18.5,000 --> 0:10:24,000
antibiotics that were efficient 30 20 or

215
0:10:21.93,000 --> 0:10:27,000
10 years ago are not capable of killing

216
0:10:24.54,000 --> 0:10:3,000
very common bugs the reality is that the

217
0:10:28.17,000 --> 0:10:33,000
world is running out of antibiotics and

218
0:10:30.68,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the pharmaceutical industry does not

219
0:10:33.6,000 --> 0:10:38,000
have any answer actually any weapon to

220
0:10:36.06,000 --> 0:10:42,000
address that concern you see 30 years

221
0:10:39.09,000 --> 0:10:44,000
ago you could consider that 10 to 15 new

222
0:10:42.69,000 --> 0:10:46,000
kinds of antibiotics would hit the

223
0:10:44.61,000 --> 0:10:48,000
market every couple of years do you know

224
0:10:47.22,000 --> 0:10:53,000
how many of them hit the market in the

225
0:10:48.75,000 --> 0:10:55,000
past five years - the reality is that if

226
0:10:53.31,000 --> 0:10:59,000
we continue this way we are few decades

227
0:10:56.07,000 --> 0:11:02,000
away to be completely helpless in front

228
0:10:59.85,000 --> 0:11:04,000
of infections just like we were before

229
0:11:02.55,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the discovery of penicillin 90 years ago

230
0:11:04.94,000 --> 0:11:09,000
so you see the reality is that we are at

231
0:11:07.92,000 --> 0:11:12,000
war against an invisible enemy that

232
0:11:10.71,000 --> 0:11:17,000
adapts and evolves a lot quicker than we

233
0:11:13.77,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and in that war this little spider might

234
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
be one of a greatest secret weapon just

235
0:11:22.14,000 --> 0:11:3,000
half a millionth of a liter of a venom

236
0:11:25.55,000 --> 0:11:34,000
diluted 10,000 times is still capable of

237
0:11:30.66,000 --> 0:11:37,000
killing most bacteria that are resistant

238
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to any other kind of antibiotics it's

239
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
absolutely amazing

240
0:11:39.39,000 --> 0:11:45,000
every time I repeat this experiment I

241
0:11:41.82,000 --> 0:11:47,000
just wonder how is that possible how

242
0:11:45.42,000 --> 0:11:51,000
many other possibilities and secrets all

243
0:11:48.36,000 --> 0:11:54,000
siblings do actually have what kind of

244
0:11:52.05,000 --> 0:11:58,000
wonderful product can we really find out

245
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
if we care to look so when people ask me

246
0:11:58.35,000 --> 0:12:03,000
are bugs really the future of

247
0:12:00.42,000 --> 0:12:06,000
therapeutic drugs my answer is well I

248
0:12:03.45,000 --> 0:12:08,000
really believe that they do all some key

249
0:12:06.93,000 --> 0:12:11,000
answers and we need to give ourselves

250
0:12:09.3,000 --> 0:12:14,000
really the means to investigate them so

251
0:12:12.9,000 --> 0:12:16,000
when you head back home later tonight

252
0:12:14.91,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and that you see that spider in the

253
0:12:17.19,000 --> 0:12:26,000
corner of your own don't squash it

254
0:12:22.36,000 --> 0:12:27,000
just look at it admire it and remember

255
0:12:26.48,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that it is an absolutely fantastic

256
0:12:28.269,000 --> 0:12:33,000
creature a pure product of evolution and

257
0:12:31.249,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that maybe that very spider one day

258
0:12:34.149,000 --> 0:12:41,000
we'll all the answer will hold the key

259
0:12:37.069,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to your very own survival you see she's

260
0:12:41.24,000 --> 0:12:45,000
not so insignificant anymore now is she

261
0:12:43.929,000 --> 0:12:48,000
thank you

262
0:12:45.98,000 --> 0:12:48,000
[Applause]

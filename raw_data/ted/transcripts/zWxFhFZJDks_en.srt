2
0:00:15.513,000 --> 0:00:17,000
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates

3
0:00:18.383,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who had big plans for the future.

4
0:00:20.668,000 --> 0:00:22,000
He had a vision. When he got out,

5
0:00:22.899,000 --> 0:00:24,000
he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight,

6
0:00:25.754,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision.

7
0:00:30.881,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He'd spent 10,000 dollars

8
0:00:32.395,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to buy a website that exclusively featured women

9
0:00:35.679,000 --> 0:00:4,000
having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars. (Laughter)

10
0:00:41.568,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It was my first week in federal prison,

11
0:00:44.554,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you see on TV.

12
0:00:48.371,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men

13
0:00:52.274,000 --> 0:00:54,000
whose business instincts were in many cases

14
0:00:55.015,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as sharp as those of the CEOs

15
0:00:57.417,000 --> 0:00:58,000
who had wined and dined me six months earlier

16
0:00:59.246,000 --> 0:01:03,000
when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate.

17
0:01:03.798,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with

18
0:01:06.639,000 --> 0:01:08,000
had been drug dealers on the outside,

19
0:01:09.379,000 --> 0:01:12,000
but when they talked about what they did,

20
0:01:12.787,000 --> 0:01:14,000
they talked about it in a different jargon,

21
0:01:15.49,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but the business concepts that they talked about

22
0:01:17.274,000 --> 0:01:2,000
weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:

23
0:01:20.954,000 --> 0:01:24,000
promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user,

24
0:01:25.458,000 --> 0:01:28,000
focus-grouping new product launches,

25
0:01:29.029,000 --> 0:01:31,000
territorial expansion.

26
0:01:31.266,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory days.

27
0:01:34.537,000 --> 0:01:36,000
For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive.

28
0:01:37.386,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's a lot harder than you might think.

29
0:01:39.583,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Contrary to what most people think,

30
0:01:42.37,000 --> 0:01:45,000
people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay, for your life

31
0:01:45.748,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when you're in prison. You've got to pay for your own life.

32
0:01:47.538,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,

33
0:01:50.29,000 --> 0:01:52,000
toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it.

34
0:01:52.588,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And it's hard for a couple of reasons.

35
0:01:53.94,000 --> 0:01:55,000
First, everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent

36
0:01:56.335,000 --> 0:01:57,000
from what you'd pay on the street,

37
0:01:57.702,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and second, you don't make a lot of money.

38
0:02:00.284,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job,

39
0:02:02.553,000 --> 0:02:04,000
unloading trucks at a food warehouse,

40
0:02:04.842,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for $5.25, not an hour, but per month.

41
0:02:09.195,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So how do you survive?

42
0:02:11.353,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles.

43
0:02:14.872,000 --> 0:02:15,000
There's legal hustles.

44
0:02:16.471,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You pay everything in stamps. Those are the currency.

45
0:02:18.639,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You charge another inmate to clean his cell.

46
0:02:21.055,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There's sort of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell.

47
0:02:25.958,000 --> 0:02:29,000
There's pretty illegal hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell.

48
0:02:30.18,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And there's very illegal hustles, which you smuggle in,

49
0:02:33.463,000 --> 0:02:37,000
you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography,

50
0:02:37.566,000 --> 0:02:4,000
cell phones, and just as in the outer world,

51
0:02:41.033,000 --> 0:02:44,000
there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise,

52
0:02:44.536,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the more profitable it can potentially be.

53
0:02:46.4,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars.

54
0:02:51.336,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open

55
0:02:54.641,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks.

56
0:02:58.287,000 --> 0:03:,000
You want a dirty magazine?

57
0:03:00.623,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars.

58
0:03:04.007,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So as you can probably tell, one of the defining aspects

59
0:03:07.113,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of prison life is ingenuity.

60
0:03:10.663,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Whether it was concocting delicious meals

61
0:03:13.067,000 --> 0:03:17,000
from stolen scraps from the warehouse,

62
0:03:17.266,000 --> 0:03:2,000
sculpting people's hair with toenail clippers,

63
0:03:20.416,000 --> 0:03:25,000
or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags

64
0:03:26.04,000 --> 0:03:3,000
tied on to tree limbs, prisoners learn how to make do with less,

65
0:03:30.809,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and many of them want to take this ingenuity

66
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that they've learned to the outside

67
0:03:35.666,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and start restaurants, barber shops,

68
0:03:37.912,000 --> 0:03:39,000
personal training businesses.

69
0:03:40.257,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that,

70
0:03:43.752,000 --> 0:03:45,000
no rehabilitation at all in prison,

71
0:03:46.047,000 --> 0:03:48,000
no one to help them write a business plan,

72
0:03:48.248,000 --> 0:03:51,000
figure out a way to translate the business concepts

73
0:03:51.506,000 --> 0:03:54,000
they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises,

74
0:03:54.529,000 --> 0:03:56,000
no access to the Internet, even.

75
0:03:57.104,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And then, when they come out, most states

76
0:03:59.688,000 --> 0:04:01,000
don't even have a law prohibiting employers

77
0:04:02.04,000 --> 0:04:05,000
from discriminating against people with a background.

78
0:04:05.76,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So none of us should be surprised

79
0:04:08.064,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend

80
0:04:10.908,000 --> 0:04:12,000
within five years.

81
0:04:13.496,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost a year of my life from it.

82
0:04:18.808,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do

83
0:04:22.467,000 --> 0:04:23,000
whatever I could to make sure

84
0:04:24.293,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that guys like the ones I was locked up with

85
0:04:26.726,000 --> 0:04:3,000
didn't have to waste any more of their life than they already had.

86
0:04:30.773,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So I hope that you'll think about helping in some way.

87
0:04:34.421,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The best thing we can do is figure out ways

88
0:04:36.989,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit

89
0:04:39.677,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons,

90
0:04:42.921,000 --> 0:04:45,000
because if we don't, they're not going to learn any new skills

91
0:04:45.996,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that's going to help them, and they'll be right back.

92
0:04:48.545,000 --> 0:04:5,000
All they'll learn on the inside is new hustles.

93
0:04:51.421,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:13.05,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody.

2
0:00:15.542,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Can you tell everybody your name?

3
0:00:16.62,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Einstein: Einstein.

4
0:00:17.71,000 --> 0:00:19,000
SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone "hi"?

5
0:00:20.46,000 --> 0:00:21,000
E: Hello.

6
0:00:21.732,000 --> 0:00:23,000
SW: That's nice. Can you be polite?

7
0:00:23.839,000 --> 0:00:23,000
E: Hi, sweetheart.

8
0:00:24.63,000 --> 0:00:25,000
SW: Much better.

9
0:00:25.91,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006,

10
0:00:29.27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
amongst all you modern-day Einsteins.

11
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
In fact, she's very excited.

12
0:00:32.62,000 --> 0:00:32,000
E: Woo.

13
0:00:33.4,000 --> 0:00:33,000
SW: Yeah.

14
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz

16
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
about all the exciting speakers here for the conference.

17
0:00:39.93,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about Tom O'Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday.

18
0:00:43.8,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Einstein, did you hear whispers?

19
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
E: [Squawks]

20
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
SW: Yeah.

21
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

22
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk.

23
0:00:52.06,000 --> 0:00:55,000
A lot of her research goes on in case, which can get pretty dusty.

24
0:00:55.131,000 --> 0:00:56,000
E: Achoo!

25
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
SW: It could make her sneeze.

26
0:00:57.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But more importantly, her research could help Einstein

27
0:01:00.11,000 --> 0:01:02,000
find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat.

28
0:01:02.831,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Einstein: [Coughs]

29
0:01:03.95,000 --> 0:01:04,000
SW: Yeah.

30
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:05.93,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes

32
0:01:08.86,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in his research at the microscopic level.

33
0:01:11.15,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping

34
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.

35
0:01:17.59,000 --> 0:01:18,000
E: Oh, my God! My God! My God!

36
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.

37
0:01:21.545,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:22.71,000 --> 0:01:23,000
That is one big peanut.

39
0:01:24.24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Since Einstein is a bird,

40
0:01:25.93,000 --> 0:01:27,000
she's very interested in things that fly.

41
0:01:28.37,000 --> 0:01:3,000
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive.

42
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
E: Ooh.

43
0:01:31.76,000 --> 0:01:35,000
SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne.

44
0:01:35.996,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship?

45
0:01:38.51,000 --> 0:01:38,000
E: [Spaceship noise]

46
0:01:39.38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser?

47
0:01:41.06,000 --> 0:01:42,000
E: [Laser noise]

48
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
(Laughter)

49
0:01:46.389,000 --> 0:01:48,000
SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein.

50
0:01:48.88,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know,

51
0:01:52.71,000 --> 0:01:54,000
working in caves and travelling through space --

52
0:01:54.89,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it's all very dangerous jobs.

53
0:01:56.708,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It would be very dangerous if you fell down.

54
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat]

55
0:02:01.85,000 --> 0:02:01,000
SW: Yeah.

56
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Little splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt?

58
0:02:06.13,000 --> 0:02:06,000
E: Ow, ow, ow.

59
0:02:06.94,000 --> 0:02:08,000
SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work.

60
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
E: [Squawks]

61
0:02:10.01,000 --> 0:02:12,000
SW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated.

62
0:02:12.421,000 --> 0:02:12,000
E: [Squawks]

63
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
SW: Yeah, it sure can.

64
0:02:14.62,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But when Einstein needs to relax from her job educating the public

65
0:02:17.667,000 --> 0:02:18,000
she loves to take in the arts.

66
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner,

67
0:02:22.8,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance.

68
0:02:26.01,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Can you get down?

69
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter)

70
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now.

71
0:02:30.63,000 --> 0:02:31,000
She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.

72
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

73
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
SW: Do your head now.

74
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

75
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

76
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias on her violin,

77
0:02:45.02,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and Einstein can sing along with some opera?

78
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
E: [Operatic squawk]

79
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
SW: Very good.

80
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

81
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?

82
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Einstein, can you also sing?

83
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?

84
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
E: La, la.

85
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
SW: There you go.

86
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And, of course, if all else fails,

87
0:03:01.82,000 --> 0:03:03,000
she can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta.

88
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
E: [Squawks]

89
0:03:05.82,000 --> 0:03:06,000
SW: All right.

90
0:03:07.72,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier,

91
0:03:11.21,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem.

92
0:03:14.07,000 --> 0:03:14,000
E: What's the matter?

93
0:03:15.02,000 --> 0:03:17,000
SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember?

94
0:03:17.571,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You were saying that you were really embarrassed,

95
0:03:19.677,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because you're in love with a pirate?

96
0:03:21.68,000 --> 0:03:21,000
E: Yar.

97
0:03:22.67,000 --> 0:03:25,000
SW: There we go. And what do pirates like to drink?

98
0:03:25.83,000 --> 0:03:25,000
E: Beer.

99
0:03:26.72,000 --> 0:03:27,000
SW: Yeah, that's right.

100
0:03:27.798,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.

101
0:03:29.65,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You like to drink water.

102
0:03:30.86,000 --> 0:03:31,000
E: [Water sound]

103
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:33,000
SW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous.

104
0:03:34.75,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here,

105
0:03:37.74,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and she's pretty nervous to meet him.

106
0:03:39.48,000 --> 0:03:42,000
She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.

107
0:03:43.13,000 --> 0:03:44,000
What do you say to a good-looking man?

108
0:03:44.51,000 --> 0:03:45,000
E: Hey, baby.

109
0:03:45.51,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

110
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee.

111
0:03:49.794,000 --> 0:03:5,000
E: Yee haw.

112
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

113
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
SW: And since she's such a big fan,

114
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March.

115
0:03:56.66,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And we didn't think he'd be in town then,

116
0:03:58.47,000 --> 0:04:,000
so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.

117
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.

118
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?

119
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
E: Happy birthday to you.

120
0:04:08.766,000 --> 0:04:09,000
SW: Again.

121
0:04:10.06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
E: Happy birthday to you.

122
0:04:11.79,000 --> 0:04:11,000
SW: Again.

123
0:04:12.73,000 --> 0:04:14,000
E: Happy birthday to you.

124
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
SW: Big finish.

125
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
E: Happy birthday to you.

126
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
SW: Good job!

127
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Applause)

128
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out

129
0:04:29.61,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo.

130
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?

131
0:04:34.581,000 --> 0:04:34,000
E: Woo, woo, woo.

132
0:04:35.57,000 --> 0:04:36,000
SW: What about the other birds?

133
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
E: Tweet, tweet, tweet.

134
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
SW: And the penguin?

135
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
E: Quack, quack, quack.

136
0:04:39.98,000 --> 0:04:4,000
SW: There we go.

137
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

138
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?

139
0:04:44.44,000 --> 0:04:45,000
E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah.

140
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
SW: Very good.

141
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Laughter)

142
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
What about a wolf?

143
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
E: Ooooowww.

144
0:04:49.89,000 --> 0:04:49,000
SW: And a pig?

145
0:04:50.81,000 --> 0:04:51,000
E: Oink, oink, oink.

146
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
SW: And the rooster?

147
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
E: Cock-a-doodle-doo!

148
0:04:54.71,000 --> 0:04:55,000
SW: And how about those cats?

149
0:04:56.53,000 --> 0:04:56,000
E: Meow.

150
0:04:57.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

151
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle.

152
0:05:00.655,000 --> 0:05:,000
E: Grrrrr.

153
0:05:01.593,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

154
0:05:03.59,000 --> 0:05:04,000
SW: What about a skunk?

155
0:05:04.66,000 --> 0:05:05,000
E: Stinker.

156
0:05:05.71,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

157
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous?

158
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
E: Superstar.

159
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.

160
0:05:13.36,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

161
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Well, we would like to encourage all of you

162
0:05:16.72,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends,

163
0:05:20.84,000 --> 0:05:22,000

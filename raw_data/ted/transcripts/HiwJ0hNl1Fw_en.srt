1
0:00:13.142,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I once said,

2
0:00:14.849,000 --> 0:00:16,000
"If you want to liberate a society,

3
0:00:17.507,000 --> 0:00:19,000
all you need is the Internet."

4
0:00:20.261,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was wrong.

5
0:00:22.121,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I said those words back in 2011,

6
0:00:24.725,000 --> 0:00:26,000
when a Facebook page I anonymously created

7
0:00:27.671,000 --> 0:00:29,000
helped spark the Egyptian revolution.

8
0:00:30.724,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The Arab Spring revealed social media's greatest potential,

9
0:00:35.328,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but it also exposed its greatest shortcomings.

10
0:00:40.003,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The same tool that united us to topple dictators

11
0:00:45.055,000 --> 0:00:47,000
eventually tore us apart.

12
0:00:48.229,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I would like to share my own experience in using social media for activism,

13
0:00:53.148,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and talk about some of the challenges I have personally faced

14
0:00:56.703,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and what we could do about them.

15
0:00:59.818,000 --> 0:01:,000
In the early 2000s,

16
0:01:02.334,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Arabs were flooding the web.

17
0:01:05.619,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Thirsty for knowledge, for opportunities,

18
0:01:08.604,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for connecting with the rest of the people around the globe,

19
0:01:12.34,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we escaped our frustrating political realities

20
0:01:16.735,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and lived a virtual, alternative life.

21
0:01:21.684,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Just like many of them, I was completely apolitical until 2009.

22
0:01:26.835,000 --> 0:01:29,000
At the time, when I logged into social media,

23
0:01:30.368,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I started seeing more and more Egyptians

24
0:01:32.912,000 --> 0:01:34,000
aspiring for political change in the country.

25
0:01:36.244,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It felt like I was not alone.

26
0:01:40.577,000 --> 0:01:41,000
In June 2010,

27
0:01:42.308,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Internet changed my life forever.

28
0:01:47.055,000 --> 0:01:49,000
While browsing Facebook,

29
0:01:50.263,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I saw a photo, a terrifying photo, of a tortured, dead body

30
0:01:55.493,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of a young Egyptian guy.

31
0:01:57.891,000 --> 0:01:59,000
His name was Khaled Said.

32
0:02:01.08,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Khaled was a 29-year-old Alexandrian who was killed by police.

33
0:02:07.099,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I saw myself in his picture.

34
0:02:09.924,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I thought, "I could be Khaled."

35
0:02:12.853,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I could not sleep that night, and I decided to do something.

36
0:02:17.542,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I anonymously created a Facebook page

37
0:02:20.067,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and called it "We are all Khaled Said."

38
0:02:24.645,000 --> 0:02:28,000
In just three days, the page had over 100,000 people,

39
0:02:29.294,000 --> 0:02:32,000
fellow Egyptians who shared the same concern.

40
0:02:33.39,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Whatever was happening had to stop.

41
0:02:36.631,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I recruited my co-admin, AbdelRahman Mansour.

42
0:02:40.059,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We worked together for hours and hours.

43
0:02:42.956,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We were crowdsourcing ideas from the people.

44
0:02:45.908,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We were engaging them.

45
0:02:47.376,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We were calling collectively for actions,

46
0:02:49.964,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and sharing news that the regime did not want Egyptians to know.

47
0:02:54.733,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The page became the most followed page

48
0:02:57.721,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in the Arab world.

49
0:02:59.148,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It had more fans than established media organizations

50
0:03:03.526,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and even top celebrities.

51
0:03:06.468,000 --> 0:03:08,000
On January 14, 2011,

52
0:03:09.555,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Ben Ali fled out of Tunisia

53
0:03:12.112,000 --> 0:03:14,000
after mounting protests against his regime.

54
0:03:15.589,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I saw a spark of hope.

55
0:03:18.144,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Egyptians on social media were wondering,

56
0:03:21.35,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"If Tunisia did it, why can't we?"

57
0:03:24.715,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I posted an event on Facebook and called it

58
0:03:26.931,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"A Revolution against Corruption, Injustice and Dictatorship."

59
0:03:32.635,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I posed a question to the 300,000 users of the page at the time:

60
0:03:37.685,000 --> 0:03:39,000
"Today is the 14th of January.

61
0:03:40.969,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The 25th of January is Police Day.

62
0:03:44.58,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's a national holiday.

63
0:03:46.283,000 --> 0:03:49,000
If 100,000 of us take to the streets of Cairo,

64
0:03:50.251,000 --> 0:03:51,000
no one is going to stop us.

65
0:03:52.03,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I wonder if we could do it."

66
0:03:54.797,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In just a few days, the invitation reached over a million people,

67
0:03:59.303,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and over 100,000 people confirmed attendance.

68
0:04:03.562,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Social media was crucial for this campaign.

69
0:04:06.329,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It helped a decentralized movement arise.

70
0:04:09.999,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It made people realize that they were not alone.

71
0:04:12.927,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And it made it impossible for the regime to stop it.

72
0:04:16.259,000 --> 0:04:18,000
At the time, they didn't even understand it.

73
0:04:19.656,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And on January 25th, Egyptians flooded the streets of Cairo and other cities,

74
0:04:25.913,000 --> 0:04:26,000
calling for change,

75
0:04:27.911,000 --> 0:04:29,000
breaking the barrier of fear

76
0:04:30.23,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and announcing a new era.

77
0:04:33.947,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Then came the consequences.

78
0:04:36.592,000 --> 0:04:4,000
A few hours before the regime cut off the Internet and telecommunications,

79
0:04:41.395,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was walking in a dark street in Cairo, around midnight.

80
0:04:46.075,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I had just tweeted, "Pray for Egypt.

81
0:04:49.423,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The government must be planning a massacre tomorrow."

82
0:04:53.587,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I was hit hard on my head.

83
0:04:56.589,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I lost my balance and fell down,

84
0:04:58.723,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to find four armed men surrounding me.

85
0:05:02.698,000 --> 0:05:05,000
One covered my mouth and the others paralyzed me.

86
0:05:06.711,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I knew I was being kidnapped by state security.

87
0:05:10.701,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I found myself in a cell,

88
0:05:14.259,000 --> 0:05:16,000
handcuffed, blindfolded.

89
0:05:17.027,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I was terrified.

90
0:05:18.615,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So was my family,

91
0:05:20.956,000 --> 0:05:21,000
who started looking for me

92
0:05:22.605,000 --> 0:05:24,000
in hospitals, police stations and even morgues.

93
0:05:26.569,000 --> 0:05:27,000
After my disappearance,

94
0:05:27.864,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a few of my fellow colleagues who knew I was the admin of the page

95
0:05:31.277,000 --> 0:05:35,000
told the media about my connection with that page,

96
0:05:35.5,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and that I was likely arrested by state security.

97
0:05:39.189,000 --> 0:05:43,000
My colleagues at Google started a search campaign trying to find me,

98
0:05:43.596,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and the fellow protesters in the square demanded my release.

99
0:05:48.088,000 --> 0:05:5,000
After 11 days of complete darkness,

100
0:05:50.564,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I was set free.

101
0:05:52.516,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And three days later,

102
0:05:54.152,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Mubarak was forced to step down.

103
0:05:57.505,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It was the most inspiring and empowering moment of my life.

104
0:06:02.633,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It was a time of great hope.

105
0:06:05.265,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Egyptians lived a utopia for 18 days during the revolution.

106
0:06:09.685,000 --> 0:06:1,000
They all shared the belief

107
0:06:11.581,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that we could actually live together despite our differences,

108
0:06:15.897,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that Egypt after Mubarak would be for all.

109
0:06:19.267,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But unfortunately,

110
0:06:20.538,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the post-revolution events were like a punch in the gut.

111
0:06:26.609,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The euphoria faded,

112
0:06:28.775,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we failed to build consensus,

113
0:06:31.84,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the political struggle led to intense polarization.

114
0:06:35.813,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Social media only amplified that state,

115
0:06:38.626,000 --> 0:06:41,000
by facilitating the spread of misinformation, rumors,

116
0:06:42.803,000 --> 0:06:44,000
echo chambers and hate speech.

117
0:06:45.189,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The environment was purely toxic.

118
0:06:48.265,000 --> 0:06:54,000
My online world became a battleground filled with trolls, lies, hate speech.

119
0:06:55.66,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I started to worry about the safety of my family.

120
0:06:59.655,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But of course, this wasn't just about me.

121
0:07:03.145,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The polarization reached its peak between the two main powers --

122
0:07:08.093,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the army supporters and the Islamists.

123
0:07:10.986,000 --> 0:07:12,000
People in the center, like me,

124
0:07:13.418,000 --> 0:07:14,000
started feeling helpless.

125
0:07:16.587,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Both groups wanted you to side with them;

126
0:07:19.111,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you were either with them or against them.

127
0:07:22.737,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And on the 3rd of July 2013,

128
0:07:24.663,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the army ousted Egypt's first democratically elected president,

129
0:07:29.194,000 --> 0:07:33,000
after three days of popular protest that demanded his resignation.

130
0:07:34.519,000 --> 0:07:36,000
That day I made a very hard decision.

131
0:07:37.688,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I decided to go silent, completely silent.

132
0:07:42.106,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It was a moment of defeat.

133
0:07:45.101,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I stayed silent for more than two years,

134
0:07:47.929,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and I used the time to reflect on everything that happened,

135
0:07:51.394,000 --> 0:07:53,000
trying to understand why did it happen.

136
0:07:54.773,000 --> 0:07:55,000
It became clear to me

137
0:07:56.242,000 --> 0:08:,000
that while it's true that polarization is primarily driven

138
0:08:01.187,000 --> 0:08:02,000
by our human behavior,

139
0:08:03.046,000 --> 0:08:07,000
social media shapes this behavior and magnifies its impact.

140
0:08:08.315,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Say you want to say something that is not based on a fact,

141
0:08:11.43,000 --> 0:08:13,000
pick a fight or ignore someone that you don't like.

142
0:08:14.914,000 --> 0:08:16,000
These are all natural human impulses,

143
0:08:17.645,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but because of technology,

144
0:08:19.824,000 --> 0:08:22,000
acting on these impulses is only one click away.

145
0:08:24.562,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In my view, there are five critical challenges

146
0:08:27.529,000 --> 0:08:29,000
facing today's social media.

147
0:08:30.794,000 --> 0:08:33,000
First, we don't know how to deal with rumors.

148
0:08:34.493,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Rumors that confirm people's biases

149
0:08:37.243,000 --> 0:08:41,000
are now believed and spread among millions of people.

150
0:08:42.59,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Second, we create our own echo chambers.

151
0:08:46.595,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We tend to only communicate with people that we agree with,

152
0:08:49.936,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and thanks to social media,

153
0:08:52.124,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we can mute, un-follow and block everybody else.

154
0:08:58.247,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Third, online discussions quickly descend into angry mobs.

155
0:09:03.571,000 --> 0:09:04,000
All of us probably know that.

156
0:09:05.833,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's as if we forget

157
0:09:07.651,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that the people behind screens are actually real people

158
0:09:10.935,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and not just avatars.

159
0:09:13.254,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And fourth, it became really hard to change our opinions.

160
0:09:18.309,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Because of the speed and brevity of social media,

161
0:09:21.617,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we are forced to jump to conclusions

162
0:09:24.575,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and write sharp opinions in 140 characters

163
0:09:27.663,000 --> 0:09:29,000
about complex world affairs.

164
0:09:30.402,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And once we do that, it lives forever on the Internet,

165
0:09:34.276,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and we are less motivated to change these views,

166
0:09:37.403,000 --> 0:09:39,000
even when new evidence arises.

167
0:09:40.033,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Fifth -- and in my point of view, this is the most critical --

168
0:09:44.246,000 --> 0:09:48,000
today, our social media experiences are designed in a way

169
0:09:48.574,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that favors broadcasting over engagements,

170
0:09:51.535,000 --> 0:09:53,000
posts over discussions,

171
0:09:54.586,000 --> 0:09:56,000
shallow comments over deep conversations.

172
0:09:57.764,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's as if we agreed that we are here to talk at each other

173
0:10:01.838,000 --> 0:10:03,000
instead of talking with each other.

174
0:10:05.244,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I witnessed how these critical challenges contributed

175
0:10:07.704,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to an already polarized Egyptian society,

176
0:10:11.041,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but this is not just about Egypt.

177
0:10:13.601,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Polarization is on the rise in the whole world.

178
0:10:17.325,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We need to work hard on figuring out

179
0:10:19.923,000 --> 0:10:22,000
how technology could be part of the solution,

180
0:10:23.268,000 --> 0:10:25,000
rather than part of the problem.

181
0:10:27.072,000 --> 0:10:3,000
There's a lot of debate today on how to combat online harassment

182
0:10:30.436,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and fight trolls.

183
0:10:31.992,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This is so important.

184
0:10:33.818,000 --> 0:10:34,000
No one could argue against that.

185
0:10:36.251,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But we need to also think about how to design social media experiences

186
0:10:41.492,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that promote civility and reward thoughtfulness.

187
0:10:45.512,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I know for a fact

188
0:10:46.906,000 --> 0:10:49,000
if I write a post that is more sensational,

189
0:10:50.146,000 --> 0:10:53,000
more one-sided, sometimes angry and aggressive,

190
0:10:53.681,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I get to have more people see that post.

191
0:10:56.791,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I will get more attention.

192
0:10:59.726,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But what if we put more focus on quality?

193
0:11:03.149,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What is more important:

194
0:11:04.398,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the total number of readers of a post you write,

195
0:11:07.075,000 --> 0:11:11,000
or who are the people who have impact that read what you write?

196
0:11:12.846,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Couldn't we just give people more incentives to engage in conversations,

197
0:11:17.236,000 --> 0:11:19,000
rather than just broadcasting opinions all the time?

198
0:11:20.788,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Or reward people for reading

199
0:11:22.21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and responding to views that they disagree with?

200
0:11:26.082,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And also, make it socially acceptable that we change our minds,

201
0:11:30.819,000 --> 0:11:31,000
or probably even reward that?

202
0:11:33.343,000 --> 0:11:37,000
What if we have a matrix that says how many people changed their minds,

203
0:11:37.516,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and that becomes part of our social media experience?

204
0:11:41.206,000 --> 0:11:44,000
If I could track how many people are changing their minds,

205
0:11:44.307,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I'd probably write more thoughtfully, trying to do that,

206
0:11:48.032,000 --> 0:11:51,000
rather than appealing to the people who already agree with me

207
0:11:51.761,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and "liking" because I just confirmed their biases.

208
0:11:55.512,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We also need to think about effective crowdsourcing mechanisms,

209
0:11:59.192,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to fact-check widely spread online information,

210
0:12:02.941,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and reward people who take part in that.

211
0:12:05.924,000 --> 0:12:09,000
In essence, we need to rethink today's social media ecosystem

212
0:12:10.885,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and redesign its experiences

213
0:12:13.164,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to reward thoughtfulness, civility and mutual understanding.

214
0:12:17.585,000 --> 0:12:2,000
As a believer in the Internet, I teamed up with a few friends,

215
0:12:20.867,000 --> 0:12:21,000
started a new project,

216
0:12:22.374,000 --> 0:12:25,000
trying to find answers and explore possibilities.

217
0:12:26.63,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Our first product is a new media platform for conversations.

218
0:12:30.977,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We're hosting conversations that promote mutual understanding

219
0:12:34.263,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and hopefully change minds.

220
0:12:36.348,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We don't claim to have the answers,

221
0:12:38.779,000 --> 0:12:41,000
but we started experimenting with different discussions

222
0:12:42.168,000 --> 0:12:44,000
about very divisive issues,

223
0:12:44.255,000 --> 0:12:48,000
such as race, gun control, the refugee debate,

224
0:12:48.426,000 --> 0:12:5,000
relationship between Islam and terrorism.

225
0:12:51.217,000 --> 0:12:53,000
These are conversations that matter.

226
0:12:54.779,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Today, at least one out of three people on the planet

227
0:12:59.81,000 --> 0:13:,000
have access to the Internet.

228
0:13:02.226,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But part of this Internet is being held captive

229
0:13:06.05,000 --> 0:13:09,000
by the less noble aspects of our human behavior.

230
0:13:10.774,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Five years ago, I said,

231
0:13:13.148,000 --> 0:13:15,000
"If you want to liberate society,

232
0:13:16.943,000 --> 0:13:17,000
all you need is the Internet."

233
0:13:19.207,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Today, I believe if we want to liberate society,

234
0:13:24.266,000 --> 0:13:26,000
we first need to liberate the Internet.

235
0:13:27.193,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Thank you very much.

236
0:13:28.385,000 --> 0:13:32,000

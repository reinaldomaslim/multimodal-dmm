1
0:00:12.929,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I am multidisciplinary.

2
0:00:14.816,000 --> 0:00:18,000
As a scientist, I've been a crew commander for a NASA Mars simulation last year,

3
0:00:19.799,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and as an artist, I create multicultural community art all over the planet.

4
0:00:26.718,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And recently, I've actually been combining both.

5
0:00:29.622,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But let me first talk a little more about that NASA mission.

6
0:00:33.337,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is the HI-SEAS program.

7
0:00:35.24,000 --> 0:00:38,000
HI-SEAS is a NASA-funded planetary surface analogue

8
0:00:38.936,000 --> 0:00:4,000
on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii,

9
0:00:41.664,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and it's a research program that is specifically designed

10
0:00:44.69,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to study the effects of long-term isolation of small crews.

11
0:00:49.729,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six,

12
0:00:53.601,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a very interesting experience, of course.

13
0:00:56.386,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We did all kinds of research.

14
0:00:59.469,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Our main research was actually a food study,

15
0:01:01.821,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but apart from that food study --

16
0:01:03.7,000 --> 0:01:06,000
developing a new food system for astronauts living in deep space --

17
0:01:07.488,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we also did all kinds of other research.

18
0:01:09.621,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We did extra-vehicular activities, as you can see here,

19
0:01:12.942,000 --> 0:01:14,000
wearing mock-up space suits,

20
0:01:14.986,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but we also had our chores and lots of other stuff to do,

21
0:01:17.655,000 --> 0:01:19,000
like questionnaires at the end of every day.

22
0:01:19.907,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Busy, busy work.

23
0:01:21.7,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now, as you can imagine,

24
0:01:23.752,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it's quite challenging to live with just a small group of people

25
0:01:26.804,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in a small space for a long time.

26
0:01:28.987,000 --> 0:01:3,000
There's all kinds of psychological challenges:

27
0:01:31.216,000 --> 0:01:34,000
how to keep a team together in these circumstances;

28
0:01:35.092,000 --> 0:01:37,000
how to deal with the warping of time you start to sense

29
0:01:37.822,000 --> 0:01:39,000
when you're living in these circumstances;

30
0:01:40.015,000 --> 0:01:41,000
sleep problems that arise; etc.

31
0:01:41.949,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But also we learned a lot.

32
0:01:44.033,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I learned a lot about how individual crew members

33
0:01:46.749,000 --> 0:01:48,000
actually cope with a situation like this;

34
0:01:49.419,000 --> 0:01:52,000
how you can keep a crew productive and happy,

35
0:01:52.926,000 --> 0:01:54,000
for example, giving them a good deal of autonomy

36
0:01:55.526,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is a good trick to do that;

37
0:01:57.058,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and honestly, I learned a lot about leadership,

38
0:02:00.047,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because I was a crew commander.

39
0:02:01.935,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So doing this mission,

40
0:02:03.839,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I really started thinking more deeply about our future in outer space.

41
0:02:08.725,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We will venture into outer space, and we will start inhabiting outer space.

42
0:02:12.394,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I have no doubt about it.

43
0:02:14.159,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It might take 50 years or it might take 500 years,

44
0:02:17.744,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but it's going to happen nevertheless.

45
0:02:20.443,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So I came up with a new art project called Seeker.

46
0:02:24.434,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And the Seeker project is actually challenging communities all over the world

47
0:02:28.355,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to come up with starship prototypes

48
0:02:31.209,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that re-envision human habitation and survival.

49
0:02:34.513,000 --> 0:02:35,000
That's the core of the project.

50
0:02:36.382,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, one important thing:

51
0:02:38.739,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is not a dystopian project.

52
0:02:41.244,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is not about, "Oh my God, the world is going wrong

53
0:02:43.956,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and we have to escape because we need another future somewhere else."

54
0:02:47.218,000 --> 0:02:48,000
No, no.

55
0:02:49.029,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The project is basically inviting people

56
0:02:51.696,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to take a step away from earthbound constraints

57
0:02:54.661,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and, as such, reimagine our future.

58
0:02:57.319,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And it's really helpful, and it works really well,

59
0:03:00.003,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so that's really the important part of what we're doing.

60
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, in this project, I'm using a cocreation approach,

61
0:03:08.988,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which is a slightly different approach

62
0:03:11.078,000 --> 0:03:13,000
from what you would expect from many artists.

63
0:03:13.58,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I'm essentially dropping a basic idea into a group, into a community,

64
0:03:17.963,000 --> 0:03:19,000
people start gravitating to the idea,

65
0:03:20.491,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and together, we shape and build the artwork.

66
0:03:23.851,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's a little bit like termites, really.

67
0:03:26.018,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We just work together,

68
0:03:27.308,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and even, for example, when architects visit what we're doing,

69
0:03:30.264,000 --> 0:03:32,000
sometimes they have a bit of a hard time understanding

70
0:03:32.849,000 --> 0:03:33,000
how we build without a master plan.

71
0:03:34.527,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We always come up with these fantastic large-scale scupltures

72
0:03:37.986,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that actually we can also inhabit.

73
0:03:41.678,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The first version was done in Belgium and Holland.

74
0:03:45.022,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It was built with a team of almost 50 people.

75
0:03:47.924,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This is the second iteration of that same project,

76
0:03:50.785,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but in Slovenia, in a different country,

77
0:03:52.745,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the new group was like, we're going to do the architecture differently.

78
0:03:56.987,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So they took away the architecture, they kept the base of the artwork,

79
0:04:00.291,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and they built an entirely new,

80
0:04:02.343,000 --> 0:04:04,000
much more biomorphic architecture on top of that.

81
0:04:05.014,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that's another crucial part of the project.

82
0:04:07.429,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's an evolving artwork, evolving architecture.

83
0:04:11.31,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This was the last version that was just presented a few weeks ago in Holland,

84
0:04:15.137,000 --> 0:04:19,000
which was using caravans as modules to build a starship.

85
0:04:19.282,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We bought some second-hand caravans,

86
0:04:21.308,000 --> 0:04:22,000
cut them open,

87
0:04:22.605,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and reassembled them into a starship.

88
0:04:25.342,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now, when we're thinking about starships,

89
0:04:28.249,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we're not just approaching it as a technological challenge.

90
0:04:31.287,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We're really looking at it as a combination of three systems:

91
0:04:34.215,000 --> 0:04:36,000
ecology, people and technology.

92
0:04:36.596,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So there's always a strong ecological component in the project.

93
0:04:40.154,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Here you can see aquaponic systems

94
0:04:42.523,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that are actually surrounding the astronauts,

95
0:04:44.727,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so they're constantly in contact with part of the food that they're eating.

96
0:04:50.659,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, a very typical thing for this project

97
0:04:53.695,000 --> 0:05:,000
is that we run our own isolation missions inside these art and design projects.

98
0:05:00.773,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We actually lock ourselves up for multiple days on end,

99
0:05:03.747,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and test what we build.

100
0:05:05.447,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And this is, for example,

101
0:05:06.875,000 --> 0:05:08,000
on the right hand side you can see an isolation mission

102
0:05:09.489,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in the Museum of Modern Art in Ljubljana in Slovenia,

103
0:05:12.407,000 --> 0:05:14,000
where six artists and designers locked themselves up --

104
0:05:15.025,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I was part of that --

105
0:05:16.935,000 --> 0:05:18,000
for four days inside the museum.

106
0:05:19.173,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And, of course, obviously, this is a very performative

107
0:05:21.928,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and very strong experience for all of us.

108
0:05:26.13,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, the next version of the project is currently being developed

109
0:05:30.549,000 --> 0:05:33,000
together with Camilo Rodriguez-Beltran, who is also a TED Fellow,

110
0:05:34.512,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in the Atacama Desert in Chile, a magical place.

111
0:05:38.788,000 --> 0:05:41,000
First of all, it's really considered a Mars analogue.

112
0:05:41.896,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It really does look like Mars in certain locations

113
0:05:44.59,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and has been used by NASA to test equipment.

114
0:05:48.119,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And it has a long history of being connected to space

115
0:05:51.222,000 --> 0:05:53,000
through observations of the stars.

116
0:05:53.977,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's now home to ALMA,

117
0:05:55.645,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the large telescope that's being developed there.

118
0:05:59.183,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But also, it's the driest location on the planet,

119
0:06:03.143,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and that makes it extremely interesting to build our project,

120
0:06:06.144,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because suddenly, sustainability is something we have to explore fully.

121
0:06:11.829,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We have no other option,

122
0:06:13.661,000 --> 0:06:15,000
so I'm very curious to see what's going to happen.

123
0:06:16.074,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, a specific thing for this particular version of the project

124
0:06:20.231,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is that I'm very interested to see

125
0:06:22.413,000 --> 0:06:24,000
how we can connect with the local population,

126
0:06:24.569,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the native population.

127
0:06:25.802,000 --> 0:06:27,000
These people have been living there for a very long time

128
0:06:28.544,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and can be considered experts in sustainability,

129
0:06:31.516,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and so I'm very interested to see what we can learn from them,

130
0:06:34.487,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration.

131
0:06:38.719,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So we're trying to redefine how we look at our future in outer space

132
0:06:43.598,000 --> 0:06:47,000
by exploring integration, biology, technology and people;

133
0:06:48.002,000 --> 0:06:5,000
by using a cocreation approach;

134
0:06:50.652,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and by using and exploring local traditions

135
0:06:54.099,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and to see how we can learn from the past and integrate that into our deep future.

136
0:06:58.528,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Thank you.

137
0:07:00.321,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Applause)

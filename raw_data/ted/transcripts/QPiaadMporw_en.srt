I'm gonna talk a little bit about open-source security,

3
0:00:20.602,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because we've got to get better at security

4
0:00:22.626,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in this 21st century.

5
0:00:24.646,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Let me start by saying, let's look back to the 20th century,

6
0:00:29.333,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and kind of get a sense of how that style of security

7
0:00:33.002,000 --> 0:00:34,000
worked for us.

8
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:37,000
This is Verdun, a battlefield in France

9
0:00:37.772,000 --> 0:00:4,000
just north of the NATO headquarters in Belgium.

10
0:00:41.089,000 --> 0:00:47,000
At Verdun, in 1916, over a 300-day period,

11
0:00:47.705,000 --> 0:00:5,000
700,000 people were killed,

12
0:00:50.833,000 --> 0:00:52,000
so about 2,000 a day.

13
0:00:52.892,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If you roll it forward -- 20th-century security --

14
0:00:57.22,000 --> 0:00:59,000
into the Second World War,

15
0:01:00.123,000 --> 0:01:02,000
you see the Battle of Stalingrad,

16
0:01:02.605,000 --> 0:01:05,000
300 days, 2 million people killed.

17
0:01:06.173,000 --> 0:01:08,000
We go into the Cold War, and we continue

18
0:01:08.959,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to try and build walls.

19
0:01:11.738,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We go from the trench warfare of the First World War

20
0:01:15.79,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to the Maginot Line of the Second World War,

21
0:01:19.369,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and then we go into the Cold War,

22
0:01:21.798,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the Iron Curtain, the Berlin Wall.

23
0:01:24.736,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Walls don't work.

24
0:01:26.963,000 --> 0:01:3,000
My thesis for us today is, instead of building walls

25
0:01:31.295,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to create security, we need to build bridges.

26
0:01:34.951,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This is a famous bridge in Europe.

27
0:01:37.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

28
0:01:39.497,000 --> 0:01:41,000
It's the bridge over the Drina River,

29
0:01:41.736,000 --> 0:01:43,000

1
0:00:13.269,000 --> 0:00:14,000
About two years ago,

2
0:00:14.477,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I got a phone call that changed my life.

3
0:00:17.687,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"Hey, this is your cousin Hassen."

4
0:00:21.482,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I froze.

5
0:00:23.101,000 --> 0:00:26,000
You see, I have well over 30 first cousins,

6
0:00:26.231,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but I didn't know anybody named Hassen.

7
0:00:29.712,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It turned out that Hassen was actually my mom's cousin

8
0:00:32.371,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and had just arrived in Montreal as a refugee.

9
0:00:35.422,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And over the next few months,

10
0:00:36.958,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I would have three more relatives coming to Canada to apply for asylum

11
0:00:40.315,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with little more than the clothes on their back.

12
0:00:43.64,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And in the two years since that phone call,

13
0:00:45.693,000 --> 0:00:46,000
my life has completely changed.

14
0:00:48.162,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I left academia

15
0:00:49.412,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and now lead a diverse team of technologists, researchers and refugees

16
0:00:53.862,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that is developing customized self-help resources for newcomers.

17
0:00:58.418,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We want to help them overcome language, cultural and other barriers

18
0:01:02.492,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that make them feel like they've lost control over their own lives.

19
0:01:06.07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And we feel that AI can help restore the rights and the dignity

20
0:01:09.258,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that many people lose when seeking help.

21
0:01:12.559,000 --> 0:01:14,000
My family's refugee experience is not unique.

22
0:01:16.384,000 --> 0:01:17,000
According to the UNHCR,

23
0:01:18.179,000 --> 0:01:21,000
every minute, 20 people are newly displaced

24
0:01:21.273,000 --> 0:01:23,000
by climate change, economic crisis

25
0:01:23.677,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and social and political instability.

26
0:01:26.441,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And it was while volunteering at a local YMCA shelter

27
0:01:29.257,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that my cousin Hassen and other relatives were sent to

28
0:01:32.251,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that we saw and learned to appreciate

29
0:01:34.589,000 --> 0:01:38,000
how much effort and coordination resettlement requires.

30
0:01:39.042,000 --> 0:01:42,000
When you first arrive, you need to find a lawyer

31
0:01:42.546,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and fill out legal documents within two weeks.

32
0:01:45.052,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You also need to schedule a medical exam with a pre-authorized physician,

33
0:01:49.108,000 --> 0:01:51,000
just so that you can apply for a work permit.

34
0:01:51.675,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And you need to start looking for a place to live

35
0:01:54.102,000 --> 0:01:56,000
before you receive any sort of social assistance.

36
0:01:58.719,000 --> 0:02:,000
With thousands fleeing the United States

37
0:02:00.857,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to seek asylum in Canada over the past few years,

38
0:02:03.22,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we quickly saw what it looks like

39
0:02:04.887,000 --> 0:02:08,000
when there are more people who need help than there are resources to help them.

40
0:02:09.004,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Social services doesn't scale quickly,

41
0:02:11.97,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and even if communities do their best

42
0:02:14.543,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to help more people with limited resources,

43
0:02:17.312,000 --> 0:02:19,000
newcomers end up spending more time waiting in limbo,

44
0:02:19.963,000 --> 0:02:2,000
not knowing where to turn.

45
0:02:22.457,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In Montreal, for example,

46
0:02:23.936,000 --> 0:02:26,000
despite millions of dollars being spent to support resettlement efforts,

47
0:02:27.668,000 --> 0:02:29,000
nearly 50 percent of newcomers still don't know

48
0:02:30.224,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that there are free resources that exist

49
0:02:32.55,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to help them with everything from filling out paperwork

50
0:02:35.167,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to finding a job.

51
0:02:37.292,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The challenge is not that this information doesn't exist.

52
0:02:41.064,000 --> 0:02:45,000
On the contrary, those in need are often bombarded with so much information

53
0:02:45.488,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that it's difficult to make sense of it all.

54
0:02:48.957,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"Don't give me more information, just tell me what to do,"

55
0:02:52.525,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was a sentiment we heard over and over again.

56
0:02:55.735,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And it reflects how insanely difficult it could be to get your bearings

57
0:02:59.464,000 --> 0:03:01,000
when you first arrive in a new country.

58
0:03:02.603,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Hell, I struggled with the same issues when I got to Montreal,

59
0:03:06.379,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and I have a PhD.

60
0:03:08.234,000 --> 0:03:09,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:10.068,000 --> 0:03:12,000
As another member of our team, himself also a refugee, put it:

62
0:03:14.001,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"In Canada, a SIM card is more important than food,

63
0:03:17.303,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because we will not die from hunger."

64
0:03:20.005,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But getting access to the right resources and information

65
0:03:23.315,000 --> 0:03:26,000
can be the difference between life and death.

66
0:03:27.465,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Let me say that again:

67
0:03:28.918,000 --> 0:03:31,000
getting access to the right resources and information

68
0:03:32.073,000 --> 0:03:35,000
can be the difference between life and death.

69
0:03:37.347,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In order to address these issues,

70
0:03:38.982,000 --> 0:03:39,000
we built Atar,

71
0:03:40.692,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the first-ever AI-powered virtual advocate

72
0:03:43.626,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that guides you step-by-step through your first week

73
0:03:46.264,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of arriving in a new city.

74
0:03:47.778,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Just tell Atar what you need help with.

75
0:03:50.747,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Atar will then ask you some basic questions

76
0:03:52.859,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to understand your unique circumstances

77
0:03:54.927,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and determine your eligibility for resources.

78
0:03:57.847,000 --> 0:03:59,000
For example: Do you have a place to stay tonight?

79
0:04:01.845,000 --> 0:04:03,000
If not, would you prefer an all-women's shelter?

80
0:04:05.232,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Do you have children?

81
0:04:07.442,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Atar will then generate a custom, step-by-step to-do list

82
0:04:10.608,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that tells you everything that you need to know,

83
0:04:12.921,000 --> 0:04:14,000
from where to go, how to get there,

84
0:04:15.67,000 --> 0:04:16,000
what to bring with you

85
0:04:16.896,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and what to expect.

86
0:04:18.924,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You can ask a question at any time,

87
0:04:21.335,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and if Atar doesn't have an answer,

88
0:04:23.052,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you'll be connected with a real person who does.

89
0:04:26.775,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But what's most exciting

90
0:04:29.077,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is that we help humanitarian and service organizations

91
0:04:32.176,000 --> 0:04:36,000
collect the data and the analytics that's necessary to understand

92
0:04:36.235,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the changing needs of newcomers

93
0:04:37.88,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in real time.

94
0:04:39.904,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That's a game changer.

95
0:04:42.282,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We've already partnered with the UNHCR

96
0:04:44.345,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to provide this technology in Canada,

97
0:04:46.239,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and in our work have conducted campaigns in Arabic, English,

98
0:04:50.072,000 --> 0:04:52,000
French, Creole and Spanish.

99
0:04:54.246,000 --> 0:04:56,000
When we talk about the issue of refugees,

100
0:04:57.201,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we often focus on the official statistic

101
0:04:59.242,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of 65.8 million forcibly displaced worldwide.

102
0:05:03.87,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But the reality is much greater than that.

103
0:05:07.193,000 --> 0:05:12,000
By 2050, there will be an additional 140 million people

104
0:05:12.375,000 --> 0:05:15,000
who are at risk of being displaced due to environmental degradation.

105
0:05:16.412,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And today -- that is today -- there are nearly one billion people

106
0:05:21.224,000 --> 0:05:24,000
who already live in illegal settlements and slums.

107
0:05:25.356,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Resettlement and integration

108
0:05:27.324,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is one of the greatest challenges of our time.

109
0:05:30.883,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and our hope is that Atar can provide every single newcomer an advocate.

110
0:05:36.212,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Our hope is that Atar can amplify existing efforts

111
0:05:40.507,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and alleviate pressure on a social safety net

112
0:05:43.189,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that's already stretched beyond imagination.

113
0:05:47.183,000 --> 0:05:49,000
But what's most important to us

114
0:05:49.653,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is that our work helps restore the rights and the dignity

115
0:05:54.281,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that refugees lose throughout resettlement and integration

116
0:05:57.856,000 --> 0:06:01,000
by giving them the resources that they need in order to help themselves.

117
0:06:02.197,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Thank you.

118
0:06:03.453,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

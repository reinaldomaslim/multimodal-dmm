1
0:00:12.865,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The youthful perspective on the future,

2
0:00:17.128,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the present perspective on the future

3
0:00:19.686,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and the future, mature perspective on the future --

4
0:00:24.8,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'd like to try and bring all those three tenses together

5
0:00:28.802,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in one identity tonight.

6
0:00:31.517,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And you could say that the poet, in many ways,

7
0:00:34.786,000 --> 0:00:37,000
looks at what I call "the conversational nature of reality."

8
0:00:39.156,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And you ask yourself:

9
0:00:40.882,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What is the conversational nature of reality?

10
0:00:43.706,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The conversational nature of reality is the fact

11
0:00:46.479,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that whatever you desire of the world --

12
0:00:50.29,000 --> 0:00:53,000
whatever you desire of your partner in a marriage or a love relationship,

13
0:00:54.101,000 --> 0:00:56,000
whatever you desire of your children,

14
0:00:56.132,000 --> 0:00:59,000
whatever you desire of the people who work for you or with you,

15
0:00:59.969,000 --> 0:01:,000
or your world --

16
0:01:01.341,000 --> 0:01:05,000
will not happen exactly as you would like it to happen.

17
0:01:06.831,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But equally,

18
0:01:08.612,000 --> 0:01:09,000
whatever the world desires of us --

19
0:01:10.359,000 --> 0:01:13,000
whatever our partner, our child, our colleague,

20
0:01:14.358,000 --> 0:01:15,000
our industry,

21
0:01:15.571,000 --> 0:01:17,000
our future demands of us,

22
0:01:18.282,000 --> 0:01:19,000
will also not happen.

23
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And what actually happens

24
0:01:21.977,000 --> 0:01:25,000
is this frontier between what you think is you

25
0:01:26.381,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and what you think is not you.

26
0:01:28.787,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And this frontier of actual meeting

27
0:01:31.402,000 --> 0:01:34,000
between what we call a self and what we call the world

28
0:01:34.52,000 --> 0:01:36,000
is the only place, actually, where things are real.

29
0:01:37.664,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But it's quite astonishing,

30
0:01:39.274,000 --> 0:01:43,000
how little time we spend at this conversational frontier,

31
0:01:43.757,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and not abstracted away from it in one strategy or another.

32
0:01:49.636,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I was coming through immigration,

33
0:01:54.401,000 --> 0:01:57,000
which is quite a dramatic border at the moment,

34
0:01:57.925,000 --> 0:01:59,000
into the US last year,

35
0:02:00.935,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and, you know, you get off an international flight

36
0:02:03.395,000 --> 0:02:04,000
across the Atlantic,

37
0:02:04.571,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and you're not in the best place;

38
0:02:06.29,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you're not at your most spiritually mature.

39
0:02:08.867,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You're quite impatient with the rest of humanity, in fact.

40
0:02:12.156,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So when you get up to immigration with your shirt collar out

41
0:02:16.555,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and a day's growth of beard,

42
0:02:18.068,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and you have very little patience,

43
0:02:21.431,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and the immigration officer looked at my passport

44
0:02:24.183,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?"

45
0:02:26.315,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I said, "I work with the conversational nature of reality."

46
0:02:31.481,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:36.964,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And he leaned forward over his podium

48
0:02:39.257,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and he said, "I needed you last night."

49
0:02:42.211,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:44.623,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Applause)

51
0:02:48.363,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And I said, "I'm sorry,

52
0:02:49.537,000 --> 0:02:52,000
my powers as a poet and philosopher only go so far.

53
0:02:52.644,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I'm not sure I can --"

54
0:02:53.881,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But before we knew it,

55
0:02:55.442,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we were into a conversation about his marriage.

56
0:02:58.896,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Here he was in his uniform,

57
0:03:00.593,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and the interesting thing was,

58
0:03:02.085,000 --> 0:03:04,000
he was looking up and down the row of officers

59
0:03:04.322,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to make sure his supervisor didn't see

60
0:03:07.375,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that we was having a real conversation.

61
0:03:11.228,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But all of us live at this conversational frontier

62
0:03:14.097,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with the future.

63
0:03:16.209,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I'd like to put you in the shoes of my Irish niece,

64
0:03:19.987,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Marlene McCormack,

65
0:03:21.762,000 --> 0:03:24,000
standing on a cliff edge on the western coast of Spain,

66
0:03:25.23,000 --> 0:03:27,000
overlooking the broad Atlantic.

67
0:03:27.261,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Twenty-three years old, she's just walked 500 miles

68
0:03:31.042,000 --> 0:03:34,000
from Saint Jean Pied de Port on the French side of the Pyrenees,

69
0:03:34.648,000 --> 0:03:35,000
all the way across Northern Spain,

70
0:03:36.449,000 --> 0:03:4,000
on this very famous, old and contemporary pilgrimage

71
0:03:40.484,000 --> 0:03:43,000
called the Camino de Santiago de Compostela --

72
0:03:44.043,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the Path to Santiago of Compostela.

73
0:03:47.593,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And when you get to Santiago, actually,

74
0:03:51.455,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it can be something of an anticlimax,

75
0:03:53.254,000 --> 0:03:55,000
because there are 100,000 people living there

76
0:03:55.6,000 --> 0:03:58,000
who are not necessarily applauding you as you're coming into town.

77
0:03:58.815,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And 10,000 of them are trying to sell you a memento of your journey.

79
0:04:04.719,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But you do have the possibility of going on for three more days

80
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to this place where Marlene stood, called, in Spanish, Finisterre,

81
0:04:16.749,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in English, Finisterre,

82
0:04:18.75,000 --> 0:04:21,000
from the Latin, meaning "the ends of the earth,"

83
0:04:22.191,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the place where ground turns to ocean;

84
0:04:25.262,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the place where your present turns into the future.

85
0:04:30.598,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And Marlene had walked this way --

86
0:04:32.28,000 --> 0:04:35,000
she just graduated as a 23-year-old from the University of Sligo

87
0:04:35.998,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with a degree in Irish drama.

88
0:04:38.399,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And she said to me, "I don't think the major corporations of the world

89
0:04:41.815,000 --> 0:04:42,000
will be knocking on my door."

90
0:04:43.244,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I said, "Listen, I've worked in corporations all over the world

91
0:04:46.34,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for decades;

92
0:04:47.517,000 --> 0:04:5,000
a degree in drama is what would most prepare you for the adult --

93
0:04:51.268,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:52.309,000 --> 0:04:53,000
corporate world."

95
0:04:53.488,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Applause)

96
0:04:55.74,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But she said, "I'm not interested in that, anyway.

97
0:04:58.135,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I don't want to teach drama, I want to become a dramatist.

98
0:05:01.782,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I want to write plays.

99
0:05:04.132,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I walked the Camino in order to give myself some courage,

100
0:05:08.647,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in order to walk into my future."

101
0:05:10.85,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I said, "What was the most powerful moment you had on the whole Camino,

102
0:05:14.52,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the very most powerful moment?"

103
0:05:16.088,000 --> 0:05:17,000
She said, "I had many powerful moments,

104
0:05:18.02,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but you know, the most powerful moment was post-Camino,

105
0:05:22.064,000 --> 0:05:26,000
was the three days you go on from Santiago and come to this cliff edge.

106
0:05:26.34,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And you go through three rituals.

107
0:05:27.98,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The first ritual is to eat a tapas plate of scallops" --

108
0:05:32.625,000 --> 0:05:33,000
or if you're vegetarian,

109
0:05:34.214,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to contemplate the scallop shell.

110
0:05:36.691,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:38.166,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Because the scallop shell has been the icon and badge of your walk,

112
0:05:42.478,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and every arrow that you have seen along that way

113
0:05:45.279,000 --> 0:05:49,000
has been pointing underneath a scallop shell.

114
0:05:49.368,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So really, this first ritual is saying:

115
0:05:51.477,000 --> 0:05:52,000
How did you get to this place?

116
0:05:53.409,000 --> 0:05:55,000
How did you follow the path to get here?

117
0:05:56.963,000 --> 0:06:01,000
How do you hold the conversation of life when you feel unbesieged,

118
0:06:02.109,000 --> 0:06:03,000
when you're unbullied,

119
0:06:03.291,000 --> 0:06:04,000
when you're left to yourself?

120
0:06:04.723,000 --> 0:06:08,000
How do you hold the conversation of life that brings you to this place?

121
0:06:10.217,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And the second ritual is that you burn something that you've brought.

122
0:06:15.168,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I said, "What did you burn, Marlene?"

123
0:06:17.634,000 --> 0:06:19,000
She said, "I burned a letter and two postcards."

124
0:06:20.639,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I said, "Astonishing.

125
0:06:21.836,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Twenty-three years old and you have paper.

126
0:06:23.904,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I can't believe it."

127
0:06:25.104,000 --> 0:06:26,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:26.438,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I'm sure there's a Camino app

129
0:06:28.113,000 --> 0:06:32,000
where you can just delete a traumatic text, you know?

130
0:06:32.545,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

131
0:06:34.101,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It will engage the flashlight,

132
0:06:36.141,000 --> 0:06:37,000
imbue it with color

133
0:06:37.797,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and disappear in a firework of flames.

134
0:06:42.157,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But you either bring a letter or you write one there,

135
0:06:45.364,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and you burn it.

136
0:06:46.561,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And of course we know intuitively what is on those letters and postcards.

137
0:06:50.929,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's a form of affection and love that is now no longer extant, yeah?

138
0:06:58.434,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And then the third ritual:

139
0:07:01.194,000 --> 0:07:05,000
between all these fires are large piles of clothes.

140
0:07:06.405,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And you leave an item of clothing

141
0:07:08.882,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that has helped you to get to this place.

142
0:07:12.179,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And I said to Marlene, "What did you leave at the cliff edge?"

143
0:07:15.167,000 --> 0:07:16,000
She said, "I left my boots --

144
0:07:16.616,000 --> 0:07:18,000
the very things that I walked in, actually.

145
0:07:18.791,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They were beautiful boots, I loved those boots,

146
0:07:21.29,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but they were finished after seven weeks of walking.

147
0:07:24.3,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So I walked away in my trainers,

148
0:07:25.849,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but I left my boots there."

149
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
She said, "It was really incredible.

150
0:07:29.533,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The most powerful moment was, the sun was going down,

151
0:07:33.473,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but the full moon was coming up behind me.

152
0:07:37.19,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And the full moon was illuminated by the dying sun in such a powerful way

153
0:07:42.63,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that even after the sun had dropped below the horizon,

154
0:07:45.332,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the moon could still see that sun.

155
0:07:49.657,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I had a moon shadow,

156
0:07:52.09,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I was looking at my moon shadow walking across the Atlantic,

157
0:07:57.232,000 --> 0:07:58,000
across this ocean.

158
0:07:59.614,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I thought,

159
0:08:00.789,000 --> 0:08:02,000
'Oh! That's my new self going into the future.'

160
0:08:03.939,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But suddenly I realized the sun was falling further.

161
0:08:09.418,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The moon was losing its reflection,

162
0:08:13.563,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and my shadow was disappearing.

163
0:08:15.851,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The most powerful moment I had on the whole Camino

164
0:08:18.987,000 --> 0:08:23,000
was when I realized I myself had to walk across that unknown sea

165
0:08:24.999,000 --> 0:08:25,000
into my future."

166
0:08:27.831,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Well, I was so taken by this story,

167
0:08:29.677,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I wrote this piece for her.

168
0:08:31.026,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We were driving at the time;

169
0:08:32.555,000 --> 0:08:33,000
we got home, I sat on the couch,

170
0:08:34.252,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I wrote until two in the morning --

171
0:08:36.053,000 --> 0:08:37,000
everyone had gone to bed --

172
0:08:37.471,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and I gave it to Marlene at breakfast time.

173
0:08:40.342,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's called, "Finisterre," for Marlene McCormack.

174
0:08:46.322,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"The road in the end

175
0:08:47.752,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the road in the end taking the path the sun had taken

176
0:08:52.508,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the road in the end taking the path the sun had taken

177
0:08:56.223,000 --> 0:08:58,000
into the western sea

178
0:08:58.641,000 --> 0:09:,000
the road in the end taking the path the sun had taken

179
0:09:01.63,000 --> 0:09:02,000
into the western sea

180
0:09:03.512,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and the moon

181
0:09:04.703,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the moon rising behind you

182
0:09:07.013,000 --> 0:09:11,000
as you stood where ground turned to ocean:

183
0:09:11.395,000 --> 0:09:12,000
no way to your future now

184
0:09:13.327,000 --> 0:09:14,000
no way to your future now

185
0:09:14.543,000 --> 0:09:16,000
except the way your shadow could take,

186
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
walking before you across water, going where shadows go,

187
0:09:20.667,000 --> 0:09:24,000
no way to make sense of a world that wouldn't let you pass

188
0:09:25.517,000 --> 0:09:28,000
except to call an end to the way you had come,

189
0:09:30.442,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to take out each letter you had brought

190
0:09:35.585,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and light their illumined corners;

191
0:09:38.074,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and to read them as they drifted on the late western light;

192
0:09:43.182,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to empty your bags

193
0:09:44.411,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to empty your bags;

194
0:09:45.988,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to sort this and to leave that

195
0:09:48.741,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to sort this and to leave that;

196
0:09:52.121,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to promise what you needed to promise all along

197
0:09:56.369,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to promise what you needed to promise all along,

198
0:09:59.229,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and to abandon the shoes that brought you here

199
0:10:03.937,000 --> 0:10:04,000
right at the water's edge,

200
0:10:05.81,000 --> 0:10:06,000
not because you had given up

201
0:10:07.395,000 --> 0:10:08,000
not because you had given up

202
0:10:09.04,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but because now,

203
0:10:10.905,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you would find a different way to tread,

204
0:10:13.112,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and because, through it all,

205
0:10:14.879,000 --> 0:10:16,000
part of you would still walk on,

206
0:10:17.304,000 --> 0:10:18,000
no matter how,

207
0:10:18.812,000 --> 0:10:19,000
over the waves."

208
0:10:22.511,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"Finisterre."

209
0:10:23.97,000 --> 0:10:24,000
For Marlene McCormack --

210
0:10:25.348,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Applause)

211
0:10:35.052,000 --> 0:10:37,000
who has already had her third play performed

212
0:10:37.861,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in off-off-off-off-Broadway --

213
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:42,000
in Dublin.

214
0:10:42.189,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:43.226,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But she's on her way.

216
0:10:45.46,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is the last piece.

217
0:10:47.389,000 --> 0:10:53,000
This is about the supposed arrival at the sum of all of our endeavors.

218
0:10:53.922,000 --> 0:10:54,000
In Santiago itself --

219
0:10:55.358,000 --> 0:10:56,000
it could be Santiago,

220
0:10:56.62,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it could be Mecca,

221
0:10:57.949,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it could be Varanasi,

222
0:10:59.141,000 --> 0:11:,000
it could be Kyoto,

223
0:11:00.727,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it could be that threshold you've set for yourself,

224
0:11:05.588,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the disturbing approach to the consummation of all your goals.

225
0:11:13.121,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And one of the difficulties about walking into your life,

226
0:11:17.705,000 --> 0:11:18,000
about coming into this body,

227
0:11:19.162,000 --> 0:11:21,000
into this world fully,

228
0:11:22.057,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is you start to realize

229
0:11:24.022,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that you have manufactured three abiding illusions

230
0:11:30.353,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that the rest of humanity has shared with you since the beginning of time.

231
0:11:34.399,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And the first illusion is that you can somehow construct a life

232
0:11:39.231,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in which you are not vulnerable.

233
0:11:42.655,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You can somehow be immune to all of the difficulties

234
0:11:47.495,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and ill health and losses

235
0:11:51.703,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that humanity has been subject to since the beginning of time.

236
0:11:56.075,000 --> 0:11:57,000
If we look out at the natural world,

237
0:11:57.815,000 --> 0:11:58,000
there's no part of that world

238
0:11:59.343,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that doesn't go through cycles of, first, incipience,

239
0:12:03.319,000 --> 0:12:04,000
or hiddenness,

240
0:12:04.545,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but then growth, fullness,

241
0:12:07.713,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but then a beautiful, to begin with, disappearance,

242
0:12:11.259,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and then a very austere, full disappearance.

243
0:12:14.306,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We look at that, we say, "That's beautiful,

244
0:12:16.437,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but can I just have the first half of the equation, please?

245
0:12:20.734,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And when the disappearance is happening,

246
0:12:22.753,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I'll close my eyes and wait for the new cycle to come around."

247
0:12:25.829,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Which means most human beings are at war with reality

248
0:12:29.845,000 --> 0:12:3,000
50 percent of the time.

249
0:12:32.804,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The mature identity

250
0:12:37.625,000 --> 0:12:4,000
is able to live in the full cycle.

251
0:12:40.883,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The second illusion is,

252
0:12:42.56,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I can construct a life in which I will not have my heart broken.

253
0:12:47.102,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Romance is the first place we start to do it.

254
0:12:49.774,000 --> 0:12:52,000
When you're at the beginning of a new romance or a new marriage,

255
0:12:53.222,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you say, "I have found the person who will not break my heart."

256
0:12:57.805,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I'm sorry;

257
0:12:59.174,000 --> 0:13:04,000
you have chosen them out unconsciously for that exact core competency.

258
0:13:04.596,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Laughter)

259
0:13:05.93,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They will break your heart.

260
0:13:07.291,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Why?

261
0:13:08.471,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Because you care about them.

262
0:13:10.105,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You look at parenting, yeah?

263
0:13:12.295,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Parenting: "I will be the perfect mother and father."

264
0:13:16.049,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Your children will break your heart.

265
0:13:18.386,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And they don't even have to do anything spectacular or dramatic.

266
0:13:23.077,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But usually, they do do something spectacular or dramatic --

267
0:13:27.01,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Laughter)

268
0:13:28.055,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to break your heart.

269
0:13:30.095,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And then they live with you as spies and saboteurs for years,

270
0:13:33.495,000 --> 0:13:35,000
watching your every psychological move,

271
0:13:36.357,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and spotting your every weakness.

272
0:13:39.079,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And one day,

273
0:13:40.269,000 --> 0:13:42,000
when they're about 14 years old,

274
0:13:42.421,000 --> 0:13:43,000
with your back turned to them,

275
0:13:43.915,000 --> 0:13:44,000
in the kitchen,

276
0:13:45.183,000 --> 0:13:47,000
while you're making something for them --

277
0:13:47.37,000 --> 0:13:48,000
(Laughter)

278
0:13:48.402,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the psychological stiletto goes in.

279
0:13:50.933,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Laughter)

280
0:13:53.992,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Applause)

281
0:13:58.682,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And you say, "How did you know exactly where to place it?"

282
0:14:02.776,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Laughter)

283
0:14:03.815,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And they say,

284
0:14:04.998,000 --> 0:14:05,000
"I've been watching you for --

285
0:14:06.547,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Laughter)

286
0:14:07.582,000 --> 0:14:08,000
a good few years."

287
0:14:11.667,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And then we hope that our armored, professional personalities

288
0:14:17.096,000 --> 0:14:2,000
will prevent us from having our heart broken in work.

289
0:14:20.865,000 --> 0:14:22,000
But if you're sincere about your work,

290
0:14:23.977,000 --> 0:14:24,000
it should break your heart.

291
0:14:26.173,000 --> 0:14:27,000
You should get to thresholds

292
0:14:27.985,000 --> 0:14:3,000
where you do not know how to proceed.

293
0:14:32.032,000 --> 0:14:35,000
You do not know how to get from here to there.

294
0:14:36.799,000 --> 0:14:37,000
What does that do?

295
0:14:37.987,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It puts you into a proper relationship with reality.

296
0:14:41.263,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Why?

297
0:14:42.437,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Because you have to ask for help.

298
0:14:50.959,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Heartbreak.

299
0:14:52.371,000 --> 0:14:54,000
We don't have a choice about heartbreak,

300
0:14:54.507,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we only have a choice of having our hearts broken

301
0:14:58.506,000 --> 0:15:03,000
over people and things and projects that we deeply care about.

302
0:15:05.404,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And the last illusion is,

303
0:15:07.496,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I can somehow plan enough and arrange things

304
0:15:11.957,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that I will be able to see the path to the end

305
0:15:15.596,000 --> 0:15:16,000
right from where I'm standing,

306
0:15:17.294,000 --> 0:15:18,000
right to the horizon.

307
0:15:20.221,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But when you think about it,

308
0:15:22.048,000 --> 0:15:25,000
the only environment in which that would be true

309
0:15:25.471,000 --> 0:15:27,000
would be a flat desert,

310
0:15:28.848,000 --> 0:15:3,000
empty of any other life.

311
0:15:33.061,000 --> 0:15:34,000
But even in a flat desert,

312
0:15:34.682,000 --> 0:15:37,000
the curvature of the earth would take the path away from you.

313
0:15:38.764,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So, no;

314
0:15:40.342,000 --> 0:15:41,000
you see the path,

315
0:15:41.981,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and then you don't

316
0:15:43.887,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and then you see it again.

317
0:15:45.846,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So this is "Santiago,"

318
0:15:48.868,000 --> 0:15:49,000
the supposed arrival,

319
0:15:51.405,000 --> 0:15:54,000
which is a kind of return to the beginning all at the same time.

320
0:15:55.788,000 --> 0:15:57,000
We have this experience of the journey,

321
0:15:58.158,000 --> 0:16:,000
which is in all of our great spiritual traditions,

322
0:16:00.888,000 --> 0:16:01,000
of pilgrimage.

323
0:16:02.065,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But just by actually standing in the ground of your life fully,

324
0:16:06.359,000 --> 0:16:1,000
not trying to abstract yourself into a strategic future

325
0:16:10.473,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that's actually just an escape from present heartbreak;

326
0:16:14.154,000 --> 0:16:16,000
the ability to stand in the ground of your life

327
0:16:16.987,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and to look at the horizon that is pulling you --

328
0:16:20.4,000 --> 0:16:21,000
in that moment,

329
0:16:21.742,000 --> 0:16:22,000
you are the whole journey.

330
0:16:23.244,000 --> 0:16:25,000
You are the whole conversation.

331
0:16:27.743,000 --> 0:16:28,000
"Santiago."

332
0:16:28.917,000 --> 0:16:3,000
"The road seen, then not seen

333
0:16:31.923,000 --> 0:16:34,000
the road seen, then not seen

334
0:16:36.02,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the hillside hiding then revealing the way you should take

335
0:16:40.778,000 --> 0:16:42,000
the road seen, then not seen

336
0:16:43.552,000 --> 0:16:48,000
the hillside hiding then revealing the way you should take,

337
0:16:48.652,000 --> 0:16:51,000
the road dropping away from you

338
0:16:52.326,000 --> 0:16:56,000
as if leaving you to walk on thin air,

339
0:16:57.1,000 --> 0:16:58,000
then catching you,

340
0:16:58.299,000 --> 0:16:59,000
catching you,

341
0:16:59.563,000 --> 0:17:01,000
holding you up, when you thought you would fall,

342
0:17:02.412,000 --> 0:17:03,000
catching you,

343
0:17:03.599,000 --> 0:17:05,000
holding you up, when you thought you would fall,

344
0:17:05.959,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and the way forward

345
0:17:07.529,000 --> 0:17:1,000
the way forward always in the end

346
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
the way that you came,

347
0:17:12.721,000 --> 0:17:13,000
the way forward always in the end

348
0:17:14.622,000 --> 0:17:15,000
the way that you came,

349
0:17:15.802,000 --> 0:17:18,000
the way that you followed, the way that carried you into your future,

350
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
that brought you to this place,

351
0:17:20.904,000 --> 0:17:22,000
that brought you to this place,

352
0:17:23.391,000 --> 0:17:28,000
no matter that it sometimes had to take your promise from you,

353
0:17:28.673,000 --> 0:17:33,000
no matter that it always had to break your heart along the way:

354
0:17:34.697,000 --> 0:17:35,000
the sense

355
0:17:35.902,000 --> 0:17:39,000
the sense of having walked from deep inside yourself

356
0:17:40.525,000 --> 0:17:42,000
out into the revelation,

357
0:17:43.482,000 --> 0:17:44,000
to have risked yourself

358
0:17:45.248,000 --> 0:17:5,000
for something that seemed to stand both inside you and far beyond you,

359
0:17:51.242,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and that called you back in the end

360
0:17:53.763,000 --> 0:17:55,000
to the only road you could follow,

361
0:17:56.427,000 --> 0:18:,000
walking as you did, in your rags of love

362
0:18:00.804,000 --> 0:18:02,000
walking as you did, in your rags of love

363
0:18:03.72,000 --> 0:18:09,000
and speaking in the voice that by night became a prayer for safe arrival,

364
0:18:10.665,000 --> 0:18:11,000
so that one day

365
0:18:12.416,000 --> 0:18:14,000
one day you realized

366
0:18:14.557,000 --> 0:18:17,000
that what you wanted had actually already happened

367
0:18:18.064,000 --> 0:18:19,000
one day you realized

368
0:18:20.04,000 --> 0:18:22,000
that what you wanted had actually already happened

369
0:18:22.421,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and long ago

370
0:18:23.596,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and in the dwelling place in which you lived before you began,

371
0:18:27.597,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and that

372
0:18:28.777,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and that every step along the way,

373
0:18:31.417,000 --> 0:18:32,000
every step along the way,

374
0:18:33.088,000 --> 0:18:36,000
you had carried the heart and the mind and the promise

375
0:18:36.939,000 --> 0:18:38,000
that first set you off and then drew you on,

376
0:18:39.85,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and that

377
0:18:41.037,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and that you were more marvelous

378
0:18:45.934,000 --> 0:18:47,000
in your simple wish to find a way

379
0:18:48.222,000 --> 0:18:51,000
you were more marvelous in your simple wish to find a way

380
0:18:52.223,000 --> 0:18:56,000
than the gilded roofs of any destination you could reach

381
0:18:56.484,000 --> 0:18:59,000
you were more marvelous in that simple wish to find a way

382
0:19:00.245,000 --> 0:19:02,000
than the gilded roofs of any destination you could reach:

383
0:19:03.175,000 --> 0:19:04,000
as if, all along,

384
0:19:04.376,000 --> 0:19:07,000
you had thought the end point might be a city with golden domes,

385
0:19:07.493,000 --> 0:19:08,000
and cheering crowds,

386
0:19:08.972,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and turning the corner

387
0:19:10.943,000 --> 0:19:14,000
at what you thought was the end of the road,

388
0:19:15.314,000 --> 0:19:18,000
you found just a simple reflection,

389
0:19:19.395,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and a clear revelation beneath the face looking back

390
0:19:22.996,000 --> 0:19:26,000
and beneath it another invitation,

391
0:19:27.348,000 --> 0:19:29,000
all in one glimpse

392
0:19:29.771,000 --> 0:19:3,000
all in one glimpse:

393
0:19:31.442,000 --> 0:19:32,000
like a person

394
0:19:33.729,000 --> 0:19:36,000
like a person or a place you had sought forever

395
0:19:37.17,000 --> 0:19:4,000
like a person or a place you had sought forever,

396
0:19:40.681,000 --> 0:19:44,000
like a bold field of freedom that beckoned you beyond;

397
0:19:45.032,000 --> 0:19:46,000
like another life

398
0:19:46.413,000 --> 0:19:47,000
like another life,

399
0:19:48.222,000 --> 0:19:49,000
and the road

400
0:19:49.513,000 --> 0:19:52,000
the road still stretching on."

401
0:19:54.53,000 --> 0:19:55,000
(Applause)

402
0:19:55.567,000 --> 0:19:56,000
Thank you.

403
0:19:56.745,000 --> 0:19:59,000
(Applause)

404
0:20:01.379,000 --> 0:20:02,000
Thank you.

405
0:20:02.554,000 --> 0:20:05,000
(Applause)

406
0:20:07.731,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

407
0:20:10.128,000 --> 0:20:11,000
You're very kind. Thank you.

408
0:20:11.699,000 --> 0:20:13,000
(Applause)

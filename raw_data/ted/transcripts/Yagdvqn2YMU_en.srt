1
0:00:12.602,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Approximately 30 years ago,

2
0:00:14.94,000 --> 0:00:16,000
when I was in oncology at the Children's Hospital

3
0:00:17.633,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in Philadelphia,

4
0:00:19.022,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a father and a son walked into my office

5
0:00:22.176,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and they both had their right eye missing,

6
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and as I took the history, it became apparent

7
0:00:28.131,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that the father and the son had a rare form

8
0:00:30.9,000 --> 0:00:33,000
of inherited eye tumor, retinoblastoma,

9
0:00:34.442,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and the father knew that he had passed that fate

10
0:00:37.556,000 --> 0:00:38,000
on to his son.

11
0:00:39.431,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That moment changed my life.

12
0:00:41.843,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It propelled me to go on

13
0:00:43.747,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and to co-lead a team that discovered

14
0:00:47.279,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the first cancer susceptibility gene,

15
0:00:50.476,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and in the intervening decades since then,

16
0:00:53.197,000 --> 0:00:56,000
there has been literally a seismic shift

17
0:00:56.617,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in our understanding of what goes on,

18
0:00:58.643,000 --> 0:01:,000
what genetic variations are sitting behind

19
0:01:01.531,000 --> 0:01:02,000
various diseases.

20
0:01:03.09,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In fact, for thousands of human traits,

21
0:01:06.474,000 --> 0:01:08,000
a molecular basis that's known for that,

22
0:01:08.692,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and for thousands of people, every day,

23
0:01:11.987,000 --> 0:01:13,000
there's information that they gain

24
0:01:14.068,000 --> 0:01:16,000
about the risk of going on to get this disease

25
0:01:16.51,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or that disease.

26
0:01:18.736,000 --> 0:01:2,000
At the same time, if you ask,

27
0:01:21.041,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"Has that impacted the efficiency,

28
0:01:23.748,000 --> 0:01:25,000
how we've been able to develop drugs?"

29
0:01:25.84,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the answer is not really.

30
0:01:27.622,000 --> 0:01:29,000
If you look at the cost of developing drugs,

31
0:01:29.952,000 --> 0:01:32,000
how that's done, it basically hasn't budged that.

32
0:01:33.341,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And so it's as if we have the power to diagnose

33
0:01:37.814,000 --> 0:01:39,000
yet not the power to fully treat.

34
0:01:40.626,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And there are two commonly given reasons

35
0:01:43.092,000 --> 0:01:44,000
for why that happens.

36
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One of them is it's early days.

37
0:01:48.032,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We're just learning the words, the fragments,

38
0:01:51.622,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the letters in the genetic code.

39
0:01:53.398,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We don't know how to read the sentences.

40
0:01:55.553,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We don't know how to follow the narrative.

41
0:01:58.123,000 --> 0:02:,000
The other reason given is that

42
0:02:00.602,000 --> 0:02:02,000
most of those changes are a loss of function,

43
0:02:02.82,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and it's actually really hard to develop drugs

44
0:02:05.745,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that restore function.

45
0:02:07.66,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But today, I want us to step back

46
0:02:09.842,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and ask a more fundamental question,

47
0:02:11.87,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and ask, "What happens if we're thinking

48
0:02:14.059,000 --> 0:02:16,000
about this maybe in the wrong context?"

49
0:02:16.792,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We do a lot of studying of those who are sick

50
0:02:19.951,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and building up long lists

51
0:02:22.551,000 --> 0:02:25,000
of altered components.

52
0:02:25.669,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But maybe, if what we're trying to do

53
0:02:28.068,000 --> 0:02:31,000
is to develop therapies for prevention,

54
0:02:31.29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
maybe what we should be doing

55
0:02:32.843,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is studying those who don't get sick.

56
0:02:35.225,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Maybe we should be studying those

57
0:02:37.572,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that are well.

58
0:02:39.747,000 --> 0:02:4,000
A vast majority of those people

59
0:02:41.544,000 --> 0:02:43,000
are not necessarily carrying a particular

60
0:02:43.88,000 --> 0:02:44,000
genetic load or risk factor.

61
0:02:45.816,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They're not going to help us.

62
0:02:47.8,000 --> 0:02:48,000
There are going to be those individuals

63
0:02:49.399,000 --> 0:02:51,000
who are carrying a potential future risk,

64
0:02:52.068,000 --> 0:02:53,000
they're going to go on to get some symptom.

65
0:02:53.912,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's not what we're looking for.

66
0:02:55.7,000 --> 0:02:56,000
What we're asking and looking for is,

67
0:02:57.548,000 --> 0:02:59,000
are there a very few set of individuals

68
0:03:00.318,000 --> 0:03:02,000
who are actually walking around

69
0:03:03.154,000 --> 0:03:07,000
with the risk that normally would cause a disease,

70
0:03:07.173,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but something in them, something hidden in them

71
0:03:10.136,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is actually protective

72
0:03:11.97,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and keeping them from exhibiting those symptoms?

73
0:03:15.145,000 --> 0:03:17,000
If you're going to do a study like that, you can imagine

74
0:03:17.198,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you'd like to look at lots and lots of people.

75
0:03:20.03,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We'd have to go and have a pretty wide study,

76
0:03:23.322,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and we realized that actually

77
0:03:25.057,000 --> 0:03:26,000
one way to think of this is,

78
0:03:26.586,000 --> 0:03:3,000
let us look at adults who are over 40 years of age,

79
0:03:30.863,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and let's make sure that we look at those

80
0:03:33.833,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who were healthy as kids.

81
0:03:35.313,000 --> 0:03:37,000
They might have had individuals in their families

82
0:03:37.715,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who had had a childhood disease,

83
0:03:39.527,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but not necessarily.

84
0:03:41.033,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And let's go and then screen those

85
0:03:43.8,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to find those who are carrying genes

86
0:03:45.793,000 --> 0:03:46,000
for childhood diseases.

87
0:03:47.471,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, some of you, I can see you

88
0:03:49.035,000 --> 0:03:52,000
putting your hands up going, "Uh, a little odd.

89
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What's your evidence

90
0:03:53.747,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that this could be feasible?"

91
0:03:55.409,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I want to give you two examples.

92
0:03:57.473,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The first comes from San Francisco.

93
0:04:00.421,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It comes from the 1980s and the 1990s,

94
0:04:03.362,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and you may know the story where

95
0:04:05.756,000 --> 0:04:07,000
there were individuals who had very high levels

96
0:04:08.153,000 --> 0:04:09,000
of the virus HIV.

97
0:04:09.421,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They went on to get AIDS.

98
0:04:11.9,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But there was a very small set of individuals

99
0:04:14.217,000 --> 0:04:16,000
who also had very high levels of HIV.

100
0:04:17.185,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They didn't get AIDS.

101
0:04:18.571,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And astute clinicians tracked that down,

102
0:04:21.533,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and what they found was they were carrying mutations.

103
0:04:24.92,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Notice, they were carrying mutations from birth

104
0:04:28.005,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that were protective, that were protecting them

105
0:04:30.02,000 --> 0:04:31,000
from going on to get AIDS.

106
0:04:31.661,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You may also know that actually a line of therapy

107
0:04:34.826,000 --> 0:04:37,000
has been coming along based on that fact.

108
0:04:37.946,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Second example, more recent, is elegant work

109
0:04:41.17,000 --> 0:04:42,000
done by Helen Hobbs,

110
0:04:42.573,000 --> 0:04:44,000
who said, "I'm going to look at individuals

111
0:04:45.235,000 --> 0:04:47,000
who have very high lipid levels,

112
0:04:47.951,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I'm going to try to find those people

113
0:04:49.89,000 --> 0:04:5,000
with high lipid levels

114
0:04:51.692,000 --> 0:04:53,000
who don't go on to get heart disease."

115
0:04:53.86,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And again, what she found was

116
0:04:56.298,000 --> 0:04:58,000
some of those individuals had mutations

117
0:04:58.858,000 --> 0:05:,000
that were protective from birth that kept them,

118
0:05:01.577,000 --> 0:05:02,000
even though they had high lipid levels,

119
0:05:03.022,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and you can see this is an interesting way

120
0:05:06.393,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of thinking about how you could develop

121
0:05:08.354,000 --> 0:05:1,000
preventive therapies.

122
0:05:10.614,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The project that we're working on

123
0:05:12.558,000 --> 0:05:14,000
is called "The Resilience Project:

124
0:05:15.02,000 --> 0:05:16,000
A Search for Unexpected Heroes,"

125
0:05:16.42,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because what we are interested in doing is saying,

126
0:05:18.91,000 --> 0:05:2,000
can we find those rare individuals

127
0:05:21.558,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who might have these hidden protective factors?

128
0:05:25.883,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And in some ways, think of it as a decoder ring,

129
0:05:28.863,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a sort of resilience decoder ring

130
0:05:30.789,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that we're going to try to build.

131
0:05:32.421,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We've realized that we should do this in a systematic way,

132
0:05:36.27,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so we've said, let's take every single

133
0:05:38.897,000 --> 0:05:39,000
childhood inherited disease.

134
0:05:40.14,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Let's take them all, and let's pull them back a little bit

135
0:05:42.704,000 --> 0:05:45,000
by those that are known to have severe symptoms,

136
0:05:45.89,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where the parents, the child,

137
0:05:47.81,000 --> 0:05:48,000
those around them would know

138
0:05:48.86,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that they'd gotten sick,

139
0:05:50.19,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and let's go ahead and then frame them again

140
0:05:53.89,000 --> 0:05:55,000
by those parts of the genes where we know

141
0:05:56.471,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that there is a particular alteration

142
0:05:58.978,000 --> 0:06:,000
that is known to be highly penetrant

143
0:06:01.776,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to cause that disease.

144
0:06:04.43,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Where are we going to look?

145
0:06:05.658,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well, we could look locally. That makes sense.

146
0:06:08.146,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But we began to think, maybe we should look

147
0:06:10.407,000 --> 0:06:11,000
all over the world.

148
0:06:11.858,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Maybe we should look not just here

149
0:06:13.511,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but in remote places where their might be

150
0:06:15.471,000 --> 0:06:18,000
a distinct genetic context,

151
0:06:18.501,000 --> 0:06:19,000
there might be environmental factors

152
0:06:20.143,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that protect people.

153
0:06:21.525,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And let's look at a million individuals.

154
0:06:25.987,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now the reason why we think it's a good time

155
0:06:28.957,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to do that now

156
0:06:30.029,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is, in the last couple of years,

157
0:06:31.789,000 --> 0:06:33,000
there's been a remarkable plummeting in the cost

158
0:06:34.377,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to do this type of analysis,

159
0:06:36.612,000 --> 0:06:37,000
this type of data generation,

160
0:06:38.351,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to where it actually costs less to do

161
0:06:40.959,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the data generation and analysis

162
0:06:43.153,000 --> 0:06:46,000
than it does to do the sample processing and the collection.

163
0:06:46.337,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The other reason is that in the last five years,

164
0:06:50.641,000 --> 0:06:51,000
there have been awesome tools,

165
0:06:52.605,000 --> 0:06:54,000
things about network biology, systems biology,

166
0:06:55.267,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that have come up that allow us to think

167
0:06:57.228,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that maybe we could decipher

168
0:06:59.168,000 --> 0:07:01,000
those positive outliers.

169
0:07:01.649,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And as we went around talking to researchers

170
0:07:03.821,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and institutions

171
0:07:05.725,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and telling them about our story,

172
0:07:07.294,000 --> 0:07:08,000
something happened.

173
0:07:08.961,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They started saying, "This is interesting.

174
0:07:11.19,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I would be glad to join your effort.

175
0:07:14.537,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I would be willing to participate."

176
0:07:16.464,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And they didn't say, "Where's the MTA?"

177
0:07:19.043,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They didn't say, "Where is my authorship?"

178
0:07:22.336,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They didn't say, "Is this data going to be mine? Am I going to own it?"

179
0:07:26.947,000 --> 0:07:28,000
They basically said, "Let's work on this

180
0:07:29.226,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in an open, crowd-sourced, team way

181
0:07:32.107,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to do this decoding."

182
0:07:35.181,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Six months ago, we locked down

183
0:07:37.696,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the screening key for this decoder.

184
0:07:41.011,000 --> 0:07:45,000
My co-lead, a brilliant scientist, Eric Schadt

185
0:07:45.589,000 --> 0:07:48,000
at the Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York,

186
0:07:48.895,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and his team,

187
0:07:50.287,000 --> 0:07:52,000
locked in that decoder key ring,

188
0:07:53.156,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and we began looking for samples,

189
0:07:55.551,000 --> 0:07:56,000
because what we realized is,

190
0:07:57.037,000 --> 0:07:58,000
maybe we could just go and look

191
0:07:58.831,000 --> 0:08:01,000
at some existing samples to get some sense of feasibility.

192
0:08:01.917,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Maybe we could take two, three percent of the project on,

193
0:08:04.494,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and see if it was there.

194
0:08:05.911,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And so we started asking people

195
0:08:07.909,000 --> 0:08:1,000
such as Hakon at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia.

196
0:08:11.446,000 --> 0:08:13,000
We asked Leif up in Finland.

197
0:08:13.691,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We talked to Anne Wojcicki at 23andMe,

198
0:08:17.364,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and Wang Jun at BGI,

199
0:08:19.131,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and again, something remarkable happened.

200
0:08:21.319,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They said, "Huh,

201
0:08:23.128,000 --> 0:08:24,000
not only do we have samples,

202
0:08:24.872,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but often we've analyzed them,

203
0:08:27.068,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and we would be glad to go into

204
0:08:28.555,000 --> 0:08:29,000
our anonymized samples

205
0:08:29.958,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and see if we could find those

206
0:08:32.02,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that you're looking for."

207
0:08:33.183,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And instead of being 20,000 or 30,000,

208
0:08:35.89,000 --> 0:08:38,000
last month we passed one half million samples

209
0:08:39.042,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that we've already analyzed.

210
0:08:40.947,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So you must be going,

211
0:08:42.44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"Huh, did you find any unexpected heroes?"

212
0:08:48.065,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And the answer is, we didn't find one or two.

213
0:08:50.648,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We found dozens of these strong candidate

214
0:08:53.686,000 --> 0:08:54,000
unexpected heroes.

215
0:08:55.415,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So we think that the time is now

216
0:08:58.112,000 --> 0:09:,000
to launch the beta phase of this project

217
0:09:00.452,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and actually start getting prospective individuals.

218
0:09:03.569,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Basically all we need is information.

219
0:09:06.74,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We need a swab of DNA

220
0:09:08.399,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and a willingness to say, "What's inside me?

221
0:09:11.804,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I'm willing to be re-contacted."

222
0:09:15.067,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Most of us spend our lives,

223
0:09:18.858,000 --> 0:09:19,000
when it comes to health and disease,

224
0:09:20.812,000 --> 0:09:23,000
acting as if we're voyeurs.

225
0:09:23.892,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We delegate the responsibility

226
0:09:26.229,000 --> 0:09:28,000
for the understanding of our disease,

227
0:09:28.272,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for the treatment of our disease,

228
0:09:30.144,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to anointed experts.

229
0:09:33.68,000 --> 0:09:36,000
In order for us to get this project to work,

230
0:09:37.02,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we need individuals to step up

231
0:09:39.17,000 --> 0:09:42,000
in a different role and to be engaged,

232
0:09:43.062,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to realize this dream,

233
0:09:45.987,000 --> 0:09:48,000
this open crowd-sourced project,

234
0:09:49.122,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to find those unexpected heroes,

235
0:09:52.802,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to evolve from the current concepts

236
0:09:55.462,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of resources and constraints,

237
0:09:57.796,000 --> 0:10:,000
to design those preventive therapies,

238
0:10:01.047,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and to extend it beyond childhood diseases,

239
0:10:03.82,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to go all the way up to ways

240
0:10:05.397,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that we could look at Alzheimer's or Parkinson's,

241
0:10:09.268,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we're going to need us

242
0:10:11.53,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to be looking inside ourselves and asking,

243
0:10:14.636,000 --> 0:10:16,000
"What are our roles?

244
0:10:16.84,000 --> 0:10:17,000
What are our genes?"

245
0:10:18.513,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and looking within ourselves for information

246
0:10:21.298,000 --> 0:10:23,000
we used to say we should go to the outside,

247
0:10:23.94,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to experts,

248
0:10:25.148,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and to be willing to share that with others.

249
0:10:29.2,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Thank you very much.

250
0:10:32.758,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

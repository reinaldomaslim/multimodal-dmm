1
0:00:13.375,000 --> 0:00:16,000
This is the sound of orcas off the coast of Vancouver.

2
0:00:17.333,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Whale chirps and squeaks)

3
0:00:23.417,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They make these fantastic sounds not just to communicate,

4
0:00:26.333,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but also sometimes to echolocate,

5
0:00:28.5,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to find their way around and to find food.

6
0:00:31.417,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But that can be tricky sometimes,

7
0:00:33.083,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because, well, here is the sound of a ship passing by,

8
0:00:36.375,000 --> 0:00:37,000
recorded underwater.

9
0:00:37.958,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Screeching oscillating sound)

10
0:00:44.452,000 --> 0:00:46,000
You know, when we think about marine pollution,

11
0:00:46.667,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I think we usually think about plastics.

12
0:00:48.708,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Maybe toxic chemicals,

13
0:00:50.333,000 --> 0:00:53,000
or even ocean acidification from climate change.

14
0:00:53.458,000 --> 0:00:56,000
As a science journalist who often writes about environmental issues,

15
0:00:56.917,000 --> 0:00:58,000
those are the things that have passed my desk

16
0:00:59.083,000 --> 0:01:,000
over the past 10 years or so.

17
0:01:01.083,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But as I recently realized

18
0:01:02.375,000 --> 0:01:05,000
when I was writing a feature for the science journal "Nature,"

19
0:01:05.458,000 --> 0:01:08,000
noise is another important kind of pollution.

20
0:01:08.75,000 --> 0:01:09,000
One that often gets ignored.

21
0:01:11.375,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You know, maybe you've heard of the dark-skies movement,

22
0:01:14.417,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which aimed to raise awareness of the issue of light pollution

23
0:01:17.917,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and create pockets of unilluminated night,

24
0:01:20.625,000 --> 0:01:21,000
so that people and animals

25
0:01:22.542,000 --> 0:01:27,000
could enjoy more natural cycles of light and dark, night and day.

26
0:01:27.75,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Well, in much the same way,

27
0:01:29.083,000 --> 0:01:3,000
there are people now raising awareness

28
0:01:30.958,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of the issue of noise pollution

29
0:01:32.542,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and trying to create pockets of quiet in the ocean,

30
0:01:35.75,000 --> 0:01:38,000
so that marine life can enjoy a more natural soundscape.

31
0:01:40.5,000 --> 0:01:41,000
This is important.

32
0:01:41.833,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Noise isn't just an irritation.

33
0:01:44.417,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It can cause chronic stress,

34
0:01:46.542,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or even physical injury.

35
0:01:48.292,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It can affect marine life's ability to find food and mates

36
0:01:51.75,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and to listen out for predators and more.

37
0:01:55.792,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Think of all the sounds we inject into the ocean.

38
0:01:59.042,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Perhaps one of the most dramatic is the seismic surveys

39
0:02:01.958,000 --> 0:02:03,000
used to look for oil and gas.

40
0:02:04.458,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Air guns produce loud blasts,

41
0:02:06.708,000 --> 0:02:08,000
sometimes every 10 to 15 seconds,

42
0:02:09.167,000 --> 0:02:1,000
for months on end.

43
0:02:10.75,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And they use the reflections of these sounds

44
0:02:12.833,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to map the ground beneath.

45
0:02:14.583,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It can sound like this.

46
0:02:17.917,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Explosion sounds)

47
0:02:23.875,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Then, there's the sound of the actual drilling for oil and gas,

48
0:02:27.208,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the construction of things like offshore wind farms,

49
0:02:30.417,000 --> 0:02:31,000
sonar

50
0:02:31.708,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and of course, the nearly constant drone from more than 50,000 ships

51
0:02:35.75,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in the global merchant fleet.

52
0:02:38.792,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now the natural ocean itself isn't exactly quiet.

53
0:02:41.292,000 --> 0:02:42,000
If you put your head under the water,

54
0:02:43.083,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you can hear cracking ice, wind, rain,

55
0:02:46.667,000 --> 0:02:48,000
singing whales, grunting fish,

56
0:02:48.792,000 --> 0:02:49,000
even snapping shrimp.

57
0:02:50.708,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Altogether, that can create a soundscape

58
0:02:52.75,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of maybe 50 to 100 decibels,

59
0:02:54.875,000 --> 0:02:56,000
depending on where and when you are.

60
0:02:57.833,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But mankind's addition to that has been dramatic.

61
0:03:00.625,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It's estimated that shipping has added three decibels of noise to the ocean

62
0:03:05.125,000 --> 0:03:07,000
every 10 years in recent decades.

63
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:09,000
That might not sound like a lot,

64
0:03:09.583,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but decibels are on a logarithmic scale,

65
0:03:11.75,000 --> 0:03:12,000
like the Richter scale for earthquakes.

66
0:03:13.667,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So a small number can actually represent a large change.

67
0:03:17.333,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Three decibels means a doubling of noise intensity in the ocean.

68
0:03:21.708,000 --> 0:03:22,000
A doubling.

69
0:03:23.75,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And that's only an estimate,

70
0:03:25.167,000 --> 0:03:28,000
because no one is actually keeping track of how noisy the ocean is

71
0:03:28.333,000 --> 0:03:29,000
all around the world.

72
0:03:30.25,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There is a body called the International Quiet Ocean Experiment,

73
0:03:34.333,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and one of their missions

74
0:03:35.625,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is to try and plug the hole in that data.

75
0:03:39.542,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So for example, last year,

76
0:03:40.833,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they managed to convince the Global Ocean Observation System

77
0:03:44.333,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to start including noise

78
0:03:45.625,000 --> 0:03:47,000
as one of their essential variables for monitoring,

79
0:03:48.208,000 --> 0:03:5,000
alongside things like temperature and salinity.

80
0:03:52.208,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We do know some things.

81
0:03:53.5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We know that sonar can be as loud, or nearly as loud,

82
0:03:57.125,000 --> 0:03:58,000
as an underwater volcano.

83
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
A supertanker can be as loud as the call of a blue whale.

84
0:04:03.208,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The noises we add to the ocean come in all different frequencies

85
0:04:06.292,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and can travel great distances.

86
0:04:08.375,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Seismic surveys off the East Coast of the United States

87
0:04:11.417,000 --> 0:04:14,000
can be heard in the middle of the Atlantic.

88
0:04:14.792,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In the 1960s, they did an experiment

89
0:04:16.792,000 --> 0:04:19,000
where they set off a loud noise off the coast of Perth, Australia,

90
0:04:20.042,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and they detected it as far away as Bermuda,

91
0:04:22.5,000 --> 0:04:24,000
20,000 kilometers away.

92
0:04:27.917,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So what does all this sound like to marine life,

93
0:04:30.417,000 --> 0:04:31,000
what do they hear?

94
0:04:31.708,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's kind of difficult to describe.

95
0:04:33.458,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Sound travels further, faster in water than it does in air,

96
0:04:36.667,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and it also packs a different punch.

97
0:04:39.25,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So sound of the same pressure will have a different intensity

98
0:04:42.417,000 --> 0:04:45,000
whether you measure it in the air or underwater.

99
0:04:45.917,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Then there's the fact that whales don't have ears exactly like human ears.

100
0:04:50.125,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Creatures like zooplankton

101
0:04:51.583,000 --> 0:04:54,000
don't even have what you would consider to be ears.

102
0:04:55.125,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So what does this mean,

103
0:04:56.417,000 --> 0:04:58,000
what is the impact on all this marine life?

104
0:05:00.042,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Perhaps the easiest thing for scientists to assess

105
0:05:02.417,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is the effect of acute noise,

106
0:05:03.958,000 --> 0:05:04,000
really loud sudden blasts

107
0:05:05.875,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that might cause physical injury or hearing loss.

108
0:05:09.458,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Beaked whales, for example, can go into panicked dives

109
0:05:12.917,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when exposed to loud noises,

110
0:05:14.75,000 --> 0:05:17,000
which may even give them a condition similar to the bends.

111
0:05:19.167,000 --> 0:05:23,000
In the 1960s, after the introduction of more powerful sonar technologies,

112
0:05:23.542,000 --> 0:05:26,000
the number of incidents of mass whale strandings of beaked whales

113
0:05:27.458,000 --> 0:05:28,000
went up dramatically.

114
0:05:29.833,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And it's not just marine mammals,

115
0:05:31.625,000 --> 0:05:35,000
fish, if they stray too close to the source of a loud sound,

116
0:05:35.917,000 --> 0:05:38,000
their fish bladders may actually explode.

117
0:05:39.208,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The airgun blasts from seismic surveys

118
0:05:41.292,000 --> 0:05:43,000
can mow down a swath of zooplankton,

119
0:05:44.042,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the tiny creatures near the base of the food chain,

120
0:05:46.708,000 --> 0:05:49,000
or can deform scallop larvae while they're developing.

121
0:05:51.417,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Well, what about chronic noise,

122
0:05:53.542,000 --> 0:05:55,000
the more pervasive issue of raising background noise

123
0:05:56.292,000 --> 0:05:57,000
from things like shipping?

124
0:05:57.792,000 --> 0:06:,000
That can mask or drown out the natural soundscape.

125
0:06:01.667,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Some whales have responded to this by literally changing their tune,

126
0:06:05.375,000 --> 0:06:09,000
a little bit like people shouting to be heard in a noisy nightclub.

127
0:06:09.792,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And some fish will spend more time patrolling their borders

128
0:06:13.542,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and less time caring for their young,

129
0:06:15.875,000 --> 0:06:16,000
as if they're on high alert.

130
0:06:19.75,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Chronic noise can affect people too, of course.

131
0:06:23.208,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Studies have shown that people living near busy airports

132
0:06:26.083,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or really busy highways

133
0:06:27.625,000 --> 0:06:3,000
may have elevated levels of cardiovascular disease.

134
0:06:30.917,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And students living under busy flight paths

135
0:06:33.333,000 --> 0:06:35,000
may do worse on some educational tests.

136
0:06:36.25,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And even while I was researching this subject,

137
0:06:39.208,000 --> 0:06:42,000
they were actually blasting out about three meters of solid granite

138
0:06:42.375,000 --> 0:06:44,000
from the lot across from my home office

139
0:06:44.792,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to make room for a new house,

140
0:06:46.417,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the constant jittering of the rock hammer

141
0:06:48.708,000 --> 0:06:5,000
was driving me completely insane.

142
0:06:51.458,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And whenever the workers stopped for a moment,

143
0:06:54.042,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I could feel my shoulders relax.

144
0:06:57.25,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This effect has been seen in whales, too.

145
0:07:00.167,000 --> 0:07:02,000
After the terrorist attacks of 9/11,

146
0:07:02.792,000 --> 0:07:05,000
international shipping largely ground to a halt for a little while

147
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in the waters off the East Coast of the United States.

148
0:07:09.083,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And in that lull,

149
0:07:10.375,000 --> 0:07:13,000
researchers noticed that endangered right whales in that region

150
0:07:13.667,000 --> 0:07:16,000
had fewer chemical markers of stress in their feces samples.

151
0:07:18.333,000 --> 0:07:2,000
As one researcher I spoke to likes to say,

152
0:07:20.917,000 --> 0:07:22,000
"We were stressed, but the whales weren't."

153
0:07:25.5,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now you have to remember,

154
0:07:26.792,000 --> 0:07:28,000
we have evolved to be a visual species.

155
0:07:29.042,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We really rely on our eyes.

156
0:07:31.292,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But marine life relies on sound

157
0:07:33.458,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the way that we rely on sight.

158
0:07:37.458,000 --> 0:07:39,000
For them, a noisy ocean

159
0:07:39.833,000 --> 0:07:42,000
may be as befuddling and even dangerous

160
0:07:43.292,000 --> 0:07:45,000
as a dense fog is for us.

161
0:07:46.625,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And maybe sometimes that just means being a little more stressed,

162
0:07:50.25,000 --> 0:07:53,000
maybe sometimes it means spending a little less time with the kids.

163
0:07:53.458,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Maybe some species can adapt.

164
0:07:55.875,000 --> 0:07:57,000
But some researchers worry that for endangered species

165
0:07:58.625,000 --> 0:07:59,000
already on the brink,

166
0:08:00.042,000 --> 0:08:02,000
noise may be enough to push them over the edge.

167
0:08:03.917,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So take, for example, the southern resident killer whales

168
0:08:06.667,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that live in the waters off my hometown of Vancouver.

169
0:08:09.583,000 --> 0:08:12,000
There are only 75, maybe 76, animals left

170
0:08:12.958,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in this population.

171
0:08:14.5,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And they're facing a lot of challenges.

172
0:08:16.917,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There are chemical pollutants in these waters,

173
0:08:19.458,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and they are running low on the salmon that they really rely on for food.

174
0:08:23.75,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And then there's noise.

175
0:08:25.417,000 --> 0:08:27,000
When researchers studied these and similar killer whales,

176
0:08:28.167,000 --> 0:08:32,000
they found that they spend between 18 and 25 percent less time

177
0:08:32.375,000 --> 0:08:35,000
feeding in the presence of loud boat noise.

178
0:08:35.458,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And that's a lot for a species that's already struggling

179
0:08:38.375,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to find enough food to thrive.

180
0:08:41.583,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The good news, as I heard from all the researchers I spoke to,

181
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is that you can do something relatively easily about ocean noise.

182
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Unlike the wicked problems of climate change

183
0:08:51.708,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and ocean acidification,

184
0:08:53.333,000 --> 0:08:55,000
you can just dial down the knob on ocean noise

185
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and see almost immediate impacts.

186
0:08:59.25,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So for example, in 2017,

187
0:09:01.75,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority

188
0:09:04.125,000 --> 0:09:06,000
started asking ships to simply slow down

189
0:09:06.792,000 --> 0:09:07,000
when going through the Haro Strait,

190
0:09:08.708,000 --> 0:09:11,000
where the southern resident killer whales are feeding in late summer.

191
0:09:12.292,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Slower ships are quieter ships.

192
0:09:14.875,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And because it's Canada, you can just ask,

193
0:09:17.167,000 --> 0:09:18,000
it can be voluntary.

194
0:09:18.458,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:19.75,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

196
0:09:24.667,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In that 2017 trial, most of the ships complied,

197
0:09:27.792,000 --> 0:09:29,000
adding about half an hour to their travel time,

198
0:09:30.042,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and reducing noise by about 1.2 decibels

199
0:09:32.833,000 --> 0:09:35,000
or 24 percent of noise intensity.

200
0:09:35.875,000 --> 0:09:37,000
This year, they decided to extend the length of time

201
0:09:38.667,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and the area over which they're asking ships to slow down.

202
0:09:41.583,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So hopefully that has a positive impact for these whales.

203
0:09:46.542,000 --> 0:09:48,000
In 2017, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority

204
0:09:48.875,000 --> 0:09:5,000
also introduced discounts in docking fees

205
0:09:51.792,000 --> 0:09:54,000
for ships that are physically designed to be quieter.

206
0:09:55.042,000 --> 0:09:57,000
You know, weirdly, a lot of the noise from a ship like this

207
0:09:57.833,000 --> 0:10:,000
comes from the popping of tiny bubbles off the back of its propeller.

208
0:10:01.5,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And you can simply design a ship to do less of that

209
0:10:04.625,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and to be quieter.

210
0:10:06.542,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The International Maritime Organization has published a huge list of ways

211
0:10:10.333,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that boats can be made quieter.

212
0:10:12.875,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And they also have a target

213
0:10:15.125,000 --> 0:10:17,000
of reducing carbon dioxide emissions from global shipping

214
0:10:17.833,000 --> 0:10:19,000
by 50 percent by 2050.

215
0:10:20.375,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And the great news is that these two things go hand in hand.

216
0:10:23.458,000 --> 0:10:26,000
On the whole, a more efficient ship is a quieter ship.

217
0:10:29.167,000 --> 0:10:32,000
People have also invented quieter ways of hammering in the giant posts

218
0:10:33.083,000 --> 0:10:35,000
needed for giant wind turbines, like this one,

219
0:10:35.708,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and gentler ways of doing seismic surveys.

220
0:10:38.708,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And there are some incentives for using quieter technologies.

221
0:10:42.125,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The European Union, for example,

222
0:10:43.875,000 --> 0:10:46,000
has a healthy marine system directive for 2020.

223
0:10:47.375,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And one of the ways that they define a healthy marine system

224
0:10:50.292,000 --> 0:10:53,000
is by how much noise is going in those waters.

225
0:10:53.542,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But on the whole, most waters remain completely unregulated

226
0:10:57.292,000 --> 0:10:58,000
when it comes to ocean noise.

227
0:11:00.125,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But again, most of the scientists I spoke to

228
0:11:02.208,000 --> 0:11:04,000
said that there's real momentum right now in policy circles

229
0:11:05.042,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to pay attention to this issue

230
0:11:06.542,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and maybe do something about this issue.

231
0:11:09.25,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We already know enough to say that quieter seas are healthier seas.

232
0:11:13.417,000 --> 0:11:17,000
But now scientists are really scrambling to come up with the details.

233
0:11:17.458,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Just how quiet do we need to be?

234
0:11:19.458,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And where are the best places to make quiet or preserve quiet?

235
0:11:23.958,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And how best can we hush our noise?

236
0:11:27.667,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And you know, I'm not trying to tell you

237
0:11:29.625,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that noise is the biggest environmental problem on the planet

238
0:11:32.542,000 --> 0:11:33,000
or even in the ocean.

239
0:11:33.833,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But the point is that humankind has a lot of impacts

240
0:11:37.667,000 --> 0:11:39,000
on our environmental system.

241
0:11:40.167,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And these impacts don't act in isolation.

242
0:11:42.333,000 --> 0:11:44,000
They act together, and they multiply.

243
0:11:44.875,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So even for the ones that are not so obvious,

244
0:11:47.333,000 --> 0:11:49,000
we really need to pay attention to them.

245
0:11:51.917,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I'll tell you about one last experiment,

246
0:11:53.875,000 --> 0:11:54,000
just because it's so beautiful.

247
0:11:55.5,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So Rob Williams,

248
0:11:56.792,000 --> 0:11:59,000
one of the researchers who works on southern resident killer whales,

249
0:12:00.042,000 --> 0:12:01,000
also does some work in Bali.

250
0:12:01.875,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And there, they celebrate a Hindu tradition

251
0:12:03.958,000 --> 0:12:05,000
called nyepi, or a day of silence.

252
0:12:06.833,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And this day, apparently, is very strictly observed.

253
0:12:09.792,000 --> 0:12:11,000
No planes take off from the airport,

254
0:12:11.875,000 --> 0:12:12,000
no boats go out fishing,

255
0:12:13.458,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the tourists are gently led off the beach back into their hotel rooms.

256
0:12:18.042,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And Rob Williams put some hydrophones in the water there

257
0:12:20.792,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to see what the impact was,

258
0:12:22.208,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and it was dramatic.

259
0:12:23.542,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Sound levels dropped by six to nine decibels,

260
0:12:26.292,000 --> 0:12:29,000
about the same as in the waters after 9/11.

261
0:12:29.667,000 --> 0:12:31,000
For an "acoustic prospector" like Williams,

262
0:12:32.542,000 --> 0:12:33,000
which is what he calls himself,

263
0:12:34.458,000 --> 0:12:36,000
this silence is golden.

264
0:12:36.75,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now he and other researchers can go back to this place

265
0:12:40.042,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and see what the fish choose to do

266
0:12:41.686,000 --> 0:12:43,000
with all this additional acoustic real estate.

267
0:12:44.25,000 --> 0:12:47,000
(Soft bubbling)

268
0:12:48.125,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I like to think of them having their own holiday,

269
0:12:51.125,000 --> 0:12:53,000
feasting and finding mates.

270
0:12:53.458,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Celebrating their own spot of calm

271
0:12:55.542,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in an otherwise noisy world.

272
0:12:58.25,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Thank you.

273
0:12:59.542,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause)

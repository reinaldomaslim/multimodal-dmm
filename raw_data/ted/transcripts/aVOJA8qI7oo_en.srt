1
0:00:13.07,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm an astronomer who builds telescopes.

2
0:00:16.563,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I build telescopes because, number one, they are awesome.

3
0:00:21.281,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But number two,

4
0:00:23.354,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I believe if you want to discover a new thing about the universe,

5
0:00:27.086,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you have to look at the universe

6
0:00:28.642,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in a new way.

7
0:00:30.378,000 --> 0:00:31,000
New technologies in astronomy --

8
0:00:32.251,000 --> 0:00:35,000
things like lenses, photographic plates,

9
0:00:35.873,000 --> 0:00:37,000
all the way up to space telescopes --

10
0:00:38.312,000 --> 0:00:41,000
each gave us new ways to see the universe

11
0:00:41.428,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and directly led to a new understanding

12
0:00:44.157,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of our place in it.

13
0:00:46.663,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But those discoveries come with a cost.

14
0:00:49.45,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It took thousands of people and 44 years

15
0:00:53.115,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to get the Hubble Space Telescope from an idea into orbit.

16
0:00:57.38,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It takes time,

17
0:00:58.927,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it takes a tolerance for failure,

18
0:01:00.769,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it takes individual people

19
0:01:02.731,000 --> 0:01:04,000
choosing every day not to give up.

20
0:01:06.247,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I know how hard that choice is because I live it.

21
0:01:09.22,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The reality of my job is that I fail almost all the time and still keep going,

22
0:01:15.302,000 --> 0:01:17,000
because that's how telescopes get built.

23
0:01:18.754,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The telescope I helped build is called

24
0:01:20.617,000 --> 0:01:25,000
the faint intergalactic-medium red-shifted emission balloon,

25
0:01:25.897,000 --> 0:01:26,000
which is a mouthful,

26
0:01:27.54,000 --> 0:01:28,000
so we call it "FIREBall."

27
0:01:28.919,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And don't worry, it is not going to explode at the end of this story.

28
0:01:34.137,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I've been working on FIREBall for more than 10 years

29
0:01:36.672,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and now lead the team of incredible people who built it.

30
0:01:40.481,000 --> 0:01:44,000
FIREBall is designed to observe some of the faintest structures known:

31
0:01:44.895,000 --> 0:01:46,000
huge clouds of hydrogen gas.

32
0:01:48.435,000 --> 0:01:49,000
These clouds are giant.

33
0:01:49.758,000 --> 0:01:51,000
They are even bigger than whatever you're thinking of.

34
0:01:52.32,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They are huge,

35
0:01:53.529,000 --> 0:01:56,000
huge clouds of hydrogen that we think flow into and out of galaxies.

36
0:01:57.521,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I work on FIREBall

37
0:01:59.393,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because what I really want is to take our view of the universe

38
0:02:02.601,000 --> 0:02:05,000
from one with just light from stars

39
0:02:05.789,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to one where we can see and measure every atom that exists.

40
0:02:11.711,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That's all that I want to do.

41
0:02:13.216,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:15.232,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But observing at least some of those atoms

43
0:02:17.466,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is crucial to our understanding of why galaxies look the way they do.

44
0:02:21.261,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I want to know

45
0:02:22.627,000 --> 0:02:25,000
how that hydrogen gas gets into a galaxy and creates a star.

46
0:02:27.909,000 --> 0:02:29,000
My work on FIREBall started in 2008,

47
0:02:30.54,000 --> 0:02:32,000
working not on the telescope but on the light sensor,

48
0:02:33.462,000 --> 0:02:35,000
which is the heart of any telescope.

49
0:02:36.153,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This new sensor was being developed by a team that I joined

50
0:02:38.963,000 --> 0:02:39,000
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

51
0:02:41.71,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And our goal was to prove that this sensor would work really well

52
0:02:45.89,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to detect that hydrogen gas.

53
0:02:48.618,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In my work on this,

54
0:02:50.015,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I destroyed several very, very, very expensive sensors

55
0:02:57.035,000 --> 0:02:59,000
before realizing that the machine I was using

56
0:02:59.166,000 --> 0:03:02,000
created a plasma that shorted out anything electrical that we put in it.

57
0:03:03.414,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We used a different machine, there were other challenges,

58
0:03:06.207,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and it took years to get it right.

59
0:03:08.208,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But when that first sensor worked,

60
0:03:10.876,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it was glorious.

61
0:03:13.098,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And our sensors are now 10 times better than the previous state of the art

62
0:03:17.029,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and are getting put into all kinds of new telescopes.

63
0:03:20.001,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Our sensors will give us a new way to see the universe and our place in it.

64
0:03:26.035,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So, sensors done,

65
0:03:28.144,000 --> 0:03:29,000
time to build a telescope.

66
0:03:29.494,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And FIREBall is weird as far as telescopes go,

67
0:03:33.132,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because it's not in space, and it's not on the ground.

68
0:03:36.148,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Instead, it hangs on a cable from a giant balloon

69
0:03:39.66,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and observes for one night only

70
0:03:42.709,000 --> 0:03:44,000
from 130,000 feet in the stratosphere,

71
0:03:45.492,000 --> 0:03:47,000
at the very edge of space.

72
0:03:48.283,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is partly because the edge of space is much cheaper than actual space.

73
0:03:53.183,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:54.451,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So building it, of course, more failures:

75
0:03:58.908,000 --> 0:03:59,000
mirrors that failed,

76
0:04:00.101,000 --> 0:04:01,000
scratched mirrors that had to be remade;

77
0:04:02.666,000 --> 0:04:03,000
cooling system failures,

78
0:04:03.961,000 --> 0:04:05,000
an entire system that had to be remade;

79
0:04:06.731,000 --> 0:04:12,000
calibration failures, we ran tests again and again and again and again;

80
0:04:12.852,000 --> 0:04:14,000
failures when you literally least expect them:

81
0:04:15.29,000 --> 0:04:18,000
we had an adorable but super angry baby falcon that landed

82
0:04:19.22,000 --> 0:04:2,000
on our spectrograph tank one day.

83
0:04:21.144,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:22.197,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Although to be fair, this was the greatest day

85
0:04:24.411,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in the history of this project.

86
0:04:26.027,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:27.234,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I really loved that falcon.

88
0:04:30.209,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But falcon damage fixed, we got it built

89
0:04:33.385,000 --> 0:04:35,000
for an August 2017 launch attempt --

90
0:04:35.634,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then failed to launch,

91
0:04:37.788,000 --> 0:04:41,000
due to six weeks of continuous rain in the New Mexico desert.

92
0:04:42.592,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:45.144,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Our spirits dampened, we showed up again,

94
0:04:47.132,000 --> 0:04:49,000
August 2018, year 10.

95
0:04:50.247,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And on the morning of September 22nd,

96
0:04:56.611,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we finally got the telescope launched.

97
0:04:59.501,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Applause)

98
0:05:04.238,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I have put so much of myself -- my whole life -- into this project,

99
0:05:08.984,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I, like, still can't believe that that happened.

100
0:05:12.663,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I have this picture that's taken right around sunset on that day

101
0:05:16.404,000 --> 0:05:18,000
of our balloon,

102
0:05:19.182,000 --> 0:05:2,000
FIREBall hanging from it,

103
0:05:20.383,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and the nearly full moon.

104
0:05:22.045,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I love this picture.

105
0:05:23.314,000 --> 0:05:25,000
God, I love it.

106
0:05:27.092,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But I look at it,

107
0:05:28.268,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and it makes me want to cry,

108
0:05:30.751,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because when fully inflated, these balloons are spherical,

109
0:05:35.037,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and this one isn't.

110
0:05:36.577,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's shaped like a teardrop.

111
0:05:38.577,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And that's because there is a hole in it.

112
0:05:43.104,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Sometimes balloons fail, too.

113
0:05:45.856,000 --> 0:05:47,000
FIREBall crash-landed in the New Mexico desert,

114
0:05:48.232,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and we didn't get the data that we wanted.

115
0:05:50.561,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And at the end of that day, I thought to myself,

116
0:05:54.522,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"Why am I doing this?"

117
0:05:57.545,000 --> 0:06:,000
And I've thought a lot about why since that day.

118
0:06:01.202,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And I've realized that all of my work has been full of things

119
0:06:05.658,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that break and fail,

120
0:06:07.164,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that we don't understand and they fail,

121
0:06:09.743,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that we just get wrong the first time,

122
0:06:12.025,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and so they fail.

123
0:06:13.512,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I think about the thousands of people who built Hubble

124
0:06:16.109,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and how many failures they endured.

125
0:06:18.086,000 --> 0:06:21,000
There were countless failures, heartbreaking failures,

126
0:06:21.243,000 --> 0:06:22,000
even when it was in space.

127
0:06:22.949,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And none of those failures were a reason for them to give up.

128
0:06:27.541,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I think about why I love my job.

129
0:06:29.112,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I want to know what is happening in the universe.

130
0:06:31.563,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You all want to know what's happening in the universe, too.

131
0:06:34.383,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I want to know what's going on with that hydrogen.

132
0:06:37.891,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And so I've realized that discovery is mostly a process

133
0:06:41.394,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of finding things that don't work,

134
0:06:43.257,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and failure is inevitable when you're pushing the limits of knowledge.

135
0:06:47.024,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And that's what I want to do.

136
0:06:49.01,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So I'm choosing to keep going.

137
0:06:51.96,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And our team is going to do

138
0:06:53.666,000 --> 0:06:57,000
what everyone who has ever built anything before us has done:

139
0:06:57.873,000 --> 0:06:58,000
we're going to try again,

140
0:06:59.133,000 --> 0:07:,000
in 2020.

141
0:07:00.648,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And it might feel like a failure today -- and it really does --

142
0:07:05.627,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but it's only going to stay a failure

143
0:07:07.932,000 --> 0:07:08,000
if I give up.

144
0:07:09.562,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Thank you very much.

145
0:07:10.814,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.637,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm going to start with a little story.

3
0:00:14.092,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So, I grew up in this neighborhood. When I was 15 years old,

4
0:00:17.204,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I went from being what I think was a strapping young athlete,

5
0:00:21.755,000 --> 0:00:24,000
over four months, slowly wasting away until

6
0:00:25.716,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I was basically a famine victim

7
0:00:27.604,000 --> 0:00:29,000
with an unquenchable thirst.

8
0:00:29.628,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had basically digested away my body.

9
0:00:33.237,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And this all came to a head when I was on a backpacking trip,

10
0:00:37.531,000 --> 0:00:39,000
my first one ever actually, on Old Rag Mountain

11
0:00:39.576,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in West Virginia, and was putting my face into puddles

12
0:00:43.56,000 --> 0:00:45,000
of water and drinking like a dog.

13
0:00:45.816,000 --> 0:00:49,000
That night, I was taken into the emergency room

14
0:00:50.328,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic in full-blown ketoacidosis.

15
0:00:54.209,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I recovered, thanks to the miracles of modern medicine,

16
0:01:00.144,000 --> 0:01:05,000
insulin and other things, and gained all my weight back and more.

17
0:01:05.6,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And something festered inside me after this happened.

18
0:01:11.111,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What I thought about was, what caused the diabetes?

19
0:01:14.624,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You see, diabetes is an autoimmune disease

20
0:01:16.477,000 --> 0:01:19,000
where your body fights itself, and at the time people thought

21
0:01:19.852,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that somehow maybe exposure to a pathogen

22
0:01:22.893,000 --> 0:01:26,000
had triggered my immune system to fight the pathogen

23
0:01:27.365,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and then kill the cells that make insulin.

24
0:01:29.423,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And this is what I thought for a long period of time,

25
0:01:31.733,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and that's in fact what medicine and people have focused on quite a bit,

26
0:01:35.781,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the microbes that do bad things.

27
0:01:38.703,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And that's where I need my assistant here now.

28
0:01:41.771,000 --> 0:01:43,000
You may recognize her.

29
0:01:44.209,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So, I went yesterday, I apologize, I skipped a few of the talks,

30
0:01:49.889,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and I went over to the National Academy of Sciences building,

31
0:01:52.13,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and they sell toys, giant microbes.

32
0:01:57.577,000 --> 0:02:,000
And here we go!

33
0:02:00.962,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So you have caught flesh-eating disease if you caught that one.

34
0:02:05.717,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I gotta get back out my baseball ability here.

35
0:02:10.145,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:13.852,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So, unfortunately or not surprisingly, most of the microbes

37
0:02:20.233,000 --> 0:02:23,000
they sell at the National Academy building are pathogens.

38
0:02:23.576,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Everybody focuses on the things that kill us,

39
0:02:26.545,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and that's what I was focusing on.

40
0:02:28.192,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And it turns out that we are covered in a cloud of microbes,

41
0:02:32.753,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and those microbes actually do us good much of the time,

42
0:02:37.273,000 --> 0:02:38,000
rather than killing us.

43
0:02:38.393,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And so, we've known about this for some period of time.

44
0:02:41.584,000 --> 0:02:44,000
People have used microscopes to look at the microbes that cover us,

45
0:02:45.161,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I know you're not paying attention to me, but ...

46
0:02:46.953,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:49.051,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The microbes that cover us.

48
0:02:50.993,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And if you look at them in the microscope,

49
0:02:54.153,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you can see that we actually have 10 times as many cells

50
0:02:57.557,000 --> 0:03:,000
of microbes on us as we have human cells.

51
0:03:01.025,000 --> 0:03:05,000
There's more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain.

52
0:03:05.776,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We are literally a teeming ecosystem of microorganisms.

53
0:03:10.097,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And unfortunately, if you want to learn about the microorganisms,

54
0:03:14.697,000 --> 0:03:16,000
just looking at them in a microscope is not sufficient.

55
0:03:16.977,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And so we just heard about the DNA sequencing.

56
0:03:19.557,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It turns out that one of the best ways to look at microbes

57
0:03:22.085,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and to understand them is to look at their DNA.

58
0:03:24.621,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And that's what I've been doing for 20 years,

59
0:03:26.763,000 --> 0:03:29,000
using DNA sequencing, collecting samples from various places,

60
0:03:30.645,000 --> 0:03:32,000
including the human body, reading the DNA sequence

61
0:03:33.549,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and then using that DNA sequencing to tell us about

62
0:03:36.169,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the microbes that are in a particular place.

63
0:03:38.335,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And what's amazing, when you use this technology,

64
0:03:41.198,000 --> 0:03:44,000
for example, looking at humans, we're not just covered

65
0:03:44.358,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in a sea of microbes.

66
0:03:45.494,000 --> 0:03:5,000
There are thousands upon thousands of different kinds of microbes on us.

67
0:03:50.605,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We have millions of genes of microbes in our human

68
0:03:55.958,000 --> 0:03:56,000
microbiome covering us.

69
0:03:57.605,000 --> 0:04:,000
And so this microbial diversity differs between people,

70
0:04:01.11,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and what people have been thinking about in the last 10,

71
0:04:04.246,000 --> 0:04:07,000
maybe 15 years is, maybe these microbes,

72
0:04:07.366,000 --> 0:04:09,000
this microbial cloud in and on us,

73
0:04:09.414,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and the variation between us, may be responsible

74
0:04:13.294,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for some of the health and illness differences between us.

75
0:04:16.864,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And that comes back to the diabetes story I was telling you.

76
0:04:19.987,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It turns out that people now think that one of the triggers

77
0:04:23.393,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for type 1 diabetes is not fighting a pathogen,

78
0:04:25.774,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but is in fact trying to -- miscommunicating with the microbes

79
0:04:30.165,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that live in and on you.

80
0:04:31.662,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And somehow maybe the microbial community that's

81
0:04:34.366,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in and on me got off, and then this triggered some sort

82
0:04:38.399,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of immune response and led to me killing the cells

83
0:04:40.638,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that make insulin in my body.

84
0:04:42.859,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And so what I want to tell you about for a few minutes is,

85
0:04:45.955,000 --> 0:04:48,000
what people have learned using DNA sequencing techniques

86
0:04:49.747,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in particular, to study the microbial cloud

87
0:04:53.406,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that lives in and on us.

88
0:04:54.98,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I want to tell you a story about a personal project.

89
0:04:57.444,000 --> 0:04:59,000
My first personal experience with studying the microbes

90
0:05:00.238,000 --> 0:05:04,000
on the human body actually came from a talk that I gave,

91
0:05:04.388,000 --> 0:05:05,000
right around the corner from here at Georgetown.

92
0:05:06.188,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I gave a talk, and a family friend who happened to be

93
0:05:09.205,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the Dean of Georgetown Medical School was at the talk,

94
0:05:11.748,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and came up to me afterwards saying, they were doing

95
0:05:14.238,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a study of ileal transplants in people.

96
0:05:17.588,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And they wanted to look at the microbes after the transplants.

97
0:05:21.564,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And so I started a collaboration with this person,

98
0:05:24.628,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Michael Zasloff and Thomas Fishbein, to look at the microbes

99
0:05:27.901,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that colonized these ilea after they were transplanted into a recipient.

100
0:05:32.374,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And I can tell you all the details about the microbial study

101
0:05:35.516,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that we did there, but the reason I want to tell you this story

102
0:05:37.766,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is something really striking that they did at the beginning

103
0:05:40.99,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of this project.

104
0:05:42.013,000 --> 0:05:46,000
They take the donor ileum, which is filled with microbes from a donor

105
0:05:46.378,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and they have a recipient who might have a problem

106
0:05:48.661,000 --> 0:05:5,000
with their microbial community, say Crohn's disease,

107
0:05:51.286,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and they sterilized the donor ileum.

108
0:05:54.846,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Cleaned out all the microbes, and then put it in the recipient.

109
0:05:59.141,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They did this because this was common practice

110
0:06:01.805,000 --> 0:06:04,000
in medicine, even though it was obvious

111
0:06:04.934,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that this was not a good idea.

112
0:06:07.072,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And fortunately, in the course of this project,

113
0:06:10.077,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the transplant surgeons and the other people

114
0:06:12.64,000 --> 0:06:16,000
decided, forget common practice. We have to switch.

115
0:06:17.061,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So they actually switched to leaving some of the microbial

116
0:06:21.206,000 --> 0:06:25,000
community in the ileum. They leave the microbes with the donor,

117
0:06:25.206,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and theoretically that might help the people who are

118
0:06:28.782,000 --> 0:06:3,000
receiving this ileal transplant.

119
0:06:30.871,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And so, people -- this is a study that I did now.

120
0:06:34.173,000 --> 0:06:36,000
In the last few years there's been a great expansion

121
0:06:36.478,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in using DNA technology to study the microbes in and on people.

122
0:06:40.656,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There's something called the Human Microbiome Project

123
0:06:42.464,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that's going on in the United States,

124
0:06:44.32,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and MetaHIT going on in Europe, and a lot of other projects.

125
0:06:46.854,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And when people have done a variety of studies,

126
0:06:50.043,000 --> 0:06:53,000
they have learned things such as, when a baby is

127
0:06:53.675,000 --> 0:06:55,000
born, during vaginal delivery you get colonized by the

128
0:06:56.659,000 --> 0:06:57,000
microbes from your mother.

129
0:06:57.851,000 --> 0:07:,000
There are risk factors associated with cesarean sections,

130
0:07:00.907,000 --> 0:07:04,000
some of those risk factors may be due to mis-colonization

131
0:07:04.938,000 --> 0:07:06,000
when you carve a baby out of its mother

132
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
rather than being delivered through the birth canal.

133
0:07:10.155,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And a variety of other studies have shown that the

134
0:07:13.604,000 --> 0:07:14,000
microbial community that lives in and on us

135
0:07:15.411,000 --> 0:07:17,000
helps in development of the immune system,

136
0:07:17.674,000 --> 0:07:21,000
helps in fighting off pathogens, helps in our metabolism,

137
0:07:22.619,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and determining our metabolic rate, probably

138
0:07:25.699,000 --> 0:07:28,000
determines our odor, and may even shape our behavior

139
0:07:28.874,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in a variety of ways.

140
0:07:30.81,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And so, these studies have documented or suggested

141
0:07:33.866,000 --> 0:07:37,000
out of a variety of important functions for the microbial community,

142
0:07:38.153,000 --> 0:07:42,000
this cloud, the non-pathogens that live in and on us.

143
0:07:42.69,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And one area that I think is very interesting,

144
0:07:46.274,000 --> 0:07:48,000
which many of you may have now that we've thrown

145
0:07:48.94,000 --> 0:07:51,000
microbes into the crowd, is something that I would call "germophobia."

146
0:07:52.87,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So people are really into cleanliness, right?

147
0:07:55.829,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We have antibiotics in our kitchen counters,

148
0:07:57.808,000 --> 0:08:,000
people are washing every part of them all of the time,

149
0:08:00.904,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we pump antibiotics into our food, into our communities,

150
0:08:05.93,000 --> 0:08:07,000
we take antibiotics excessively.

151
0:08:08.371,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And killing pathogens is a good thing if you're sick,

152
0:08:12.21,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but we should understand that when we pump chemicals

153
0:08:15.474,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and antibiotics into our world, that we're also killing

154
0:08:18.371,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the cloud of microbes that live in and on us.

155
0:08:20.666,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And excessive use of antibiotics, in particular in children,

156
0:08:23.666,000 --> 0:08:26,000
has been shown to be associated with, again, risk factors

157
0:08:26.895,000 --> 0:08:3,000
for obesity, for autoimmune diseases, for a variety

158
0:08:31.151,000 --> 0:08:32,000
of problems that are probably due to disruption

159
0:08:33.055,000 --> 0:08:36,000
of the microbial community.

160
0:08:36.159,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So the microbial community can go wrong

161
0:08:39.511,000 --> 0:08:4,000
whether we want it to or not,

162
0:08:41.223,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or we can kill it with antibiotics,

163
0:08:43.471,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but what can we do to restore it?

164
0:08:45.567,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I'm sure many people here have heard about probiotics.

165
0:08:48.679,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Probiotics are one thing that you can try and do to restore

166
0:08:51.687,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the microbial community that is in and on you.

167
0:08:54.111,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And they definitely have been shown to be effective in some cases.

168
0:08:57.583,000 --> 0:09:,000
There's a project going on at UC Davis where people are using

169
0:09:00.68,000 --> 0:09:02,000
probiotics to try and treat, prevent,

170
0:09:03.575,000 --> 0:09:05,000
necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.

171
0:09:06.087,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Premature infants have real problems with their microbial community.

172
0:09:09.495,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And it may be that probiotics can help prevent

173
0:09:12.015,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the development of this horrible necrotizing enterocolitis

174
0:09:15.151,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in these premature infants.

175
0:09:16.816,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But probiotics are sort of a very, very simple solution.

176
0:09:20.807,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Most of the pills that you can take or the yogurts that you can eat

177
0:09:24.162,000 --> 0:09:28,000
have one or two species in them, maybe five species in them,

178
0:09:28.949,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and the human community is thousands upon thousands of species.

179
0:09:32.615,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So what can we do to restore our microbial community

180
0:09:36.543,000 --> 0:09:39,000
when we have thousands and thousands of species on us?

181
0:09:39.742,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Well, one thing that animals seem to do is,

182
0:09:42.448,000 --> 0:09:46,000
they eat poo -- coprophagia.

183
0:09:46.462,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And it turns out that many veterinarians,

184
0:09:51.071,000 --> 0:09:53,000
old school veterinarians in particular,

185
0:09:53.08,000 --> 0:09:55,000
have been doing something called "poo tea,"

186
0:09:55.796,000 --> 0:10:,000
not booty, but poo tea, to treat colic and other

187
0:10:01.601,000 --> 0:10:04,000
ailments in horses and cows and things like that,

188
0:10:05.224,000 --> 0:10:08,000
where you make tea from the poo from a healthy

189
0:10:09.172,000 --> 0:10:12,000
individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal.

190
0:10:12.321,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Although, unless you have a fistulated cow with a big hole in its side,

191
0:10:16.761,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and you can put your hand into its rumen,

192
0:10:19.3,000 --> 0:10:22,000
it's hard to imagine that the delivery of microbes

193
0:10:22.708,000 --> 0:10:24,000
directly into the mouth and through the entire

194
0:10:25.637,000 --> 0:10:28,000
top of the digestive tract is the best delivery system,

195
0:10:29.285,000 --> 0:10:33,000
so you may have heard in people they are now doing

196
0:10:33.405,000 --> 0:10:37,000
fecal transplants, where rather than delivering

197
0:10:38.055,000 --> 0:10:4,000
a couple of probiotic microbes through the mouth,

198
0:10:40.487,000 --> 0:10:43,000
they are delivering a community of probiotics,

199
0:10:43.94,000 --> 0:10:45,000
a community of microbes from a healthy donor,

200
0:10:46.42,000 --> 0:10:48,000
through the other end.

201
0:10:48.557,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And this has turned out to be very effective in fighting

202
0:10:51.887,000 --> 0:10:53,000
certain intransigent infectious diseases

203
0:10:54.253,000 --> 0:10:57,000
like Clostridium difficile infections that can stay

204
0:10:58.092,000 --> 0:11:,000
with people for years and years and years.

205
0:11:00.189,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Transplants of the feces, of the microbes from the feces,

206
0:11:05.052,000 --> 0:11:07,000
from a healthy donor has actually been shown to cure

207
0:11:07.917,000 --> 0:11:09,000
systemic C. dif infections in some people.

208
0:11:10.778,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Now what these transplants, these fecal transplants, or

209
0:11:16.62,000 --> 0:11:2,000
the poo tea suggest to me, and many other people

210
0:11:21.079,000 --> 0:11:22,000
have come up with this same idea, is that

211
0:11:22.823,000 --> 0:11:25,000
the microbial community in and on us, it's an organ.

212
0:11:26.711,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We should view it as a functioning organ, part of ourselves.

213
0:11:31.718,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We should treat it carefully and with respect,

214
0:11:35.709,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and we do not want to mess with it, say by C-sections

215
0:11:39.689,000 --> 0:11:43,000
or by antibiotics or excessive cleanliness,

216
0:11:44.597,000 --> 0:11:47,000
without some real good justification.

217
0:11:47.814,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And what the DNA sequencing technologies are allowing people to do now

218
0:11:51.454,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is do detailed studies of, say, 100 patients who have Crohn's disease

219
0:11:58.406,000 --> 0:12:,000
and 100 people who don't have Crohn's disease.

220
0:12:00.941,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Or 100 people who took antibiotics when they were little,

221
0:12:04.774,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and 100 people who did not take antibiotics.

222
0:12:07.198,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And we can now start to compare the community of microbes

223
0:12:11.278,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and their genes and see if there are differences.

224
0:12:14.581,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And eventually we may be able to understand if they're not

225
0:12:17.983,000 --> 0:12:19,000
just correlative differences, but causative.

226
0:12:20.607,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Studies in model systems like mouse and other animals

227
0:12:24.077,000 --> 0:12:27,000
are also helping do this, but people are now using

228
0:12:27.286,000 --> 0:12:29,000
these technologies because they've gotten very cheap,

229
0:12:29.59,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to study the microbes in and on a variety of people.

230
0:12:33.504,000 --> 0:12:37,000
So, in wrapping up, what I want to tell you about is,

231
0:12:38.094,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I didn't tell you a part of the story of coming down with diabetes.

232
0:12:41.301,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It turns out that my father was an M.D.,

233
0:12:44.065,000 --> 0:12:48,000
actually studied hormones. I told him many times

234
0:12:48.537,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that I was tired, thirsty, not feeling very good.

235
0:12:53.327,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And he shrugged it off, I think he either thought

236
0:12:56.206,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I was just complaining a lot, or it was the typical

237
0:12:59.485,000 --> 0:13:01,000
M.D. "nothing can be wrong with my children."

238
0:13:02.104,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We even went to the International Society of Endocrinology

239
0:13:05.325,000 --> 0:13:07,000
meeting as family in Quebec.

240
0:13:07.455,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And I was getting up every five minutes to pee,

241
0:13:12.949,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and drinking everybody's water at the table,

242
0:13:15.384,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and I think they all thought I was a druggie.

243
0:13:18.318,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

244
0:13:20.038,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But the reason I'm telling you this is that

245
0:13:22.014,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the medical community, my father as an example,

246
0:13:25.014,000 --> 0:13:28,000
sometimes doesn't see what's right in front of their eyes.

247
0:13:28.581,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The microbial cloud, it is right in front of us.

248
0:13:32.566,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We can't see it most of the time. It's invisible.

249
0:13:35.366,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They're microbes. They're tiny.

250
0:13:36.837,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But we can see them through their DNA,

251
0:13:39.789,000 --> 0:13:42,000
we can see them through the effects that they have on people.

252
0:13:43.038,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And what we need now

253
0:13:44.656,000 --> 0:13:47,000
is to start thinking about this microbial community in the context

254
0:13:48.325,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of everything in human medicine.

255
0:13:50.838,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It doesn't mean that it affects every part of us,

256
0:13:53.905,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but it might.

257
0:13:55.304,000 --> 0:13:58,000
What we need is a full field guide to the microbes

258
0:13:59.229,000 --> 0:14:02,000
that live in and on people, so that we can understand

259
0:14:02.622,000 --> 0:14:05,000
what they're doing to our lives.

260
0:14:05.894,000 --> 0:14:08,000
We are them. They are us.

261
0:14:08.965,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Thank you.

262
0:14:10.293,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

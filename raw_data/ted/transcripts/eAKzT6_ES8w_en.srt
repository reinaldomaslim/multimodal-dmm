0:00:13.666,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What is the most beautiful place you have ever been?

3
0:00:17.778,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And when you were there, did you take a picture of it?

4
0:00:21.359,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Here's a place that tops that list for me.

5
0:00:23.785,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is Mesa Arch in Canyonlands National Park in Utah

6
0:00:27.276,000 --> 0:00:28,000
at sunrise.

7
0:00:28.455,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's the traditional homeland of the Pueblo, Ute,

8
0:00:31.114,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Paiute and Navajo people,

9
0:00:33.029,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and when you are there,

10
0:00:34.667,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it is absolutely stunning.

11
0:00:36.476,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The sunrise illuminates the bottom of the arch orange,

12
0:00:39.597,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and then behind it you see the buttes and clouds and cliffs.

13
0:00:43.822,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But what you might not see from my photo here

14
0:00:46.033,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is the 30 people behind me who were also taking photos.

15
0:00:49.611,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And these are just the committed people, the sunrise people, right?

16
0:00:52.866,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So when you think about that,

17
0:00:54.501,000 --> 0:00:59,000
there must be hundreds if not thousands of photos of Mesa Arch taken every week.

18
0:00:59.876,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I've been sharing my photography on Instagram for years,

19
0:01:03.162,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and it started to become really interesting and funny, even,

20
0:01:07.769,000 --> 0:01:1,000
just how many similar photos of the same places

21
0:01:11.371,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I started to see online.

22
0:01:13.125,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I was participating in it.

23
0:01:15.784,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So this made me wonder:

24
0:01:17.114,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Why are we taking photos in the first place?

25
0:01:20.239,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Sometimes, I visit a popular landmark --

26
0:01:23.045,000 --> 0:01:26,000
this one is Horseshoe Bend in Arizona --

27
0:01:26.112,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I see all the people with their phones and cameras out

28
0:01:28.886,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who snap a photo,

29
0:01:30.078,000 --> 0:01:33,000
just to turn and get back in the car or walk back to the trailhead.

30
0:01:33.359,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And sometimes it seems like we are missing the point

31
0:01:37.211,000 --> 0:01:41,000
of going to this place to experience it for ourselves

32
0:01:41.606,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or to see it with our own eyes.

33
0:01:44.858,000 --> 0:01:45,000
When I'm behind the camera,

34
0:01:46.385,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I notice the smallest details:

35
0:01:49.011,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the layers of light in the mountains

36
0:01:51.743,000 --> 0:01:53,000
as the light fades at the end of the day;

37
0:01:54.217,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the shapes that nature so expertly makes,

38
0:01:57.495,000 --> 0:01:59,000
abstract and yet completely perfect.

39
0:02:00.978,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I could go on and on here musing about the intricacies of this planet

40
0:02:04.612,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and the way that it makes me feel.

41
0:02:07.544,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Photographing the beauty and complexity of this world

42
0:02:10.746,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for me is like making a portrait of someone that I love.

43
0:02:14.164,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And when I make a photograph,

44
0:02:15.598,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I have to think about what I want it to say.

45
0:02:18.888,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I have to ask myself what I want it to feel like.

46
0:02:21.927,000 --> 0:02:23,000
When you're communicating through an image,

47
0:02:24.057,000 --> 0:02:25,000
every creative choice matters.

48
0:02:25.896,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Sometimes, I plan to share my images,

49
0:02:27.917,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and other times, I take them just for myself.

50
0:02:30.48,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I currently host a video series on the future of the outdoors,

51
0:02:33.445,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and for one of the episodes we wanted to explore

52
0:02:36.311,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the relationship between photography and outdoor spaces.

53
0:02:39.888,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I learned about the research of Kristin Diehl

54
0:02:42.043,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and her colleagues at USC,

55
0:02:43.553,000 --> 0:02:46,000
who studied photo-taking's effect on enjoyment levels.

56
0:02:46.725,000 --> 0:02:48,000
They found that when we're behind the camera,

57
0:02:49.159,000 --> 0:02:5,000
when we're the ones taking the picture,

58
0:02:51.079,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we enjoy our experiences more, not less.

59
0:02:53.68,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But it wasn't true all the time.

60
0:02:55.248,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If the person took the photo solely with the intention of sharing it,

61
0:02:59.083,000 --> 0:03:,000
there was no increase in enjoyment,

62
0:03:00.808,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because they didn't do it for themselves.

63
0:03:03.062,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So this points to an important distinction:

64
0:03:05.504,000 --> 0:03:07,000
photography can enhance your experience

65
0:03:07.937,000 --> 0:03:08,000
if it's done intentionally.

66
0:03:09.769,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The intention piece is what matters.

67
0:03:12.691,000 --> 0:03:15,000
As a photographer, I've really had to check myself on this.

68
0:03:15.83,000 --> 0:03:17,000
When does it help me to have my camera out,

69
0:03:18.395,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and when do I just need to put it away?

70
0:03:20.663,000 --> 0:03:24,000
On a trip to Alaska, I had the opportunity to photograph Alaskan brown bears.

71
0:03:25.322,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I was on a boat with four other photographers,

72
0:03:27.656,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and we were all having our minds blown

73
0:03:30.153,000 --> 0:03:31,000
at the same time

74
0:03:31.42,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in such close proximity to these animals.

75
0:03:34.004,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's an emotional experience.

76
0:03:36.208,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Being eye to eye with these bears gave me a feeling of connection

77
0:03:39.569,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that transcends words,

78
0:03:41.133,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and having my camera with me in this case enhanced that.

79
0:03:45.698,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We were all creating independently but also all completely in the moment,

80
0:03:49.362,000 --> 0:03:5,000
both with nature and with each other.

81
0:03:51.374,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I so clearly remember

82
0:03:52.864,000 --> 0:03:55,000
capturing the water droplets and the motion as the bears swam

83
0:03:56.455,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and the cute cubs following their mothers.

84
0:03:59.793,000 --> 0:04:01,000
That group and I will have that experience together

85
0:04:02.506,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and these images to look back on

86
0:04:04.417,000 --> 0:04:05,000
time and time again,

87
0:04:05.613,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and photography is what enabled us to share this in the first place.

88
0:04:10.518,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Other times, I choose to leave the camera behind,

89
0:04:12.959,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and I think that choice ultimately improves both my experience

90
0:04:16.821,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and my work.

91
0:04:18.672,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I recently flew to the South Pacific island of Tonga

92
0:04:21.776,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to swim with humpback whales.

93
0:04:23.887,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I noticed myself feeling pressure

94
0:04:26.288,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and a certain obligation to take the camera with me,

95
0:04:29.17,000 --> 0:04:32,000
when sometimes I just wanted the pure experience itself.

96
0:04:32.37,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And the experience is seriously amazing.

97
0:04:34.82,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You're talking about being in the water

98
0:04:36.729,000 --> 0:04:38,000
with a curious baby animal the size of a station wagon

99
0:04:39.517,000 --> 0:04:42,000
while you are surrounded by particles that float around you like glitter,

100
0:04:43.296,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and the mom swims gracefully below you.

101
0:04:46.068,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There were times, obviously, when I did take my camera with me,

102
0:04:49.117,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and those were really amazing to capture as well.

103
0:04:52.104,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But the setup is pretty big.

104
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's like this big box. This is what it looks like.

105
0:04:56.527,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so this is between me and the whales,

106
0:04:58.607,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and at times that feels like a block between you and reality.

107
0:05:02.294,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Is there a difference when it's just your phone?

108
0:05:05.135,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Last year, I went to Uluru in Central Australia,

109
0:05:07.682,000 --> 0:05:1,000
which is this massive rock that towers over the desert.

110
0:05:11.666,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This is sacred land to Anangu,

111
0:05:14.545,000 --> 0:05:16,000
who are the Aboriginal people from this area

112
0:05:16.657,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the traditional owners of the land.

113
0:05:19.455,000 --> 0:05:23,000
There are particular spots in Uluru that you cannot photograph professionally,

114
0:05:23.927,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because they are culturally sensitive,

115
0:05:26.508,000 --> 0:05:28,000
equivalent to sacred scripture to Anangu.

116
0:05:29.494,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So because of this, most of my photographs are from either far away, like this one,

117
0:05:34.056,000 --> 0:05:36,000
or from specific angles in the park.

118
0:05:36.985,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You could say that some of the most interesting and beautiful visuals in Uluru

119
0:05:41.514,000 --> 0:05:43,000
are located in these sensitive areas,

120
0:05:43.95,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but the request not to photograph them is an explicit and direct invitation

121
0:05:49.535,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to learn more about the land, its importance and its people.

122
0:05:53.648,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Isn't that what we should be doing anyway?

123
0:05:55.937,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So my visit to Uluru quickly became not about me

124
0:05:58.987,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but about connecting with the place.

125
0:06:02.983,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Ironically and unsurprisingly,

126
0:06:04.489,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I have found that presence and connection

127
0:06:06.646,000 --> 0:06:09,000
also happens to make for more compelling images.

128
0:06:10.413,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We can probably all point to social media

129
0:06:12.799,000 --> 0:06:15,000
as being a good place to share the images from our travels and from our lives.

130
0:06:17.255,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We not only share pieces of the world that we have seen

131
0:06:20.168,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but also parts of our day-to-day experiences.

132
0:06:22.664,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And if we're applying intentionality to the photos we take,

133
0:06:26.531,000 --> 0:06:29,000
then hopefully we're sharing intentionally too.

134
0:06:30.38,000 --> 0:06:35,000
For me, allowing people to see pieces of my story and my perspective online

135
0:06:35.49,000 --> 0:06:37,000
has reminded me that I'm not alone.

136
0:06:38.252,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's helped me build support and community

137
0:06:40.499,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to do the same for others.

138
0:06:43.212,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Let me be clear:

139
0:06:44.406,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I am not trying to discourage you from taking photos.

140
0:06:48.688,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Even if thousands of people have been to whatever exact location

141
0:06:52.455,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and taken whatever exact photo,

142
0:06:54.607,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I encourage you to get out and create too.

143
0:06:56.96,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The world needs every voice and perspective,

144
0:06:59.31,000 --> 0:07:,000
and yours is included.

145
0:07:01.64,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But what I'm trying to show you is that the phone or camera

146
0:07:04.882,000 --> 0:07:05,000
doesn't have to stay out all the time.

147
0:07:07.376,000 --> 0:07:08,000
What I'm trying to encourage you to do

148
0:07:09.245,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is to put it away, just for a moment --

149
0:07:11.806,000 --> 0:07:12,000
a moment for you.

150
0:07:13.67,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So let's go back to Mesa Arch,

151
0:07:15.375,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the way that the rock glows orange

152
0:07:17.718,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and the lovely layers of blue in the background.

153
0:07:21.846,000 --> 0:07:23,000
What if the next time you were somewhere amazing,

154
0:07:24.648,000 --> 0:07:26,000
you couldn't bring your camera or phone?

155
0:07:27.601,000 --> 0:07:29,000
What if you were not allowed to take any pictures at all?

156
0:07:31.035,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Would it feel like a limitation?

157
0:07:33.618,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Or would it feel like a relief?

158
0:07:36.983,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So what can we do?

159
0:07:38.183,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Well, the next time you feel the impulse to take out your camera or phone,

160
0:07:42.041,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or, in my case, once you realize you have already pulled it out --

161
0:07:45.366,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

162
0:07:46.47,000 --> 0:07:47,000
First: stop.

163
0:07:48.567,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Pause.

164
0:07:49.903,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Take a deep breath.

165
0:07:52.148,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Look around. What do you notice?

166
0:07:56.045,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Are you experiencing this moment with someone else?

167
0:07:59.191,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Remember that this moment only comes once.

168
0:08:02.267,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Photography can be part of a beautiful experience.

169
0:08:05.304,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Just don't let it be a block between you and reality.

170
0:08:08.527,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Be intentional,

171
0:08:09.964,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and don't lose a beautiful, irreplaceable memory,

172
0:08:13.618,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because you were too focused on getting the shot.

173
0:08:16.677,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Thank you.

174
0:08:17.935,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.708,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So when I was a little girl,

2
0:00:14.583,000 --> 0:00:17,000
a book sat on the coffee table in our living room,

3
0:00:17.917,000 --> 0:00:19,000
just steps from our front door.

4
0:00:19.958,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And the living room is a first impression.

5
0:00:22.5,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Ours had white carpet

6
0:00:24.125,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and a curio of my mother's most treasured collectibles.

7
0:00:28.875,000 --> 0:00:32,000
That room represented the sacrifices of generations gone by

8
0:00:33.458,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who, by poverty or by policy,

9
0:00:36.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
couldn't afford a curio of collectibles

10
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
let alone a middle class house to put them in.

11
0:00:42.292,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That room had to stay perfect.

12
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But I would risk messing up that perfect room every day

13
0:00:48.792,000 --> 0:00:5,000
just to see that book.

14
0:00:51.708,000 --> 0:00:54,000
On the cover sat a woman named Septima Clark.

15
0:00:55.208,000 --> 0:00:59,000
She sat in perfect profile with her face raised to the sky.

16
0:01:00.125,000 --> 0:01:02,000
She had perfect salt-and-pepper cornrows

17
0:01:02.75,000 --> 0:01:03,000
platted down the sides of her head,

18
0:01:04.583,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and pride and wisdom just emanated from her dark skin.

19
0:01:09.5,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Septima Clark was an activist and an educator,

20
0:01:12.208,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a woman after whom I'd eventually model my own career.

21
0:01:16.792,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But more than all the words she ever spoke,

22
0:01:19.292,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that single portrait of Septima Clark,

23
0:01:22.333,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it defined confidence for me

24
0:01:24.833,000 --> 0:01:26,000
before I ever even knew the word.

25
0:01:27.583,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It may sound simple,

26
0:01:28.917,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but confidence is something that we underestimate the importance of.

27
0:01:33.792,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We treat it like a nice-to-have instead of a must-have.

28
0:01:37.292,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We place value on knowledge and resources

29
0:01:40.792,000 --> 0:01:44,000
above what we deem to be the soft skill of confidence.

30
0:01:45.167,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But by most measures, we have more knowledge

31
0:01:47.875,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and more resources now than at any other point in history,

32
0:01:51.083,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and still injustice abounds and challenges persist.

33
0:01:56.667,000 --> 0:01:58,000
If knowledge and resources were all that we needed,

34
0:01:59.625,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we wouldn't still be here.

35
0:02:01.958,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I believe that confidence is one of the main things

36
0:02:04.625,000 --> 0:02:05,000
missing from the equation.

37
0:02:07.208,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I'm completely obsessed with confidence.

38
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's been the most important journey of my life,

39
0:02:12.292,000 --> 0:02:15,000
a journey that, to be honest, I'm still on.

40
0:02:15.458,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows.

41
0:02:21.167,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Confidence is the difference between being inspired

42
0:02:24.667,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and actually getting started,

43
0:02:27.125,000 --> 0:02:31,000
between trying and doing until it's done.

44
0:02:31.167,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Confidence helps us keep going even when we failed.

45
0:02:36.125,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The name of the book on that coffee table was "I Dream A World,"

46
0:02:41.083,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and today I dream a world where revolutionary confidence

47
0:02:45.625,000 --> 0:02:5,000
helps bring about our most ambitious dreams into reality.

48
0:02:50.958,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's exactly the kind of world that I wanted to create in my classroom

49
0:02:54.417,000 --> 0:02:55,000
when I was a teacher,

50
0:02:55.75,000 --> 0:02:57,000
like a Willy Wonka world of pure imagination,

51
0:02:58.458,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but make it scholarly.

52
0:03:01.083,000 --> 0:03:04,000
All of my students were black or brown.

53
0:03:04.375,000 --> 0:03:06,000
All of them were growing up in a low-income circumstance.

54
0:03:08.167,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Some of them were immigrants, some of them were disabled,

55
0:03:11.208,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but all of them were the very last people

56
0:03:14.208,000 --> 0:03:16,000
this world invites to be confident.

57
0:03:17.875,000 --> 0:03:2,000
That's why it was so important that my classroom be a place

58
0:03:21.333,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where my students could build the muscle of confidence,

59
0:03:24.75,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where they could learn to face each day with the confidence you need

60
0:03:28.208,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to redesign the world in the image of your own dreams.

61
0:03:32.375,000 --> 0:03:36,000
After all, what are academic skills without the confidence to use those skills

62
0:03:37.375,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to go out and change the world.

63
0:03:40.208,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now is when I should tell you about two of my students, Jamal and Regina.

64
0:03:44.083,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now, I've changed their names, but their stories remain the same.

65
0:03:47.875,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Jamal was brilliant, but unfocused.

66
0:03:51.375,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He would squirm in his chair during independent work,

67
0:03:54.167,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and he would never stay still for more than three or four minutes.

68
0:03:58.208,000 --> 0:04:,000
Students like Jamal can perplex brand new teachers

69
0:04:00.875,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because they're not quite sure how to support young people like him.

70
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I took a direct approach.

71
0:04:07.458,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I negotiated with Jamal.

72
0:04:10.375,000 --> 0:04:11,000
If he could give me focused work,

73
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
then he could do it from anywhere in the classroom,

74
0:04:14.458,000 --> 0:04:16,000
from our classroom rug, from behind my desk,

75
0:04:17.083,000 --> 0:04:21,000
from inside his classroom locker, which turned out to be his favorite place.

76
0:04:22.458,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Jamal's least favorite subject was writing,

77
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and he never wanted to read what he had written out loud in class,

78
0:04:28.625,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but we were still making progress.

79
0:04:31.041,000 --> 0:04:35,000
One day, I decided to host a mock 2008 presidential election

80
0:04:35.167,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in my classroom.

81
0:04:36.5,000 --> 0:04:39,000
My third graders had to research and write a stump speech

82
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:41,000
for their chosen candidate:

83
0:04:41.417,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or John McCain.

84
0:04:45.292,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The heavy favorites were obvious,

85
0:04:47.292,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but one student chose John McCain.

86
0:04:50.375,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It was Jamal.

87
0:04:52.583,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Jamal finally decided to read something that he had written out loud in class,

88
0:04:57.375,000 --> 0:05:,000
and sure enough, Jamal stunned all of us with his brilliance.

89
0:05:01.25,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Just like Jamal's dad, John McCain was a veteran,

90
0:05:05.333,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and just like Jamal's dad protected him,

91
0:05:07.625,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Jamal believed that John McCain would protect the entire country.

92
0:05:11.792,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And he wasn't my candidate of choice, but it didn't matter,

93
0:05:14.625,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because the entire class erupted into applause,

94
0:05:18.792,000 --> 0:05:2,000
a standing ovation for our brave friend Jamal

95
0:05:21.667,000 --> 0:05:24,000
who finally showed up as his most confident self

96
0:05:25.167,000 --> 0:05:26,000
for the first time that year.

97
0:05:28.208,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And then there was Regina.

98
0:05:30.583,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Regina was equally as brilliant, but active.

99
0:05:33.458,000 --> 0:05:35,000
She'd inevitably finish her work early,

100
0:05:36.042,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and then she'd get on about the business of distracting other students.

101
0:05:39.833,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:41.167,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Walking, talking,

103
0:05:43.458,000 --> 0:05:45,000
passing those notes that teachers hate but kids love.

104
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You look like you passed a lot of them.

105
0:05:47.917,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:49.292,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Despite my high ideals for our classroom,

107
0:05:52.708,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I would too often default to my baser instincts,

108
0:05:56.208,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and I would choose compliance over confidence.

109
0:05:59.875,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Regina was a glitch in my intended system.

110
0:06:03.75,000 --> 0:06:05,000
A good teacher can correct misbehavior

111
0:06:06.417,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but still remain a student's champion.

112
0:06:08.292,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But on one day in particular,

113
0:06:10.458,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I just plain old chose control.

114
0:06:13.167,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I snapped,

115
0:06:14.875,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and my approach didn't communicate to Regina

116
0:06:17.458,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that she was being a distraction.

117
0:06:20.083,000 --> 0:06:24,000
My approach communicated to Regina that she herself was a distraction.

118
0:06:26.042,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I watched the light go out from her eyes,

119
0:06:28.292,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and that light sparked joy in our classroom.

120
0:06:31.875,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I had just extinguished it.

121
0:06:34.042,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The entire class became irritable,

122
0:06:36.708,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and we didn't recover for the rest of the day.

123
0:06:40.25,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I think about the day often,

124
0:06:42.708,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and I have literally prayed that I did not do irreparable harm,

125
0:06:47.25,000 --> 0:06:52,000
because as a woman who used to be a little girl just like Regina,

126
0:06:52.833,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I know that I could have started the process of killing her confidence

127
0:06:56.958,000 --> 0:06:57,000
forever.

128
0:06:58.833,000 --> 0:07:01,000
A lack of confidence pulls us down from the bottom

129
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and weighs us down from the top,

130
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
crushing us between a flurry of can'ts, won'ts and impossibles.

131
0:07:09.208,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Without confidence, we get stuck,

132
0:07:11.833,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and when we get stuck, we can't even get started.

133
0:07:16.083,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Instead of getting mired in what can get in our way,

134
0:07:18.667,000 --> 0:07:22,000
confidence invites us to perform with certainty.

135
0:07:22.708,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We all operate a little differently when we're sure we can win

136
0:07:25.792,000 --> 0:07:27,000
versus if we just hope we will.

137
0:07:28.542,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Now, this can be a helpful check.

138
0:07:30.542,000 --> 0:07:31,000
If you don't have enough confidence,

139
0:07:32.333,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it could be because you need to readjust your goal.

140
0:07:35.083,000 --> 0:07:36,000
If you have too much confidence,

141
0:07:36.667,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it could be because you're not rooted in something real.

142
0:07:40.833,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Not everyone lacks confidence.

143
0:07:43.458,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We make it easier in this society for some people to gain confidence

144
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because they fit our preferred archetype of leadership.

145
0:07:52.833,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We reward confidence in some people

146
0:07:55.375,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and we punish confidence in others,

147
0:07:57.875,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and all the while far too many people

148
0:08:00.417,000 --> 0:08:03,000
are walking around every single day without it.

149
0:08:03.833,000 --> 0:08:05,000
For some of us,

150
0:08:06.25,000 --> 0:08:08,000
confidence is a revolutionary choice,

151
0:08:09.833,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and it would be our greatest shame

152
0:08:12.167,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to see our best ideas go unrealized

153
0:08:15.292,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and our brightest dreams go unreached

154
0:08:17.792,000 --> 0:08:2,000
all because we lacked the engine of confidence.

155
0:08:21.667,000 --> 0:08:23,000
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

156
0:08:24.792,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So how do we crack the code on confidence?

157
0:08:26.875,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In my estimation, it takes at least three things:

158
0:08:30.417,000 --> 0:08:33,000
permission, community and curiosity.

159
0:08:34.625,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Permission births confidence,

160
0:08:36.542,000 --> 0:08:38,000
community nurtures it

161
0:08:39.083,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and curiosity affirms it.

162
0:08:41.833,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In education, we've got a saying,

163
0:08:43.625,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that you can't be what you can't see.

164
0:08:46.375,000 --> 0:08:48,000
When I was a little girl, I couldn't show confidence

165
0:08:49.042,000 --> 0:08:51,000
until someone showed me.

166
0:08:51.207,000 --> 0:08:52,000
My family used to do everything together,

167
0:08:53.207,000 --> 0:08:55,000
including the mundane things, like buying a new car,

168
0:08:55.917,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and every time we did this,

169
0:08:57.458,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I'd watch my parents put on the exact same performance.

170
0:09:01.75,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We'd enter the dealership,

171
0:09:03.208,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and my dad would sit

172
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
while my mom shopped.

173
0:09:08.167,000 --> 0:09:1,000
When my mom found a car that she liked,

174
0:09:10.833,000 --> 0:09:12,000
they'd go in and meet with the dealer,

175
0:09:13.042,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and inevitably, every time the dealer would turn his attention

176
0:09:16.917,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and his body to my dad,

177
0:09:19.958,000 --> 0:09:21,000
assuming that he controlled the purse strings

178
0:09:22.333,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and therefore this negotiation.

179
0:09:24.333,000 --> 0:09:28,000
"Rev. Packnett," they'd say, "how do we get you into this car today?"

180
0:09:29.833,000 --> 0:09:32,000
My dad would inevitably respond the same way.

181
0:09:33.75,000 --> 0:09:37,000
He'd slowly and silently gesture toward my mother

182
0:09:38.625,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and then put his hands right back in his lap.

183
0:09:40.792,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It might have been the complete shock

184
0:09:42.75,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of negotiating finances with a black woman in the '80s,

185
0:09:45.625,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but whatever it was,

186
0:09:46.958,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I'd watch my mother work these car dealers over

187
0:09:50.458,000 --> 0:09:52,000
until they were basically giving the car away for free.

188
0:09:53.083,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

189
0:09:54.417,000 --> 0:09:55,000
She would never crack a smile.

190
0:09:56.958,000 --> 0:09:58,000
She would never be afraid to walk away.

191
0:10:00.333,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I know my mom just thought she was getting a good deal on a minivan,

192
0:10:04.25,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but what she was actually doing

193
0:10:06.417,000 --> 0:10:1,000
was giving me permission to defy expectations

194
0:10:11.083,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and to show up confidently in my skill no matter who doubts me.

195
0:10:15.75,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Confidence needs permission to exist

196
0:10:19.333,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and community is the safest place to try confidence on.

197
0:10:23.625,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I traveled to Kenya this year to learn about women's empowerment

198
0:10:26.708,000 --> 0:10:27,000
among Maasai women.

199
0:10:28.417,000 --> 0:10:3,000
There I met a group of young women

200
0:10:30.5,000 --> 0:10:31,000
called Team Lioness,

201
0:10:32.208,000 --> 0:10:36,000
among Kenya's first all-female community ranger groups.

202
0:10:36.625,000 --> 0:10:39,000
These eight brave young women were making history

203
0:10:39.792,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in just their teenage years,

204
0:10:41.333,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and I asked Purity, the most verbose young ranger among them,

205
0:10:45.583,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Do you ever get scared?"

206
0:10:47.542,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I swear to you, I want to tattoo her response all over my entire body.

207
0:10:51.833,000 --> 0:10:53,000
She said, "Of course I do,

208
0:10:54.625,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but I call on my sisters.

209
0:10:56.958,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They remind me that we will be better than these men

210
0:11:00.5,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and that we will not fail."

211
0:11:03.125,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Purity's confidence to chase down lions and catch poachers,

212
0:11:06.75,000 --> 0:11:1,000
it didn't come from her athletic ability or even just her faith.

213
0:11:11.125,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Her confidence was propped up by sisterhood,

214
0:11:14.833,000 --> 0:11:15,000
by community.

215
0:11:16.625,000 --> 0:11:19,000
What she was basically saying was that if I am ever in doubt,

216
0:11:20.583,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I need you to be there

217
0:11:22.917,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to restore my hope

218
0:11:24.833,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and to rebuild my certainty.

219
0:11:27.792,000 --> 0:11:31,000
In community, I can find my confidence

220
0:11:32.375,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and your curiosity can affirm it.

221
0:11:35.625,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Early in my career, I led a large-scale event

222
0:11:38.167,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that did not go exactly as planned.

223
0:11:40.417,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I'm lying to you. It was terrible.

224
0:11:43.167,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And when I debriefed the event with my manager,

225
0:11:45.583,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I just knew that she was going to run down the list

226
0:11:48.417,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of every mistake I had ever made,

227
0:11:50.75,000 --> 0:11:51,000
probably from birth.

228
0:11:52.25,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But instead, she opened with a question:

229
0:11:56.458,000 --> 0:11:57,000
What was your intention?

230
0:11:59.5,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I was surprised but relieved.

231
0:12:02.417,000 --> 0:12:04,000
She knew that I was already beating myself up,

232
0:12:05.333,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and that question invited me to learn from my own mistakes

233
0:12:09.833,000 --> 0:12:12,000
instead of damage my already fragile confidence.

234
0:12:13.75,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Curiosity invites people to be in charge of their own learning.

235
0:12:18.875,000 --> 0:12:21,000
That exchange, it helped me approach my next project

236
0:12:22.708,000 --> 0:12:24,000
with the expectation of success.

237
0:12:26.75,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Permission, community, curiosity:

238
0:12:31.042,000 --> 0:12:35,000
all of these are the things that we will need to breed the confidence

239
0:12:35.542,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that we'll absolutely need to solve our greatest challenges

240
0:12:39.625,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and to build the world we dream,

241
0:12:42.25,000 --> 0:12:47,000
a world where inequity is ended and where justice is real,

242
0:12:47.375,000 --> 0:12:5,000
a world where we can be free on the outside and free on the inside

243
0:12:50.625,000 --> 0:12:54,000
because we know that none of us are free until all of us are free.

244
0:12:55.208,000 --> 0:12:57,000
A world that isn't intimidated by confidence

245
0:12:57.958,000 --> 0:12:58,000
when it shows up as a woman

246
0:12:59.917,000 --> 0:13:,000
or in black skin

247
0:13:01.208,000 --> 0:13:05,000
or in anything other than our preferred archetypes of leadership.

248
0:13:05.792,000 --> 0:13:07,000
A world that knows that that kind of confidence

249
0:13:08.375,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is exactly the key we need to unlock the future that we want.

250
0:13:14.042,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I have enough confidence to believe that that world

251
0:13:16.958,000 --> 0:13:18,000
will indeed come to pass,

252
0:13:19.292,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and that we are the ones to make it so.

253
0:13:22.583,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Thank you so much.

254
0:13:23.917,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

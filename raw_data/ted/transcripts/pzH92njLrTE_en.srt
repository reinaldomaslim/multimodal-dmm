1
0:00:13.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Music)

2
0:00:21.6,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Singing) It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well.

3
0:00:30.56,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle.

4
0:00:37.68,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Oh,

5
0:00:39.72,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and now the young monsieur and madame

6
0:00:45.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
have rung the chapel bell.

7
0:00:48.76,000 --> 0:00:51,000
C'est la vie, say the old folks,

8
0:00:51.84,000 --> 0:00:53,000
it goes to show you never can tell.

9
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:00:58,000
No, no.

10
0:01:02.28,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebuck sale.

11
0:01:11.24,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The coolerator was crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale.

12
0:01:18.2,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Oh,

13
0:01:20.2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but when Pierre found work,

14
0:01:24.64,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the little money comin' worked out well .

15
0:01:29.04,000 --> 0:01:31,000
C'est la vie, say the old folks,

16
0:01:31.96,000 --> 0:01:34,000
it goes to show you never can tell.

17
0:01:37.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You never can tell.

18
0:01:42.64,000 --> 0:01:47,000
They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53.

19
0:01:51.56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They drove it down to New Orleans to celebrate their anniversary.

20
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Oh,

21
0:02:00.6,000 --> 0:02:04,000
it was there where Pierre

22
0:02:05.08,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was wedded to the lovely mademoiselle.

23
0:02:09.56,000 --> 0:02:11,000
C'est la vie, say the old folks,

24
0:02:12.48,000 --> 0:02:15,000
it goes to show you never can tell.

25
0:02:16.4,000 --> 0:02:17,000
No, no,

26
0:02:18.08,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you never can tell.

27
0:02:20.919,000 --> 0:02:21,000
No, no,

28
0:02:22.56,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you never can tell.

29
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You never can tell.

30
0:02:31.44,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You never can tell.

31
0:02:34.24,000 --> 0:02:35,000
No, no,

32
0:02:35.96,000 --> 0:02:37,000
you never can tell.

33
0:02:40.4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Applause and cheers)

34
0:02:47.64,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Thank you.

35
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I recently had the tremendous opportunity of searching for gold

36
0:02:54.04,000 --> 0:02:58,000
in the vast mine of songs released by Chess Records,

37
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a Chicago-based label that was really very active in the '50s and '60s in the US

38
0:03:03.64,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and that music spread all over the world.

39
0:03:06.76,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And the songs that I'm singing tonight

40
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
are from an album that I just put out called, "Playing Chess,"

41
0:03:12.68,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that pays homage to those songs.

42
0:03:15.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And these guys were really the innovators of rock 'n' roll and soul and R&B

43
0:03:19.88,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as we now know it.

44
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Applause)

45
0:03:26.52,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Music)

46
0:03:28.64,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Singing) Over the mountain,

47
0:03:32.72,000 --> 0:03:34,000
across the sea,

48
0:03:36.36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
there's a girl waiting,

49
0:03:41.32,000 --> 0:03:45,000
she's waiting for ...

50
0:03:46.68,000 --> 0:03:48,000
me.

51
0:03:49.44,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Music)

52
0:04:03.2,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Over the river,

53
0:04:06.28,000 --> 0:04:09,000
beyond every cloud,

54
0:04:09.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
she's passed the wind blowin' loud.

55
0:04:17.12,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Over the mountain,

56
0:04:19.32,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a girl waits for me.

57
0:04:24.72,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Music)

58
0:04:31.04,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Tell the sands,

59
0:04:33.64,000 --> 0:04:36,000
every blade of grass,

60
0:04:37.52,000 --> 0:04:42,000
please tell the wind to let my love pass.

61
0:04:44.84,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Over the mountain,

62
0:04:47.08,000 --> 0:04:51,000
a girl waits for me.

63
0:04:58.84,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Tell the moon up --

64
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
up in the sky.

65
0:05:05.4,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Tell all the birds that fly on by

66
0:05:11.56,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that over and over the mountain ...

67
0:05:18.24,000 --> 0:05:23,000
my love waits for me.

68
0:05:24.76,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Oh,

69
0:05:26.72,000 --> 0:05:32,000
into each dark, starry night,

70
0:05:33.28,000 --> 0:05:35,000
oh, what a mystery

71
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that's sealed so tight.

72
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Over the mountain,

73
0:05:42.92,000 --> 0:05:46,000
a girl waits for me.

74
0:05:54.72,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Tell the moon up --

75
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:06:,000
up in the sky.

76
0:06:00.44,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Tell the birds that fly by

77
0:06:07.4,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that over and over the mountain

78
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
my love waits for me.

79
0:06:22.72,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Into each dark and starry night,

80
0:06:29.28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
oh, what a mystery

81
0:06:31.96,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that's sealed so tight.

82
0:06:36.72,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Over the mountains,

83
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:43,000
a girl waits for me.

84
0:06:47.64,000 --> 0:06:5,000
She waits for me.

85
0:06:52.4,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Oh, she waits for me.

86
0:07:00.68,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

87
0:07:05.24,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Oh,

88
0:07:07.8,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.

89
0:07:12.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Oh,

90
0:07:14.84,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,

91
0:07:19.406,000 --> 0:07:22,000
oh oh, oh oh.

92
0:07:26.473,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Applause and cheers)

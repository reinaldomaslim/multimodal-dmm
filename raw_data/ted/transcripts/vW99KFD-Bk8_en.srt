1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want you to put off your preconceptions,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And by the way, if I come across as a sort of

5
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
rabid, hippie conservationist,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
it's purely a figment of your imagination.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth

9
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.

10
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb,

11
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet.

12
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we?

13
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water.

14
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's not only because we like to drink lots of it,

15
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.

16
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And, of course, watch it fall from the sky

17
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and flow in our wonderful rivers,

18
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but for several other reasons as well.

19
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
When I was a kid, growing up in New York,

20
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are

21
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.

22
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And my mother, brave lady,

23
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
was partly to blame,

24
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
taking me to the New York Natural History Museum,

25
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
buying me books on snakes,

26
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and then starting this infamous career of mine,

27
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
which has culminated in

28
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of course, arriving in India 60 years ago,

29
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
brought by my mother, Doris Norden,

30
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.

31
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's been a roller coaster ride.

32
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Two animals, two iconic reptiles

33
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
really captivated me very early on.

34
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
One of them was the remarkable gharial.

35
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long

36
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in the northern rivers,

37
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and this charismatic snake, the king cobra.

38
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
What my purpose of the talk today really is,

39
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is to sort of indelibly scar your minds

40
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
with these charismatic and majestic creatures.

41
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Because this is what you will take away from here,

42
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a reconnection with nature, I hope.

43
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.

44
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
What you're seeing here is very recently shot images

45
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in a forest nearby here,

46
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of a female king cobra making her nest.

47
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,

48
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and then laying her eggs inside,

49
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],

50
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,

51
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and hatch into little baby king cobras.

52
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, she protects her eggs,

53
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and after three months,

54
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the babies finally do hatch out.

55
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality

56
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.

57
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
My first experience with king cobras was in '72

58
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
at a magical place called Agumbe,

59
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in Karnataka, this state.

60
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And it is a marvelous rain forest.

61
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This first encounter

62
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
was kind of like the

63
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.

64
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It really changed my life totally.

65
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And it brought me straight into the conservation fray.

66
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I ended up starting this research

67
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and education station in Agumbe,

68
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which you are all of course invited to visit.

69
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This is basically a base wherein

70
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we are trying to gather and learn

71
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
virtually everything about the biodiversity

72
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of this incredibly complex forest system,

73
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and try to hang on to what's there,

74
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,

75
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and of course, having a good time too.

76
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You can almost hear the drums

77
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.

78
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It was very important for us to get through to the people.

79
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And through the children is usually the way to go.

80
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got

81
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that steely thing that you end up

82
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.

83
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
They are interested.

84
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And it really works to start with them.

85
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.

86
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.

87
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,

88
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and was hanging around there for two or three days.

89
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The people of this part of India

90
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
worship the king cobra.

91
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.

92
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now we've caught more than 100 king cobras

93
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
over the last three years,

94
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and relocated them in nearby forests.

95
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures

96
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
[it was necessary] for us to actually insert

97
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.

98
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,

99
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
where the babies go after they hatch,

100
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and remarkable things like this you're about to see.

101
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.

102
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra

103
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
who had caught a venomous pit viper.

104
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.

105
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And king cobras feed only on snakes.

106
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,

107
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
what we'd call a "vadai" or a donut or something like that.

108
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Usually they eat something a bit larger.

110
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In this case a rather strange and inexplicable

111
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
activity happened over the last breeding season,

112
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,

113
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.

114
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We're still trying to explain and come to terms with

115
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
what is the evolutionary advantage of this.

116
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But they do also a lot of other remarkable things.

117
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact

118
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.

119
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
This male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.

120
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And they did this incredible ritual combat dance.

121
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,

122
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.

123
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It's just a wresting match,

124
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but a remarkable activity.

125
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now, what are we doing with all this information?

126
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
What's the point of all this?

127
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Well, the king cobra is literally

128
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
a keystone species in these rainforests.

129
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And our job is to convince the authorities

130
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that these forests have to be protected.

131
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And this is one of the ways we do it,

132
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
by learning as much as we can

133
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,

134
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in order to help protect trees, animals

135
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and of course the water sources.

136
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
You've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger

137
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which started back in the early '70s,

138
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.

139
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We were piloted, I could say,

140
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
by a highly autocratic stateswoman,

141
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
but who also had an incredible passion for environment.

142
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.

143
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And, just like Project Tiger,

144
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
our activities with the king cobra

145
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is to look at a species of animal

146
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so that we protect its habitat and everything within it.

147
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So, the tiger is the icon.

148
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And now the king cobra is a new one.

149
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
All the major rivers in south India

150
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
are sourced in the Western Ghats,

151
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
the chain of hills running along the west coast of India.

152
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It pours out millions of gallons every hour,

153
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,

154
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and washes many, many babies,

155
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and of course feeds many, many animals,

156
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
both domestic and wild,

157
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
produces thousands of tons of rice.

158
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And what do we do? How do we respond to this?

159
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,

160
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.

161
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
You drink it in peril of your life.

162
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And the thing is, it's not just big industry.

163
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It's not misguided river engineers

164
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
who are doing all this; it's us.

165
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage

166
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
are in water sources.

167
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Okay. Now we're going north, very far north.

168
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
North central India, the Chambal River

169
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is where we have our base.

170
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.

171
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It is an animal which has been on the Earth

172
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
for just about 100 million years.

173
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.

174
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It has remarkable features.

175
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Even though it grows to 20 feet long,

176
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.

177
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It does have big teeth, however,

178
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and it's kind of hard to convince people

179
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
if an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.

180
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But we, actually, back in the early '70s,

181
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
did surveys,

182
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and found that gharial were extremely rare.

183
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
In fact, if you see the map,

184
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the range of their original habitat

185
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan

186
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to the Irrawaddy in Burma.

187
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And now it's just limited to a couple of spots

188
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in Nepal and India.

189
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So, in fact at this point

190
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.

191
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So, starting in the mid-'70s

192
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
when conservation was at the fore,

193
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we were actually able to start projects which were

194
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
basically government supported

195
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests

196
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and release 5,000 baby gharial

197
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
back to the wild.

198
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.

199
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial

200
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
basking on the river again.

201
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.

202
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,

203
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
like sand mining, for example,

204
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,

205
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
not allowing the animals to breed anymore,

206
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we're looking at

207
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
even more problems building up for the gharial,

208
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
despite the early good intentions.

209
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Their nests hatching along the riverside

210
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.

211
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This was actually just taken last year.

212
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But then the monsoon arrives,

213
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or

214
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
there is always a barrage,

215
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.

216
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Luckily there is still a lot of interest.

217
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,

218
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,

219
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the World Wildlife Fund,

220
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,

221
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.

222
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But it's possibly, and definitely not enough.

223
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,

224
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.

225
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.

226
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Why? How could it happen?

227
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This is a relatively clean river.

228
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.

229
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,

230
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.

231
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So, in order to try to find out the answer to this,

232
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we got veterinarians from all over the world

233
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.

234
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.

235
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And we actually looked through

236
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.

237
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And it came down to something called gout,

238
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
which, as a result of kidney breakdown

239
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,

240
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and worse in the joints,

241
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
which made the gharial unable to swim.

242
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And it's a horribly painful death.

243
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Just downriver from the Chambal is the

244
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.

245
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it

246
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.

247
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,

248
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.

249
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial

250
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
was something in the food chain,

251
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
something in the fish they were eating.

252
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain

253
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
everything is affected, including us.

254
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.

255
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
In order to try to answer some of these questions,

256
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we again turn to technology,

257
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to biological technology, in this case,

258
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
again, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial,

259
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and actually following their movements. They're being watched

260
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
everyday as we speak, to try to find out

261
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
what this mysterious toxin is.

262
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.

263
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know

264
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
about the bandits, the dacoits

265
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.

266
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur

267
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
made an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.

268
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.

269
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But, again, heavy fishing pressures.

270
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
This is one of the last repositories of the

271
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Ganges river dolphin,

272
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
various species of turtles,

273
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
thousands of migratory birds,

274
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and fishing is causing problems like this.

275
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And now [these] new elements of human intolerance

276
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
for river creatures like the gharial

277
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
means that if they don't drown in the net,

278
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
then they simply cut their beaks off.

279
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Animals like the Ganges river dolphin

280
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which is just down to a few left,

281
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and it is also critically endangered.

282
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So, who is next? Us?

283
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Because we are all dependent on these water sources.

284
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So, we all know about the Narmada river,

285
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects

286
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
which displace people and wreck river systems

287
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
without providing livelihoods.

288
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And development just basically going berserk,

289
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
for a double figure growth index, basically.

290
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
So, we're not sure where this story is going to end,

291
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
whether it's got a happy or sad ending.

292
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And climate change is certainly going

293
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.

294
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
We're still working hard at it.

295
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.

296
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And the thing is, you know, the decision makers,

297
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
the folks in power,

298
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,

299
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.

300
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But out on the rivers there are still millions of people

301
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
who are in really bad shape.

302
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And it's a bleak future for them.

303
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.

304
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,

305
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and nothing to show for it. Incredible.

306
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So, people talk about political will.

307
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.

308
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Government cut through all the red tape,

309
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
we got foreign vets on it. It was great.

310
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So, we can do it.

311
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
But if you stroll down to the Yamuna

312
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
or to the Gomati in Lucknow,

313
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
or to the Adyar river in Chennai,

314
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,

315
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.

316
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
But I think the final note really is

317
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that we can do it.

318
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,

319
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the good old everyday folks

320
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
can actually bring these rivers back.

321
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And the final word is

322
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.

323
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river.

324
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And these are powerful water totems.

325
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.

326
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Namaste.

327
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Applause)

328
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Chris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.

329
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
You know, most people are terrified of snakes.

330
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And there might be quite a few people here who would be

331
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.

332
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Do you have those conversations with people?

333
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
How do you really get them to care?

334
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Romulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach,

335
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.

336
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
It's not like the teddy bear.

337
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
But I sort of -- there is an innocence in these animals.

338
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And when the average person looks at a cobra

339
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
going "Ssssss!" like that, they say, "My god,

340
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
look at that angry, dangerous creature."

341
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened

342
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
of something so dangerous as a human being.

343
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.

344
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Applause)

345
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
CA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.

346
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.

347
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
RW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.

348
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?

349
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,

350
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
or even cobras.

351
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.

352
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Whereas other king cobras

353
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
very often come into the human interface,

354
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
you know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.

355
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
This guy specializes in pit vipers.

356
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And the guy who is working there with them,

357
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
he's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha."

358
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Laughter)

359
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Now, the nusha means the high.

360
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.

361
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Laughter)

362
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
CA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.

363
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So I grew up in Orlando, Florida.

2
0:00:16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was the son of an aerospace engineer.

3
0:00:19.32,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I lived and breathed the Apollo program.

4
0:00:22.08,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We either saw the launches from our backyard

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the Cape.

6
0:00:27.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was impressed by, obviously, space and everything about it,

7
0:00:30.722,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I was most impressed by the engineering that went into it.

8
0:00:34.72,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Behind me you see an amazing view,

9
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a picture that was taken from the International Space Station,

10
0:00:41.36,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and it shows a portion of our planet

11
0:00:43.56,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that's rarely seen and rarely studied

12
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and almost never explored.

13
0:00:48.32,000 --> 0:00:5,000
That place is called the stratosphere.

14
0:00:50.88,000 --> 0:00:53,000
If you start on the planet and you go up and up and up,

15
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it gets colder and colder and colder,

16
0:00:56.64,000 --> 0:00:58,000
until you reach the beginning of the stratosphere,

17
0:00:59.04,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and then an amazing thing happens.

18
0:01:01.68,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It gets colder at a much slower rate, and then it starts warming up,

19
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and then it gets warmer and warmer

20
0:01:07.4,000 --> 0:01:11,000
until the point where you can almost survive without any protection,

21
0:01:12.36,000 --> 0:01:13,000
about zero degrees,

22
0:01:14.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and then you end up getting colder and colder,

23
0:01:17.519,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and that's the top of the stratosphere.

24
0:01:19.76,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It is one of the least accessible places on our planet.

25
0:01:23.72,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Most often, when it's visited,

26
0:01:25.48,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it's by astronauts who are blazing up at it

27
0:01:29.4,000 --> 0:01:31,000
at probably several times the speed of sound,

28
0:01:32.28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and they get a few seconds on the way up,

29
0:01:34.28,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and then they get this blazing ball of fire coming back in,

30
0:01:39.08,000 --> 0:01:4,000
on the way back in.

31
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But the question I asked is, is it possible to linger in the stratosphere?

32
0:01:45.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Is it possible to experience the stratosphere?

33
0:01:47.72,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Is it possible to explore the stratosphere?

34
0:01:54.64,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I studied this using my favorite search engine

35
0:01:57.44,000 --> 0:02:,000
for quite a while, about a year,

36
0:02:00.48,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then I made a scary phone call.

37
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It was a reference from a friend of mine to call Taber MacCallum

38
0:02:07.72,000 --> 0:02:09,000
from Paragon Space Development Corporation,

39
0:02:10.48,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and I asked him the question:

40
0:02:11.885,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is it possible to build

41
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a system to go into the stratosphere?

42
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And he said it was.

43
0:02:19.76,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And after a period of about three years, we proceeded to do just that.

44
0:02:26.48,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And on October 24 of last year,

45
0:02:29.68,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in this suit,

46
0:02:31.44,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I started on the ground,

47
0:02:33.72,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I went up in a balloon to 135,890 feet --

48
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but who's counting?

49
0:02:41.6,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:44.08,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Came back to Earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour.

51
0:02:49.8,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It was a four-minute and 27-second descent.

52
0:02:53.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And when I got to 10,000 feet, I opened a parachute and I landed.

53
0:02:58.12,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Applause)

54
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But this is really a science talk, and it's really an engineering talk,

55
0:03:10.08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and what was amazing to me about that experience

56
0:03:12.4,000 --> 0:03:16,000
is that Taber said, yes, I think we can build a stratospheric suit,

57
0:03:17.08,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and more than that, come down tomorrow

58
0:03:19.72,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and let's talk to the team that formed the core of the group

59
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that actually built it.

60
0:03:24.4,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And they did something which I think is important,

61
0:03:28.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which is they took the analogy of scuba diving.

62
0:03:32.12,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So in scuba diving,

63
0:03:33.84,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you have a self-contained system.

64
0:03:35.68,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You have everything that you could ever need.

65
0:03:38.04,000 --> 0:03:4,000
You have a scuba tank.

66
0:03:40.48,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You have a wetsuit.

67
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
You have visibility.

68
0:03:44.92,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that scuba is exactly this system,

69
0:03:47.68,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we're going to launch it into the stratosphere.

70
0:03:50.92,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Three years later, this is what we have.

71
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We've got an amazing suit that was made by ILC Dover.

72
0:03:58.88,000 --> 0:04:01,000
ILC Dover was the company that made all of the Apollo suits

73
0:04:02.36,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and all of the extravehicular activity suits.

74
0:04:04.8,000 --> 0:04:07,000
They had never sold a suit commercially,

75
0:04:08.08,000 --> 0:04:09,000
only to the government,

76
0:04:09.68,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but they sold one to me, which I am very grateful for.

77
0:04:13.32,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Up here we have a parachute. This was all about safety.

78
0:04:17.24,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Everyone on the team knew

79
0:04:22.08,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that I have a wife and two small children --

80
0:04:24.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
10 and 15 --

81
0:04:27.44,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I wanted to come back safely.

82
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So there's a main parachute and a reserve parachute,

83
0:04:31.973,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and if I do nothing,

84
0:04:33.76,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the reserve parachute is going to open because of an automatic opening device.

85
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The suit itself can protect me from the cold.

86
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This area in the front here has thermal protection.

87
0:04:43.28,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It will actually heat water that will wrap around my body.

88
0:04:46.48,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It has two redundant oxygen tanks.

89
0:04:48.96,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Even if I was to get a quarter-inch hole in this suit,

90
0:04:52.04,000 --> 0:04:54,000
which is extremely unlikely,

91
0:04:54.64,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this system would still protect me from the low pressure of space.

92
0:04:59.32,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The main advantage of this system is weight and complexity.

93
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So the system weighs about 500 pounds,

94
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and if you compare it to the other attempt recently to go up in the stratosphere,

95
0:05:09.84,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they used a capsule.

96
0:05:11.12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And to do a capsule, there's an amazing amount of complexity that goes into it,

97
0:05:15.12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and it weighed about 3,000 pounds,

98
0:05:17.08,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and to raise 3,000 pounds to an altitude of 135,000 feet,

99
0:05:21.8,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which was my target altitude,

100
0:05:23.96,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it would have taken a balloon that was 45 to 50 million cubic feet.

101
0:05:30.84,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Because I only weighed 500 pounds in this system,

102
0:05:34.2,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we could do it with a balloon that was five times smaller than that,

103
0:05:37.44,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and that allowed us to use a launch system that was dramatically simpler

104
0:05:41.88,000 --> 0:05:43,000
than what needs to be done for a much larger balloon.

105
0:05:45.48,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So with that, I want to take you to Roswell, New Mexico, on October 24.

106
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We had an amazing team that got up in the middle of the night.

107
0:05:53.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And here's the suit.

108
0:05:56.48,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Again, this is using the front loader that you'll see in a second,

109
0:05:59.64,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and I want to play you a video of the actual launch.

110
0:06:02.88,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Roswell's a great place to launch balloons,

111
0:06:04.92,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but it's a fantastic place to land under a parachute,

112
0:06:08.12,000 --> 0:06:12,000
especially when you're going to land 70 miles away from the place you started.

113
0:06:13.64,000 --> 0:06:15,000
That's a helium truck in the background.

114
0:06:16.36,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's darkness.

115
0:06:17.64,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I've already spent about an hour and a half pre-breathing.

116
0:06:20.88,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And then here you see the suit going on.

117
0:06:24.96,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It takes about an hour to get the suit on.

118
0:06:29.48,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Astronauts get this really nice air-conditioned van

119
0:06:33.24,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to go to the launch pad, but I got a front loader.

120
0:06:35.84,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:38.04,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You can see the top. You can see the balloon up there.

122
0:06:40.6,000 --> 0:06:41,000
That's where the helium is.

123
0:06:44.64,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is Dave clearing the airspace with the FAA for 15 miles.

124
0:06:52.36,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And there we go.

125
0:06:56.52,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:58.24,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That's me waving with my left hand.

127
0:06:59.96,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The reason I'm waving with my left hand

128
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is because on the right hand is the emergency cutaway.

129
0:07:04.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

130
0:07:06.32,000 --> 0:07:08,000
My team forbade me from using my right hand.

131
0:07:11.28,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So the trip up is beautiful. It's kind of like Google Earth in reverse.

132
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:17.48,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It took two hours and seven minutes to go up,

134
0:07:19.6,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and it was the most peaceful two hours and seven minutes.

135
0:07:22.36,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I was mostly trying to relax.

136
0:07:25.92,000 --> 0:07:27,000
My heart rate was very low

137
0:07:27.96,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and I was trying not to use very much oxygen.

138
0:07:31.84,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You can see how the fields in the background

139
0:07:34.6,000 --> 0:07:35,000
are relatively big at this point,

140
0:07:36.24,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and you can see me going up and up.

141
0:07:38.32,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's interesting here, because if you look,

142
0:07:40.36,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I'm right over the airport, and I'm probably at 50,000 feet,

143
0:07:43.76,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but immediately I'm about to go into a stratospheric wind

144
0:07:46.48,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of over 120 miles an hour.

145
0:07:51.44,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This is my flight director telling me that I had just gone higher

146
0:07:55.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
than anybody else had ever gone in a balloon,

147
0:07:57.44,000 --> 0:08:,000
and I was about 4,000 feet from release.

148
0:08:01.68,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is what it looks like.

149
0:08:06.24,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You can see the darkness of space, the curvature of the Earth,

150
0:08:10.08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the fragile planet below.

151
0:08:20.2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I'm practicing my emergency procedures mentally right now.

152
0:08:24.64,000 --> 0:08:26,000
If anything goes wrong, I want to be ready.

153
0:08:26.68,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And the main thing that I want to do here

154
0:08:28.88,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is to have a release and fall and stay completely stable.

155
0:08:35.32,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Video) Ground control. Everyone ready?

156
0:08:43.72,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Five. Four. Three. Two. One.

157
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Alan Eustace: There's the balloon going by, fully inflated at this point.

158
0:09:04.678,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And there you can see a drogue parachute, which I'll demonstrate in just a second,

159
0:09:08.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because that's really important.

160
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
There's the balloon going by a second time.

161
0:09:21.2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Right now, I'm about at the speed of sound.

162
0:09:24.64,000 --> 0:09:26,000
There's nothing for me to tell it's the speed of sound,

163
0:09:27.88,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and very soon I will actually be as fast as I ever get,

164
0:09:31.68,000 --> 0:09:32,000
822 miles an hour.

165
0:09:49.2,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Video) Ground control: We lost the data.

166
0:09:54.96,000 --> 0:09:55,000
AE: So now I'm down low right now

167
0:09:56.6,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and you can basically see the parachute come out right there.

168
0:10:01.92,000 --> 0:10:03,000
At this point, I'm very happy that there's a parachute out.

169
0:10:05.789,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I thought I was the only one happy,

170
0:10:07.48,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but it turns out mission control was really happy as well.

171
0:10:10.84,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The really nice thing about this is the moment I opened --

172
0:10:13.96,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I had a close of friend of mine, Blikkies, my parachute guy.

173
0:10:17.36,000 --> 0:10:19,000
He flew in another airplane, and he actually jumped out

174
0:10:20.32,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and landed right next to me.

175
0:10:22.32,000 --> 0:10:25,000
He was my wingman on the descent.

176
0:10:25.6,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is my landing, but it's probably more properly called a crash.

177
0:10:30.84,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Laughter)

178
0:10:35.08,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I hate to admit it, but this wasn't even close to my worst landing.

179
0:10:38.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

180
0:10:41.44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

181
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Video) Man: How are you doing?

182
0:11:01.68,000 --> 0:11:02,000
AE: Hi there!

183
0:11:07.28,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Yay.

184
0:11:08.52,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

185
0:11:10.84,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So I want to tell you one thing

186
0:11:12.36,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that you might not have seen in that video,

187
0:11:14.68,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but one of the most critical parts of the entire thing was the release

188
0:11:18.56,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and what happens right after you release.

189
0:11:21.44,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And what we tried to do was use something called a drogue parachute,

190
0:11:25.76,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and a drogue parachute was there to stabilize me.

191
0:11:28.48,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And I'll show you one of those right now.

192
0:11:30.56,000 --> 0:11:32,000
If any of you have ever gone tandem skydiving,

193
0:11:34.12,000 --> 0:11:35,000
you probably used one of these.

194
0:11:38.2,000 --> 0:11:39,000
But the problem with one of these things

195
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
is right when you release, you're in zero gravity.

196
0:11:43.12,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So it's very easy for this to just turn right around you.

197
0:11:46.76,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And before you know it, you can be tangled up or spinning,

198
0:11:51.32,000 --> 0:11:53,000
or you can release this drogue late,

199
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in which case what happens is you're going down at 800 miles an hour,

200
0:11:58.08,000 --> 0:12:,000
and this thing is going to destroy itself

201
0:12:00.6,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and not be very useful.

202
0:12:03.4,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But the guys at United Parachute Technologies came up with this idea,

203
0:12:07.72,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and it was a roll that looks like that,

204
0:12:09.68,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but watch what happens when I pull it out.

205
0:12:13.56,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's forming a pipe.

206
0:12:16.68,000 --> 0:12:18,000
This pipe is so solid

207
0:12:20.36,000 --> 0:12:23,000
that you can take this drogue parachute and wrap it around,

208
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and there's no way it will ever tangle with you.

209
0:12:27.68,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And that prevented a very serious potential problem.

210
0:12:31.56,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So nothing is possible without an amazing team of people.

211
0:12:34.52,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The core of this was about 20 people

212
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
that worked on this for the three years,

213
0:12:39.12,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and they were incredible.

214
0:12:40.76,000 --> 0:12:42,000
People asked me what the best part of this whole thing was,

215
0:12:43.56,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and it was a chance to work with the best experts

216
0:12:46.04,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in meteorology and ballooning and parachute technology

217
0:12:50.68,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and environmental systems and high altitude medicine.

218
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It was fantastic. It's an engineer's dream to work with that group of people.

219
0:12:59.32,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And I also at the same time wanted to thank my friends at Google,

220
0:13:02.6,000 --> 0:13:04,000
both for supporting me during this effort

221
0:13:05.48,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and also covering for me in the times that I was away.

222
0:13:08.8,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But there's one other group I wanted to thank, and that's my family.

223
0:13:12.12,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Yay.

224
0:13:13.36,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

225
0:13:19.6,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I would constantly give them speeches about the safety of technology,

226
0:13:23.32,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and they weren't hearing any of it.

227
0:13:27.08,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It was super hard on them,

228
0:13:28.48,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and the only reason that my wife put up with it

229
0:13:31.08,000 --> 0:13:36,000
was because I came back incredibly happy after each of the 250 tests,

230
0:13:36.6,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and she didn't want to take that away from me.

231
0:13:38.8,000 --> 0:13:39,000
So I want to close with a story.

232
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:44,000
My daughter Katelyn, my 15-year-old, she and I were in the car,

233
0:13:45.2,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and we were driving down the road, and she was sitting there,

234
0:13:48.68,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and she had this idea, and she goes, "Dad, I've got this idea."

235
0:13:52.08,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And so I listened to her idea and I said, "Katelyn, that's impossible."

236
0:13:57.32,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And she looks at me

237
0:13:58.96,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and she goes, "Dad, after what you just did,

238
0:14:02.32,000 --> 0:14:04,000
how can you call anything impossible?"

239
0:14:05.76,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And I laughed, and I said, "OK, it's not impossible,

240
0:14:09.04,000 --> 0:14:11,000
it's just very, very hard."

241
0:14:12.84,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And then I paused for a second, and I said, "Katelyn,

242
0:14:15.76,000 --> 0:14:18,000
it may not be impossible, it may not even be very, very hard,

243
0:14:19.52,000 --> 0:14:21,000
it's just that I don't know how to do it."

244
0:14:22.32,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Thank you.

245
0:14:23.56,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Applause)

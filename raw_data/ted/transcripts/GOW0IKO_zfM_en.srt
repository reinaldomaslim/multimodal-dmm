1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Dogs have interests.

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.

4
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought

5
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it,

6
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here,"

7
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.

8
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling."

9
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It's a difficult choice, right?

10
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Rear end, owner. Rear end wins.

11
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I mean, you lose.

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You cannot compete with the environment,

13
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
if you have an adolescent dog's brain.

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account

15
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the dog's point of view.

16
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, I'm here largely because

17
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment

18
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,

19
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
number one, by making up rules, human rules.

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We don't take the dog's point of view into account.

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."

23
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And then number three, now we can punish the dog

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.

26
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.

27
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --

28
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you know, isn't that nice?

29
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."

30
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
You bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.

31
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
he weighs, you know, 80 pounds.

33
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.

34
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get.

35
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So, this whole dominance issue -- number one,

36
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation

37
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
of a very complicated social system.

38
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And they take this stuff seriously.

39
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,

40
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
because it prevents physical fights.

41
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,

42
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.

43
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The number one is, "I have it, you don't."

44
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch

45
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.

46
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,

47
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this.

48
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Dogs get so abused.

49
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Dogs, horses and humans --

50
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
these are the three species which are so abused in life.

51
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And the reason is built into their behavior --

52
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is to always come back and apologize.

53
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
Like, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault."

54
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
They are just so beatable,

55
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and that's why they get beaten.

56
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?

57
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,

58
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,

59
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,

60
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards."

61
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Because he grew?

62
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?

63
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is insanity.

64
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?"

65
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess."

66
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I said, "Let's teach him to sit."

67
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And then we give him a reason for sitting.

68
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Because the first stage

69
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is basically teaching a dog ESL.

70
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."

71
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Go on, something should happen now.

72
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.

73
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Well, I've got news for you.

74
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French.

75
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,

76
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
English as a second language.

77
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And that's how we use the food lure in the hand,

78
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and we use food because we're dealing with owners.

79
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
My wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer,

80
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
much better than I am.

81
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I don't need food, but the average owner says,

82
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"Puppy, sit."

83
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit."

84
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,

85
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
like the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.

86
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You know, "Sit, sit."

87
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.

88
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Then we phase out the food as a lure,

89
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,

90
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and you can actually communicate to a dog

91
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in a perfectly constructed English sentence.

92
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."

93
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to"

94
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and the name of my son, "Jamie."

95
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the dog can take a note,

96
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.

97
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,

98
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,

99
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and take him a little message that says,

100
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."

101
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.

102
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Will it do it?

103
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Not necessarily, no.

104
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,

105
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
why come to the owner?

106
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.

107
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.

108
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing

109
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels.

110
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do

111
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
what we want him to do, and this is very easy.

112
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We use the Premack principle.

113
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --

114
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
one the dog doesn't want to do --

115
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,

116
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.

117
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.

118
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit,"

119
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.

120
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Yes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.

121
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"Sit," sniff butt.

122
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So now all of these distractions that worked against training

123
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
now become rewards that work for training.

124
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --

125
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.

126
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I can imagine this dog, you know,

127
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,

128
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
saying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.

129
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They're like Golden Retrievers.

130
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.

131
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,

132
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
they will throw tennis balls,

133
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
they will cook for me and serve the food.

134
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's like, if I just sit, that's my command.

135
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Then I have my own personal doorman,

136
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."

137
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And now the dog's really happy.

138
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And this, to me, is always what training is.

139
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So we really motivate the dog to want to do it,

140
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
such that the need for punishment seldom comes up.

141
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Now we move to phase three, when now --

142
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
there's times, you know, when daddy knows best.

143
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,

144
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
"Because I'm the daddy, that's why."

145
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Sorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit."

146
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And there's times, for example,

147
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
if my son's friends leave the door open,

148
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the dogs have to know you don't step across this line.

149
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This is a life-or-death thing.

150
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You leave this, the sanctity of your house,

151
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and you could be hit on the street.

152
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So some things we have to let the dog know,

153
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
"You mustn't do this."

154
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And so we have to enforce, but without force.

155
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
People here get very confused about what a punishment is.

156
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
They think a punishment is something nasty.

157
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I bet a lot of you do, right?

158
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.

159
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It doesn't have to be.

160
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
There's several definitions of what a punishment is,

161
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but one definition, the most popular, is:

162
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,

163
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
such that it's less likely to occur in the future.

164
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.

165
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be.

166
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.

167
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,

168
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.

169
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,

170
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and they never took it outside.

171
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The dog is actually euthanized now,

172
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but this was a dog I worked with for a while.

173
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,

174
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --

175
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.

176
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.

177
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
When the dog would try to leave the mat,

178
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
she would say, "Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat."

179
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,

180
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because we had a lot of aggression related towards food.

181
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The breaks got fewer and fewer.

182
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You see, the punishment was working.

183
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The behavior problem was going away.

184
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
She never raised her voice.

185
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
If she did, she would have got bitten.

186
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It's not a good dog you shout at.

187
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And a lot of my friends train really neat animals,

188
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear

189
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --

190
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
killer whales. I love it because it wires you up.

191
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?

192
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!

193
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?

194
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
This is crazy.

195
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So, where do we go from here?

196
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We want a better way.

197
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Dogs deserve better.

198
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.

199
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It has to do with watching people train puppies,

200
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,

201
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
horrendous relationship skills.

202
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.

203
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.

204
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,

205
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,

206
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.

207
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch."

208
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
The dog says, "I don't think so."

209
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
(Laughter)

210
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I mean, who in their right mind

211
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
would think that a dog would want to approach them

212
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
when they're screaming like that?

213
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Instead, the dog says, "I know that tone. I know that tone.

214
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."

215
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I was walking onto a plane --

216
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career,

217
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and it really cemented what I wanted to do

218
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
with this whole puppy-training thing,

219
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way

220
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.

221
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You know, I puppy-train my child.

222
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas,

223
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five,

224
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
kicking the back of the chair.

225
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
"Johnny, don't do that."

226
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Kick, kick, kick.

227
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick.

228
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I'm standing right here with my bag.

229
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.

230
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And ugly face is this --

231
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,

232
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"

233
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"

234
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
That child has lost everything --

235
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that one of the two people he can trust in this world

236
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.

237
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"

238
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."

239
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I walked to the back of the plane,

240
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I sat down, and a thought came to me.

241
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.

242
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Laughter)

243
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.

244
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.

245
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And this is what it's all about.

246
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
These relationship skills are so easy.

247
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate

248
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness.

249
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
You know, kind of like a little robot.

250
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.

251
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And then, a little behavior problem comes up.

252
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
No different from the dog barking.

253
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The husband won't clear up his clothes,

254
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?

255
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And it then starts, and we get into this thing,

256
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.

257
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people,

258
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.

259
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.

260
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,

261
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
especially with children, especially with parents.

262
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
You see it especially in the workplace,

263
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
especially from boss to employee.

264
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It's as if there's some schadenfreude there,

265
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong,

266
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.

267
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have.

268
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It really is.

269
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.

270
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.

271
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
You know, calculus is wonderful.

272
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.

273
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.

274
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics --

275
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
these are cool things.

276
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.

277
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And my look to the future is,

278
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people

279
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
that you know, your husband's just as easy to train.

280
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Probably easier -- if you got a Rottie -- much easier to train.

281
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Your kids are easy to train.

282
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
All you've got to do is to watch them,

283
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,

284
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"

285
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."

286
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
That is such a powerful training technique.

287
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
This should be taught in schools.

288
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Relationships -- how do you negotiate?

289
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?

290
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?

291
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
How on earth about raising children?

292
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
We think how we do it -- one night in bed, we're pregnant,

293
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.

294
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits,

295
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
which are just as hard to break as bad habits.

296
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So, that would be my wish to the future.

297
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time,

298
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two --

299
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.

300
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
(Applause)

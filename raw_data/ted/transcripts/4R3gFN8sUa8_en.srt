1
0:00:13.093,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What is history?

2
0:00:15.438,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It is something written by the winners.

3
0:00:20.203,000 --> 0:00:24,000
There is a stereotype that history should be focused on the rulers,

4
0:00:24.975,000 --> 0:00:25,000
like Lenin or Trotsky.

5
0:00:27.445,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As a result, people in many countries, like mine, Russia,

6
0:00:31.932,000 --> 0:00:34,000
look at history as something that was predetermined

7
0:00:35.433,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or determined by the leaders,

8
0:00:38.075,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and common people could not influence it in any way.

9
0:00:41.585,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Many Russians today do not believe that Russia could ever have been

10
0:00:45.189,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or ever will be a truly democratic nation,

11
0:00:48.026,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and this is due to the way history has been framed

12
0:00:51.011,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to the citizens of Russia.

13
0:00:52.606,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And this is not true.

14
0:00:55.011,000 --> 0:01:,000
To prove it, I spent two years of my life trying to go 100 years back,

15
0:01:00.796,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to the year 1917,

16
0:01:03.162,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the year of the Russian Revolution.

17
0:01:05.639,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I asked myself, what if the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago?

18
0:01:12.155,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So last year, we built a social network for dead people,

19
0:01:17.47,000 --> 0:01:19,000
named Project1917.com.

20
0:01:22.111,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My team and I created our software,

21
0:01:24.707,000 --> 0:01:29,000
digitized and uploaded all possible real diaries and letters

22
0:01:30.011,000 --> 0:01:33,000
written by more than 3,000 people

23
0:01:33.137,000 --> 0:01:34,000
100 years ago.

24
0:01:34.693,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So any user of our website or application

25
0:01:38.459,000 --> 0:01:42,000
can follow a news feed for each day of 1917

26
0:01:42.484,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and read what people like Stravinsky or Trotsky,

27
0:01:46.629,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Lenin or Pavlova and others thought and felt.

28
0:01:50.931,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We watch all those personalities being ordinary people like you and me,

29
0:01:55.66,000 --> 0:01:56,000
not demigods,

30
0:01:57.596,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and we see that history consists of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses,

31
0:02:04.604,000 --> 0:02:06,000
not only their "genius ideas."

32
0:02:08.643,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Our project was a shock for many Russians,

33
0:02:10.866,000 --> 0:02:15,000
who used to think that our country has always been an autocratic empire

34
0:02:16.491,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and the ideas of freedom and democracy could never have prevailed,

35
0:02:19.928,000 --> 0:02:21,000
just because democracy was not our destiny.

36
0:02:23.514,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But if we take a broader look,

37
0:02:26.291,000 --> 0:02:27,000
it's not that black and white.

38
0:02:29.771,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Yes, 1917 led to 70 years of communist dictatorship.

39
0:02:35.584,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But with this project, we see that Russia could have had a different history

40
0:02:40.257,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and a democratic future, as any other country could or still can.

41
0:02:45.249,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Reading the posts from 1917,

42
0:02:49.09,000 --> 0:02:51,000
you learn that Russia was the first country in the world

43
0:02:52.081,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to abolish the death penalty,

44
0:02:54.041,000 --> 0:02:58,000
or one of the first ones to grant women voting rights.

45
0:02:59.334,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Knowing history and understanding how ordinary people influenced history

46
0:03:05.583,000 --> 0:03:06,000
can help us create a better future,

47
0:03:07.465,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because history is just a rehearsal of what's happening right now.

48
0:03:12.5,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We do need new ways of telling history,

49
0:03:15.437,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and this year, for example,

50
0:03:17.032,000 --> 0:03:22,000
we started a new online project that is called 1968Digital.com,

51
0:03:23.681,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and that is an online documentary series

52
0:03:28.53,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that gives you an impression of that year, 1968,

53
0:03:32.498,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a year marked by global social change

54
0:03:36.061,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that, in many ways, created the world as we know it now.

55
0:03:40.327,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But we are making that history alive

56
0:03:43.461,000 --> 0:03:47,000
by imagining what if all the main characters could use mobile phones ...

57
0:03:49.299,000 --> 0:03:5,000
just like that?

58
0:03:51.906,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we see that a lot of individuals

59
0:03:57.477,000 --> 0:04:02,000
were facing the same challenges and were fighting for the same values,

60
0:04:02.749,000 --> 0:04:06,000
no matter if they lived in the US or in USSR

61
0:04:07.17,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or in France or in China or in Czechoslovakia.

62
0:04:11.345,000 --> 0:04:13,000
By exposing history in such a democratic way,

63
0:04:14.211,000 --> 0:04:15,000
through social media,

64
0:04:16.762,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we show that people in power are not the only ones making choices.

65
0:04:22.596,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That gives any user a possibility of reclaiming history.

66
0:04:27.191,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Ordinary people matter.

67
0:04:29.096,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They have an impact.

68
0:04:31.476,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Ideas matter.

69
0:04:33.471,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Journalists, scientists, philosophers matter.

70
0:04:38.542,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We shape society.

71
0:04:40.789,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We all make history.

72
0:04:43.436,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Thank you.

73
0:04:44.611,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Applause)

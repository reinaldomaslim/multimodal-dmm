1
0:00:12.864,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's August 5, 2010.

2
0:00:16.166,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A massive collapse at the San José Copper Mine in Northern Chile

3
0:00:20.305,000 --> 0:00:26,000
has left 33 men trapped half a mile -- that's two Empire State Buildings --

4
0:00:26.51,000 --> 0:00:28,000
below some of the hardest rock in the world.

5
0:00:30.522,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They will find their way to a small refuge designed for this purpose,

6
0:00:35.236,000 --> 0:00:39,000
where they will find intense heat, filth

7
0:00:39.34,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and about enough food for two men for 10 days.

8
0:00:43.436,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Aboveground, it doesn't take long

9
0:00:46.928,000 --> 0:00:49,000
for the experts to figure out that there is no solution.

10
0:00:50.56,000 --> 0:00:55,000
No drilling technology in the industry is capable of getting through rock

11
0:00:56.262,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that hard and that deep

12
0:00:58.719,000 --> 0:01:,000
fast enough to save their lives.

13
0:01:02.612,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's not exactly clear where the refuge is.

14
0:01:06.933,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It's not even clear if the miners are alive.

15
0:01:10.593,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And it's not even clear who's in charge.

16
0:01:12.629,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Yet, within 70 days, all 33 of these men will be brought to the surface alive.

17
0:01:19.09,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This remarkable story is a case study

18
0:01:22.724,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in the power of teaming.

19
0:01:24.678,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So what's "teaming"?

20
0:01:26.041,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Teaming is teamwork on the fly.

21
0:01:28.272,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's coordinating and collaborating with people

22
0:01:30.748,000 --> 0:01:31,000
across boundaries of all kinds --

23
0:01:32.737,000 --> 0:01:36,000
expertise, distance, time zone, you name it --

24
0:01:37.445,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to get work done.

25
0:01:39.209,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Think of your favorite sports team, because this is different.

26
0:01:42.808,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Sports teams work together: that magic, those game-saving plays.

27
0:01:47.817,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, sports teams win because they practice.

28
0:01:51.924,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But you can only practice if you have the same members over time.

29
0:01:56.413,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And so you can think of teaming ...

30
0:01:58.553,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Sports teams embody the definition of a team,

31
0:02:01.867,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the formal definition.

32
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's a stable, bounded, reasonably small group of people

33
0:02:07.285,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who are interdependent in achieving a shared outcome.

34
0:02:10.69,000 --> 0:02:13,000
You can think of teaming as a kind of pickup game in the park,

35
0:02:14.237,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in contrast to the formal, well-practiced team.

36
0:02:17.185,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, which one is going to win in a playoff?

37
0:02:19.737,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The answer is obvious.

38
0:02:21.828,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So why do I study teaming?

39
0:02:24.55,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It's because it's the way more and more of us have to work today.

40
0:02:29.368,000 --> 0:02:32,000
With 24/7 global fast-paced operations,

41
0:02:33.319,000 --> 0:02:35,000
crazy shifting schedules

42
0:02:36.055,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and ever-narrower expertise,

43
0:02:38.795,000 --> 0:02:41,000
more and more of us have to work with different people all the time

44
0:02:42.049,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to get our work done.

45
0:02:43.436,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We don't have the luxury of stable teams.

46
0:02:46.094,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now, when you can have that luxury, by all means do it.

47
0:02:50.248,000 --> 0:02:52,000
But increasingly for a lot of the work we do today,

48
0:02:53.016,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we don't have that option.

49
0:02:54.498,000 --> 0:02:56,000
One place where this is true is hospitals.

50
0:02:57.831,000 --> 0:03:,000
This is where I've done a lot of my research over the years.

51
0:03:00.959,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So it turns out hospitals have to be open 24/7.

52
0:03:06.524,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And patients -- well, they're all different.

53
0:03:09.988,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They're all different in complicated and unique ways.

54
0:03:12.769,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The average hospitalized patient is seen by 60 or so different caregivers

55
0:03:18.396,000 --> 0:03:19,000
throughout his stay.

56
0:03:20.555,000 --> 0:03:22,000
They come from different shifts, different specialties,

57
0:03:23.262,000 --> 0:03:26,000
different areas of expertise,

58
0:03:27.227,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and they may not even know each other's name.

59
0:03:29.744,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But they have to coordinate in order for the patient to get great care.

60
0:03:33.323,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And when they don't, the results can be tragic.

61
0:03:36.885,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Of course, in teaming, the stakes aren't always life and death.

62
0:03:40.701,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Consider what it takes to create an animated film,

63
0:03:44.765,000 --> 0:03:45,000
an award-winning animated film.

64
0:03:46.484,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I had the good fortune to go to Disney Animation

65
0:03:49.664,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and study over 900 scientists, artists,

66
0:03:54.626,000 --> 0:03:56,000
storytellers, computer scientists

67
0:03:57.037,000 --> 0:04:,000
as they teamed up in constantly changing configurations

68
0:04:01.024,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to create amazing outcomes like "Frozen."

69
0:04:04.366,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They just work together, and never the same group twice,

70
0:04:08.829,000 --> 0:04:1,000
not knowing what's going to happen next.

71
0:04:11.175,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now, taking care of patients in the emergency room

72
0:04:14.69,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and designing an animated film

73
0:04:17.152,000 --> 0:04:19,000
are obviously very different work.

74
0:04:19.464,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Yet underneath the differences, they have a lot in common.

75
0:04:23.224,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You have to get different expertise at different times,

76
0:04:26.647,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you don't have fixed roles, you don't have fixed deliverables,

77
0:04:30.196,000 --> 0:04:33,000
you're going to be doing a lot of things that have never been done before,

78
0:04:33.758,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and you can't do it in a stable team.

79
0:04:36.776,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, this way of working isn't easy,

80
0:04:40.387,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but as I said, it's more and more the way many of us have to work,

81
0:04:43.963,000 --> 0:04:44,000
so we have to understand it.

82
0:04:45.384,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And I would argue that it's especially needed

83
0:04:49.018,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for work that's complex and unpredictable

84
0:04:51.148,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and for solving big problems.

85
0:04:53.173,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Paul Polman, the Unilever CEO, put this really well

86
0:04:56.996,000 --> 0:05:,000
when he said, "The issues we face today are so big and so challenging,

87
0:05:01.144,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it becomes quite clear we can't do it alone,

88
0:05:03.54,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and so there is a certain humility in knowing you have to invite people in."

89
0:05:07.943,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Issues like food or water scarcity cannot be done by individuals,

90
0:05:14.134,000 --> 0:05:15,000
even by single companies,

91
0:05:15.756,000 --> 0:05:16,000
even by single sectors.

92
0:05:17.356,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So we're reaching out to team across big teaming,

93
0:05:22.52,000 --> 0:05:23,000
grand-scale teaming.

94
0:05:24.591,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Take the quest for smart cities.

95
0:05:27.342,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Maybe you've seen some of the rhetoric:

96
0:05:29.951,000 --> 0:05:32,000
mixed-use designs, zero net energy buildings,

97
0:05:33.549,000 --> 0:05:35,000
smart mobility,

98
0:05:35.858,000 --> 0:05:37,000
green, livable, wonderful cities.

99
0:05:39.162,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We have the vocabulary, we have the visions,

100
0:05:42.379,000 --> 0:05:43,000
not to mention the need.

101
0:05:44.292,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We have the technology.

102
0:05:45.812,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Two megatrends --

103
0:05:47.323,000 --> 0:05:49,000
urbanization, we're fast becoming a more urban planet,

104
0:05:50.254,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and climate change --

105
0:05:51.578,000 --> 0:05:53,000
have been increasingly pointing to cities

106
0:05:54.464,000 --> 0:05:56,000
as a crucial target for innovation.

107
0:05:57.106,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And now around the world in various locations,

108
0:05:59.4,000 --> 0:06:,000
people have been teaming up

109
0:06:01.412,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to design and try to create green, livable, smart cities.

110
0:06:06.154,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's a massive innovation challenge.

111
0:06:09.362,000 --> 0:06:1,000
To understand it better,

112
0:06:11.082,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I studied a start-up -- a smart-city software start-up --

113
0:06:16.614,000 --> 0:06:18,000
as it teamed up with a real estate developer,

114
0:06:19.292,000 --> 0:06:2,000
some civil engineers,

115
0:06:21.295,000 --> 0:06:22,000
a mayor,

116
0:06:23.68,000 --> 0:06:26,000
an architect, some builders, some tech companies.

117
0:06:27.563,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Their goal was to build a demo smart city from scratch.

118
0:06:32.475,000 --> 0:06:36,000
OK. Five years into the project, not a whole lot had happened.

119
0:06:37.01,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Six years, still no ground broken.

120
0:06:41.383,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It seemed that teaming across industry boundaries

121
0:06:44.722,000 --> 0:06:46,000
was really, really hard.

122
0:06:48.215,000 --> 0:06:49,000
OK, so ...

123
0:06:50.362,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We had inadvertently discovered

124
0:06:53.862,000 --> 0:06:56,000
what I call "professional culture clash" with this project.

125
0:06:57.39,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You know, software engineers and real estate developers

126
0:07:01.473,000 --> 0:07:02,000
think differently --

127
0:07:03.09,000 --> 0:07:04,000
really differently:

128
0:07:04.872,000 --> 0:07:08,000
different values, different time frames -- time frames is a big one --

129
0:07:09.237,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and different jargon, different language.

130
0:07:12.418,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And so they don't always see eye to eye.

131
0:07:15.109,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I think this is a bigger problem than most of us realize.

132
0:07:19.128,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In fact, I think professional culture clash

133
0:07:23.756,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is a major barrier to building the future that we aspire to build.

134
0:07:28.28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And so it becomes a problem that we have to understand,

135
0:07:31.085,000 --> 0:07:34,000
a problem that we have to figure out how to crack.

136
0:07:35.041,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So how do you make sure teaming goes well, especially big teaming?

137
0:07:39.819,000 --> 0:07:42,000
This is the question I've been trying to solve for a number of years

138
0:07:43.117,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in many different workplaces

139
0:07:44.596,000 --> 0:07:45,000
with my research.

140
0:07:46.266,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, to begin to get just a glimpse of the answer to this question,

141
0:07:50.47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
let's go back to Chile.

142
0:07:52.403,000 --> 0:07:57,000
In Chile, we witnessed 10 weeks of teaming

143
0:07:57.493,000 --> 0:07:59,000
by hundreds of individuals

144
0:07:59.678,000 --> 0:08:01,000
from different professions, different companies,

145
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
different sectors, even different nations.

146
0:08:04.745,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And as this process unfolded,

147
0:08:08.152,000 --> 0:08:12,000
they had lots of ideas, they tried many things,

148
0:08:12.786,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they experimented, they failed,

149
0:08:15.06,000 --> 0:08:18,000
they experienced devastating daily failure,

150
0:08:18.582,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but they picked up, persevered,

151
0:08:20.329,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and went on forward.

152
0:08:22.437,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And really, what we witnessed there

153
0:08:27.09,000 --> 0:08:29,000
was they were able to be humble

154
0:08:29.748,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in the face of the very real challenge ahead,

155
0:08:33.085,000 --> 0:08:35,000
curious -- all of these diverse individuals,

156
0:08:35.384,000 --> 0:08:37,000
diverse expertise especially, nationality as well,

157
0:08:38.112,000 --> 0:08:4,000
were quite curious about what each other brings.

158
0:08:40.505,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And they were willing to take risks to learn fast what might work.

159
0:08:44.98,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And ultimately, 17 days into this remarkable story,

160
0:08:50.23,000 --> 0:08:51,000
ideas came from everywhere.

161
0:08:51.995,000 --> 0:08:54,000
They came from André Sougarret, who is a brilliant mining engineer

162
0:08:55.497,000 --> 0:08:57,000
who was appointed by the government to lead the rescue.

163
0:08:58.229,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They came from NASA.

164
0:08:59.895,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They came from Chilean Special Forces.

165
0:09:03.07,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They came from volunteers around the world.

166
0:09:05.355,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And while many of us, including myself, watched from afar,

167
0:09:10.273,000 --> 0:09:14,000
these folks made slow, painful progress through the rock.

168
0:09:14.366,000 --> 0:09:18,000
On the 17th day, they broke through to the refuge.

169
0:09:18.394,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It's just a remarkable moment.

170
0:09:20.905,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And with just a very small incision, they were able to find it

171
0:09:25.472,000 --> 0:09:27,000
through a bunch of experimental techniques.

172
0:09:27.691,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And then for the next 53 days,

173
0:09:30.184,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that narrow lifeline would be the path

174
0:09:34.362,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where food and medicine and communication would travel,

175
0:09:38.38,000 --> 0:09:42,000
while aboveground, for 53 more days, they continued the teaming

176
0:09:42.47,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to find a way to create a much larger hole

177
0:09:46.319,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and also to design a capsule.

178
0:09:49.779,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is the capsule.

179
0:09:50.992,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And then on the 69th day,

180
0:09:53.257,000 --> 0:09:55,000
over 22 painstaking hours,

181
0:09:56.066,000 --> 0:09:59,000
they managed to pull the miners out one by one.

182
0:09:59.276,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So how did they overcome professional culture clash?

183
0:10:02.375,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I would say in a word, it's leadership, but let me be more specific.

184
0:10:06.802,000 --> 0:10:07,000
When teaming works,

185
0:10:08.747,000 --> 0:10:1,000
you can be sure that some leaders,

186
0:10:11.604,000 --> 0:10:12,000
leaders at all levels,

187
0:10:13.023,000 --> 0:10:16,000
have been crystal clear that they don't have the answers.

188
0:10:16.328,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Let's call this "situational humility."

189
0:10:18.689,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's appropriate humility.

190
0:10:20.012,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We don't know how to do it.

191
0:10:21.629,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You can be sure, as I said before, people were very curious,

192
0:10:24.852,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and this situational humility

193
0:10:26.954,000 --> 0:10:28,000
combined with curiosity

194
0:10:29.139,000 --> 0:10:31,000
creates a sense of psychological safety

195
0:10:31.729,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that allows you take risks with strangers,

196
0:10:33.772,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because let's face it: it's hard to speak up, right?

197
0:10:37.463,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's hard to ask for help.

198
0:10:38.786,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's hard to offer an idea that might be a stupid idea

199
0:10:42.3,000 --> 0:10:43,000
if you don't know people very well.

200
0:10:44.04,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You need psychological safety to do that.

201
0:10:47.613,000 --> 0:10:51,000
They overcame what I like to call the basic human challenge:

202
0:10:52.291,000 --> 0:10:55,000
it's hard to learn if you already know.

203
0:10:55.361,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And unfortunately, we're hardwired to think we know.

204
0:10:58.809,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And so we've got to remind ourselves -- and we can do it --

205
0:11:02.127,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to be curious;

206
0:11:03.341,000 --> 0:11:05,000
to be curious about what others bring.

207
0:11:05.563,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And that curiosity can also spawn a kind of generosity of interpretation.

208
0:11:11.83,000 --> 0:11:14,000
But there's another barrier, and you all know it.

209
0:11:14.928,000 --> 0:11:16,000
You wouldn't be in this room if you didn't know it.

210
0:11:17.35,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And to explain it, I'm going to quote from the movie "The Paper Chase."

211
0:11:20.809,000 --> 0:11:22,000
This, by the way, is what Hollywood thinks

212
0:11:22.85,000 --> 0:11:24,000
a Harvard professor is supposed to look like.

213
0:11:24.99,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You be the judge.

214
0:11:26.272,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The professor in this famous scene,

215
0:11:28.306,000 --> 0:11:31,000
he's welcoming the new 1L class,

216
0:11:31.392,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and he says, "Look to your left. Look to your right.

217
0:11:33.885,000 --> 0:11:34,000
one of you won't be here next year."

218
0:11:35.631,000 --> 0:11:37,000
What message did they hear? "It's me or you."

219
0:11:39.3,000 --> 0:11:41,000
For me to succeed, you must fail.

220
0:11:41.383,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Now, I don't think too many organizations welcome newcomers that way anymore,

221
0:11:45.916,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but still, many times people arrive with that message of scarcity anyway.

222
0:11:50.951,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It's me or you.

223
0:11:52.372,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's awfully hard to team if you inadvertently see others as competitors.

224
0:11:56.972,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So we have to overcome that one as well,

225
0:11:59.319,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and when we do, the results can be awesome.

226
0:12:03.45,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Abraham Lincoln said once,

227
0:12:05.418,000 --> 0:12:08,000
"I don't like that man very much. I must get to know him better."

228
0:12:09.827,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Think about that --

229
0:12:11.002,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I don't like him, that means I don't know him well enough.

230
0:12:13.768,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It's extraordinary.

231
0:12:14.943,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This is the mindset, I have to say,

232
0:12:16.64,000 --> 0:12:19,000
this is the mindset you need for effective teaming.

233
0:12:21.285,000 --> 0:12:23,000
In our silos, we can get things done.

234
0:12:23.85,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But when we step back and reach out and reach across,

235
0:12:27.259,000 --> 0:12:29,000
miracles can happen.

236
0:12:29.326,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Miners can be rescued,

237
0:12:31.181,000 --> 0:12:32,000
patients can be saved,

238
0:12:32.648,000 --> 0:12:34,000
beautiful films can be created.

239
0:12:36.065,000 --> 0:12:38,000
To get there, I think there's no better advice than this:

240
0:12:38.81,000 --> 0:12:4,000
look to your left, look to your right.

241
0:12:41.061,000 --> 0:12:46,000
How quickly can you find the unique talents, skills

242
0:12:47.035,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and hopes of your neighbor,

243
0:12:48.51,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and how quickly, in turn, can you convey what you bring?

244
0:12:52.003,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Because for us to team up to build the future we know we can create

245
0:12:56.36,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that none of us can do alone,

246
0:12:57.893,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that's the mindset we need.

247
0:12:59.831,000 --> 0:13:,000
Thank you.

248
0:13:01.146,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.249,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today, actually, is a very special day for me,

2
0:00:14.539,000 --> 0:00:16,000
because it is my birthday.

3
0:00:16.684,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Applause)

4
0:00:20.681,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And so, thanks to all of you for joining the party.

5
0:00:24.146,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:25.337,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But every time you throw a party, there's someone there to spoil it. Right?

7
0:00:30.147,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:31.243,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I'm a physicist,

9
0:00:32.626,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and this time I brought another physicist along to do so.

10
0:00:36.807,000 --> 0:00:4,000
His name is Albert Einstein -- also Albert -- and he's the one who said

11
0:00:41.393,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that the person who has not made his great contributions to science

12
0:00:46.247,000 --> 0:00:47,000
by the age of 30

13
0:00:47.83,000 --> 0:00:48,000
will never do so.

14
0:00:49.25,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:50.286,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, you don't need to check Wikipedia

16
0:00:52.65,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that I'm beyond 30.

17
0:00:54.245,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:55.685,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, effectively, what he is telling me, and us,

19
0:00:59.315,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is that when it comes to my science,

20
0:01:01.883,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I'm deadwood.

21
0:01:04.078,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Well, luckily, I had my share of luck within my career.

22
0:01:10.132,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Around age 28, I became very interested in networks,

23
0:01:13.978,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and a few years later, we managed to publish a few key papers

24
0:01:18.078,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that reported the discovery of scale-free networks

25
0:01:22.199,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and really gave birth to a new discipline that we call network science today.

26
0:01:26.801,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And if you really care about it, you can get a PhD now in network science

27
0:01:30.503,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in Budapest, in Boston,

28
0:01:32.555,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and you can study it all over the world.

29
0:01:35.466,000 --> 0:01:36,000
A few years later,

30
0:01:37.085,000 --> 0:01:4,000
when I moved to Harvard first as a sabbatical,

31
0:01:40.339,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I became interested in another type of network:

32
0:01:43.455,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that time, the networks within ourselves,

33
0:01:46.506,000 --> 0:01:49,000
how the genes and the proteins and the metabolites link to each other

34
0:01:50.256,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and how they connect to disease.

35
0:01:53.368,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And that interest led to a major explosion within medicine,

36
0:01:57.984,000 --> 0:02:,000
including the Network Medicine Division at Harvard,

37
0:02:01.987,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that has more than 300 researchers who are using this perspective

38
0:02:05.406,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to treat patients and develop new cures.

39
0:02:09.457,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And a few years ago,

40
0:02:11.251,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I thought that I would take this idea of networks

41
0:02:13.801,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and the expertise we had in networks

42
0:02:15.591,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in a different area,

43
0:02:17.007,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that is, to understand success.

44
0:02:19.704,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And why did we do that?

45
0:02:20.938,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Well, we thought that, to some degree,

46
0:02:23.243,000 --> 0:02:26,000
our success is determined by the networks we're part of --

47
0:02:26.644,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that our networks can push us forward, they can pull us back.

48
0:02:30.925,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And I was curious if we could use the knowledge and big data and expertise

49
0:02:35.077,000 --> 0:02:36,000
where we develop the networks

50
0:02:36.504,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to really quantify how these things happen.

51
0:02:40.404,000 --> 0:02:41,000
This is a result from that.

52
0:02:41.77,000 --> 0:02:43,000
What you see here is a network of galleries in museums

53
0:02:44.741,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that connect to each other.

54
0:02:46.806,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And through this map that we mapped out last year,

55
0:02:50.885,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we are able to predict very accurately the success of an artist

56
0:02:55.757,000 --> 0:02:59,000
if you give me the first five exhibits that he or she had in their career.

57
0:03:01.404,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Well, as we thought about success,

58
0:03:04.134,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we realized that success is not only about networks;

59
0:03:07.225,000 --> 0:03:09,000
there are so many other dimensions to that.

60
0:03:10.145,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And one of the things we need for success, obviously,

61
0:03:13.416,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is performance.

62
0:03:14.61,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So let's define what's the difference between performance and success.

63
0:03:18.465,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Well, performance is what you do:

64
0:03:20.486,000 --> 0:03:23,000
how fast you run, what kind of paintings you paint,

65
0:03:23.542,000 --> 0:03:24,000
what kind of papers you publish.

66
0:03:25.835,000 --> 0:03:27,000
However, in our working definition,

67
0:03:28.473,000 --> 0:03:32,000
success is about what the community notices from what you did,

68
0:03:32.702,000 --> 0:03:33,000
from your performance:

69
0:03:34.338,000 --> 0:03:38,000
How does it acknowledge it, and how does it reward you for it?

70
0:03:38.494,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In other terms,

71
0:03:39.7,000 --> 0:03:43,000
your performance is about you, but your success is about all of us.

72
0:03:45.392,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And this was a very important shift for us,

73
0:03:48.75,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because the moment we defined success as being a collective measure

74
0:03:52.798,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that the community provides to us,

75
0:03:54.928,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it became measurable,

76
0:03:56.462,000 --> 0:04:,000
because if it's in the community, there are multiple data points about that.

77
0:04:00.996,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So we go to school, we exercise, we practice,

78
0:04:06.3,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because we believe that performance leads to success.

79
0:04:09.832,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But the way we actually started to explore,

80
0:04:11.871,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we realized that performance and success are very, very different animals

81
0:04:15.422,000 --> 0:04:17,000
when it comes to the mathematics of the problem.

82
0:04:18.429,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And let me illustrate that.

83
0:04:20.329,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So what you see here is the fastest man on earth, Usain Bolt.

84
0:04:25.832,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And of course, he wins most of the competitions that he enters.

85
0:04:30.393,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And we know he's the fastest on earth because we have a chronometer

86
0:04:33.592,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to measure his speed.

87
0:04:34.776,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Well, what is interesting about him is that when he wins,

88
0:04:38.919,000 --> 0:04:43,000
he doesn't do so by really significantly outrunning his competition.

89
0:04:44.445,000 --> 0:04:48,000
He's running at most a percent faster than the one who loses the race.

90
0:04:49.631,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And not only does he run only one percent faster than the second one,

91
0:04:53.293,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but he doesn't run 10 times faster than I do --

92
0:04:56.166,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I'm not a good runner, trust me on that.

93
0:04:58.371,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:59.592,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And every time we are able to measure performance,

95
0:05:03.118,000 --> 0:05:05,000
we notice something very interesting;

96
0:05:05.192,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that is, performance is bounded.

97
0:05:07.727,000 --> 0:05:1,000
What it means is that there are no huge variations in human performance.

98
0:05:11.508,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It varies only in a narrow range,

99
0:05:14.964,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and we do need the chronometer to measure the differences.

100
0:05:18.267,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This is not to say that we cannot see the good from the best ones,

101
0:05:21.459,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but the best ones are very hard to distinguish.

102
0:05:24.216,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And the problem with that is that most of us work in areas

103
0:05:27.232,000 --> 0:05:3,000
where we do not have a chronometer to gauge our performance.

104
0:05:31.178,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Alright, performance is bounded,

105
0:05:32.766,000 --> 0:05:35,000
there are no huge differences between us when it comes to our performance.

106
0:05:36.322,000 --> 0:05:37,000
How about success?

107
0:05:37.995,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Well, let's switch to a different topic, like books.

108
0:05:40.949,000 --> 0:05:45,000
One measure of success for writers is how many people read your work.

109
0:05:46.662,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And so when my previous book came out in 2009,

110
0:05:51.096,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I was in Europe talking with my editor,

111
0:05:53.022,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and I was interested: Who is the competition?

112
0:05:56.253,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I had some fabulous ones.

113
0:05:59.012,000 --> 0:06:,000
That week --

114
0:06:00.205,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:01.253,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Dan Brown came out with "The Lost Symbol,"

116
0:06:04.834,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and "The Last Song" also came out,

117
0:06:07.84,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Nicholas Sparks.

118
0:06:09.293,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And when you just look at the list,

119
0:06:12.305,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you realize, you know, performance-wise, there's hardly any difference

120
0:06:15.782,000 --> 0:06:16,000
between these books or mine.

121
0:06:17.404,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Right?

122
0:06:18.603,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So maybe if Nicholas Sparks's team works a little harder,

123
0:06:23.295,000 --> 0:06:24,000
he could easily be number one,

124
0:06:25.041,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because it's almost by accident who ended up at the top.

125
0:06:28.486,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So I said, let's look at the numbers -- I'm a data person, right?

126
0:06:31.663,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So let's see what were the sales for Nicholas Sparks.

127
0:06:36.005,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And it turns out that that opening weekend,

128
0:06:38.083,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Nicholas Sparks sold more than a hundred thousand copies,

129
0:06:41.082,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which is an amazing number.

130
0:06:42.811,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You can actually get to the top of the "New York Times" best-seller list

131
0:06:46.231,000 --> 0:06:48,000
by selling 10,000 copies a week,

132
0:06:48.365,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so he tenfold overcame what he needed to be number one.

133
0:06:52.141,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Yet he wasn't number one.

134
0:06:53.595,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Why?

135
0:06:54.927,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Because there was Dan Brown, who sold 1.2 million copies that weekend.

136
0:06:59.029,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:01.189,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And the reason I like this number is because it shows that, really,

138
0:07:05.184,000 --> 0:07:08,000
when it comes to success, it's unbounded,

139
0:07:08.938,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that the best doesn't only get slightly more than the second best

140
0:07:14.823,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but gets orders of magnitude more,

141
0:07:17.544,000 --> 0:07:19,000
because success is a collective measure.

142
0:07:20.362,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We give it to them, rather than we earn it through our performance.

143
0:07:24.762,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So one of things we realized is that performance, what we do, is bounded,

144
0:07:30.162,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but success, which is collective, is unbounded,

145
0:07:32.868,000 --> 0:07:33,000
which makes you wonder:

146
0:07:34.204,000 --> 0:07:36,000
How do you get these huge differences in success

147
0:07:37.139,000 --> 0:07:39,000
when you have such tiny differences in performance?

148
0:07:40.537,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And recently, I published a book that I devoted to that very question.

149
0:07:44.348,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And they didn't give me enough time to go over all of that,

150
0:07:47.211,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so I'm going to go back to the question of,

151
0:07:49.306,000 --> 0:07:52,000
alright, you have success; when should that appear?

152
0:07:52.465,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So let's go back to the party spoiler and ask ourselves:

153
0:07:57.215,000 --> 0:08:,000
Why did Einstein make this ridiculous statement,

154
0:08:00.578,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that only before 30 you could actually be creative?

155
0:08:03.758,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Well, because he looked around himself and he saw all these fabulous physicists

156
0:08:08.462,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that created quantum mechanics and modern physics,

157
0:08:11.073,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and they were all in their 20s and early 30s when they did so.

158
0:08:15.73,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And it's not only him.

159
0:08:16.974,000 --> 0:08:17,000
It's not only observational bias,

160
0:08:18.621,000 --> 0:08:21,000
because there's actually a whole field of genius research

161
0:08:22.642,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that has documented the fact that,

162
0:08:24.922,000 --> 0:08:27,000
if we look at the people we admire from the past

163
0:08:28.106,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and then look at what age they made their biggest contribution,

164
0:08:31.488,000 --> 0:08:33,000
whether that's music, whether that's science,

165
0:08:33.608,000 --> 0:08:34,000
whether that's engineering,

166
0:08:35.251,000 --> 0:08:41,000
most of them tend to do so in their 20s, 30s, early 40s at most.

167
0:08:41.914,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But there's a problem with this genius research.

168
0:08:45.197,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Well, first of all, it created the impression to us

169
0:08:48.501,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that creativity equals youth,

170
0:08:52.004,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which is painful, right?

171
0:08:53.638,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:55.613,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And it also has an observational bias,

173
0:08:59.725,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because it only looks at geniuses and doesn't look at ordinary scientists

174
0:09:04.711,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and doesn't look at all of us and ask,

175
0:09:06.7,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is it really true that creativity vanishes as we age?

176
0:09:10.382,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So that's exactly what we tried to do,

177
0:09:12.283,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and this is important for that to actually have references.

178
0:09:16.11,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So let's look at an ordinary scientist like myself,

179
0:09:18.777,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and let's look at my career.

180
0:09:20.323,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So what you see here is all the papers that I've published

181
0:09:23.549,000 --> 0:09:28,000
from my very first paper, in 1989; I was still in Romania when I did so,

182
0:09:28.688,000 --> 0:09:29,000
till kind of this year.

183
0:09:30.94,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And vertically, you see the impact of the paper,

184
0:09:33.482,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that is, how many citations,

185
0:09:34.909,000 --> 0:09:37,000
how many other papers have been written that cited that work.

186
0:09:39.397,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And when you look at that,

187
0:09:40.721,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you see that my career has roughly three different stages.

188
0:09:43.558,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I had the first 10 years where I had to work a lot

189
0:09:46.017,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and I don't achieve much.

190
0:09:47.317,000 --> 0:09:49,000
No one seems to care about what I do, right?

191
0:09:49.459,000 --> 0:09:5,000
There's hardly any impact.

192
0:09:51.164,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:52.592,000 --> 0:09:54,000
That time, I was doing material science,

194
0:09:55.503,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and then I kind of discovered for myself networks

195
0:09:59.218,000 --> 0:10:,000
and then started publishing in networks.

196
0:10:01.189,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And that led from one high-impact paper to the other one.

197
0:10:04.286,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And it really felt good. That was that stage of my career.

198
0:10:07.414,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

199
0:10:08.72,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So the question is, what happens right now?

200
0:10:12.587,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And we don't know, because there hasn't been enough time passed yet

201
0:10:15.85,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to actually figure out how much impact those papers will get;

202
0:10:18.861,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it takes time to acquire.

203
0:10:20.112,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Well, when you look at the data,

204
0:10:21.705,000 --> 0:10:23,000
it seems to be that Einstein, the genius research, is right,

205
0:10:24.583,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and I'm at that stage of my career.

206
0:10:26.418,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:28.75,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So we said, OK, let's figure out how does this really happen,

208
0:10:34.748,000 --> 0:10:35,000
first in science.

209
0:10:36.55,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And in order not to have the selection bias,

210
0:10:40.206,000 --> 0:10:41,000
to look only at geniuses,

211
0:10:41.567,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we ended up reconstructing the career of every single scientist

212
0:10:45.307,000 --> 0:10:47,000
from 1900 till today

213
0:10:47.833,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and finding for all scientists what was their personal best,

214
0:10:51.569,000 --> 0:10:53,000
whether they got the Nobel Prize or they never did,

215
0:10:54.405,000 --> 0:10:57,000
or no one knows what they did, even their personal best.

216
0:10:57.836,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And that's what you see in this slide.

217
0:10:59.775,000 --> 0:11:,000
Each line is a career,

218
0:11:01.372,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and when you have a light blue dot on the top of that career,

219
0:11:04.399,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it says that was their personal best.

220
0:11:06.463,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And the question is,

221
0:11:07.642,000 --> 0:11:1,000
when did they actually make their biggest discovery?

222
0:11:11.234,000 --> 0:11:12,000
To quantify that,

223
0:11:12.423,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we look at what's the probability that you make your biggest discovery,

224
0:11:15.823,000 --> 0:11:17,000
let's say, one, two, three or 10 years into your career?

225
0:11:18.519,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We're not looking at real age.

226
0:11:20.023,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We're looking at what we call "academic age."

227
0:11:22.181,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Your academic age starts when you publish your first papers.

228
0:11:25.455,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I know some of you are still babies.

229
0:11:27.258,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:28.679,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So let's look at the probability

231
0:11:31.409,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that you publish your highest-impact paper.

232
0:11:33.499,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And what you see is, indeed, the genius research is right.

233
0:11:36.594,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Most scientists tend to publish their highest-impact paper

234
0:11:39.642,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in the first 10, 15 years in their career,

235
0:11:42.565,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and it tanks after that.

236
0:11:45.722,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It tanks so fast that I'm about -- I'm exactly 30 years into my career,

237
0:11:50.853,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and the chance that I will publish a paper that would have a higher impact

238
0:11:54.417,000 --> 0:11:55,000
than anything that I did before

239
0:11:56.381,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is less than one percent.

240
0:11:57.758,000 --> 0:12:,000
I am in that stage of my career, according to this data.

241
0:12:01.648,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But there's a problem with that.

242
0:12:03.515,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We're not doing controls properly.

243
0:12:07.214,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So the control would be,

244
0:12:08.655,000 --> 0:12:12,000
what would a scientist look like who makes random contribution to science?

245
0:12:13.286,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Or what is the productivity of the scientist?

246
0:12:16.305,000 --> 0:12:18,000
When do they write papers?

247
0:12:18.335,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So we measured the productivity,

248
0:12:20.803,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and amazingly, the productivity,

249
0:12:22.879,000 --> 0:12:26,000
your likelihood of writing a paper in year one, 10 or 20 in your career,

250
0:12:27.034,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is indistinguishable from the likelihood of having the impact

251
0:12:30.664,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in that part of your career.

252
0:12:33.026,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And to make a long story short,

253
0:12:34.833,000 --> 0:12:38,000
after lots of statistical tests, there's only one explanation for that,

254
0:12:39.085,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that really, the way we scientists work

255
0:12:42.003,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is that every single paper we write, every project we do,

256
0:12:45.66,000 --> 0:12:49,000
has exactly the same chance of being our personal best.

257
0:12:49.844,000 --> 0:12:53,000
That is, discovery is like a lottery ticket.

258
0:12:54.821,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And the more lottery tickets we buy,

259
0:12:57.196,000 --> 0:12:58,000
the higher our chances.

260
0:12:58.727,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And it happens to be so

261
0:13:00.31,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that most scientists buy most of their lottery tickets

262
0:13:03.053,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in the first 10, 15 years of their career,

263
0:13:05.537,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and after that, their productivity decreases.

264
0:13:09.411,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They're not buying any more lottery tickets.

265
0:13:11.519,000 --> 0:13:14,000
So it looks as if they would not be creative.

266
0:13:14.987,000 --> 0:13:15,000
In reality, they stopped trying.

267
0:13:17.509,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So when we actually put the data together, the conclusion is very simple:

268
0:13:21.448,000 --> 0:13:23,000
success can come at any time.

269
0:13:23.803,000 --> 0:13:26,000
It could be your very first or very last paper of your career.

270
0:13:27.562,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It's totally random in the space of the projects.

271
0:13:31.874,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It is the productivity that changes.

272
0:13:33.829,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Let me illustrate that.

273
0:13:35.105,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Here is Frank Wilczek, who got the Nobel Prize in Physics

274
0:13:38.398,000 --> 0:13:42,000
for the very first paper he ever wrote in his career as a graduate student.

275
0:13:42.523,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Laughter)

276
0:13:43.554,000 --> 0:13:46,000
More interesting is John Fenn,

277
0:13:46.796,000 --> 0:13:5,000
who, at age 70, was forcefully retired by Yale University.

278
0:13:51.418,000 --> 0:13:53,000
They shut his lab down,

279
0:13:53.498,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and at that moment, he moved to Virginia Commonwealth University,

280
0:13:57.188,000 --> 0:13:58,000
opened another lab,

281
0:13:58.998,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and it is there, at age 72, that he published a paper

282
0:14:02.055,000 --> 0:14:05,000
for which, 15 years later, he got the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.

283
0:14:06.94,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And you think, OK, well, science is special,

284
0:14:10.006,000 --> 0:14:13,000
but what about other areas where we need to be creative?

285
0:14:13.493,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So let me take another typical example: entrepreneurship.

286
0:14:18.834,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Silicon Valley,

287
0:14:20.437,000 --> 0:14:22,000
the land of the youth, right?

288
0:14:22.527,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And indeed, when you look at it,

289
0:14:24.146,000 --> 0:14:28,000
you realize that the biggest awards, the TechCrunch Awards and other awards,

290
0:14:28.812,000 --> 0:14:3,000
are all going to people

291
0:14:31.009,000 --> 0:14:36,000
whose average age is late 20s, very early 30s.

292
0:14:36.465,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You look at who the VCs give the money to, some of the biggest VC firms --

293
0:14:42.091,000 --> 0:14:44,000
all people in their early 30s.

294
0:14:44.951,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Which, of course, we know;

295
0:14:46.24,000 --> 0:14:5,000
there is this ethos in Silicon Valley that youth equals success.

296
0:14:51.653,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Not when you look at the data,

297
0:14:53.86,000 --> 0:14:55,000
because it's not only about forming a company --

298
0:14:56.188,000 --> 0:14:59,000
forming a company is like productivity, trying, trying, trying --

299
0:14:59.352,000 --> 0:15:02,000
when you look at which of these individuals actually put out

300
0:15:02.86,000 --> 0:15:04,000
a successful company, a successful exit.

301
0:15:05.666,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And recently, some of our colleagues looked at exactly that question.

302
0:15:09.41,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And it turns out that yes, those in the 20s and 30s

303
0:15:12.59,000 --> 0:15:15,000
put out a huge number of companies, form lots of companies,

304
0:15:15.962,000 --> 0:15:16,000
but most of them go bust.

305
0:15:18.089,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And when you look at the successful exits, what you see in this particular plot,

306
0:15:22.308,000 --> 0:15:25,000
the older you are, the more likely that you will actually hit the stock market

307
0:15:26.027,000 --> 0:15:28,000
or the sell the company successfully.

308
0:15:28.847,000 --> 0:15:31,000
This is so strong, actually, that if you are in the 50s,

309
0:15:31.984,000 --> 0:15:34,000
you are twice as likely to actually have a successful exit

310
0:15:35.596,000 --> 0:15:36,000
than if you are in your 30s.

311
0:15:38.613,000 --> 0:15:42,000
(Applause)

312
0:15:43.645,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So in the end, what is it that we see, actually?

313
0:15:46.678,000 --> 0:15:5,000
What we see is that creativity has no age.

314
0:15:50.785,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Productivity does, right?

315
0:15:53.424,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Which is telling me that at the end of the day,

316
0:15:57.583,000 --> 0:15:59,000
if you keep trying --

317
0:15:59.607,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Laughter)

318
0:16:02.034,000 --> 0:16:05,000
you could still succeed and succeed over and over.

319
0:16:05.63,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So my conclusion is very simple:

320
0:16:08.045,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I am off the stage, back in my lab.

321
0:16:10.162,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Thank you.

322
0:16:11.357,000 --> 0:16:14,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.604,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Today I want to tell you

3
0:00:13.82,000 --> 0:00:14,000
about a project being carried out

4
0:00:15.623,000 --> 0:00:17,000
by scientists all over the world

5
0:00:18.31,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to paint a neural portrait of the human mind.

6
0:00:21.598,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the central idea of this work

7
0:00:23.77,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is that the human mind and brain

8
0:00:25.628,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is not a single, general-purpose processor,

9
0:00:28.485,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but a collection of highly specialized components,

10
0:00:31.927,000 --> 0:00:33,000
each solving a different specific problem,

11
0:00:34.91,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and yet collectively making up

12
0:00:37.246,000 --> 0:00:41,000
who we are as human beings and thinkers.

13
0:00:41.602,000 --> 0:00:42,000
To give you a feel for this idea,

14
0:00:43.078,000 --> 0:00:45,000
imagine the following scenario:

15
0:00:45.742,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You walk into your child's day care center.

16
0:00:47.938,000 --> 0:00:49,000
As usual, there's a dozen kids there

17
0:00:50.175,000 --> 0:00:51,000
waiting to get picked up,

18
0:00:51.766,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but this time,

19
0:00:53.398,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the children's faces look weirdly similar,

20
0:00:56.383,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and you can't figure out which child is yours.

21
0:00:59.191,000 --> 0:01:,000
Do you need new glasses?

22
0:01:00.94,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Are you losing your mind?

23
0:01:02.848,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You run through a quick mental checklist.

24
0:01:05.3,000 --> 0:01:06,000
No, you seem to be thinking clearly,

25
0:01:07.194,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and your vision is perfectly sharp.

26
0:01:09.585,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And everything looks normal

27
0:01:11.374,000 --> 0:01:13,000
except the children's faces.

28
0:01:13.536,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You can see the faces,

29
0:01:15.322,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but they don't look distinctive,

30
0:01:17.03,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and none of them looks familiar,

31
0:01:18.888,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and it's only by spotting an orange hair ribbon

32
0:01:21.386,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that you find your daughter.

33
0:01:23.282,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This sudden loss of the ability to recognize faces

34
0:01:26.707,000 --> 0:01:27,000
actually happens to people.

35
0:01:28.253,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's called prosopagnosia,

36
0:01:30.307,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and it results from damage

37
0:01:31.488,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to a particular part of the brain.

38
0:01:33.614,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The striking thing about it

39
0:01:35.114,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is that only face recognition is impaired;

40
0:01:37.709,000 --> 0:01:39,000
everything else is just fine.

41
0:01:40.148,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Prosopagnosia is one of many surprisingly specific

42
0:01:44.016,000 --> 0:01:48,000
mental deficits that can happen after brain damage.

43
0:01:48.551,000 --> 0:01:49,000
These syndromes collectively

44
0:01:49.914,000 --> 0:01:51,000
have suggested for a long time

45
0:01:52.153,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that the mind is divvied up into distinct components,

46
0:01:55.921,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but the effort to discover those components

47
0:01:58.306,000 --> 0:01:59,000
has jumped to warp speed

48
0:01:59.92,000 --> 0:02:01,000
with the invention of brain imaging technology,

49
0:02:02.502,000 --> 0:02:05,000
especially MRI.

50
0:02:05.55,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So MRI enables you to see internal anatomy

51
0:02:08.79,000 --> 0:02:09,000
at high resolution,

52
0:02:10.376,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so I'm going to show you in a second

53
0:02:11.806,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a set of MRI cross-sectional images

54
0:02:15.158,000 --> 0:02:16,000
through a familiar object,

55
0:02:16.776,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and we're going to fly through them

56
0:02:17.651,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and you're going to try to figure out what the object is.

57
0:02:20.124,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Here we go.

58
0:02:24.241,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's not that easy. It's an artichoke.

59
0:02:26.13,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Okay, let's try another one,

60
0:02:27.76,000 --> 0:02:29,000
starting from the bottom and going through the top.

61
0:02:32.812,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Broccoli! It's a head of broccoli.

62
0:02:33.963,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Isn't it beautiful? I love that.

63
0:02:35.627,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Okay, here's another one. It's a brain, of course.

64
0:02:38.384,000 --> 0:02:39,000
In fact, it's my brain.

65
0:02:39.97,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We're going through slices through my head like that.

66
0:02:41.703,000 --> 0:02:42,000
That's my nose over on the right, and now

67
0:02:43.461,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we're going over here, right there.

68
0:02:46.87,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So this picture's nice, if I do say so myself,

69
0:02:51.471,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but it shows only anatomy.

70
0:02:53.383,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The really cool advance with functional imaging

71
0:02:55.903,000 --> 0:02:56,000
happened when scientists figured out how to make

72
0:02:57.475,000 --> 0:03:,000
pictures that show not just anatomy but activity,

73
0:03:00.87,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that is, where neurons are firing.

74
0:03:03.305,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So here's how this works.

75
0:03:04.821,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Brains are like muscles.

76
0:03:05.938,000 --> 0:03:06,000
When they get active,

77
0:03:07.501,000 --> 0:03:09,000
they need increased blood flow to supply that activity,

78
0:03:10.475,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and lucky for us, blood flow control to the brain is local,

79
0:03:14.043,000 --> 0:03:16,000
so if a bunch of neurons, say, right there

80
0:03:16.205,000 --> 0:03:17,000
get active and start firing,

81
0:03:17.705,000 --> 0:03:19,000
then blood flow increases just right there.

82
0:03:20.43,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So functional MRI picks up on that blood flow increase,

83
0:03:24.151,000 --> 0:03:26,000
producing a higher MRI response

84
0:03:26.184,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where neural activity goes up.

85
0:03:29.11,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So to give you a concrete feel

86
0:03:30.81,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for how a functional MRI experiment goes

87
0:03:33.295,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and what you can learn from it

88
0:03:34.734,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and what you can't,

89
0:03:36.118,000 --> 0:03:39,000
let me describe one of the first studies I ever did.

90
0:03:39.56,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We wanted to know if there was a special part of the brain for recognizing faces,

91
0:03:43.698,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and there was already reason to think there might be such a thing

92
0:03:46.77,000 --> 0:03:47,000
based on this phenomenon of prosopagnosia

93
0:03:48.49,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that I described a moment ago,

94
0:03:50.613,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but nobody had ever seen that part of the brain

95
0:03:52.891,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in a normal person,

96
0:03:54.81,000 --> 0:03:56,000
so we set out to look for it.

97
0:03:56.866,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So I was the first subject.

98
0:03:58.817,000 --> 0:04:,000
I went into the scanner, I lay on my back,

99
0:04:01.029,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I held my head as still as I could

100
0:04:03.612,000 --> 0:04:08,000
while staring at pictures of faces like these

101
0:04:08.629,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and objects like these

102
0:04:10.76,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and faces and objects for hours.

103
0:04:15.925,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So as somebody who has pretty close to the world record

104
0:04:18.697,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of total number of hours spent inside an MRI scanner,

105
0:04:22.24,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I can tell you that one of the skills

106
0:04:23.672,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that's really important for MRI research

107
0:04:26.335,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is bladder control.

108
0:04:28.113,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

109
0:04:29.915,000 --> 0:04:3,000
When I got out of the scanner,

110
0:04:31.452,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I did a quick analysis of the data,

111
0:04:33.768,000 --> 0:04:34,000
looking for any parts of my brain

112
0:04:35.271,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that produced a higher response when I was looking at faces

113
0:04:38.077,000 --> 0:04:39,000
than when I was looking at objects,

114
0:04:39.947,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and here's what I saw.

115
0:04:42.118,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now this image looks just awful by today's standards,

116
0:04:45.774,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but at the time I thought it was beautiful.

117
0:04:48.582,000 --> 0:04:49,000
What it shows is that region right there,

118
0:04:50.532,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that little blob,

119
0:04:51.815,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it's about the size of an olive

120
0:04:53.562,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it's on the bottom surface of my brain

121
0:04:55.718,000 --> 0:04:58,000
about an inch straight in from right there.

122
0:04:58.924,000 --> 0:05:,000
And what that part of my brain is doing

123
0:05:01.714,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is producing a higher MRI response,

124
0:05:04.634,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that is, higher neural activity,

125
0:05:06.382,000 --> 0:05:07,000
when I was looking at faces

126
0:05:07.864,000 --> 0:05:09,000
than when I was looking at objects.

127
0:05:10.13,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So that's pretty cool,

128
0:05:11.49,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but how do we know this isn't a fluke?

129
0:05:13.808,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Well, the easiest way

130
0:05:15.228,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is to just do the experiment again.

131
0:05:17.342,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So I got back in the scanner,

132
0:05:18.981,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I looked at more faces and I looked at more objects

133
0:05:21.412,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and I got a similar blob,

134
0:05:23.601,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and then I did it again

135
0:05:25.496,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I did it again

136
0:05:27.351,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and again and again,

137
0:05:30.423,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and around about then

138
0:05:31.47,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I decided to believe it was for real.

139
0:05:34.411,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But still, maybe this is something weird about my brain

140
0:05:38.164,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and no one else has one of these things in there,

141
0:05:40.626,000 --> 0:05:42,000
so to find out, we scanned a bunch of other people

142
0:05:43.081,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and found that pretty much everyone

143
0:05:45.527,000 --> 0:05:47,000
has that little face-processing region

144
0:05:47.533,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in a similar neighborhood of the brain.

145
0:05:50.426,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So the next question was,

146
0:05:52.314,000 --> 0:05:53,000
what does this thing really do?

147
0:05:53.788,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Is it really specialized just for face recognition?

148
0:05:57.72,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Well, maybe not, right?

149
0:05:58.96,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Maybe it responds not only to faces

150
0:06:00.762,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but to any body part.

151
0:06:02.871,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Maybe it responds to anything human

152
0:06:05.24,000 --> 0:06:06,000
or anything alive

153
0:06:07.02,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or anything round.

154
0:06:08.676,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The only way to be really sure that that region

155
0:06:10.83,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is specialized for face recognition

156
0:06:13.247,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is to rule out all of those hypotheses.

157
0:06:15.89,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So we spent much of the next couple of years

158
0:06:18.72,000 --> 0:06:19,000
scanning subjects while they looked at lots

159
0:06:20.367,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of different kinds of images,

160
0:06:21.973,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and we showed that that part of the brain

161
0:06:23.93,000 --> 0:06:24,000
responds strongly when you look at

162
0:06:25.88,000 --> 0:06:28,000
any images that are faces of any kind,

163
0:06:29.333,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and it responds much less strongly

164
0:06:31.246,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to any image you show that isn't a face,

165
0:06:34.395,000 --> 0:06:35,000
like some of these.

166
0:06:35.7,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So have we finally nailed the case

167
0:06:37.939,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that this region is necessary for face recognition?

168
0:06:41.179,000 --> 0:06:42,000
No, we haven't.

169
0:06:42.502,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Brain imaging can never tell you

170
0:06:44.453,000 --> 0:06:46,000
if a region is necessary for anything.

171
0:06:46.893,000 --> 0:06:47,000
All you can do with brain imaging

172
0:06:48.333,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is watch regions turn on and off

173
0:06:50.381,000 --> 0:06:51,000
as people think different thoughts.

174
0:06:52.349,000 --> 0:06:55,000
To tell if a part of the brain is necessary for a mental function,

175
0:06:55.96,000 --> 0:06:57,000
you need to mess with it and see what happens,

176
0:06:58.469,000 --> 0:07:,000
and normally we don't get to do that.

177
0:07:00.744,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But an amazing opportunity came about

178
0:07:03.328,000 --> 0:07:05,000
very recently when a couple of colleagues of mine

179
0:07:05.792,000 --> 0:07:08,000
tested this man who has epilepsy

180
0:07:08.863,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and who is shown here in his hospital bed

181
0:07:11.545,000 --> 0:07:12,000
where he's just had electrodes placed

182
0:07:12.912,000 --> 0:07:14,000
on the surface of his brain

183
0:07:14.983,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to identify the source of his seizures.

184
0:07:17.537,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So it turned out by total chance

185
0:07:20.07,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that two of the electrodes

186
0:07:22.019,000 --> 0:07:25,000
happened to be right on top of his face area.

187
0:07:25.242,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So with the patient's consent,

188
0:07:27.571,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the doctors asked him what happened

189
0:07:30.158,000 --> 0:07:34,000
when they electrically stimulated that part of his brain.

190
0:07:34.324,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, the patient doesn't know

191
0:07:35.978,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where those electrodes are,

192
0:07:37.362,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and he's never heard of the face area.

193
0:07:39.574,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So let's watch what happens.

194
0:07:41.565,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's going to start with a control condition

195
0:07:43.534,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that will say "Sham" nearly invisibly

196
0:07:45.941,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in red in the lower left,

197
0:07:47.651,000 --> 0:07:49,000
when no current is delivered,

198
0:07:49.933,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and you'll hear the neurologist speaking to the patient first. So let's watch.

199
0:07:53.748,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Video) Neurologist: Okay, just look at my face

200
0:07:55.829,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and tell me what happens when I do this.

201
0:07:59.114,000 --> 0:07:59,000
All right?

202
0:08:00.048,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Patient: Okay.

203
0:08:02.871,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Neurologist: One, two, three.

204
0:08:07.191,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Patient: Nothing. Neurologist: Nothing? Okay.

205
0:08:10.206,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I'm going to do it one more time.

206
0:08:12.613,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Look at my face.

207
0:08:15.807,000 --> 0:08:19,000
One, two, three.

208
0:08:20.307,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Patient: You just turned into somebody else.

209
0:08:23.131,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Your face metamorphosed.

210
0:08:25.268,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Your nose got saggy, it went to the left.

211
0:08:28.279,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You almost looked like somebody I'd seen before,

212
0:08:31.815,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but somebody different.

213
0:08:34.449,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That was a trip.

214
0:08:36.521,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

215
0:08:39.653,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Nancy Kanwisher: So this experiment —

216
0:08:41.268,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Applause) —

217
0:08:45.491,000 --> 0:08:47,000
this experiment finally nails the case

218
0:08:48.173,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that this region of the brain is not only

219
0:08:49.998,000 --> 0:08:51,000
selectively responsive to faces

220
0:08:52.135,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but causally involved in face perception.

221
0:08:55.18,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So I went through all of these details

222
0:08:57.31,000 --> 0:08:59,000
about the face region to show you what it takes

223
0:08:59.774,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to really establish that a part of the brain

224
0:09:02.113,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is selectively involved in a specific mental process.

225
0:09:05.241,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Next, I'll go through much more quickly

226
0:09:07.4,000 --> 0:09:09,000
some of the other specialized regions of the brain

227
0:09:10.06,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that we and others have found.

228
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So to do this, I've spent a lot of time

229
0:09:14.274,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in the scanner over the last month

230
0:09:16.141,000 --> 0:09:18,000
so I can show you these things in my brain.

231
0:09:18.402,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So let's get started. Here's my right hemisphere.

232
0:09:21.635,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So we're oriented like that. You're looking at my head this way.

233
0:09:24.297,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Imagine taking the skull off

234
0:09:25.39,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and looking at the surface of the brain like that.

235
0:09:27.658,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Okay, now as you can see,

236
0:09:29.416,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the surface of the brain is all folded up.

237
0:09:30.919,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So that's not good. Stuff could be hidden in there.

238
0:09:32.64,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We want to see the whole thing,

239
0:09:34.074,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so let's inflate it so we can see the whole thing.

240
0:09:37.386,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Next, let's find that face area I've been talking about

241
0:09:40.215,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that responds to images like these.

242
0:09:42.442,000 --> 0:09:43,000
To see that, let's turn the brain around

243
0:09:43.961,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and look on the inside surface on the bottom,

244
0:09:45.98,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and there it is, that's my face area.

245
0:09:48.285,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Just to the right of that is another region

246
0:09:50.992,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that is shown in purple

247
0:09:52.63,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that responds when you process color information,

248
0:09:55.702,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and near those regions are other regions

249
0:09:58.393,000 --> 0:10:,000
that are involved in perceiving places,

250
0:10:00.756,000 --> 0:10:02,000
like right now, I'm seeing this layout of space around me

251
0:10:03.594,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and these regions in green right there

252
0:10:05.346,000 --> 0:10:06,000
are really active.

253
0:10:06.62,000 --> 0:10:08,000
There's another one out on the outside surface again

254
0:10:08.99,000 --> 0:10:1,000
where there's a couple more face regions as well.

255
0:10:11.795,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Also in this vicinity

256
0:10:14.14,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is a region that's selectively involved

257
0:10:15.785,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in processing visual motion,

258
0:10:17.721,000 --> 0:10:18,000
like these moving dots here,

259
0:10:19.225,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and that's in yellow at the bottom of the brain,

260
0:10:21.914,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and near that is a region that responds

261
0:10:25.082,000 --> 0:10:27,000
when you look at images of bodies and body parts

262
0:10:27.979,000 --> 0:10:29,000
like these, and that region is shown in lime green

263
0:10:30.724,000 --> 0:10:32,000
at the bottom of the brain.

264
0:10:32.727,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Now all these regions I've shown you so far

265
0:10:35.359,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are involved in specific aspects of visual perception.

266
0:10:39.791,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Do we also have specialized brain regions

267
0:10:41.939,000 --> 0:10:43,000
for other senses, like hearing?

268
0:10:44.752,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Yes, we do. So if we turn the brain around a little bit,

269
0:10:47.789,000 --> 0:10:49,000
here's a region in dark blue

270
0:10:50.19,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that we reported just a couple of months ago,

271
0:10:52.536,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and this region responds strongly

272
0:10:54.17,000 --> 0:10:57,000
when you hear sounds with pitch, like these.

273
0:10:57.599,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Sirens)

274
0:10:59.742,000 --> 0:11:01,000
(Cello music)

275
0:11:01.823,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Doorbell)

276
0:11:03.74,000 --> 0:11:06,000
In contrast, that same region does not respond strongly

277
0:11:07.348,000 --> 0:11:08,000
when you hear perfectly familiar sounds

278
0:11:08.91,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that don't have a clear pitch, like these.

279
0:11:11.272,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Chomping)

280
0:11:13.741,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Drum roll)

281
0:11:15.941,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Toilet flushing)

282
0:11:18.708,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Okay. Next to the pitch region

283
0:11:21.206,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is another set of regions that are selectively responsive

284
0:11:23.68,000 --> 0:11:25,000
when you hear the sounds of speech.

285
0:11:26.445,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Okay, now let's look at these same regions.

286
0:11:28.285,000 --> 0:11:3,000
In my left hemisphere, there's a similar arrangement —

287
0:11:30.753,000 --> 0:11:31,000
not identical, but similar —

288
0:11:32.226,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and most of the same regions are in here,

289
0:11:34.435,000 --> 0:11:36,000
albeit sometimes different in size.

290
0:11:36.437,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now, everything I've shown you so far

291
0:11:38.451,000 --> 0:11:41,000
are regions that are involved in different aspects of perception,

292
0:11:41.477,000 --> 0:11:42,000
vision and hearing.

293
0:11:43.31,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Do we also have specialized brain regions

294
0:11:44.97,000 --> 0:11:47,000
for really fancy, complicated mental processes?

295
0:11:48.405,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Yes, we do.

296
0:11:49.834,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So here in pink are my language regions.

297
0:11:53.223,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So it's been known for a very long time

298
0:11:54.651,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that that general vicinity of the brain

299
0:11:56.686,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is involved in processing language,

300
0:11:58.879,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but we showed very recently

301
0:12:00.611,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that these pink regions

302
0:12:02.321,000 --> 0:12:04,000
respond extremely selectively.

303
0:12:04.526,000 --> 0:12:06,000
They respond when you understand the meaning of a sentence,

304
0:12:07.338,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but not when you do other complex mental things,

305
0:12:10.176,000 --> 0:12:12,000
like mental arithmetic

306
0:12:12.355,000 --> 0:12:14,000
or holding information in memory

307
0:12:14.751,000 --> 0:12:16,000
or appreciating the complex structure

308
0:12:17.406,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in a piece of music.

309
0:12:21.664,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The most amazing region that's been found yet

310
0:12:24.553,000 --> 0:12:27,000
is this one right here in turquoise.

311
0:12:27.86,000 --> 0:12:29,000
This region responds

312
0:12:30.05,000 --> 0:12:34,000
when you think about what another person is thinking.

313
0:12:34.318,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So that may seem crazy,

314
0:12:35.962,000 --> 0:12:38,000
but actually, we humans do this all the time.

315
0:12:39.83,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You're doing this when you realize

316
0:12:42.023,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that your partner is going to be worried

317
0:12:43.654,000 --> 0:12:45,000
if you don't call home to say you're running late.

318
0:12:46.161,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I'm doing this with that region of my brain right now

319
0:12:49.63,000 --> 0:12:51,000
when I realize that you guys

320
0:12:51.911,000 --> 0:12:52,000
are probably now wondering about

321
0:12:53.509,000 --> 0:12:55,000
all that gray, uncharted territory in the brain,

322
0:12:56.056,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and what's up with that?

323
0:12:58.02,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Well, I'm wondering about that too,

324
0:12:59.705,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and we're running a bunch of experiments in my lab right now

325
0:13:02.1,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to try to find a number of other

326
0:13:04.113,000 --> 0:13:06,000
possible specializations in the brain

327
0:13:06.145,000 --> 0:13:09,000
for other very specific mental functions.

328
0:13:09.513,000 --> 0:13:11,000
But importantly, I don't think we have

329
0:13:12.134,000 --> 0:13:13,000
specializations in the brain

330
0:13:13.698,000 --> 0:13:15,000
for every important mental function,

331
0:13:16.444,000 --> 0:13:19,000
even mental functions that may be critical for survival.

332
0:13:19.853,000 --> 0:13:21,000
In fact, a few years ago,

333
0:13:21.955,000 --> 0:13:22,000
there was a scientist in my lab

334
0:13:23.072,000 --> 0:13:24,000
who became quite convinced

335
0:13:24.481,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that he'd found a brain region

336
0:13:26.23,000 --> 0:13:27,000
for detecting food,

337
0:13:28.142,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and it responded really strongly in the scanner

338
0:13:30.06,000 --> 0:13:32,000
when people looked at images like this.

339
0:13:32.788,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And further, he found a similar response

340
0:13:35.7,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in more or less the same location

341
0:13:37.639,000 --> 0:13:39,000
in 10 out of 12 subjects.

342
0:13:39.64,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So he was pretty stoked,

343
0:13:41.934,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and he was running around the lab

344
0:13:43.194,000 --> 0:13:45,000
telling everyone that he was going to go on "Oprah"

345
0:13:45.196,000 --> 0:13:47,000
with his big discovery.

346
0:13:47.214,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But then he devised the critical test:

347
0:13:50.236,000 --> 0:13:53,000
He showed subjects images of food like this

348
0:13:53.419,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and compared them to images with very similar

349
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
color and shape, but that weren't food, like these.

350
0:13:59.97,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And his region responded the same

351
0:14:02.101,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to both sets of images.

352
0:14:04.05,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So it wasn't a food area,

353
0:14:05.377,000 --> 0:14:07,000
it was just a region that liked colors and shapes.

354
0:14:08.148,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So much for "Oprah."

355
0:14:12.483,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But then the question, of course, is,

356
0:14:14.708,000 --> 0:14:16,000
how do we process all this other stuff

357
0:14:16.834,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that we don't have specialized brain regions for?

358
0:14:19.804,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Well, I think the answer is that in addition

359
0:14:21.615,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to these highly specialized components that I've been describing,

360
0:14:25.169,000 --> 0:14:28,000
we also have a lot of very general- purpose machinery in our heads

361
0:14:28.848,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that enables us to tackle

362
0:14:30.342,000 --> 0:14:32,000
whatever problem comes along.

363
0:14:32.448,000 --> 0:14:34,000
In fact, we've shown recently that

364
0:14:34.503,000 --> 0:14:36,000
these regions here in white

365
0:14:36.571,000 --> 0:14:39,000
respond whenever you do any difficult mental task

366
0:14:39.982,000 --> 0:14:4,000
at all —

367
0:14:41.083,000 --> 0:14:44,000
well, of the seven that we've tested.

368
0:14:44.654,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So each of the brain regions that I've described

369
0:14:46.823,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to you today

370
0:14:48.129,000 --> 0:14:5,000
is present in approximately the same location

371
0:14:50.896,000 --> 0:14:51,000
in every normal subject.

372
0:14:52.638,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I could take any of you,

373
0:14:54.261,000 --> 0:14:55,000
pop you in the scanner,

374
0:14:55.487,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and find each of those regions in your brain,

375
0:14:57.772,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and it would look a lot like my brain,

376
0:14:59.677,000 --> 0:15:01,000
although the regions would be slightly different

377
0:15:01.747,000 --> 0:15:04,000
in their exact location and in their size.

378
0:15:05.311,000 --> 0:15:07,000
What's important to me about this work

379
0:15:07.676,000 --> 0:15:09,000
is not the particular locations of these brain regions,

380
0:15:10.645,000 --> 0:15:12,000
but the simple fact that we have

381
0:15:13.232,000 --> 0:15:15,000
selective, specific components of mind and brain

382
0:15:15.8,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in the first place.

383
0:15:17.448,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I mean, it could have been otherwise.

384
0:15:19.459,000 --> 0:15:21,000
The brain could have been a single,

385
0:15:21.9,000 --> 0:15:22,000
general-purpose processor,

386
0:15:23.395,000 --> 0:15:24,000
more like a kitchen knife

387
0:15:24.867,000 --> 0:15:25,000
than a Swiss Army knife.

388
0:15:26.55,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Instead, what brain imaging has delivered

389
0:15:29.661,000 --> 0:15:32,000
is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind.

390
0:15:33.507,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So we have this picture of very general-purpose

391
0:15:35.97,000 --> 0:15:36,000
machinery in our heads

392
0:15:37.04,000 --> 0:15:39,000
in addition to this surprising array

393
0:15:39.397,000 --> 0:15:42,000
of very specialized components.

394
0:15:43.712,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It's early days in this enterprise.

395
0:15:45.865,000 --> 0:15:47,000
We've painted only the first brushstrokes

396
0:15:48.641,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in our neural portrait of the human mind.

397
0:15:51.568,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The most fundamental questions remain unanswered.

398
0:15:54.65,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So for example, what does each of these regions do exactly?

399
0:15:58.45,000 --> 0:16:,000
Why do we need three face areas

400
0:16:00.592,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and three place areas,

401
0:16:02.057,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and what's the division of labor between them?

402
0:16:04.925,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Second, how are all these things

403
0:16:07.618,000 --> 0:16:08,000
connected in the brain?

404
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
With diffusion imaging,

405
0:16:10.917,000 --> 0:16:12,000
you can trace bundles of neurons

406
0:16:13.096,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that connect to different parts of the brain,

407
0:16:15.671,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and with this method shown here,

408
0:16:17.302,000 --> 0:16:2,000
you can trace the connections of individual neurons in the brain,

409
0:16:20.999,000 --> 0:16:22,000
potentially someday giving us a wiring diagram

410
0:16:23.717,000 --> 0:16:25,000
of the entire human brain.

411
0:16:25.783,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Third, how does all of this

412
0:16:27.83,000 --> 0:16:3,000
very systematic structure get built,

413
0:16:30.979,000 --> 0:16:32,000
both over development in childhood

414
0:16:33.935,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and over the evolution of our species?

415
0:16:36.747,000 --> 0:16:37,000
To address questions like that,

416
0:16:38.647,000 --> 0:16:39,000
scientists are now scanning

417
0:16:40.43,000 --> 0:16:42,000
other species of animals,

418
0:16:42.587,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and they're also scanning human infants.

419
0:16:48.931,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Many people justify the high cost of neuroscience research

420
0:16:52.582,000 --> 0:16:54,000
by pointing out that it may help us someday

421
0:16:55.336,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to treat brain disorders like Alzheimer's and autism.

422
0:16:58.793,000 --> 0:16:59,000
That's a hugely important goal,

423
0:17:00.74,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and I'd be thrilled if any of my work contributed to it,

424
0:17:03.961,000 --> 0:17:05,000
but fixing things that are broken in the world

425
0:17:06.959,000 --> 0:17:08,000
is not the only thing that's worth doing.

426
0:17:09.76,000 --> 0:17:12,000
The effort to understand the human mind and brain

427
0:17:12.988,000 --> 0:17:14,000
is worthwhile even if it never led to the treatment

428
0:17:15.806,000 --> 0:17:16,000
of a single disease.

429
0:17:17.483,000 --> 0:17:19,000
What could be more thrilling

430
0:17:19.52,000 --> 0:17:22,000
than to understand the fundamental mechanisms

431
0:17:22.661,000 --> 0:17:24,000
that underlie human experience,

432
0:17:24.957,000 --> 0:17:26,000
to understand, in essence, who we are?

433
0:17:27.883,000 --> 0:17:3,000
This is, I think, the greatest scientific quest

434
0:17:31.332,000 --> 0:17:33,000
of all time.

435
0:17:34.045,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Applause)

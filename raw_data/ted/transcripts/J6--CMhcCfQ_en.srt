1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
so I put children to sleep for a living.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I'm an academic, so I put audiences to sleep for free.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But what I actually mostly do

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is I manage the pain management service

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
at the Packard Children's Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it's from the experience

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
from about 20 or 25 years of doing that

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that I want to bring to you the message this morning,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that pain is a disease.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now most of the time,

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
you think of pain as a symptom of a disease,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and that's true most of the time.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's the symptom of a tumor or an infection

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or an inflammation or an operation.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But about 10 percent of the time,

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
after the patient has recovered from one of those events,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
pain persists.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It persists for months

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and oftentimes for years,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and when that happens,

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it is its own disease.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and what we can do about it,

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I want to show you how it feels for my patients.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So imagine, if you will,

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that I'm stroking your arm with this feather,

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
as I'm stroking my arm right now.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now, I want you to imagine

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that I'm stroking it with this.

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Please keep your seat.

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A very different feeling.

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain?

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Imagine, if you will, these two ideas together.

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Imagine what your life would be like

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
if I were to stroke it with this feather,

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
but your brain was telling you

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that this is what you are feeling --

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
In fact, imagine something even worse.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Imagine I were to stroke your child's arm with this feather,

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and their brain [was] telling them

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that they were feeling this hot torch.

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That was the experience of my patient, Chandler,

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
whom you see in the photograph.

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
As you can see, she's a beautiful, young woman.

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
She was 16 years old last year when I met her,

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and she aspired to be a professional dancer.

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals,

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist.

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now you would probably imagine, as she did,

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that a wrist sprain is a trivial event

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in a person's life.

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Wrap it in an ACE bandage,

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
take some ibuprofen for a week or two,

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and that's the end of the story.

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But in Chandler's case, that was the beginning of the story.

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is what her arm looked like

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain.

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You can see that the arm is discolored,

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
purplish in color.

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
It was cadaverically cold to the touch.

66
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The muscles were frozen, paralyzed --

67
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
dystonic is how we refer to that.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands,

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to her fingertips, from her wrist up to her elbow,

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
almost all the way to her shoulder.

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
But the worst part was,

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day.

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The worst part was that she had allodynia,

74
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated

75
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
with the feather and with the torch.

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The lightest touch of her arm --

77
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the touch of a hand,

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the touch even of a sleeve, of a garment, as she put it on --

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
caused excruciating, burning pain.

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
How can the nervous system get this so wrong?

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
How can the nervous system

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
misinterpret an innocent sensation

83
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
like the touch of a hand

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and turn it into the malevolent sensation

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of the touch of the flame?

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is hardwired like your house.

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In your house, wires run in the wall,

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling

90
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and from the junction box to the light bulb.

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And when you turn the switch on, the light goes on.

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And when you turn the switch off, the light goes off.

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that.

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
If you hit your thumb with a hammer,

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
these wires in your arm -- that, of course, we call nerves --

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
where new wires, new nerves,

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
take the information up to the brain

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But the situation, of course, in the human body

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is far more complicated than that.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Instead of it being the case

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that that junction box in the spinal cord

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
by releasing these little brown packets

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of chemical information called neurotransmitters

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in a linear one-on-one fashion,

108
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in fact, what happens

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions --

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
laterally, vertically, up and down in the spinal cord --

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and they start interacting

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
with other adjacent cells.

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
These cells, called glial cells,

114
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
were once thought to be

115
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that did nothing more than hold all the important things together,

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
like the nerves.

118
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But it turns out

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
the glial cells have a vital role

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in the modulation, amplification

121
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and, in the case of pain, the distortion

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of sensory experiences.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
These glial cells become activated.

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins,

125
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which spill out

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and interact with adjacent nerves,

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and they start releasing their neurotransmitters,

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and those neurotransmitters spill out

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and activate adjacent glial cells, and so on and so forth,

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
until what we have

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is a positive feedback loop.

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's almost as if somebody came into your home

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and rewired your walls

134
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
so that the next time you turned on the light switch,

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the toilet flushed three doors down,

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or your dishwasher went on,

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or your computer monitor turned off.

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
That's crazy,

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but that's, in fact, what happens

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
with chronic pain.

141
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And that's why pain becomes its own disease.

142
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The nervous system has plasticity.

143
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It changes, and it morphs

144
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in response to stimuli.

145
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well, what do we do about that?

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
What can we do in a case like Chandler's?

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
at this point in time.

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs --

150
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
painkillers --

151
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
which are, frankly, not very effective

152
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
for this kind of pain.

153
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We take nerves that are noisy and active

154
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that should be quiet,

155
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics.

156
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And most importantly, what we do

157
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is we use a rigorous, and often uncomfortable, process

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of physical therapy and occupational therapy

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to retrain the nerves in the nervous system

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to respond normally

161
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to the activities and sensory experiences

162
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that are part of everyday life.

163
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And we support all of that

164
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
with an intensive psychotherapy program

165
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to address the despondency, despair and depression

166
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that always accompanies

167
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
severe, chronic pain.

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It's successful,

169
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as you can see from this video of Chandler,

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
who, two months after we first met her,

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
is now doings a back flip.

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And I had lunch with her yesterday

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
because she's a college student studying dance at Long Beach here,

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and she's doing absolutely fantastic.

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But the future is actually even brighter.

176
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The future holds the promise

177
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that new drugs will be developed

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that are not symptom-modifying drugs

179
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that simply mask the problem,

180
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as we have now,

181
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but that will be disease-modifying drugs

182
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that will actually go right to the root of the problem

183
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and attack those glial cells,

184
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
or those pernicious proteins

185
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that the glial cells elaborate,

186
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up,

187
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or plasticity,

188
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that so is capable

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
of distorting and amplifying

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the sensory experience that we call pain.

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So I have hope

192
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that in the future,

193
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized,

194
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
who said, "My philosophy:

195
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
No pain, no pain."

196
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Thank you very much.

197
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Applause)

Cloe Shasha: When I was a little girl,

4
0:00:22.858,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I used to draw on all the walls of my house.

5
0:00:25.25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(RS: Speaks Spanish)

6
0:00:33.583,000 --> 0:00:35,000
CS: Until one day, my mother got angry and told me,

7
0:00:36.333,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"You can only draw on one wall.

8
0:00:38.125,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Don't draw on any others."

9
0:00:39.667,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:41.125,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Speaks Spanish)

11
0:00:44.625,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That was the first time I experienced an act of totalitarian censorship.

12
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:51.542,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Speaks Spanish)

14
0:00:56.708,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But a lack of freedom stimulates creativity and empowers it.

15
0:01:00.875,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Speaks Spanish)

16
0:01:19.042,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Many years have passed since my childhood,

17
0:01:21.417,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but throughout my formal studies,

18
0:01:23.042,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I found myself drawing in the margins of my notebooks

19
0:01:25.583,000 --> 0:01:27,000
instead of paying attention to my professors.

20
0:01:28.25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I studied journalism in college

21
0:01:30.042,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with the intention of expanding my communication and writing skills,

22
0:01:33.667,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but the only thing that I felt connected to in life

23
0:01:36.292,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was drawing.

24
0:01:37.708,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Speaks Spanish)

25
0:01:43.625,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was born in a democracy,

26
0:01:45.458,000 --> 0:01:48,000
in a country called Venezuela, which is now a dictatorship.

27
0:01:49.458,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Speaks Spanish)

28
0:02:01.625,000 --> 0:02:02,000
For 19 years,

29
0:02:02.917,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I was the daily cartoonist for "El Universal,"

30
0:02:05.292,000 --> 0:02:07,000
one of the biggest newspapers in Venezuela.

31
0:02:07.833,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I really enjoyed translating political and cultural current events into drawings.

32
0:02:12.75,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Speaks Spanish)

33
0:02:25.292,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In the year 2014,

34
0:02:26.667,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I got fired from my job at the newspaper over a cartoon that I drew

35
0:02:30.292,000 --> 0:02:32,000
alluding to the health care system in Venezuela.

36
0:02:33.083,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I drew a flat line of a heartbeat monitor,

37
0:02:35.542,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but I intentionally drew the heartbeat line

38
0:02:37.833,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in a way that resembled the signature of Hugo Chavez,

39
0:02:40.583,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the former president of Venezuela.

40
0:02:42.542,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:43.583,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Speaks Spanish)

42
0:02:51.833,000 --> 0:02:53,000
All of this happened after the newspaper was bought

43
0:02:54.25,000 --> 0:02:55,000
by an unknown company,

44
0:02:55.833,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and some of us suspect

45
0:02:57.25,000 --> 0:03:,000
that it was the Venezuelan government who was behind that deal.

46
0:03:00.958,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Speaks Spanish)

47
0:03:11.833,000 --> 0:03:13,000
My work as a cartoonist became more and more of a nuisance

48
0:03:14.583,000 --> 0:03:15,000
for the dictatorship.

49
0:03:15.958,000 --> 0:03:17,000
They have no tolerance for any freedom of expression

50
0:03:18.708,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or free thinking.

51
0:03:20.833,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Speaks Spanish)

52
0:03:37.625,000 --> 0:03:38,000
After I got fired,

53
0:03:38.917,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I started to feel unsafe in my own country.

54
0:03:41.583,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I received anonymous calls and death threats.

55
0:03:44.5,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I was mocked publicly on national television.

56
0:03:47.417,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I was eventually forced out of Venezuela,

57
0:03:49.75,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and I now live in Miami, Florida,

58
0:03:51.75,000 --> 0:03:53,000
where I am free to be my own editor for my work.

59
0:03:54.417,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Speaks Spanish)

60
0:04:07.375,000 --> 0:04:1,000
A political cartoon is a barometer of freedom in a country.

61
0:04:10.833,000 --> 0:04:12,000
That's why dictators hate cartoonists

62
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and try to eradicate everything that involves humor

63
0:04:16.125,000 --> 0:04:18,000
as a mirror for social and political issues.

64
0:04:19.792,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Speaks Spanish)

65
0:04:26.792,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A cartoon involves a delicate balance of ideas and drawings

66
0:04:30.375,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that reveal a hidden truth.

67
0:04:32.458,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Speaks Spanish)

68
0:04:37.208,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And a good cartoon is one that conveys a plot of a full-length movie

69
0:04:40.958,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in a single frame.

70
0:04:42.5,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Speaks Spanish)

71
0:04:56.417,000 --> 0:04:59,000
A cartoon needs to communicate the core of a story with its precision.

72
0:05:00.208,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And when it succeeds,

73
0:05:01.5,000 --> 0:05:04,000
its message can have the effect of inoculating people

74
0:05:04.667,000 --> 0:05:05,000
with a dose of skepticism.

75
0:05:06.958,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Speaks Spanish)

76
0:05:22.708,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Cartoons are drawn from observation and analysis.

77
0:05:26.167,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They are inspired by muses of mythology,

78
0:05:28.5,000 --> 0:05:31,000
as well as classical, modern and paleolithic tales.

79
0:05:32.292,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
When we are told that a modern-day emperor is wearing new clothes,

81
0:05:38.417,000 --> 0:05:41,000
cartoons reveal that the emperor just might still be naked.

82
0:05:42.333,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Speaks Spanish)

83
0:05:58.208,000 --> 0:05:59,000
At one point in my career,

84
0:05:59.708,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I drew pigs and compared them with politicians and national guards

85
0:06:03.542,000 --> 0:06:07,000
who were responsible for stopping peaceful student demonstrations.

86
0:06:07.583,000 --> 0:06:09,000
One day, when I got back to my office,

87
0:06:09.75,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I had a letter on my desk.

88
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Speaks Spanish)

89
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The letter was from the Venezuelan Swine Federation.

90
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:2,000
(Laughter)

91
0:06:20.458,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Speaks Spanish)

92
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The letter said,

93
0:06:43.292,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"Please do not compare an animal as wonderful as a pig with politicians.

94
0:06:46.708,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

95
0:06:47.75,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Pigs are very friendly and noble,

96
0:06:49.375,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they can be a great mascot,

97
0:06:50.875,000 --> 0:06:51,000
they make good pets

98
0:06:52.208,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and they provide sustenance to us in the form of pork."

99
0:06:56.042,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Speaks Spanish)

100
0:07:01.958,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I think they were absolutely right.

101
0:07:03.708,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I didn't draw any more pigs,

102
0:07:05.125,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but I did keep drawing politicians.

103
0:07:07.208,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

104
0:07:08.25,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Speaks Spanish)

105
0:07:26.458,000 --> 0:07:28,000
A cartoon travels on an information highway,

106
0:07:29.333,000 --> 0:07:31,000
which seems like it has multiple lanes,

107
0:07:31.417,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but in reality, all of these lanes

108
0:07:33.417,000 --> 0:07:36,000
lead to a binary response of either positivity or rage.

109
0:07:37.417,000 --> 0:07:39,000
"I like it" or "I don't like it."

110
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Those are the only responses

111
0:07:41.375,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that govern democratic thinking on the internet.

112
0:07:44.5,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Speaks Spanish)

113
0:07:55.542,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We have lost the space for nuanced debate,

114
0:07:58.083,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we have no time,

115
0:07:59.375,000 --> 0:08:01,000
so we simply respond with approval or disdain,

116
0:08:01.958,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and we let algorithms take over.

117
0:08:04.583,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Speaks Spanish)

118
0:08:20.75,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But a cartoon is born from a space of deep, nuanced thinking.

119
0:08:24.958,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Creating a good cartoon involves repeated failures,

120
0:08:27.75,000 --> 0:08:28,000
draft after draft.

121
0:08:29.667,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And a cartoonist must shed their own taboos

122
0:08:32.042,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to spark a conversation, rather than a confrontation,

123
0:08:35.25,000 --> 0:08:36,000
through their work.

124
0:08:36.917,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Speaks Spanish)

125
0:08:54.833,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In the year 2013, President Chavez died,

126
0:08:58.167,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I had to think about what to draw as the cartoon of the day

127
0:09:01.167,000 --> 0:09:02,000
at "El Universal."

128
0:09:02.458,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I was personally happy that he had passed away,

129
0:09:04.708,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because I thought that the end of his power

130
0:09:06.732,000 --> 0:09:09,000
would potentially bring our country closer to freedom and better times.

131
0:09:10.5,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Speaks Spanish)

132
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But there were many other people who were mourning the death of Chavez,

133
0:09:23.417,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so there was a divided sentiment in Venezuela.

134
0:09:25.584,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Some were celebrating,

135
0:09:26.875,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and others were crying at the loss of their leader.

136
0:09:30.042,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Speaks Spanish)

137
0:09:45.25,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I felt stuck,

138
0:09:46.542,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I really didn't know what to draw in this historic moment.

139
0:09:49.292,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And I knew that I couldn't allow my happiness to seep into my work,

140
0:09:52.625,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that I should take the higher road and respect people's grief.

141
0:09:55.917,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So what could I draw?

142
0:09:57.833,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Speaks Spanish)

143
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I spent many hours drafting and throwing out papers.

144
0:10:18.458,000 --> 0:10:19,000
My editor called me and said

145
0:10:19.917,000 --> 0:10:21,000
everything was late for that day's newspaper

146
0:10:22.167,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and asked me when I'd be done.

147
0:10:23.958,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It was in the middle of the night that the idea came to me.

148
0:10:26.792,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And we then published a cartoon

149
0:10:28.5,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that represented a historical moment in time.

150
0:10:31.667,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Speaks Spanish)

151
0:10:35.083,000 --> 0:10:37,000
A fallen king chess piece in red.

152
0:10:38.708,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Speaks Spanish)

153
0:10:50.958,000 --> 0:10:52,000
A good cartoon has a lot of power.

154
0:10:53.125,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It can generate action and reaction.

155
0:10:55.667,000 --> 0:10:58,000
That's why a cartoonist must exercise their power responsibly,

156
0:10:59.292,000 --> 0:11:,000
showcasing the truth

157
0:11:00.792,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and drawing without the fear of consequences.

158
0:11:03.667,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Speaks Spanish)

159
0:11:08.083,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Having an opinion has a cost,

160
0:11:09.75,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and in some countries, that cost is high.

161
0:11:12.792,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Speaks Spanish)

162
0:11:29.708,000 --> 0:11:3,000
In Venezuela,

163
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
many young people have been killed for protesting peacefully.

164
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
There are men and women who are stuck behind bars

165
0:11:36.375,000 --> 0:11:37,000
as political prisoners.

166
0:11:38.125,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So over the years,

167
0:11:39.417,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I've drawn the faces of imprisoned women,

168
0:11:41.375,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because I don't want them to be forgotten by the community.

169
0:11:45.083,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Speaks Spanish)

170
0:12:06.792,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This year at an event called El Foro Penal,

171
0:12:09.542,000 --> 0:12:1,000
which is a criminal forum

172
0:12:11.042,000 --> 0:12:12,000
where a group of lawyers do pro bono work

173
0:12:13.042,000 --> 0:12:14,000
for Venezuelan political prisoners,

174
0:12:15.042,000 --> 0:12:17,000
a young woman approached me and she said,

175
0:12:17.625,000 --> 0:12:18,000
"I was imprisoned,

176
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and then you drew my face and my story.

177
0:12:21.75,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's because of that drawing that people knew who I was.

178
0:12:24.917,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Your cartoon helped me survive my days in prison.

179
0:12:27.833,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Thank you."

180
0:12:29.125,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Speaks Spanish)

181
0:12:36.125,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This was a moment that meant a lot to me,

182
0:12:38.125,000 --> 0:12:39,000
because I had found a way to collaborate

183
0:12:40.083,000 --> 0:12:42,000
with the memories of my country and its people.

184
0:12:42.5,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Speaks Spanish)

185
0:13:01.708,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Last year, I started making drawings about immigration.

186
0:13:05.458,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I drew my own world, my fears,

187
0:13:08.333,000 --> 0:13:1,000
my suitcase, my roots

188
0:13:10.458,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and everything that I had to leave behind in Venezuela.

189
0:13:13.625,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I also drew my joy in the face of this new opportunity

190
0:13:16.833,000 --> 0:13:18,000
as an immigrant in the United States.

191
0:13:18.958,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Speaks Spanish)

192
0:13:25.667,000 --> 0:13:27,000
From there, I worked on a series of drawings

193
0:13:27.792,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that represented the experience and psychology of immigration.

194
0:13:31.375,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Speaks Spanish)

195
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Being an immigrant is like moving to another planet.

196
0:13:48.125,000 --> 0:13:51,000
At first, you don't understand anything about your new world.

197
0:13:51.667,000 --> 0:13:53,000
There are new codes, a new language

198
0:13:53.917,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and unfamiliar tools you need to learn how to use

199
0:13:56.75,000 --> 0:13:58,000
in order to adapt to your new life.

200
0:13:59.333,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Speaks Spanish)

201
0:14:04.833,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Being an immigrant is the closest thing to being an astronaut

202
0:14:07.917,000 --> 0:14:08,000
who landed on the moon.

203
0:14:09.625,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Speaks Spanish)

204
0:14:25.542,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Over time, that series of drawings became a traveling exhibition,

205
0:14:28.958,000 --> 0:14:29,000
called "I, Immigrant."

206
0:14:30.833,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And the exhibition traveled to multiple cities,

207
0:14:33.125,000 --> 0:14:36,000
including Miami, Houston, Madrid, Barcelona,

208
0:14:36.333,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and we're hoping for more places.

209
0:14:38.458,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Speaks Spanish)

210
0:14:46.458,000 --> 0:14:48,000
The show has become a meeting space for the diaspora,

211
0:14:49.458,000 --> 0:14:52,000
for people to gather and recognize their shared experiences of suffering

212
0:14:53.375,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that come with immigration.

213
0:14:55.208,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Speaks Spanish)

214
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:16,000
What I want these drawings to convey

215
0:15:16.833,000 --> 0:15:18,000
is that an immigrant is not a criminal.

216
0:15:19.292,000 --> 0:15:21,000
An immigrant is a person whose life has been broken.

217
0:15:22.208,000 --> 0:15:25,000
A person who has very likely been separated from their family

218
0:15:25.292,000 --> 0:15:26,000
under inhumane conditions.

219
0:15:27.208,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Who has been forced to leave their country in search of a better life.

220
0:15:31.333,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Speaks Spanish)

221
0:15:43.708,000 --> 0:15:45,000
A drawing can be a synthesis of a place,

222
0:15:45.875,000 --> 0:15:48,000
a universe, a country or a society.

223
0:15:49.042,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It can also represent the inner workings of someone's mind.

224
0:15:52.25,000 --> 0:15:56,000
For me, drawing cartoons is a form of resistance.

225
0:15:56.333,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Speaks Spanish)

226
0:16:09.625,000 --> 0:16:11,000
A cartoon is like a Rosetta stone.

227
0:16:12.083,000 --> 0:16:13,000
If we throw it into outer space,

228
0:16:13.792,000 --> 0:16:15,000
a future alien would be able to know with certainty

229
0:16:16.333,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that in the past,

230
0:16:17.625,000 --> 0:16:2,000
we once had a civilized world with free thinking.

231
0:16:20.917,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Speaks Spanish)

232
0:16:27.542,000 --> 0:16:3,000
That one wall that my mother gave me the freedom to draw on feels infinite.

233
0:16:31.25,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And it's for that reason that I am still drawing.

234
0:16:34.458,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Thank you very much.

235
0:16:35.833,000 --> 0:16:4,000
(Cheers and applause)

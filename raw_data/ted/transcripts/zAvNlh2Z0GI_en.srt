1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So I really consider myself a storyteller.

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But I don't really tell stories in the usual way,

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.

4
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
large numbers of other people to tell their stories,

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:44,000
people all around the world.

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.

8
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I think people are very similar,

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but I also think that we have trouble seeing that.

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,

11
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I think we all see a lot of gaps.

12
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And we define ourselves by our gaps.

13
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There's language gaps,

14
0:01:04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,

15
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:13,000
there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,

16
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,

17
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
there's also religious gaps.

18
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps

19
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because they make us feel like we identify with something,

20
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:26,000
some smaller community.

21
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But I think that actually, despite our gaps,

22
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we really have a lot in common.

23
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need

24
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to express ourselves.

25
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new.

26
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But the thing about self-expression

27
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is that there's traditionally been this imbalance

28
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
between the desire that we have to express ourselves

29
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and the number of sympathetic friends

30
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:52,000
who are willing to stand around and listen.

31
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This, also, is nothing new.

33
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance

34
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:03,000
by making art, writing poems, singing songs,

35
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,

36
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.

37
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What's new is that in the last several years

38
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:13,000
a lot of these very traditional physical human activities,

39
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.

40
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,

41
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.

42
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And so what I do is, I write computer programs

43
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that study very large sets of these footprints,

44
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them --

45
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:35,000
what they feel, what they think,

46
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
what's different in the world today than usual,

47
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:4,000
these sorts of questions.

48
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:42,000
One project that explores these ideas,

49
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:44,000
which was made about a year ago,

50
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is a piece called We Feel Fine.

51
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This is a piece that every two or three minutes

52
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:5,000
scans the world's newly-posted blog entries

53
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:55,000
for occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."

54
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And when it finds one of those phrases,

55
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it grabs the sentence up to the period,

56
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender

57
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.

58
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Then, knowing the geographical location and the time,

59
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we can also then figure out the weather

60
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:1,000
when that person wrote the sentence.

61
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:13,000
All of this information is saved in a database

62
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.

63
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It's been running for about a year and a half.

64
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.

65
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I'll show you a glimpse

66
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.

67
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,

68
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
each of which represents a single human feeling

69
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that was stated in the last few hours.

70
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside --

71
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.

72
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.

73
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The diameter of each dot

74
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
represents the length of the sentence inside,

75
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
so that the large dots contain large sentences,

76
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and the small dots contain small sentences.

77
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,

78
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
"I would just feel so much better

79
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:,000
if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me

80
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips."

81
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes

82
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in the world of human emotions.

83
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And all of these are stated by people:

84
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,

85
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,

86
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
it's nice to feel bigger again."

87
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,

88
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.

89
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And then they also exhibit curiosity.

90
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.

91
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You can see some other ones

92
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:32,000
are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen

93
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
around six words. Those six words represent the six movements

94
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.

95
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.

96
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I'll walk you through a few of those now.

97
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.

98
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,

99
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.

100
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"I feel a bit better now."

101
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do."

103
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"I feel gypped out of something awesome here."

104
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"I feel so free; I feel so good."

105
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."

106
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog

107
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
from which it was collected. And in that way,

108
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you can connect with the authors of these statements

109
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:19,000
if you feel some degree of empathy.

110
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The next movement is called Montage.

111
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs

112
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.

113
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings

114
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in the last few hours, if you will.

115
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.

116
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun

117
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
if it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.

118
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."

119
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
These are automatically constructed using the found objects:

121
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
"I think I feel a little full."

122
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The next movement is called mobs.

123
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns

124
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.

125
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now,

126
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.

127
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:14,000
We can also get a gender breakdown.

128
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And we see that women are slightly more prolific

129
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.

130
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram

131
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
of the world's emotional distribution by age.

132
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,

133
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,

134
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and it dies out very quickly from there.

135
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:36,000
In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics

136
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of the weather that they represent,

137
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so that the ones collected on a sunny day

138
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:41,000
swirl around as if they're part of the sun.

139
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.

140
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,

141
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground.

142
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions

143
0:06:52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.

144
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.

145
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:,000
We see that the world is feeling "used"

146
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:03,000
at 3.3 times the normal level right now.

147
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.

149
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Other views are also available.

150
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Here are gender, age, weather, location.

151
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The final movement is called Mounds.

152
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It's a bit different from the others.

153
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs

154
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which kind of jiggle.

155
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.

156
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."

157
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,

158
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.

159
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You can see the little pink cursor moving along,

160
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:36,000
representing our position.

161
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."

162
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:42,000
There's also a search capability,

163
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.

164
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted"

165
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh.

166
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

167
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But I'll spare you that.

168
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:

169
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:03,000
"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me."

170
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"I feel very lonely."

171
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
"I need to be in some backwoods redneck town

172
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so that I can feel beautiful."

173
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
"I feel invisible to you."

174
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to."

175
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty."

176
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."

177
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

178
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:4,000
"I love how I feel today."

179
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique

180
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that I call "passive observation."

181
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
What I mean by that is that it passively observes people

182
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs

183
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and looks at what people are writing,

184
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.

185
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And because of that,

186
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses

187
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that are often very moving.

188
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work

189
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
because people don't know they're being interviewed.

190
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that.

191
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Another technique is directly questioning people.

192
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,

193
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the Yahoo! Time Capsule,

194
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:19,000
which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.

195
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
It was divided into ten very simple themes --

196
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
love, anger, sadness and so on --

197
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
each of which contained a single, very open-ended question

198
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?

199
0:09:29,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.

200
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The time capsule was available for one month online,

201
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.

202
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's a spinning globe,

203
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures

204
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and words and drawings of people

205
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that submitted to the time capsule.

206
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.

207
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.

208
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World."

209
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There are two modes to the time capsule.

210
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
There's One World, which presents the spinning globe,

211
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips

212
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and lets you sift through them one by one.

213
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,

214
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico

215
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,

216
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides

217
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,

218
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.

219
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And we also projected the contents of the time capsule

220
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.

221
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor

222
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:34,000
at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing

223
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because the first night I looked at all this information

224
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --

225
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.

226
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,

227
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and saw these images go across the rocks,

228
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events

229
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
depicted again and again and again.

230
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:57,000
You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,

231
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.

232
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken

233
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,

234
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:1,000
where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.

235
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And there was something very moving

236
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.

237
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,

238
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and how humans have always used the night sky

239
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to project their great stories.

240
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,

241
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I would often look up into the dark sky

242
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.

243
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And as an adult, I've been more aware

244
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.

245
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.

246
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.

247
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.

248
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.

249
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And it caused me to wonder about our world today.

250
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And it caused me to wonder specifically,

251
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
if we could make new constellations today,

252
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:54,000
what would those look like? What would those be?

253
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:57,000
If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?

254
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:58,000
What are the great stories of today?

255
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And those are the questions that inspired my new project,

256
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:04,000
which is debuting here today at TED.

257
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.

258
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.

259
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.

260
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.

261
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So, Universe will open here.

262
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,

263
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,

264
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:27,000
kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis

265
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,

266
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and we'll put it down here to red.

267
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along.

268
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.

269
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Each of those stars actually represents

270
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
a specific event in the real world --

271
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
a quote that was stated by somebody, an image,

272
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
a news story, a person, a company. You know,

273
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:52,000
some kind of heroic personality.

274
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And you might notice that as the cursor begins

275
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.

276
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.

277
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And we see here a photograph with a head.

278
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
You can start to see words emerging here.

279
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And those are

280
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the constellations of today.

281
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And I can turn them all on,

282
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and you can see them moving across the sky now.

283
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.

284
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The data from this is global news coverage

285
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
from thousands of news sources around the world.

286
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's using the API of a really great company that I work with

287
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:3,000
in New York, actually, called Daylife.

288
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level

289
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:38,000
of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.

290
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,

291
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words --

292
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form

293
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith

294
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
playing a big role recently.

295
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:56,000
President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.

296
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We can actually click anything in Universe

297
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:,000
and have it become the center of the universe,

298
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and everything else will enter its orbit.

299
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.

300
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit

301
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and swirl around it.

302
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:12,000
We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.

303
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We can click on one of those

304
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and have the photograph be the center of the universe.

305
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.

306
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
We can click on this and we see this iconic image

307
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.

308
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,

309
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and you can just kind of click on stuff.

310
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:38,000
This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.

311
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:42,000
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.

312
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So, if we want to,

313
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.

314
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.

315
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained

316
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:54,000
to all things Bill Clinton.

317
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We can have his constellations emerge here.

318
0:14:58,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We can pull out his secrets,

319
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,

320
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.

321
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We can see the stories

322
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.

323
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Any of those can be opened up.

324
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:14,000
So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.

325
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:16,000
You can see that this is an important story;

326
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,

327
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
we get different perspectives on this story.

328
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
You can click any of those to go out and read the article

329
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.

330
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We can also see the superstars. These would be the people

331
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines

332
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,

333
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --

334
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.

335
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach

336
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.

337
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
We can see he's been focused in America

338
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
because he's been campaigning, probably,

339
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.

340
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And then we can also see a timeline.

341
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:01,000
So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,

342
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but he was back to work on Sunday morning,

343
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and actually been tapering off since then this week.

344
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And it's not limited to just people or dates,

345
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:1,000
but we can actually put in concepts also.

346
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So if I put in climate change for all of 2006,

347
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
we'll see what that universe looks like.

348
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.

349
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Here we have our secrets.

350
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So we see again, climate change is large:

351
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Nairobi, global conference, environmental.

352
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And there are also quotes that you can see,

353
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.

354
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:32,000
You know, this is really an infinite thing.

355
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
The superstars of climate change in 2006:

356
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:38,000
United States, Britain, China. You know,

357
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:41,000
these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.

358
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So this is a piece that demands exploration.

359
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:48,000
This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.

360
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore

361
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
what your own personal mythology might be.

362
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:58,000
You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe --

363
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
it supports both the notion of a global mythology,

364
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,

365
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and also a personal mythology.

366
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:09,000
As you search for the things that are important to you in your world,

367
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and then see what the constellations of those might look like.

368
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much.

369
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
(Applause)

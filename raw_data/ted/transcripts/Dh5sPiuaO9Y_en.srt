0:00:13.44,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In July of 1911,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a 35-year-old Yale graduate and professor set out from his rainforest camp

3
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with his team.

4
0:00:23.08,000 --> 0:00:25,000
After climbing a steep hill

5
0:00:25.24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and wiping the sweat from his brow,

6
0:00:27.68,000 --> 0:00:3,000
he described what he saw beneath him.

7
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He saw rising from the dense rainforest foliage

8
0:00:34.2,000 --> 0:00:37,000
this incredible interlocking maze of structures

9
0:00:37.8,000 --> 0:00:38,000
built of granite,

10
0:00:39.12,000 --> 0:00:41,000
beautifully put together.

11
0:00:41.36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What's amazing about this project

12
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:45,000
is that it was the first funded by National Geographic,

13
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it graced the front cover of its magazine in 1912.

14
0:00:50.64,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This professor used state-of-the-art photography equipment

15
0:00:54.8,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to record the site,

16
0:00:56.48,000 --> 0:00:59,000
forever changing the face of exploration.

17
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The site was Machu Picchu,

18
0:01:02.96,000 --> 0:01:05,000
discovered and explored by Hiram Bingham.

19
0:01:07.32,000 --> 0:01:08,000
When he saw the site, he asked,

20
0:01:09.28,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"This is an impossible dream.

21
0:01:11.84,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What could it be?"

22
0:01:14.36,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So today,

23
0:01:16.72,000 --> 0:01:18,000
100 years later,

24
0:01:19.28,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I invite you all on an incredible journey with me,

25
0:01:23.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a 37-year-old Yale graduate and professor.

26
0:01:26.44,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Cheers)

27
0:01:28.6,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We will do nothing less than use state-of-the-art technology

28
0:01:32.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to map an entire country.

29
0:01:35.76,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is a dream started by Hiram Bingham,

30
0:01:38.72,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but we are expanding it to the world,

31
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
making archaeological exploration more open, inclusive,

32
0:01:47.32,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and at a scale simply not previously possible.

33
0:01:51.2,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is why I am so excited

34
0:01:54.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to share with you all today

35
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that we will begin the 2016 TED Prize platform

36
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in Latin America,

37
0:02:03.64,000 --> 0:02:05,000
more specifically Peru.

38
0:02:07.04,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Applause)

39
0:02:08.28,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Thank you.

40
0:02:13.88,000 --> 0:02:16,000
We will be taking Hiram Bingham's impossible dream

41
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and turning it into an amazing future

42
0:02:20.759,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that we can all share in together.

43
0:02:23.64,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So Peru doesn't just have Machu Picchu.

44
0:02:25.56,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It has absolutely stunning jewelry,

45
0:02:28.56,000 --> 0:02:29,000
like what you can see here.

46
0:02:30.4,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It has amazing Moche pottery of human figures.

47
0:02:34.44,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It has the Nazca Lines

48
0:02:36.28,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and amazing textiles.

49
0:02:38.8,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So as part of the TED Prize platform,

50
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we are going to partnering with some incredible organizations,

51
0:02:44.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
first of all with DigitalGlobe, the world's largest provider

52
0:02:48.24,000 --> 0:02:51,000
of high-resolution commercial satellite imagery.

53
0:02:51.36,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They're going to be helping us build out

54
0:02:53.88,000 --> 0:02:55,000
this amazing crowdsourcing platform they have.

55
0:02:56.08,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Maybe some of you used it

56
0:02:57.4,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with the MH370 crash and search for the airplane.

57
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Of course, they'll also be providing us with the satellite imagery.

58
0:03:04.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
National Geographic will be helping us with education and of course exploration.

59
0:03:08.72,000 --> 0:03:11,000
As well, they'll be providing us with rich content for the platform,

60
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
including some of the archival imagery like you saw at the beginning of this talk

61
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and some of their documentary footage.

62
0:03:19.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We've already begun to build and plan the platform,

63
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I'm just so excited.

64
0:03:24.44,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So here's the cool part.

65
0:03:25.92,000 --> 0:03:27,000
My team, headed up by Chase Childs,

66
0:03:28.52,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is already beginning to look at some of the satellite imagery.

67
0:03:31.96,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Of course, what you can see here is 0.3-meter data.

68
0:03:35.2,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This is site called Chan Chan in northern Peru.

69
0:03:37.44,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It dates to 850 AD.

70
0:03:39.44,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's a really amazing city, but let's zoom in.

71
0:03:41.84,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This is the type and quality of data that you all will get to see.

72
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:49,000
You can see individual structures, individual buildings.

73
0:03:49.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And we've already begun to find previously unknown sites.

74
0:03:52.68,000 --> 0:03:54,000
What we can say already is that as part of the platform,

75
0:03:55.36,000 --> 0:03:58,000
you will all help discover thousands of previously unknown sites,

76
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:,000
like this one here,

77
0:04:00.52,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and this potentially large one here.

78
0:04:02.84,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Unfortunately, we've also begun to uncover large-scale looting at sites,

79
0:04:07.32,000 --> 0:04:08,000
like what you see here.

80
0:04:08.6,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So many sites in Peru are threatened,

81
0:04:10.64,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but the great part is that all of this data

82
0:04:12.72,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is going to be shared with archaeologists on the front lines

83
0:04:15.76,000 --> 0:04:16,000
of protecting these sites.

84
0:04:18.28,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So I was just in Peru, meeting with their Minister of Culture

85
0:04:21.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
as well as UNESCO.

86
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We'll be collaborating closely with them.

87
0:04:25.2,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Just so you all know,

88
0:04:26.48,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the site is going to be in both English and Spanish,

89
0:04:29.24,000 --> 0:04:31,000
which is absolutely essential to make sure

90
0:04:31.279,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that people in Peru and across Latin America can participate.

91
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Our main project coprincipal investigator is the gentleman you see here,

92
0:04:39.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Dr. Luis Jaime Castillo,

93
0:04:41.4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
professor at Catholic University.

94
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:47,000
As a respected Peruvian archaeologist and former vice-minister,

95
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Dr. Castillo will be helping us coordinate and share the data with archaeologists

96
0:04:51.92,000 --> 0:04:53,000
so they can explore these sites on the ground.

97
0:04:54.28,000 --> 0:04:57,000
He also runs this amazing drone mapping program,

98
0:04:57.68,000 --> 0:05:,000
some of the images of which you can see behind me here and here.

99
0:05:00.76,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And this data will be incorporated into the platform,

100
0:05:03.6,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and also he'll be helping to image some of the new sites you help find.

101
0:05:08.24,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Our on-the-ground partner

102
0:05:10.4,000 --> 0:05:13,000
who will be helping us with education, outreach,

103
0:05:13.6,000 --> 0:05:14,000
as well as site preservation components,

104
0:05:15.529,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is the Sustainable Preservation Initiative,

105
0:05:17.553,000 --> 0:05:18,000
led by Dr. Larry Coben.

106
0:05:19.32,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Some of you may not be aware

107
0:05:20.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that some of the world's poorest communities

108
0:05:22.84,000 --> 0:05:25,000
coexist with some of the world's most well-known archaeological sites.

109
0:05:26.68,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What SPI does

110
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is it helps to empower these communities,

111
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in particular women,

112
0:05:31.96,000 --> 0:05:34,000
with new economic approaches and business training.

113
0:05:35.08,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So it helps to teach them to create beautiful handicrafts

114
0:05:38.52,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which are then sold on to tourists.

115
0:05:40.52,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This empowers the women to treasure their cultural heritage

116
0:05:44.72,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and take ownership of it.

117
0:05:46.4,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I had the opportunity to spend some time with 24 of these women

118
0:05:50.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
at a well-known archaeological site called Pachacamac, just outside Lima.

119
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
These women were unbelievably inspiring,

120
0:05:57.44,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and what's great is that SPI will help us transform communities

121
0:06:01.6,000 --> 0:06:03,000
near some of the sites that you help to discover.

122
0:06:04.8,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Peru is just the beginning.

123
0:06:06.96,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We're going to be expanding this platform to the world,

124
0:06:09.6,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but already I've gotten thousands of emails

125
0:06:11.84,000 --> 0:06:14,000
from people all across the world -- professors, educators, students,

126
0:06:15.52,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and other archaeologists -- who are so excited to help participate.

127
0:06:19.08,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In fact, they're already suggesting amazing places for us to help discover,

128
0:06:23.72,000 --> 0:06:24,000
including Atlantis.

129
0:06:25.6,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I don't know if we're going to be looking for Atlantis,

130
0:06:28.24,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but you never know.

131
0:06:29.48,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So I'm just so excited to launch this platform.

132
0:06:32.6,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's going to be launched formally by the end of the year.

133
0:06:35.4,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I have to say,

134
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:41,000
if what my team has already discovered in the past few weeks are any indication,

135
0:06:42.64,000 --> 0:06:46,000
what the world discovers is just going to be beyond imagination.

136
0:06:47.08,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Make sure to hold on to your alpacas.

137
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Thank you very much.

138
0:06:51.52,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Applause)

139
0:06:53.36,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Thank you.

140
0:06:54.6,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

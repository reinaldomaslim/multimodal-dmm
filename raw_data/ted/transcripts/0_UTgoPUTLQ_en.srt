1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm very fortunate to be here.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I feel so fortunate.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I've been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I called my wife Leslie,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I said, "You know, there's so many good people

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
trying to do so much good.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It feels like I've landed in a colony of angels."

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's a true feeling.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm a public school teacher,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and I just want to share a story of my superintendent.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Her name is Pam Moran

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in Albemarle County, Virginia,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And she's a very high-tech superintendent.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
She uses smart boards, she blogs,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
she Tweets, she does Facebook,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
she does all this sort of high-tech stuff.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
She's a technology leader and instructional leader.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But in her office,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
there's this old wooden, weather-worn table, kitchen table --

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
peeling green paint, it's kind of rickety.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I said, "Pam, you're such a modern, cutting-edge person.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Why is this old table in your office?"

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And she told me, she said,

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"You know, I grew up in Southwestern Virginia,

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia,

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and this table was in my grandfather's kitchen.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And we'd come in from playing, he'd come in from plowing and working,

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we'd sit around that table every night.

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And as I grew up, I heard so much knowledge

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and so many insights and so much wisdom

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
come out around this table,

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I began to call it the wisdom table.

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And when he passed on, I took this table with me and brought it to my office,

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and it reminds me of him.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes."

38
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The project I'm going to tell you about

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is called the World Peace Game,

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and essentially it is also an empty space.

41
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I'd like to think of it

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as a 21st century wisdom table, really.

43
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It all started back in 1977.

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I was a young man,

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I had been dropping in and out of college.

46
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And my parents were very patient,

47
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India

48
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
on a mystical quest.

49
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I remember the last time I came back from India --

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in my long white flowing robes

51
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses --

52
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and I said to my father,

53
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
"Dad, I think I've just about found spiritual enlightenment."

54
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He said, "Well there's one more thing you need to find."

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I said, "What is that, dad?" "A job."

56
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something.

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So I got a degree

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and it turned out to be education.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It was an experimental education program.

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It could have been dentistry, but the word "experimental" was in it,

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and so that's what I had to go for.

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And I went in for a job interview

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia, the capital city,

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention --

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
kept my long beard and my afro

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the '70s --

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and I walked in, and I sat down and had an interview.

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And I guess they were hard up for teachers

70
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because the supervisor, her name was Anna Aro,

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
said I had the job teaching gifted children.

72
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I was so shocked, so stunned,

73
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I got up and said, "Well, thank you, but what do I do?"

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Gifted education hadn't really taken hold too much.

76
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There weren't really many materials or things to use.

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I said, "What do I do?"

78
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And her answer shocked me. It stunned me.

79
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Her answer set the template

80
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
for the entire career I was to have after that.

81
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
She said, "What do you want to do?"

82
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And that question cleared the space.

83
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
There was no program directive, no manual to follow,

84
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
no standards in gifted education

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in that way.

86
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And she cleared such a space

87
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that I endeavored from then on

88
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to clear a space for my students, an empty space,

89
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
whereby they could create and make meaning

90
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
out of their own understanding.

91
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So this happened in 1978,

92
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and I was teaching many years later,

93
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker.

94
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
His name is Chris Farina.

95
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost.

96
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Chris, could you stand up and let them see you --

97
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
a young, visionary filmmaker who's made a film.

98
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Applause)

99
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This film is called "World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements."

100
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
He proposed the film to me -- it's a great title.

101
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
He proposed the film to me,

102
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and I said, "Yeah, maybe it'll be on local TV,

103
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and we can say hi to our friends."

104
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But the film has really gone places.

105
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Now it's still in debt, but Chris has managed, through his own sacrifice,

106
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to get this film out.

107
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So we made a film

108
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it turns out to be more than a story about me,

109
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
more than a story about one teacher.

110
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It's a story that's a testament to teaching and teachers.

111
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And it's a beautiful thing.

112
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And the strange thing is, when I watch the film --

113
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I have the eerie sensation of seeing it --

114
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I saw myself literally disappear.

115
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What I saw

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
was my teachers coming through me.

117
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I saw my geometry teacher in high school, Mr. Rucell's

118
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
wry smile under his handlebar mustache.

119
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
That's the smile I use -- that's his smile.

120
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I saw Jan Polo's flashing eyes.

121
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And they weren't flashing in anger,

122
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
they were flashing in love, intense love for her students.

123
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And I have that kind of flash sometimes.

124
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks

125
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day.

126
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And you know, she had that old-school teacher stare.

127
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
You know the one.

128
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"And I'm not even talking about you behind me,

130
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because I've got eyes in the back of my head."

131
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You know that teacher?

133
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I didn't use that stare very often,

134
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but I do have it in my repertoire.

135
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me.

136
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And then I saw

137
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
my own parents, my first teachers.

138
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
My father, very inventive, spatial thinker.

139
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That's my brother Malcolm there on the right.

140
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And my mother,

141
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
who taught me in fourth grade

142
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in segregated schools in Virginia,

143
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
who was my inspiration.

144
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And really, I feel as though,

145
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
when I see the film --

146
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I have a gesture she does, like this --

147
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture.

148
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I am one of her teaching gestures.

149
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And the beautiful thing was,

150
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I got to teach my daughter in elementary school, Madeline.

151
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And so that gesture of my mother's

152
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
continues through many generations.

153
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's an amazing feeling

154
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to have that lineage.

155
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And so I'm here standing on the shoulders of many people.

156
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I'm not here alone.

157
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
There are many people on this stage right now.

158
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And so this World Peace Game I'd like to tell you about.

159
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It started out like this:

160
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
it's just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board

161
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in an inner-city urban school, 1978.

162
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa.

163
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We put all the problems of the world there,

164
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and I thought, let's let them solve it.

165
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I didn't want to lecture or have just book reading.

166
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I wanted to have them be immersed

167
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies.

168
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So I thought, well they like to play games.

169
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I'll make something -- I didn't say interactive;

170
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we didn't have that term in 1978 --

171
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
but something interactive.

172
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And so we made the game,

173
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and it has since evolved

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot

175
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Plexiglass structure.

176
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And it has four Plexiglass layers.

177
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There's an outer space layer

178
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
with black holes and satellites

179
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and research satellites and asteroid mining.

180
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
There's an air and space level

181
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around

182
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and territorial air spaces and air forces,

183
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it --

184
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
even an undersea level

185
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
with submarines and undersea mining.

186
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
There are four countries around the board.

187
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich; some are poor.

188
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They have different assets, commercial and military.

189
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And each country has a cabinet.

190
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There's a Prime Minister, Secretary of State, Minister of Defense

191
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and a CFO, or Comptroller.

192
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them.

193
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I offer them the job, they can turn it down,

194
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and then they choose their own cabinet.

195
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
There's a World Bank, arms dealers and a United Nations.

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
There's also a weather goddess

197
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
who controls a random stock market and random weather.

198
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

199
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That's not all.

200
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And then there's a 13-page crisis document

201
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
with 50 interlocking problems.

202
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So that, if one thing changes, everything else changes.

203
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I throw them into this complex matrix,

204
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and they trust me because we have a deep, rich relationship together.

205
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And so with all these crises,

206
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we have -- let's see -- ethnic and minority tensions;

207
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we have chemical and nuclear spills,

208
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
nuclear proliferation.

209
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
There's oil spills, environmental disasters,

210
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
water rights disputes, breakaway republics,

211
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
famine, endangered species and global warming.

212
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
If Al Gore is here,

213
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I'm going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you

214
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
because they solved global warming in a week.

215
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Applause)

217
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And they've done it several times too.

218
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Laughter)

219
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So I also have in the game a saboteur --

220
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
some child -- it's basically a troublemaker --

221
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and I have my troublemaker put to use

222
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
because they, on the surface,

223
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
are trying to save the world and their position in the game.

224
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But they're also trying to undermine everything in the game.

225
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And they do it secretly through misinformation

226
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and ambiguities and irrelevancies,

227
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
trying to cause everyone to think more deeply.

228
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The saboteur is there,

229
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and we also read from Sun Tzu's "The Art of War."

230
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old --

231
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and they handle that and use that

232
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to understand how to, not follow --

233
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
at first they do --

234
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the paths to power and destruction,

235
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the path to war.

236
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions

237
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and impulsive thinking,

238
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to think in a long-term, more consequential way.

239
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Stewart Brand is here, and one of the ideas for this game came from him

240
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
with a CoEvolution Quarterly article

241
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
on a peace force.

242
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And in the game, sometimes students actually form a peace force.

243
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I'm just a clock watcher.

244
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I'm just a clarifier. I'm just a facilitator.

245
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The students run the game.

246
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever

247
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
once they start playing.

248
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So I'll just share with you ...

249
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Video) Boy: The World Peace Game is serious.

250
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
You're actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world.

251
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
See, Mr. Hunter is doing that

252
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
because he says his time has messed up a lot,

253
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and he's trying to tell us

254
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
how to fix that problem.

255
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
John Hunter: I offered them a --

256
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

257
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Actually, I can't tell them anything because I don't know the answer.

258
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And I admit the truth to them right up front: I don't know.

259
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And because I don't know, they've got to dig up the answer.

260
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And so I apologize to them as well.

261
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
I say, "I'm so sorry, boys and girls,

262
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but the truth is

263
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape,

264
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and we hope you can fix it for us,

265
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it."

266
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
It's a sincere apology,

267
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and they take it very seriously.

268
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like.

269
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Well when we have the game start, here's what you see.

270
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Video) JH: All right, we're going into negotiations as of now. Go.

271
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
(Chatter)

272
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
JH: My question to you is, who's in charge of that classroom?

273
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's a serious question: who is really in charge?

274
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I've learned to cede control of the classroom

275
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
over to the students over time.

276
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
There's a trust and an understanding

277
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and a dedication to an ideal

278
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that I simply don't have to do

279
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher:

280
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
control every conversation and response in the classroom.

281
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's impossible. Their collective wisdom

282
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is much greater than mine,

283
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and I admit it to them openly.

284
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So I'll just share with you some stories very quickly

285
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
of some magical things that have happened.

286
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
In this game we had a little girl,

287
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation.

288
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth.

289
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And she was next door to a very wealthy, oil-rich neighbor.

290
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Without provocation,

291
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
suddenly she attacked, against her Prime Minister's orders,

292
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the next-door neighbor's oil fields.

293
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
She marched into the oil field reserves,

294
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
surrounded it, without firing a shot,

295
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and secured it and held it.

296
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations

297
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because their fuel supply was locked up.

298
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We were all upset with her, "Why are you doing this?

299
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is the World Peace Game. What is wrong with you?"

300
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Laughter)

301
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This was a little girl and, at nine years old,

302
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
she held her pieces and said, "I know what I'm doing."

303
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
To her girlfriends she said that.

304
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That's a breach there.

305
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And we learned in this, you don't really ever want to cross

306
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
a nine year-old girl with tanks.

307
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Laughter)

308
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
They are the toughest opponents.

309
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And we were very upset.

310
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I thought I was failing as a teacher. Why would she do this?

311
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
But come to find out, a few game days later --

312
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team --

313
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
actually there's a negotiation period with all teams,

314
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and each team takes a turn,

315
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
then we go back in negotiation, around and around,

316
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
so each turn around is one game day.

317
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So a few game days later it came to light

318
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that we found out this major country

319
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
was planning a military offensive

320
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to dominate the entire world.

321
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Had they had their fuel supplies, they would have done it.

322
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions

323
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
long before any of us

324
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and understand what was going to happen

325
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and made a philosophical decision

326
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to attack in a peace game.

327
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war,

328
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion

329
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
about whether that was right,

330
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
conditional good, or not right.

331
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
That's the kind of thinking that we put them in, the situations.

332
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I could not have designed that in teaching it.

333
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom.

334
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
(Applause)

335
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Another example, a beautiful thing happened.

336
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
We have a letter in the game.

337
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If you're a military commander and you wage troops --

338
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them,

339
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I put in a letter.

340
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You have to write a letter to their parents --

341
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
the fictional parents of your fictional troops --

342
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
explaining what happened and offering your condolences.

343
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
So you have a little bit more thought

344
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
before you commit to combat.

345
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And so we had this situation come up --

346
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
last summer actually,

347
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County --

348
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter

349
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and one of the other kids said, "Mr. Hunter,

350
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
let's ask -- there's a parent over there."

351
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
There was a parent visiting that day, just sitting in the back of the room.

352
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
"Let's ask that mom to read the letter.

353
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It'll be more realer if she reads it."

354
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So we did, we asked her, and she gamely picked up the letter.

355
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
"Sure." She started reading. She read one sentence.

356
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
She read two sentences.

357
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
By the third sentence, she was in tears.

358
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I was in tears.

359
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Everybody understood

360
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that when we lose somebody, the winners are not gloating.

361
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We all lose.

362
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding.

363
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
I'll show you what my friend David says about this.

364
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
He's been in many battles.

365
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Video) David: We've really had enough of people attacking.

366
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I mean, we've been lucky [most of] the time.

367
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
But now I'm feeling really weird

368
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
because I'm living what Sun Tzu said one week.

369
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
One week he said,

370
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
"Those who go into battle and win

371
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
will want to go back,

372
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and those who lose in battle

373
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
will want to go back and win."

374
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And so I've been winning battles,

375
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
so I'm going into battles, more battles.

376
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And I think it's sort of weird to be living

377
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
what Sun Tzu said.

378
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
JH: I get chills every time I see that.

379
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
That's the kind of engagement you want to have happen.

380
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And I can't design that, I can't plan that,

381
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and I can't even test that.

382
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But it's self-evident assessment.

383
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
We know that's an authentic assessment of learning.

384
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We have a lot of data, but I think sometimes we go beyond data

385
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
with the real truth of what's going on.

386
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So I'll just share a third story.

387
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
This is about my friend Brennan.

388
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
We had played the game one session after school

389
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
for many weeks, about seven weeks,

390
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises.

391
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved

392
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and every country's asset value

393
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
has to be increased above its starting point.

394
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
Some are poor, some are wealthy. There are billions.

395
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time.

396
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
He says, "How many zeros in a trillion? I've got to calculate that right away."

397
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game

398
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
for high school players who were playing with him.

399
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
So the team that was the poorest

400
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
had gotten even poorer.

401
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
There was no way they could win.

402
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And we were approaching four o'clock, our cut-off time --

403
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
there was about a minute left --

404
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and despair just settled over the room.

405
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I thought, I'm failing as a teacher.

406
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
I should have gotten it so they could have won.

407
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
They shouldn't be failing like this.

408
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I've failed them.

409
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected.

410
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And suddenly, Brennan walked over to my chair

411
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and he grabbed the bell, the bell I ring

412
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets,

413
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and he ran back to his seat, rang the bell.

414
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Everybody ran to his chair: there was screaming;

415
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
there was yelling, waving of their dossiers.

416
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
They get these dossiers full of secret documents.

417
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
They were gesticulating; they were running around.

418
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
I didn't know what they were doing. I'd lost control of my classroom.

419
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Principal walks in, I'm out of a job.

420
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
The parents were looking in the window.

421
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And Brennan runs back to his seat. Everybody runs back to their seat.

422
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
He rings the bell again. He says, "We have" --

423
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and there's 12 seconds left on the clock --

424
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
"we have, all nations, pooled all our funds together.

425
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
And we've got 600 billion dollars.

426
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
We're going to offer it as a donation to this poor country.

427
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
And if they accept it, it'll raise their asset value and we can win the game.

428
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Will you accept it?"

429
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
And there are three seconds left on the clock.

430
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country,

431
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and he says, "Yes."

432
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And the game is won.

433
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Spontaneous compassion

434
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
that could not be planned for,

435
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
that was unexpected and unpredictable.

436
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
Every game we play is different.

437
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Some games are more about social issues,

438
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
some are more about economic issues.

439
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Some games are more about warfare.

440
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
But I don't try to deny them that reality of being human.

441
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I allow them to go there

442
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and, through their own experience, learn, in a bloodless way,

443
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing.

444
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And they find out what is right

445
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
their own way, their own selves.

446
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And so in this game,

447
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
I've learned so much from it,

448
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
but I would say

449
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
that if only

450
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
they could pick up a critical thinking tool

451
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
or creative thinking tool

452
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
from this game

453
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and leverage something good for the world,

454
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
they may save us all.

455
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
If only.

456
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
And on behalf of all of my teachers

457
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
on whose shoulders I'm standing,

458
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

459
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
(Applause)

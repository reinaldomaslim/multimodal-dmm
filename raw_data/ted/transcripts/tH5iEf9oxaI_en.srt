1
0:00:12.834,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So my moment of truth

2
0:00:14.872,000 --> 0:00:17,000
did not come all at once.

3
0:00:17.936,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In 2010, I had the chance to be considered

4
0:00:21.562,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for promotion from my job

5
0:00:23.889,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as director of policy planning

6
0:00:25.961,000 --> 0:00:27,000
at the U.S. State Department.

7
0:00:28.718,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This was my moment to lean in,

8
0:00:32.449,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to push myself forward

9
0:00:35.334,000 --> 0:00:37,000
for what are really only a handful

10
0:00:38.028,000 --> 0:00:41,000
of the very top foreign policy jobs,

11
0:00:41.045,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I had just finished a big, 18-month project

12
0:00:44.125,000 --> 0:00:46,000
for Secretary Clinton, successfully,

13
0:00:46.698,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and I knew I could handle a bigger job.

14
0:00:50.929,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The woman I thought I was

15
0:00:54.759,000 --> 0:00:56,000
would have said yes.

16
0:00:56.93,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I had been commuting for two years

17
0:00:58.957,000 --> 0:01:01,000
between Washington and Princeton, New Jersey,

18
0:01:02.1,000 --> 0:01:05,000
where my husband and my two teenage sons lived,

19
0:01:06.027,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and it was not going well.

20
0:01:09.293,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I tried on the idea of eking out another two years

21
0:01:12.998,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in Washington, or maybe uprooting my sons

22
0:01:15.794,000 --> 0:01:17,000
from their school and my husband from his work

23
0:01:17.929,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and asking them to join me.

24
0:01:20.51,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But deep down, I knew

25
0:01:23.549,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that the right decision was to go home,

26
0:01:27.08,000 --> 0:01:29,000
even if I didn't fully recognize the woman

27
0:01:29.996,000 --> 0:01:32,000
who was making that choice.

28
0:01:33.988,000 --> 0:01:36,000
That was a decision based on love

29
0:01:37.495,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and responsibility.

30
0:01:39.439,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I couldn't keep watching my oldest son

31
0:01:42.338,000 --> 0:01:43,000
make bad choices

32
0:01:43.763,000 --> 0:01:45,000
without being able to be there for him

33
0:01:46.458,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when and if he needed me.

34
0:01:50.241,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But the real change came more gradually.

35
0:01:53.755,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Over the next year,

36
0:01:55.514,000 --> 0:01:57,000
while my family was righting itself,

37
0:01:58.389,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I started to realize

38
0:02:00.053,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that even if I could go back into government,

39
0:02:02.992,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I didn't want to.

40
0:02:04.772,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I didn't want to miss the last five years

41
0:02:08.719,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that my sons were at home.

42
0:02:11.551,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I finally allowed myself to accept

43
0:02:15.437,000 --> 0:02:18,000
what was really most important to me,

44
0:02:18.443,000 --> 0:02:21,000
not what I was conditioned to want

45
0:02:21.852,000 --> 0:02:25,000
or maybe what I conditioned myself to want,

46
0:02:26.55,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and that decision led to a reassessment

47
0:02:31.611,000 --> 0:02:34,000
of the feminist narrative that I grew up with

48
0:02:34.634,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and have always championed.

49
0:02:38.29,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I am still completely committed

50
0:02:42.142,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to the cause of male-female equality,

51
0:02:47.327,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but let's think about what that equality really means,

52
0:02:52.273,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and how best to achieve it.

53
0:02:55.2,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I always accepted the idea

54
0:02:58.323,000 --> 0:03:,000
that the most respected and powerful people

55
0:03:01.248,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in our society are men at the top of their careers,

56
0:03:05.753,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so that the measure of male-female equality

57
0:03:09.928,000 --> 0:03:13,000
ought to be how many women are in those positions:

58
0:03:14.147,000 --> 0:03:16,000
prime ministers, presidents, CEOs,

59
0:03:17.066,000 --> 0:03:22,000
directors, managers, Nobel laureates, leaders.

60
0:03:22.169,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I still think we should do everything we possibly can

61
0:03:26.446,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to achieve that goal.

62
0:03:28.526,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But that's only half of real equality,

63
0:03:33.651,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and I now think we're never going to get there

64
0:03:36.999,000 --> 0:03:41,000
unless we recognize the other half.

65
0:03:42.281,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I suggest that real equality,

66
0:03:46.592,000 --> 0:03:48,000
full equality,

67
0:03:48.863,000 --> 0:03:51,000
does not just mean valuing women

68
0:03:52.078,000 --> 0:03:54,000
on male terms.

69
0:03:54.245,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It means creating a much wider range

70
0:03:58.863,000 --> 0:04:02,000
of equally respected choices

71
0:04:02.875,000 --> 0:04:05,000
for women and for men.

72
0:04:05.926,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And to get there, we have to change our workplaces,

73
0:04:09.395,000 --> 0:04:11,000
our policies and our culture.

74
0:04:12.309,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In the workplace,

75
0:04:14.374,000 --> 0:04:17,000
real equality means valuing family

76
0:04:17.677,000 --> 0:04:18,000
just as much as work,

77
0:04:19.3,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and understanding that the two reinforce each other.

78
0:04:23.863,000 --> 0:04:24,000
As a leader and as a manager,

79
0:04:25.766,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I have always acted on the mantra,

80
0:04:28.811,000 --> 0:04:3,000
if family comes first,

81
0:04:31.091,000 --> 0:04:33,000
work does not come second --

82
0:04:33.938,000 --> 0:04:35,000
life comes together.

83
0:04:36.242,000 --> 0:04:4,000
If you work for me, and you have a family issue,

84
0:04:40.407,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I expect you to attend to it,

85
0:04:42.841,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I am confident,

86
0:04:44.486,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and my confidence has always been borne out,

87
0:04:47.183,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that the work will get done, and done better.

88
0:04:51.174,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Workers who have a reason to get home

89
0:04:53.575,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to care for their children or their family members

90
0:04:56.954,000 --> 0:04:58,000
are more focused, more efficient,

91
0:04:59.461,000 --> 0:05:01,000
more results-focused.

92
0:05:01.484,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And breadwinners who are also caregivers

93
0:05:04.613,000 --> 0:05:06,000
have a much wider range

94
0:05:07.22,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of experiences and contacts.

95
0:05:09.746,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Think about a lawyer who spends part of his time

96
0:05:12.978,000 --> 0:05:14,000
at school events for his kids

97
0:05:15.579,000 --> 0:05:16,000
talking to other parents.

98
0:05:17.405,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He's much more likely to bring in

99
0:05:19.463,000 --> 0:05:2,000
new clients for his firm

100
0:05:21.403,000 --> 0:05:24,000
than a lawyer who never leaves his office.

101
0:05:24.664,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And caregiving itself

102
0:05:26.553,000 --> 0:05:29,000
develops patience --

103
0:05:30.335,000 --> 0:05:32,000
a lot of patience --

104
0:05:32.798,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and empathy, creativity, resilience, adaptability.

105
0:05:38.418,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Those are all attributes that are ever more important

106
0:05:42.216,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in a high-speed, horizontal,

107
0:05:44.309,000 --> 0:05:48,000
networked global economy.

108
0:05:48.758,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The best companies actually know this.

109
0:05:51.946,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The companies that win awards

110
0:05:53.673,000 --> 0:05:56,000
for workplace flexibility in the United States

111
0:05:56.925,000 --> 0:05:59,000
include some of our most successful corporations,

112
0:06:00.151,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and a 2008 national study

113
0:06:02.422,000 --> 0:06:04,000
on the changing workforce

114
0:06:04.475,000 --> 0:06:05,000
showed that employees

115
0:06:06.089,000 --> 0:06:09,000
in flexible and effective workplaces

116
0:06:09.591,000 --> 0:06:1,000
are more engaged with their work,

117
0:06:11.304,000 --> 0:06:13,000
they're more satisfied and more loyal,

118
0:06:13.794,000 --> 0:06:14,000
they have lower levels of stress

119
0:06:15.627,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and higher levels of mental health.

120
0:06:18.026,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And a 2012 study of employers

121
0:06:21.736,000 --> 0:06:23,000
showed that deep, flexible practices

122
0:06:24.589,000 --> 0:06:26,000
actually lowered operating costs

123
0:06:26.979,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and increased adaptability

124
0:06:29.444,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in a global service economy.

125
0:06:32.531,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So you may think

126
0:06:35.648,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that the privileging of work over family

127
0:06:39.865,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is only an American problem.

128
0:06:43.812,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Sadly, though, the obsession with work

129
0:06:47.35,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is no longer a uniquely American disease.

130
0:06:50.51,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Twenty years ago,

131
0:06:52.282,000 --> 0:06:53,000
when my family first started going to Italy,

132
0:06:54.278,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we used to luxuriate in the culture of siesta.

133
0:06:57.881,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Siesta is not just about avoiding the heat of the day.

134
0:07:00.764,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's actually just as much

135
0:07:02.63,000 --> 0:07:05,000
about embracing the warmth of a family lunch.

136
0:07:05.742,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Now, when we go, fewer and fewer businesses

137
0:07:08.945,000 --> 0:07:09,000
close for siesta,

138
0:07:10.658,000 --> 0:07:13,000
reflecting the advance of global corporations

139
0:07:14.196,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and 24-hour competition.

140
0:07:17.033,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So making a place for those we love

141
0:07:19.902,000 --> 0:07:22,000
is actually a global imperative.

142
0:07:23.647,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In policy terms,

143
0:07:26.377,000 --> 0:07:29,000
real equality means recognizing

144
0:07:29.813,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that the work that women have traditionally done

145
0:07:32.771,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is just as important

146
0:07:34.648,000 --> 0:07:36,000
as the work that men have traditionally done,

147
0:07:37.311,000 --> 0:07:4,000
no matter who does it.

148
0:07:40.363,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Think about it: Breadwinning and caregiving

149
0:07:44.108,000 --> 0:07:47,000
are equally necessary for human survival.

150
0:07:47.633,000 --> 0:07:5,000
At least if we get beyond a barter economy,

151
0:07:51.117,000 --> 0:07:53,000
somebody has to earn an income

152
0:07:53.354,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and someone else has to convert that income

153
0:07:56.308,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to care and sustenance for loved ones.

154
0:08:00.092,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now most of you, when you hear me

155
0:08:02.23,000 --> 0:08:04,000
talk about breadwinning and caregiving,

156
0:08:04.955,000 --> 0:08:07,000
instinctively translate those categories

157
0:08:08.396,000 --> 0:08:11,000
into men's work and women's work.

158
0:08:12.127,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And we don't typically challenge

159
0:08:14.963,000 --> 0:08:17,000
why men's work is advantaged.

160
0:08:18.861,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But consider a same-sex couple

161
0:08:21.451,000 --> 0:08:23,000
like my friends Sarah and Emily.

162
0:08:23.47,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They're psychiatrists.

163
0:08:25.338,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They got married five years ago,

164
0:08:27.167,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and now they have two-year-old twins.

165
0:08:30.448,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They love being mothers,

166
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but they also love their work,

167
0:08:34.088,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and they're really good at what they do.

168
0:08:36.298,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So how are they going to divide up

169
0:08:38.319,000 --> 0:08:4,000
breadwinning and caregiving responsibilities?

170
0:08:40.796,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Should one of them stop working

171
0:08:42.881,000 --> 0:08:44,000
or reduce hours to be home?

172
0:08:45.573,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Or should they both change their practices

173
0:08:48.252,000 --> 0:08:51,000
so they can have much more flexible schedules?

174
0:08:51.535,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And what criteria should they use

175
0:08:53.506,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to make that decision?

176
0:08:54.8,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Is it who makes the most money

177
0:08:56.574,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or who is most committed to her career?

178
0:09:00.351,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Or who has the most flexible boss?

179
0:09:04.912,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The same-sex perspective helps us see

180
0:09:08.237,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that juggling work and family

181
0:09:10.701,000 --> 0:09:12,000
are not women's problems,

182
0:09:12.812,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they're family problems.

183
0:09:15.45,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And Sarah and Emily are the lucky ones,

184
0:09:18.473,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because they have a choice

185
0:09:20.242,000 --> 0:09:22,000
about how much they want to work.

186
0:09:22.779,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Millions of men and women

187
0:09:25.608,000 --> 0:09:28,000
have to be both breadwinners and caregivers

188
0:09:28.945,000 --> 0:09:31,000
just to earn the income they need,

189
0:09:32.485,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and many of those workers are scrambling.

190
0:09:35.033,000 --> 0:09:37,000
They're patching together care arrangements

191
0:09:37.917,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that are inadequate

192
0:09:39.09,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and often actually unsafe.

193
0:09:41.501,000 --> 0:09:45,000
If breadwinning and caregiving are really equal,

194
0:09:46.191,000 --> 0:09:47,000
then why shouldn't a government

195
0:09:47.779,000 --> 0:09:5,000
invest as much in an infrastructure of care

196
0:09:51.595,000 --> 0:09:54,000
as the foundation of a healthy society

197
0:09:55.454,000 --> 0:09:58,000
as it invests in physical infrastructure

198
0:09:58.566,000 --> 0:10:01,000
as the backbone of a successful economy?

199
0:10:02.442,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The governments that get it --

200
0:10:04.778,000 --> 0:10:05,000
no surprises here --

201
0:10:06.625,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the governments that get it,

202
0:10:08.465,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands,

203
0:10:13.17,000 --> 0:10:15,000
provide universal child care,

204
0:10:16.1,000 --> 0:10:18,000
support for caregivers at home,

205
0:10:18.219,000 --> 0:10:21,000
school and early childhood education,

206
0:10:21.386,000 --> 0:10:23,000
protections for pregnant women,

207
0:10:23.596,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and care for the elderly and the disabled.

208
0:10:27.981,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Those governments invest in that infrastructure

209
0:10:31.662,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the same way they invest in roads and bridges

210
0:10:34.991,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and tunnels and trains.

211
0:10:38.126,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Those societies also show you

212
0:10:40.534,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that breadwinning and caregiving

213
0:10:42.824,000 --> 0:10:44,000
reinforce each other.

214
0:10:45.208,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They routinely rank among the top 15 countries

215
0:10:51.047,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of the most globally competitive economies,

216
0:10:54.38,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but at the same time,

217
0:10:56.032,000 --> 0:11:,000
they rank very high on the OECD Better Life Index.

218
0:11:00.723,000 --> 0:11:03,000
In fact, they rank higher than other governments,

219
0:11:04.259,000 --> 0:11:06,000
like my own, the U.S., or Switzerland,

220
0:11:06.928,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that have higher average levels of income

221
0:11:09.857,000 --> 0:11:14,000
but lower rankings on work-life balance.

222
0:11:15.62,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So changing our workplaces

223
0:11:18.296,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and building infrastructures of care

224
0:11:21.592,000 --> 0:11:22,000
would make a big difference,

225
0:11:23.067,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but we're not going to get equally valued choices

226
0:11:27.551,000 --> 0:11:29,000
unless we change our culture,

227
0:11:30.056,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and the kind of cultural change required

228
0:11:33.197,000 --> 0:11:35,000
means re-socializing men.

229
0:11:35.952,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

230
0:11:39.626,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Increasingly in developed countries,

231
0:11:41.361,000 --> 0:11:44,000
women are socialized to believe that our place

232
0:11:44.443,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is no longer only in the home,

233
0:11:48.103,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but men are actually still where they always were.

234
0:11:52.999,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Men are still socialized to believe

235
0:11:56.397,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that they have to be breadwinners,

236
0:11:58.652,000 --> 0:12:,000
that to derive their self-worth

237
0:12:01.527,000 --> 0:12:03,000
from how high they can climb over other men

238
0:12:04.406,000 --> 0:12:06,000
on a career ladder.

239
0:12:06.751,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The feminist revolution still has a long way to go.

240
0:12:09.534,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It's certainly not complete.

241
0:12:11.436,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But 60 years after

242
0:12:13.092,000 --> 0:12:15,000
"The Feminine Mystique" was published,

243
0:12:15.402,000 --> 0:12:17,000
many women actually have

244
0:12:17.703,000 --> 0:12:19,000
more choices than men do.

245
0:12:20.681,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We can decide to be a breadwinner,

246
0:12:23.409,000 --> 0:12:27,000
a caregiver, or any combination of the two.

247
0:12:27.556,000 --> 0:12:29,000
When a man, on the other hand,

248
0:12:30.082,000 --> 0:12:32,000
decides to be a caregiver,

249
0:12:32.971,000 --> 0:12:35,000
he puts his manhood on the line.

250
0:12:36.275,000 --> 0:12:39,000
His friends may praise his decision,

251
0:12:39.495,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but underneath, they're scratching their heads.

252
0:12:43.367,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Isn't the measure of a man

253
0:12:46.468,000 --> 0:12:48,000
his willingness to compete with other men

254
0:12:49.399,000 --> 0:12:51,000
for power and prestige?

255
0:12:51.779,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And as many women hold that view as men do.

256
0:12:55.875,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We know that lots of women

257
0:12:58.841,000 --> 0:13:01,000
still judge the attractiveness of a man

258
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
based in large part on how successful he is

259
0:13:04.885,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in his career.

260
0:13:06.382,000 --> 0:13:08,000
A woman can drop out of the work force

261
0:13:08.733,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and still be an attractive partner.

262
0:13:10.893,000 --> 0:13:14,000
For a man, that's a risky proposition.

263
0:13:15.432,000 --> 0:13:17,000
So as parents and partners,

264
0:13:17.673,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we should be socializing our sons

265
0:13:20.86,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and our husbands

266
0:13:23.311,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to be whatever they want to be,

267
0:13:26.635,000 --> 0:13:29,000
either caregivers or breadwinners.

268
0:13:30.254,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We should be socializing them to make caregiving

269
0:13:33.61,000 --> 0:13:34,000
cool for guys.

270
0:13:35.597,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Applause)

271
0:13:39.362,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I can almost hear lots of you thinking, "No way."

272
0:13:45.674,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But in fact, the change is actually already happening.

273
0:13:50.321,000 --> 0:13:51,000
At least in the United States,

274
0:13:52.278,000 --> 0:13:54,000
lots of men take pride in cooking,

275
0:13:54.502,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and frankly obsess over stoves.

276
0:13:57.818,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They are in the birthing rooms.

277
0:14:00.805,000 --> 0:14:02,000
They take paternity leave when they can.

278
0:14:03.449,000 --> 0:14:05,000
They can walk a baby or soothe a toddler

279
0:14:05.911,000 --> 0:14:07,000
just as well as their wives can,

280
0:14:08.553,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and they are increasingly

281
0:14:10.302,000 --> 0:14:12,000
doing much more of the housework.

282
0:14:12.869,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Indeed, there are male college students now

283
0:14:14.957,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who are starting to say,

284
0:14:16.484,000 --> 0:14:17,000
"I want to be a stay-at-home dad."

285
0:14:18.36,000 --> 0:14:2,000
That was completely unthinkable

286
0:14:20.611,000 --> 0:14:22,000
50 or even 30 years ago.

287
0:14:23.478,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And in Norway, where men have

288
0:14:26.369,000 --> 0:14:28,000
an automatic three month's paternity leave,

289
0:14:29.158,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but they lose it if they decide not to take it,

290
0:14:32.495,000 --> 0:14:33,000
a high government official told me

291
0:14:34.42,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that companies are starting to look

292
0:14:36.652,000 --> 0:14:38,000
at prospective male employees

293
0:14:38.737,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and raise an eyebrow if they didn't in fact

294
0:14:42.715,000 --> 0:14:44,000
take their leave when they had kids.

295
0:14:45.111,000 --> 0:14:47,000
That means that it's starting to seem

296
0:14:47.94,000 --> 0:14:49,000
like a character defect

297
0:14:50.142,000 --> 0:14:54,000
not to want to be a fully engaged father.

298
0:14:57.421,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So I was raised

299
0:15:02.943,000 --> 0:15:05,000
to believe that championing women's rights

300
0:15:06.592,000 --> 0:15:08,000
meant doing everything we could

301
0:15:08.711,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to get women to the top.

302
0:15:10.485,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And I still hope that I live long enough

303
0:15:13.204,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to see men and women equally represented

304
0:15:16.467,000 --> 0:15:19,000
at all levels of the work force.

305
0:15:19.514,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But I've come to believe that we have to value family

306
0:15:23.613,000 --> 0:15:25,000
every bit as much as we value work,

307
0:15:26.445,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and that we should entertain the idea

308
0:15:28.957,000 --> 0:15:31,000
that doing right by those we love

309
0:15:32.506,000 --> 0:15:35,000
will make all of us better at everything we do.

310
0:15:36.422,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Thirty years ago, Carol Gilligan,

311
0:15:38.49,000 --> 0:15:4,000
a wonderful psychologist, studied adolescent girls

312
0:15:41.447,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and identified an ethic of care,

313
0:15:44.504,000 --> 0:15:47,000
an element of human nature every bit as important

314
0:15:47.659,000 --> 0:15:48,000
as the ethic of justice.

315
0:15:49.646,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It turns out that "you don't care"

316
0:15:52.951,000 --> 0:15:54,000
is just as much a part of who we are

317
0:15:55.872,000 --> 0:15:57,000
as "that's not fair."

318
0:15:58.152,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Bill Gates agrees.

319
0:15:59.952,000 --> 0:16:02,000
He argues that the two great forces of human nature

320
0:16:03.123,000 --> 0:16:07,000
are self-interest and caring for others.

321
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Let's bring them both together.

322
0:16:09.972,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Let's make the feminist revolution

323
0:16:12.631,000 --> 0:16:14,000
a humanist revolution.

324
0:16:15.363,000 --> 0:16:16,000
As whole human beings,

325
0:16:17.107,000 --> 0:16:2,000
we will be better caregivers and breadwinners.

326
0:16:20.951,000 --> 0:16:22,000
You may think that can't happen,

327
0:16:23.059,000 --> 0:16:24,000
but I grew up in a society

328
0:16:24.759,000 --> 0:16:26,000
where my mother put out small vases

329
0:16:27.105,000 --> 0:16:29,000
of cigarettes for dinner parties,

330
0:16:29.767,000 --> 0:16:33,000
where blacks and whites used separate bathrooms,

331
0:16:33.96,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and where everybody claimed to be heterosexual.

332
0:16:40.602,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Today, not so much.

333
0:16:45.041,000 --> 0:16:48,000
The revolution for human equality

334
0:16:48.681,000 --> 0:16:49,000
can happen.

335
0:16:50.471,000 --> 0:16:52,000
It is happening.

336
0:16:52.717,000 --> 0:16:54,000
It will happen.

337
0:16:54.999,000 --> 0:16:58,000
How far and how fast is up to us.

338
0:16:59.717,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Thank you.

339
0:17:01.86,000 --> 0:17:05,000

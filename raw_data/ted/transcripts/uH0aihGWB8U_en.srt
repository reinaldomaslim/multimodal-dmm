1
0:00:12.903,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Clicking)

2
0:00:19.804,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was born with bilateral retinoblastoma,

3
0:00:24.42,000 --> 0:00:25,000
retinal cancer.

4
0:00:27.313,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My right eye was removed

5
0:00:30.419,000 --> 0:00:32,000
at seven months of age.

6
0:00:33.336,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I was 13 months when they removed my left eye.

7
0:00:38.003,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The first thing I did upon awakening from that last surgery

8
0:00:43.148,000 --> 0:00:46,000
was to climb out of my crib

9
0:00:46.78,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and begin wandering around the intensive care nursery,

10
0:00:51.829,000 --> 0:00:54,000
probably looking for the one who did this to me.

11
0:00:55.208,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:58.966,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Evidently, wandering around the nursery

13
0:01:02.127,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was not a problem for me without eyes.

14
0:01:05.702,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The problem was getting caught.

15
0:01:09.557,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's impressions about blindness

16
0:01:12.731,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that are far more threatening

17
0:01:16.221,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to blind people than the blindness itself.

18
0:01:21.283,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Think for a moment about your own impressions of blindness.

19
0:01:25.23,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Think about your reactions when I first came onto the stage,

20
0:01:29.296,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or the prospect of your own blindness,

21
0:01:33.347,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or a loved one going blind.

22
0:01:37.264,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The terror is incomprehensible to most of us,

23
0:01:42.704,000 --> 0:01:44,000
because blindness

24
0:01:45.159,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is thought to epitomize ignorance and unawareness,

25
0:01:50.829,000 --> 0:01:57,000
hapless exposure to the ravages of the dark unknown.

26
0:01:58.63,000 --> 0:01:59,000
How poetic.

27
0:02:01.44,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Fortunately for me, my parents were not poetic.

28
0:02:04.801,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They were pragmatic.

29
0:02:06.676,000 --> 0:02:12,000
They understood that ignorance and fear were but matters of the mind,

30
0:02:13.293,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and the mind is adaptable.

31
0:02:17.282,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They believed that I should grow up

32
0:02:20.983,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to enjoy the same freedoms and responsibilities as everyone else.

33
0:02:25.814,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In their own words, I would move out --

34
0:02:28.275,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which I did when I was 18 --

35
0:02:31.062,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I will pay taxes --

36
0:02:33.035,000 --> 0:02:35,000
thanks -- (Laughter) --

37
0:02:37.605,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and they knew the difference between love and fear.

38
0:02:42.786,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Fear immobilizes us in the face of challenge.

39
0:02:47.71,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They knew that blindness would pose a significant challenge.

40
0:02:50.612,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I was not raised with fear.

41
0:02:53.666,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They put my freedom first before all else,

42
0:02:57.415,000 --> 0:03:,000
because that is what love does.

43
0:03:00.535,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, moving forward, how do I manage today?

44
0:03:06.044,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The world is a much larger nursery.

45
0:03:09.419,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Fortunately, I have my trusty long cane,

46
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
longer than the canes used by most blind people.

47
0:03:16.014,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I call it my freedom staff.

48
0:03:19.357,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It will keep me, for example,

49
0:03:20.913,000 --> 0:03:25,000
from making an undignified departure from the stage. (Laughter)

50
0:03:27.279,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I do see that cliff edge.

51
0:03:30.282,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They warned us earlier that every imaginable mishap

52
0:03:33.509,000 --> 0:03:36,000
has occurred to speakers up here on the stage.

53
0:03:37.1,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I don't care to set a new precedent.

54
0:03:40.491,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But beyond that,

55
0:03:42.425,000 --> 0:03:45,000
many of you may have heard me clicking as I came onto the stage --

56
0:03:45.552,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Clicking) --

57
0:03:46.619,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with my tongue.

58
0:03:48.488,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Those are flashes of sound

59
0:03:51.666,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that go out and reflect from surfaces all around me,

60
0:03:56.746,000 --> 0:03:57,000
just like a bat's sonar,

61
0:03:58.118,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and return to me with patterns, with pieces of information,

62
0:04:03.738,000 --> 0:04:05,000
much as light does for you.

63
0:04:07.135,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And my brain, thanks to my parents,

64
0:04:10.793,000 --> 0:04:15,000
has been activated to form images in my visual cortex,

65
0:04:16.098,000 --> 0:04:19,000
which we now call the imaging system,

66
0:04:19.338,000 --> 0:04:22,000
from those patterns of information, much as your brain does.

67
0:04:23.288,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I call this process flash sonar.

68
0:04:26.604,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It is how I have learned to see through my blindness,

69
0:04:32.322,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to navigate my journey

70
0:04:35.498,000 --> 0:04:39,000
through the dark unknowns of my own challenges,

71
0:04:39.538,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which has earned me the moniker

72
0:04:43.439,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"the remarkable Batman."

73
0:04:47.154,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, Batman I will accept.

74
0:04:49.708,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Bats are cool. Batman is cool.

75
0:04:53.098,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But I was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable.

76
0:04:59.856,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I have always regarded myself much like anyone else

77
0:05:03.884,000 --> 0:05:08,000
who navigates the dark unknowns of their own challenges.

78
0:05:09.3,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Is that so remarkable?

79
0:05:12.718,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I do not use my eyes, I use my brain.

80
0:05:16.834,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, someone, somewhere,

81
0:05:19.317,000 --> 0:05:22,000
must think that's remarkable, or I wouldn't be up here,

82
0:05:23.144,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but let's consider this for a moment.

83
0:05:27.013,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Everyone out there

84
0:05:29.739,000 --> 0:05:33,000
who faces or who has ever faced a challenge,

85
0:05:34.428,000 --> 0:05:35,000
raise your hands.

86
0:05:37.47,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Whoosh. Okay.

87
0:05:39.49,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Lots of hands going up, a moment, let me do a head count.

88
0:05:42.462,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Clicking)

89
0:05:45.713,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This will take a while. (Clicking) (Laughter)

90
0:05:48.731,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Okay, lots of hands in the air.

91
0:05:50.205,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Keep them up. I have an idea.

92
0:05:52.609,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Those of you who use your brains to navigate these challenges,

93
0:05:58.302,000 --> 0:06:,000
put your hands down.

94
0:06:02.423,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Okay, anyone with your hands still up

95
0:06:05.024,000 --> 0:06:1,000
has challenges of your own. (Laughter)

96
0:06:10.262,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So we all face challenges,

97
0:06:12.839,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and we all face the dark unknown,

98
0:06:16.577,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which is endemic to most challenges, which is what most of us fear, okay?

99
0:06:20.92,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But we all have brains

100
0:06:24.773,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that allow us, that activate to allow us

101
0:06:29.069,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to navigate the journey through these challenges. Okay?

102
0:06:36.151,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Case in point: I came up here

103
0:06:40.284,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and -- (Clicking) -- they wouldn't tell me

104
0:06:47.254,000 --> 0:06:49,000
where the lectern was.

105
0:06:50.152,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So you can't trust those TED folks.

106
0:06:54.796,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"Find it yourself," they said.

107
0:06:56.653,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So -- (Laughter)

108
0:07:01.413,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And the feedback for the P.A. system is no help at all.

109
0:07:04.525,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So now I present to you a challenge.

110
0:07:07.934,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So if you'd all close your eyes for just a moment, okay?

111
0:07:11.85,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And you're going to learn a bit of flash sonar.

112
0:07:15.507,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I'm going to make a sound.

113
0:07:17.017,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I'm going to hold this panel in front of me, but I'm not going to move it.

114
0:07:20.562,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Just listen to the sound for a moment.

115
0:07:25.236,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Shhhhhhhhhh.

116
0:07:31.228,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Okay, nothing very interesting.

117
0:07:33.293,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, listen to what happens to that same exact sound

118
0:07:36.032,000 --> 0:07:37,000
when I move the panel.

119
0:07:39.146,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Shhhhhhhhhhh. (Pitch getting higher and lower)

120
0:07:50.266,000 --> 0:07:53,000
You do not know the power of the dark side.

121
0:07:53.609,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:55.421,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I couldn't resist.

123
0:07:59.832,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Okay, now keep your eyes closed

124
0:08:02.479,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because, did you hear the difference?

125
0:08:04.327,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Okay. Now, let's be sure.

126
0:08:07.425,000 --> 0:08:08,000
For your challenge,

127
0:08:09.224,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you tell me, just say "now" when you hear the panel start to move.

128
0:08:14.308,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Okay? We'll relax into this.

129
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Shhhhhhh.

130
0:08:23.823,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Audience: Now. Daniel Kish: Good. Excellent.

131
0:08:25.888,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Open your eyes.

132
0:08:27.381,000 --> 0:08:31,000
All right. So just a few centimeters,

133
0:08:31.915,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you would notice the difference.

134
0:08:34.045,000 --> 0:08:36,000
You've experienced sonar.

135
0:08:37.528,000 --> 0:08:4,000
You'd all make great blind people. (Laughter)

136
0:08:40.547,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Let's have a look at what can happen

137
0:08:43.24,000 --> 0:08:46,000
when this activation process

138
0:08:46.584,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is given some time and attention.

139
0:08:51.111,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Video) Juan Ruiz: It's like you guys can see with your eyes

140
0:08:54.292,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and we can see with our ears.

141
0:08:57.497,000 --> 0:09:,000
Brian Bushway: It's not a matter of enjoying it more or less,

142
0:09:00.561,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it's about enjoying it differently.

143
0:09:03.487,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Shawn Marsolais: It goes across. DK: Yeah.

144
0:09:06.529,000 --> 0:09:09,000
SM: And then it's gradually coming back down again.

145
0:09:10.337,000 --> 0:09:11,000
DK: Yes! SM: That's amazing.

146
0:09:11.95,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I can, like, see the car. Holy mother!

147
0:09:21.981,000 --> 0:09:23,000
J. Louchart: I love being blind.

148
0:09:24.048,000 --> 0:09:27,000
If I had the opportunity, honestly, I wouldn't go back to being sighted.

149
0:09:27.716,000 --> 0:09:3,000
JR: The bigger the goal, the more obstacles you'll face,

150
0:09:31.176,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and on the other side of that goal

151
0:09:33.777,000 --> 0:09:34,000
is victory.

152
0:09:35.425,000 --> 0:09:4,000
[In Italian]

153
0:09:40.58,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Applause)

154
0:09:50.355,000 --> 0:09:53,000
DK: Now, do these people look terrified?

155
0:09:54.245,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Not so much.

156
0:09:56.067,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We have delivered activation training

157
0:09:58.853,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to tens of thousands of blind and sighted people from all backgrounds

158
0:10:02.382,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in nearly 40 countries.

159
0:10:04.82,000 --> 0:10:08,000
When blind people learn to see,

160
0:10:09.302,000 --> 0:10:12,000
sighted people seem inspired

161
0:10:12.32,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to want to learn to see their way better, more clearly, with less fear,

162
0:10:18.627,000 --> 0:10:23,000
because this exemplifies the immense capacity within us all

163
0:10:24.533,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to navigate any type of challenge, through any form of darkness,

164
0:10:31.046,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to discoveries unimagined

165
0:10:34.332,000 --> 0:10:39,000
when we are activated.

166
0:10:39.695,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I wish you all a most activating journey.

167
0:10:45.709,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Thank you very much.

168
0:10:47.474,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Applause)

169
0:10:55.716,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Chris Anderson: Daniel, my friend.

170
0:10:58.162,000 --> 0:11:03,000
As I know you can see, it's a spectacular standing ovation at TED.

171
0:11:03.297,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Thank you for an extraordinary talk.

172
0:11:06.281,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Just one more question about your world, your inner world that you construct.

173
0:11:11.53,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We think that we have things in our world that you as a blind person don't have,

174
0:11:17.095,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but what's your world like?

175
0:11:18.819,000 --> 0:11:2,000
What do you have that we don't have?

176
0:11:21.582,000 --> 0:11:24,000
DK: Three hundred and sixty-degree view,

177
0:11:24.717,000 --> 0:11:27,000
so my sonar works about as well behind me as it does in front of me.

178
0:11:28.618,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It works around corners.

179
0:11:30.499,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It works through surfaces.

180
0:11:34.448,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Generally, it's kind of a fuzzy three-dimensional geometry.

181
0:11:39.229,000 --> 0:11:43,000
One of my students, who has now become an instructor,

182
0:11:43.269,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when he lost his vision, after a few months

183
0:11:46.195,000 --> 0:11:48,000
he was sitting in his three story house

184
0:11:48.447,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and he realized that he could hear everything going on throughout the house:

185
0:11:52.464,000 --> 0:11:56,000
conversations, people in the kitchen, people in the bathroom,

186
0:11:56.643,000 --> 0:11:58,000
several floors away, several walls away.

187
0:11:59.337,000 --> 0:12:02,000
He said it was something like having x-ray vision.

188
0:12:02.889,000 --> 0:12:05,000
CA: What do you picture that you're in right now?

189
0:12:06.511,000 --> 0:12:09,000
How do you picture this theater?

190
0:12:09.53,000 --> 0:12:14,000
DK: Lots of loudspeakers, quite frankly.

191
0:12:16.453,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It's interesting. When people make a sound,

192
0:12:20.709,000 --> 0:12:25,000
when they laugh, when they fidget, when they take a drink or blow their nose

193
0:12:25.864,000 --> 0:12:27,000
or whatever, I hear everything.

194
0:12:28.557,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I hear every little movement that every single person makes.

195
0:12:31.738,000 --> 0:12:33,000
None of it really escapes my attention,

196
0:12:34.501,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and then, from a sonar perspective,

197
0:12:36.355,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the size of the room, the curvature of the audience around the stage,

198
0:12:42.209,000 --> 0:12:45,000
it's the height of the room.

199
0:12:45.847,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Like I say, it's all that kind of three-dimensional surface geometry

200
0:12:49.127,000 --> 0:12:5,000
all around me.

201
0:12:50.544,000 --> 0:12:52,000
CA: Well, Daniel, you have done a spectacular job

202
0:12:52.83,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of helping us all see the world in a different way.

203
0:12:55.655,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Thanks so much for that, truly. DK: Thank you.

204
0:12:57.825,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause)

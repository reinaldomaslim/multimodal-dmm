1
0:00:15.807,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I thought I'd talk a little bit about how nature makes materials.

2
0:00:18.998,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I brought along with me an abalone shell.

3
0:00:21.212,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material

4
0:00:23.811,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that's 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate

5
0:00:26.684,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and two percent by mass protein.

6
0:00:29.239,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Yet, it's 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart.

7
0:00:32.959,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells,

8
0:00:36.422,000 --> 0:00:37,000
like chalk.

9
0:00:37.598,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've been fascinated by how nature makes materials,

10
0:00:40.413,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and there's a lot of secrets to how they do such an exquisite job.

11
0:00:43.792,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure,

12
0:00:48.084,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but they're formed at the nano scale.

13
0:00:49.967,000 --> 0:00:5,000
They're formed at the nano scale,

14
0:00:51.659,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level

15
0:00:55.316,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that allow them to build these really exquisite structures.

16
0:00:58.149,000 --> 0:01:,000
So something I think is very fascinating is:

17
0:01:00.405,000 --> 0:01:04,000
What if you could give life to non-living structures,

18
0:01:04.686,000 --> 0:01:06,000
like batteries and like solar cells?

19
0:01:06.96,000 --> 0:01:08,000
What if they had some of the same capabilities

20
0:01:09.268,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that an abalone shell did,

21
0:01:10.96,000 --> 0:01:13,000
in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures

22
0:01:14.666,000 --> 0:01:15,000
at room temperature and room pressure,

23
0:01:16.523,000 --> 0:01:18,000
using nontoxic chemicals

24
0:01:18.592,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and adding no toxic materials back into the environment?

25
0:01:21.315,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So that's kind of the vision that I've been thinking about.

26
0:01:24.597,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish?

27
0:01:27.287,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Or what if you could give genetic information to a battery

28
0:01:30.201,000 --> 0:01:33,000
so that it could actually become better as a function of time, and do so

29
0:01:34.027,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in an environmentally friendly way?

30
0:01:36.195,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And so, going back to this abalone shell,

31
0:01:39.29,000 --> 0:01:42,000
besides being nanostructured, one thing that's fascinating is,

32
0:01:42.379,000 --> 0:01:44,000
when a male and female abalone get together,

33
0:01:44.871,000 --> 0:01:46,000
they pass on the genetic information that says,

34
0:01:47.1,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"This is how to build an exquisite material.

35
0:01:49.56,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Here's how to do it at room temperature and pressure,

36
0:01:52.084,000 --> 0:01:53,000
using nontoxic materials."

37
0:01:53.414,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Same with diatoms, which are shown right here,

38
0:01:55.602,000 --> 0:01:56,000
which are glasseous structures.

39
0:01:57.249,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Every time the diatoms replicate,

40
0:01:58.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
they give the genetic information that says,

41
0:02:01.05,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Here's how to build glass in the ocean that's perfectly nanostructured."

42
0:02:04.738,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And you can do it the same, over and over again."

43
0:02:07.055,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery?

44
0:02:10.399,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year old.

45
0:02:13.96,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But anyone who's ever had or knows small children knows,

46
0:02:17.221,000 --> 0:02:19,000
they're incredibly complex organisms.

47
0:02:19.261,000 --> 0:02:22,000
If you wanted to convince them to do something they don't want to do,

48
0:02:22.981,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it's very difficult.

49
0:02:24.163,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So when we think about future technologies,

50
0:02:26.203,000 --> 0:02:29,000
we actually think of using bacteria and viruses --

51
0:02:29.445,000 --> 0:02:3,000
simple organisms.

52
0:02:30.677,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox,

53
0:02:33.357,000 --> 0:02:36,000
so they can build a structure that will be important to me?

54
0:02:36.631,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Also, when we think about future technologies,

55
0:02:38.956,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we start with the beginning of Earth.

56
0:02:41.193,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Basically, it took a billion years to have life on Earth.

57
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And very rapidly, they became multi-cellular,

58
0:02:47.095,000 --> 0:02:49,000
they could replicate, they could use photosynthesis

59
0:02:49.696,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as a way of getting their energy source.

60
0:02:51.657,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But it wasn't until about 500 million years ago --

61
0:02:54.023,000 --> 0:02:56,000
during the Cambrian geologic time period --

62
0:02:56.079,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials.

63
0:02:59.148,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Before that, they were all soft, fluffy structures.

64
0:03:02.736,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It was during this time that there was increased calcium,

65
0:03:05.448,000 --> 0:03:06,000
iron and silicon in the environment,

66
0:03:07.328,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and organisms learned how to make hard materials.

67
0:03:10.594,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So that's what I would like to be able to do,

68
0:03:12.809,000 --> 0:03:15,000
convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table.

69
0:03:16.46,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Now, if you look at biology,

70
0:03:18.672,000 --> 0:03:21,000
there's many structures like DNA, antibodies, proteins and ribosomes

71
0:03:22.514,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you've heard about,

72
0:03:23.738,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that are nanostructured --

73
0:03:25.208,000 --> 0:03:28,000
nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nano scale.

74
0:03:28.74,000 --> 0:03:29,000
What if we could harness them

75
0:03:30.463,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV?

76
0:03:35.185,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us?

77
0:03:39.334,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Here are some examples.

78
0:03:40.708,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Natural shells, natural biological materials.

79
0:03:42.889,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The abalone shell here.

80
0:03:44.105,000 --> 0:03:47,000
If you fracture it, you can look at the fact that it's nanostructured.

81
0:03:47.516,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There's diatoms made out of SiO2,

82
0:03:49.668,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and there are magnetotactic bacteria

83
0:03:51.55,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that make small, single-domain magnets used for navigation.

84
0:03:54.96,000 --> 0:03:55,000
What all these have in common

85
0:03:56.652,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is these materials are structured at the nano scale,

86
0:03:59.233,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence

87
0:04:02.583,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that gives them the blueprint

88
0:04:04.113,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to be able to build these really wonderful structures.

89
0:04:06.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, going back to the abalone shell,

90
0:04:09.166,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins.

91
0:04:11.77,000 --> 0:04:13,000
These proteins are very negatively charged.

92
0:04:13.818,000 --> 0:04:15,000
They can pull calcium out of the environment,

93
0:04:16.017,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate, calcium and carbonate.

94
0:04:19.58,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids which says,

95
0:04:22.497,000 --> 0:04:23,000
"This is how to build the structure.

96
0:04:24.244,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Here's the DNA sequence, here's the protein sequence

97
0:04:26.712,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in order to do it."

98
0:04:27.887,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So an interesting idea is,

99
0:04:29.158,000 --> 0:04:31,000
what if you could take any material you wanted,

100
0:04:31.435,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or any element on the periodic table,

101
0:04:33.237,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and find its corresponding DNA sequence,

102
0:04:35.619,000 --> 0:04:38,000
then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure,

103
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but not build an abalone shell --

104
0:04:40.99,000 --> 0:04:44,000
build something that nature has never had the opportunity to work with yet.

105
0:04:46.214,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And so here's the periodic table.

106
0:04:48.556,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I absolutely love the periodic table.

107
0:04:50.367,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT,

108
0:04:53.016,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I have a periodic table made that says,

109
0:04:54.967,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"Welcome to MIT. Now you're in your element."

110
0:04:57.128,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:58.161,000 --> 0:05:,000
And you flip it over, and it's the amino acids

112
0:05:00.474,000 --> 0:05:02,000
with the pH at which they have different charges.

113
0:05:02.96,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And so I give this out to thousands of people.

114
0:05:05.96,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And I know it says MIT and this is Caltech,

115
0:05:08.08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but I have a couple extra if people want it.

116
0:05:10.168,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year

117
0:05:14.511,000 --> 0:05:15,000
on his visit to MIT,

118
0:05:15.924,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and I really wanted to give him a periodic table.

119
0:05:18.246,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So I stayed up at night and talked to my husband,

120
0:05:20.612,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"How do I give President Obama a periodic table?

121
0:05:22.892,000 --> 0:05:24,000
What if he says, 'Oh, I already have one,'

122
0:05:24.984,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or, 'I've already memorized it?'"

123
0:05:26.648,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:27.68,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit.

125
0:05:30.984,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And then afterward, I said,

126
0:05:32.342,000 --> 0:05:34,000
"Sir, I want to give you the periodic table,

127
0:05:34.729,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in case you're ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight."

128
0:05:38.116,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:39.226,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I thought "molecular weight" sounded much less nerdy than "molar mass."

130
0:05:42.764,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

131
0:05:43.859,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And he looked at it and said,

132
0:05:46.782,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"Thank you. I'll look at it periodically."

133
0:05:48.82,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

134
0:05:50.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Applause)

135
0:05:54.96,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy,

136
0:05:57.96,000 --> 0:05:58,000
he pulled it out and said,

137
0:05:59.284,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"And people at MIT, they give out periodic tables." So ...

138
0:06:02.046,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So basically what I didn't tell you

139
0:06:04.378,000 --> 0:06:07,000
is that about 500 million years ago, the organisms started making materials,

140
0:06:08.003,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it --

141
0:06:10.861,000 --> 0:06:13,000
50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell.

142
0:06:14.332,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And that's a hard sell to a graduate student:

143
0:06:16.48,000 --> 0:06:18,000
"I have this great project ... 50 million years ..."

144
0:06:19.041,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly.

145
0:06:22.569,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so we use a nontoxic virus called M13 bacteriophage,

146
0:06:27.346,000 --> 0:06:28,000
whose job is to infect bacteria.

147
0:06:29.327,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Well, it has a simple DNA structure

148
0:06:31.057,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it,

149
0:06:35.209,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and by doing that, it allows the virus to express random protein sequences.

150
0:06:39.726,000 --> 0:06:4,000
This is pretty easy biotechnology,

151
0:06:41.663,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and you could basically do this a billion times.

152
0:06:43.934,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So you can have a billion different viruses

153
0:06:46.268,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that are all genetically identical,

154
0:06:47.999,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but they differ from each other based on their tips,

155
0:06:50.461,000 --> 0:06:51,000
on one sequence,

156
0:06:52.086,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that codes for one protein.

157
0:06:53.599,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now if you take all billion viruses, and put them in one drop of liquid,

158
0:06:57.377,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you can force them to interact with anything you want

159
0:06:59.91,000 --> 0:07:,000
on the periodic table.

160
0:07:01.115,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And through a process of selection evolution,

161
0:07:03.256,000 --> 0:07:06,000
you can pull one of a billion that does something you'd like it to do,

162
0:07:06.584,000 --> 0:07:07,000
like grow a battery or a solar cell.

163
0:07:08.362,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Basically, viruses can't replicate themselves; they need a host.

164
0:07:11.422,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Once you find that one out of a billion,

165
0:07:13.41,000 --> 0:07:16,000
you infect it into a bacteria, and make millions and billions of copies

166
0:07:16.871,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of that particular sequence.

167
0:07:18.283,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The other thing that's beautiful about biology

168
0:07:20.485,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is that biology gives you really exquisite structures

169
0:07:23.651,000 --> 0:07:24,000
with nice link scales.

170
0:07:24.96,000 --> 0:07:25,000
These viruses are long and skinny,

171
0:07:26.795,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and we can get them to express the ability

172
0:07:28.984,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to grow something like semiconductors

173
0:07:30.96,000 --> 0:07:32,000
or materials for batteries.

174
0:07:33.09,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Now, this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab.

175
0:07:35.96,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes.

176
0:07:38.697,000 --> 0:07:4,000
One part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube,

177
0:07:40.96,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the other part of the virus has a sequence

178
0:07:43.069,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that can grow an electrode material for a battery,

179
0:07:45.717,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and then it wires itself to the current collector.

180
0:07:48.44,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And so through a process of selection evolution,

181
0:07:50.96,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery

182
0:07:54.126,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to a virus that made a good battery

183
0:07:55.831,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to a virus that made a record-breaking, high-powered battery

184
0:07:58.727,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that's all made at room temperature, basically at the benchtop.

185
0:08:01.918,000 --> 0:08:04,000
That battery went to the White House for a press conference,

186
0:08:05.412,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and I brought it here.

187
0:08:06.847,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You can see it in this case that's lighting this LED.

188
0:08:09.65,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now if we could scale this,

189
0:08:11.729,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you could actually use it to run your Prius,

190
0:08:15.713,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which is kind of my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car.

191
0:08:19.081,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:20.222,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But basically you can pull one out of a billion,

193
0:08:24.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and make lots of amplifications to it.

194
0:08:26.902,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Basically, you make an amplification in the lab,

195
0:08:29.199,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery.

196
0:08:32.517,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We're able to do this also with catalysis.

197
0:08:34.807,000 --> 0:08:37,000
This is the example of a photocatalytic splitting of water.

198
0:08:38.762,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And what we've been able to do is engineer a virus

199
0:08:41.774,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to basically take dye-absorbing molecules

200
0:08:44.084,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and line them up on the surface of the virus

201
0:08:46.163,000 --> 0:08:47,000
so it acts as an antenna,

202
0:08:47.498,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and you get an energy transfer across the virus.

203
0:08:50.195,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material

204
0:08:53.482,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen,

205
0:08:57.498,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that can be used for clean fuels.

206
0:08:59.736,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I brought an example of that with me today.

207
0:09:01.836,000 --> 0:09:02,000
My students promised me it would work.

208
0:09:03.678,000 --> 0:09:05,000
These are virus-assembled nanowires.

209
0:09:06.129,000 --> 0:09:08,000
When you shine light on them, you can see them bubbling.

210
0:09:08.96,000 --> 0:09:1,000
In this case, you're seeing oxygen bubbles come out.

211
0:09:11.919,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Applause)

212
0:09:13.252,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Basically, by controlling the genes,

213
0:09:15.96,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance.

214
0:09:19.318,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The last example are solar cells.

215
0:09:21.048,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You can also do this with solar cells.

216
0:09:22.887,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We've been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes

217
0:09:26.173,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and then grow titanium dioxide around them,

218
0:09:30.3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and use it as a way of getting electrons through the device.

219
0:09:34.343,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And what we've found is through genetic engineering,

220
0:09:36.831,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells

221
0:09:41.658,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to record numbers

222
0:09:43.659,000 --> 0:09:46,000
for these types of dye-sensitized systems.

223
0:09:46.96,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And I brought one of those as well,

224
0:09:48.96,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that you can play around with outside afterward.

225
0:09:52.162,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So this is a virus-based solar cell.

226
0:09:54.051,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Through evolution and selection,

227
0:09:55.96,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell

228
0:09:59.48,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell.

229
0:10:01.588,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So I hope that I've convinced you

230
0:10:03.445,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that there's a lot of great, interesting things to be learned

231
0:10:07.336,000 --> 0:10:08,000
about how nature makes materials,

232
0:10:08.96,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and about taking it the next step,

233
0:10:10.635,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to see if you can force or take advantage of how nature makes materials,

234
0:10:15.156,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to make things that nature hasn't yet dreamed of making.

235
0:10:17.861,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Thank you.

236
0:10:19.036,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Applause)

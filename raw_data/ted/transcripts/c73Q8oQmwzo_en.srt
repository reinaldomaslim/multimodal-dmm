1
0:00:12.731,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My son and the iPhone were born three weeks apart

2
0:00:16.571,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in June 2007.

3
0:00:19.393,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So while those early adopters were lined up outside,

4
0:00:22.76,000 --> 0:00:24,000
waiting to get their hands on this amazing new gadget,

5
0:00:25.709,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was stuck at home with my hands full of something else

6
0:00:29.677,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that was sending out constant notifications --

7
0:00:31.947,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:33.804,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a miserable, colicky baby

9
0:00:36.44,000 --> 0:00:4,000
who would only sleep in a moving stroller with complete silence.

10
0:00:42.177,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I literally was walking 10 to 15 miles a day,

11
0:00:45.211,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and the baby weight came off.

12
0:00:46.81,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That part was great.

13
0:00:48.435,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But man, was I bored.

14
0:00:51.217,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Before motherhood, I had been a journalist

15
0:00:53.393,000 --> 0:00:55,000
who rushed off when the Concorde crashed.

16
0:00:55.984,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I was one of the first people into Belgrade

17
0:00:58.429,000 --> 0:01:,000
when there was a revolution in Serbia.

18
0:01:00.954,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, I was exhausted.

19
0:01:04.186,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This walking went on for weeks.

20
0:01:07.086,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was only until about three months in that something shifted, though.

21
0:01:12.553,000 --> 0:01:14,000
As I pounded the pavement,

22
0:01:14.664,000 --> 0:01:17,000
my mind started to wander, too.

23
0:01:17.851,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I began imagining what I would do when I finally did sleep again.

24
0:01:22.125,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So the colic did fade,

25
0:01:24.157,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I finally got an iPhone

26
0:01:26.98,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I put all those hours of wandering into action.

27
0:01:29.899,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I created my dream job hosting a public radio show.

28
0:01:33.839,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So there was no more rushing off to war zones,

29
0:01:36.023,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but thanks to my new smartphone,

30
0:01:37.949,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I could be a mother and a journalist.

31
0:01:40.244,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I could be on the playground and on Twitter at the same time.

32
0:01:45.541,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Yeah, well, when I thought that,

33
0:01:47.316,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when the technology came in and took over,

34
0:01:49.387,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that is when I hit a wall.

35
0:01:52.176,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So, I want you to picture this:

36
0:01:54.41,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you host a podcast, and you have to prove

37
0:01:56.688,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that the investment of precious public radio dollars in you

38
0:02:00.132,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is worth it.

39
0:02:01.332,000 --> 0:02:05,000
My goal was to increase my audience size tenfold.

40
0:02:05.601,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So one day, I sat down to brainstorm,

41
0:02:08.089,000 --> 0:02:09,000
as you do,

42
0:02:09.389,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and I came up barren.

43
0:02:11.382,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This was different than writer's block, right?

44
0:02:13.577,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It wasn't like there was something there waiting to be unearthed.

45
0:02:16.676,000 --> 0:02:17,000
There was just nothing.

46
0:02:18.124,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And so I started to think back:

47
0:02:19.626,000 --> 0:02:21,000
When was the last time I actually had a good idea?

48
0:02:22.417,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Yeah, it was when I was pushing that damn stroller.

49
0:02:25.872,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now all the cracks in my day were filled with phone time.

50
0:02:29.305,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I checked the headlines while I waited for my latte.

51
0:02:32.854,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I updated my calendar while I was sitting on the couch.

52
0:02:36.95,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Texting turned every spare moment

53
0:02:39.399,000 --> 0:02:42,000
into a chance to show to my coworkers and my dear husband

54
0:02:42.712,000 --> 0:02:44,000
what a responsive person I was,

55
0:02:45.338,000 --> 0:02:47,000
or at least it was a chance to find another perfect couch

56
0:02:48.247,000 --> 0:02:49,000
for my page on Pinterest.

57
0:02:50.829,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I realized that I was never bored.

58
0:02:53.668,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And anyway, don't only boring people get bored?

59
0:02:57.028,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But then I started to wonder:

60
0:02:58.434,000 --> 0:03:,000
What actually happens to us when we get bored?

61
0:03:00.72,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Or, more importantly: What happens to us if we never get bored?

62
0:03:04.921,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And what could happen if we got rid of this human emotion entirely?

63
0:03:09.896,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I started talking to neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists,

64
0:03:14.171,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and what they told me was fascinating.

65
0:03:17.12,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It turns out that when you get bored,

66
0:03:18.937,000 --> 0:03:22,000
you ignite a network in your brain called the "default mode."

67
0:03:23.045,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So our body, it goes on autopilot while we're folding the laundry

68
0:03:27.928,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or we're walking to work,

69
0:03:29.319,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but actually that is when our brain gets really busy.

70
0:03:32.304,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann.

71
0:03:36.081,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann: Once you start daydreaming

72
0:03:38.454,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and allow your mind to really wander,

73
0:03:40.294,000 --> 0:03:42,000
you start thinking a little bit beyond the conscious,

74
0:03:42.877,000 --> 0:03:43,000
a little bit into the subconscious,

75
0:03:44.624,000 --> 0:03:47,000
which allows sort of different connections to take place.

76
0:03:47.82,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's really awesome, actually.

77
0:03:49.334,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right?

78
0:03:51.864,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So this is my brain in an fMRI,

79
0:03:54.091,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I learned that in the default mode is when we connect disparate ideas,

80
0:03:58.068,000 --> 0:04:,000
we solve some of our most nagging problems,

81
0:04:00.602,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and we do something called "autobiographical planning."

82
0:04:03.667,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This is when we look back at our lives,

83
0:04:05.586,000 --> 0:04:08,000
we take note of the big moments, we create a personal narrative,

84
0:04:08.809,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and then we set goals

85
0:04:10.341,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and we figure out what steps we need to take to reach them.

86
0:04:13.482,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But now we chill out on the couch also while updating a Google Doc

87
0:04:17.955,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or replying to email.

88
0:04:19.899,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We call it "getting shit done,"

89
0:04:22.451,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but here's what neuroscientist Dr. Daniel Levitin says

90
0:04:25.513,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we're actually doing.

91
0:04:27.51,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin: Every time you shift your attention

92
0:04:30.591,000 --> 0:04:31,000
from one thing to another,

93
0:04:31.927,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the brain has to engage a neurochemical switch

94
0:04:34.679,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that uses up nutrients in the brain to accomplish that.

95
0:04:37.934,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So if you're attempting to multitask,

96
0:04:40.377,000 --> 0:04:42,000
you know, doing four or five things at once,

97
0:04:42.724,000 --> 0:04:44,000
you're not actually doing four or five things at once,

98
0:04:45.289,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because the brain doesn't work that way.

99
0:04:47.238,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Instead, you're rapidly shifting from one thing to the next,

100
0:04:50.113,000 --> 0:04:52,000
depleting neural resources as you go.

101
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch, you're using glucose, glucose, glucose.

102
0:04:55.991,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we have a limited supply of that stuff.

103
0:04:59.332,000 --> 0:05:01,000
MZ: A decade ago, we shifted our attention at work

104
0:05:01.765,000 --> 0:05:02,000
every three minutes.

105
0:05:03.049,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now we do it every 45 seconds,

106
0:05:05.966,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and we do it all day long.

107
0:05:07.827,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The average person checks email 74 times a day,

108
0:05:11.187,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and switches tasks on their computer

109
0:05:13.498,000 --> 0:05:16,000
566 times a day.

110
0:05:17.418,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I discovered all this talking to professor of informatics,

111
0:05:20.943,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Dr. Gloria Mark.

112
0:05:23.127,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we find that when people are stressed,

113
0:05:26.697,000 --> 0:05:29,000
they tend to shift their attention more rapidly.

114
0:05:29.892,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We also found, strangely enough,

115
0:05:32.155,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that the shorter the amount of sleep that a person gets,

116
0:05:37.879,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the more likely they are to check Facebook.

117
0:05:39.999,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle.

118
0:05:44.065,000 --> 0:05:46,000
MZ: But could this cycle be broken?

119
0:05:46.187,000 --> 0:05:49,000
What would happen if we broke this vicious cycle?

120
0:05:50.487,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Maybe my listeners could help me find out.

121
0:05:55.281,000 --> 0:05:57,000
What if we reclaimed those cracks in our day?

122
0:05:58.416,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Could it help us jump-start our creativity?

123
0:06:03.042,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We called the project "Bored and Brilliant."

124
0:06:08.084,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And I expected, you know, a couple hundred people to play along,

125
0:06:11.157,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but thousands of people started signing up.

126
0:06:14.258,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And they told me the reason they were doing it

127
0:06:16.454,000 --> 0:06:19,000
was because they were worried that their relationship with their phone

128
0:06:19.892,000 --> 0:06:23,000
had grown kind of ... "codependent," shall we say.

129
0:06:24.084,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Audio) Man: The relationship between a baby and its teddy bear

130
0:06:27.779,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or a baby and its binky

131
0:06:29.618,000 --> 0:06:32,000
or a baby that wants its mother's cradle

132
0:06:32.92,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when it's done with being held by a stranger --

133
0:06:35.966,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughs)

134
0:06:37.042,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that's the relationship between me and my phone.

135
0:06:40.018,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Audio) Woman: I think of my phone like a power tool:

136
0:06:42.817,000 --> 0:06:45,000
extremely useful, but dangerous if I'm not handling it properly.

137
0:06:46.75,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Audio) Woman 2: If I don't pay close attention,

138
0:06:49.052,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I'll suddenly realize that I've lost an hour of time

139
0:06:51.529,000 --> 0:06:52,000
doing something totally mindless.

140
0:06:53.544,000 --> 0:06:55,000
MZ: OK, but to really measure any improvement,

141
0:06:55.871,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we needed data, right?

142
0:06:57.316,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Because that's what we do these days.

143
0:06:59.531,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So we partnered with some apps that would measure how much time

144
0:07:02.693,000 --> 0:07:04,000
we were spending every day on our phone.

145
0:07:04.809,000 --> 0:07:05,000
If you're thinking it's ironic

146
0:07:06.31,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that I asked people to download another app

147
0:07:08.383,000 --> 0:07:1,000
so that they would spend less time on their phones:

148
0:07:10.93,000 --> 0:07:12,000
yeah, but you gotta meet people where they are.

149
0:07:13.261,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:14.787,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So before challenge week,

151
0:07:16.589,000 --> 0:07:18,000
we were averaging two hours a day on our phones

152
0:07:19.481,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and 60 pickups,

153
0:07:21.213,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you know, like, a quick check, did I get a new email?

154
0:07:23.964,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Here's what Tina, a student at Bard College,

155
0:07:26.198,000 --> 0:07:27,000
discovered about herself.

156
0:07:28.552,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending

157
0:07:30.553,000 --> 0:07:33,000
between 150 and 200 minutes on my phone per day,

158
0:07:34.039,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I've been picking up my phone 70 to 100 times per day.

159
0:07:38.188,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And it's really concerning,

160
0:07:39.888,000 --> 0:07:41,000
because that's so much time that I could have spent

161
0:07:42.346,000 --> 0:07:45,000
doing something more productive, more creative, more towards myself,

162
0:07:46.222,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because when I'm on my phone, I'm not doing anything important.

163
0:07:49.204,000 --> 0:07:52,000
MZ: Like Tina, people were starting to observe their own behavior.

164
0:07:52.573,000 --> 0:07:54,000
They were getting ready for challenge week.

165
0:07:55.171,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And that Monday,

166
0:07:56.969,000 --> 0:07:58,000
they started to wake up to instructions in their inbox,

167
0:07:59.868,000 --> 0:08:,000
an experiment to try.

168
0:08:01.885,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Day one:

169
0:08:03.46,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"Put it in your pocket."

170
0:08:05.069,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Take that phone out of your hand.

171
0:08:07.385,000 --> 0:08:09,000
See if you can eliminate the reflex to check it all day long,

172
0:08:10.384,000 --> 0:08:11,000
just for a day.

173
0:08:11.902,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And if this sounds easy,

174
0:08:13.407,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you haven't tried it.

175
0:08:14.68,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Here's listener Amanda Itzko.

176
0:08:16.764,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Audio) Amanda Itzko: I am absolutely itching.

177
0:08:20.528,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I feel a little bit crazy,

178
0:08:23.008,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because I have noticed that I pick up my phone

179
0:08:27.716,000 --> 0:08:3,000
when I'm just walking from one room to another,

180
0:08:31.648,000 --> 0:08:32,000
getting on the elevator,

181
0:08:32.938,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and even -- and this is the part that I am really embarrassed

182
0:08:36.739,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to actually say out loud --

183
0:08:38.75,000 --> 0:08:39,000
in the car.

184
0:08:40.201,000 --> 0:08:41,000
MZ: Yikes.

185
0:08:41.398,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned,

186
0:08:43.091,000 --> 0:08:46,000
this itching feeling is not actually her fault.

187
0:08:46.498,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That is exactly the behavior that the technology is built to trigger.

188
0:08:50.873,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:55.557,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I mean, right?

190
0:08:57.627,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Here's former Google designer, Tristan Harris.

191
0:09:01.129,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebook or I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat,

192
0:09:04.529,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I have literally a thousand engineers

193
0:09:06.411,000 --> 0:09:08,000
whose job is to get more attention from you.

194
0:09:09.006,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I'm very good at this,

195
0:09:10.569,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and I don't want you to ever stop.

196
0:09:12.309,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And you know, the CEO of Netflix recently said,

197
0:09:14.555,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"Our biggest competitors are Facebook, YouTube and sleep."

198
0:09:17.801,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I mean, so there's a million places to spend your attention,

199
0:09:21.099,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but there's a war going on to get it.

200
0:09:23.05,000 --> 0:09:24,000
MZ: I mean, you know the feeling:

201
0:09:24.772,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that amazing episode of "Transparent" ends,

202
0:09:26.925,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and then the next one starts playing

203
0:09:28.701,000 --> 0:09:3,000
so you're like, eh, OK fine, I'll just stay up and watch it.

204
0:09:31.625,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Or the LinkedIn progress bar says you are this close

205
0:09:34.728,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to having the perfect profile,

206
0:09:36.908,000 --> 0:09:39,000
so you add a little more personal information.

207
0:09:40.04,000 --> 0:09:41,000
As one UX designer told me,

208
0:09:42.058,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the only people who refer to their customers as "users"

209
0:09:45.355,000 --> 0:09:47,000
are drug dealers and technologists.

210
0:09:47.447,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:48.827,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Applause)

212
0:09:55.199,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And users, as we know, are worth a lot of money.

213
0:09:58.647,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Here's former Facebook product manager and author,

214
0:10:02.081,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Antonio García Martínez.

215
0:10:05.367,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Audio) Antonio García Martínez: The saying is, if any product is free

216
0:10:08.709,000 --> 0:10:1,000
then you're the product; your attention is the product.

217
0:10:11.334,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But what is your attention worth?

218
0:10:12.932,000 --> 0:10:14,000
That's why literally every time you load a page,

219
0:10:15.209,000 --> 0:10:16,000
not just on Facebook or any app,

220
0:10:16.773,000 --> 0:10:19,000
there's an auction being held instantly, billions of times a day,

221
0:10:19.868,000 --> 0:10:21,000
for exactly how much that one ad impression cost.

222
0:10:22.206,000 --> 0:10:25,000
MZ: By the way, the average person will spend two years of their life

223
0:10:25.517,000 --> 0:10:26,000
on Facebook.

224
0:10:27.042,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So, back to challenge week.

225
0:10:28.608,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Immediately, we saw some creativity kick in.

226
0:10:32.044,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert.

227
0:10:34.593,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess.

228
0:10:36.781,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So I suddenly looked at the stairway that went up to the top of the station,

229
0:10:41.41,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and I thought, you know,

230
0:10:42.973,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I had just come down that stairway, but I could go back up

231
0:10:46.258,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and then come back down and get a little cardio.

232
0:10:48.767,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So I did,

233
0:10:49.955,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and then I had a little more time, so I did it again and I did it again,

234
0:10:53.82,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and I did it 10 times.

235
0:10:55.65,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I had a complete cardio workout.

236
0:10:58.045,000 --> 0:11:,000
I got on that R train feeling kind of exhausted,

237
0:11:00.496,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but, like, wow, that had never occurred to me.

238
0:11:03.184,000 --> 0:11:04,000
How is that possible?

239
0:11:04.603,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

240
0:11:05.731,000 --> 0:11:08,000
MZ: So creativity, I learned, means different things to different people.

241
0:11:09.741,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:10.765,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But everyone found day three's challenge the hardest.

243
0:11:14.342,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It was called "Delete that app."

244
0:11:16.582,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Take that app -- you know the one;

245
0:11:18.483,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that one that always gets you, it sucks you in --

246
0:11:21.283,000 --> 0:11:22,000
take it off your phone,

247
0:11:22.47,000 --> 0:11:23,000
even if just for the day.

248
0:11:23.882,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I deleted the game Two Dots and nearly cried.

249
0:11:27.168,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

250
0:11:28.238,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Yeah, Two Dots players know what I'm talking about.

251
0:11:30.681,000 --> 0:11:32,000
But my misery had good company.

252
0:11:36.194,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Audio) Man 2: This is Liam in Los Angeles,

253
0:11:38.47,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and I deleted Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine

254
0:11:43.327,000 --> 0:11:44,000
from my phone

255
0:11:44.506,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in one fell swoop.

256
0:11:46.131,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And it was kind of an embarrassingly emotional experience at first.

257
0:11:50.796,000 --> 0:11:53,000
It felt weirdly lonely to look at that lock screen

258
0:11:54.692,000 --> 0:11:56,000
with no new notifications on it.

259
0:11:57.073,000 --> 0:12:,000
But I really liked deciding for myself

260
0:12:00.145,000 --> 0:12:03,000
when to think about or access my social networks,

261
0:12:03.561,000 --> 0:12:06,000
not giving my phone the power to decide that for me.

262
0:12:07.559,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So thank you.

263
0:12:08.761,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter app was very sad,

264
0:12:11.476,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and I feel I maybe, over the last year when I've been on Twitter,

265
0:12:15.038,000 --> 0:12:16,000
have developed an addiction to it,

266
0:12:16.682,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and this "Bored and Brilliant" challenge has really made me realize it.

267
0:12:20.094,000 --> 0:12:23,000
After a brief period of really horrible withdrawal feeling,

268
0:12:23.25,000 --> 0:12:24,000
like lack-of-caffeine headache,

269
0:12:25.243,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I now feel lovely.

270
0:12:26.843,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I had a lovely dinner with my family,

271
0:12:28.678,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and I hope to continue this structured use of these powerful tools.

272
0:12:33.377,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Audio) Woman 4: I don't have that guilty gut feeling

273
0:12:35.9,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I have when I know I'm wasting time on my phone.

274
0:12:38.219,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Maybe I'll have to start giving myself challenges and reminders like this

275
0:12:41.745,000 --> 0:12:42,000
every morning.

276
0:12:42.921,000 --> 0:12:43,000
MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress.

277
0:12:44.638,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I could not wait to see what the numbers said

278
0:12:47.129,000 --> 0:12:48,000
at the end of that week.

279
0:12:49.971,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But when the data came in,

280
0:12:51.898,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it turned out that we had cut down,

281
0:12:54.195,000 --> 0:12:55,000
on average,

282
0:12:55.457,000 --> 0:12:57,000
just six minutes --

283
0:12:57.747,000 --> 0:12:59,000
from 120 minutes a day on our phones

284
0:13:00.581,000 --> 0:13:01,000
to 114.

285
0:13:03.474,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Yeah. Whoop-de-do.

286
0:13:05.117,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So I went back to the scientists feeling kind of low,

287
0:13:08.851,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and they just laughed at me,

288
0:13:10.355,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and they said, you know, changing people's behavior

289
0:13:12.81,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in such a short time period

290
0:13:14.367,000 --> 0:13:16,000
was ridiculously ambitious,

291
0:13:16.618,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and actually what you've achieved is far beyond what we thought possible.

292
0:13:21.861,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Because more important than the numbers, were the people's stories.

293
0:13:25.721,000 --> 0:13:26,000
They felt empowered.

294
0:13:27.387,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Their phones had been transformed

295
0:13:30.05,000 --> 0:13:31,000
from taskmasters

296
0:13:31.803,000 --> 0:13:32,000
back into tools.

297
0:13:34.528,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And actually, I found what the young people said most intriguing.

298
0:13:38.502,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Some of them told me

299
0:13:39.681,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that they didn't recognize some of the emotions

300
0:13:41.967,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that they felt during challenge week,

301
0:13:43.786,000 --> 0:13:44,000
because, if you think about it,

302
0:13:45.297,000 --> 0:13:47,000
if you have never known life without connectivity,

303
0:13:48.285,000 --> 0:13:5,000
you may never have experienced boredom.

304
0:13:51.291,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And there could be consequences.

305
0:13:53.381,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Researchers at USC have found -- they're studying teenagers

306
0:13:56.834,000 --> 0:13:58,000
who are on social media while they're talking to their friends

307
0:13:59.818,000 --> 0:14:,000
or they're doing homework,

308
0:14:01.128,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and two years down the road, they are less creative and imaginative

309
0:14:04.967,000 --> 0:14:05,000
about their own personal futures

310
0:14:06.845,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and about solving societal problems, like violence in their neighborhoods.

311
0:14:11.511,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And we really need this next generation

312
0:14:14.14,000 --> 0:14:16,000
to be able to focus on some big problems:

313
0:14:16.39,000 --> 0:14:18,000
climate change, economic disparity,

314
0:14:18.858,000 --> 0:14:2,000
massive cultural differences.

315
0:14:21.482,000 --> 0:14:23,000
No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey

316
0:14:24.227,000 --> 0:14:28,000
identified creativity as the number one leadership competency.

317
0:14:30.034,000 --> 0:14:31,000
OK, here's the good news, though:

318
0:14:31.726,000 --> 0:14:34,000
In the end, 20,000 people did "Bored and Brilliant" that week.

319
0:14:35.521,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Ninety percent cut down on their minutes.

320
0:14:37.977,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Seventy percent got more time to think.

321
0:14:40.871,000 --> 0:14:42,000
People told me that they slept better.

322
0:14:43.024,000 --> 0:14:44,000
They felt happier.

323
0:14:44.365,000 --> 0:14:47,000
My favorite note was from a guy who said he felt like he was waking up

324
0:14:48.013,000 --> 0:14:5,000
from a mental hibernation.

325
0:14:51.961,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Some personal data and some neuroscience

326
0:14:54.429,000 --> 0:14:57,000
gave us permission to be offline a little bit more,

327
0:14:57.594,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and a little bit of boredom gave us some clarity

328
0:15:00.561,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and helped some of us set some goals.

329
0:15:03.976,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I mean, maybe constant connectivity

330
0:15:06.111,000 --> 0:15:08,000
won't be cool in a couple of years.

331
0:15:09.893,000 --> 0:15:12,000
But meanwhile, teaching people, especially kids,

332
0:15:13.475,000 --> 0:15:16,000
how to use technology to improve their lives

333
0:15:16.626,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and to self-regulate

334
0:15:18.065,000 --> 0:15:2,000
needs to be part of digital literacy.

335
0:15:22.505,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So the next time you go to check your phone,

336
0:15:25.452,000 --> 0:15:29,000
remember that if you don't decide how you're going to use the technology,

337
0:15:29.548,000 --> 0:15:31,000
the platforms will decide for you.

338
0:15:32.833,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And ask yourself:

339
0:15:34.438,000 --> 0:15:35,000
What am I really looking for?

340
0:15:36.2,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Because if it's to check email, that's fine -- do it and be done.

341
0:15:39.919,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But if it's to distract yourself from doing the hard work

342
0:15:42.611,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that comes with deeper thinking,

343
0:15:44.935,000 --> 0:15:45,000
take a break,

344
0:15:46.367,000 --> 0:15:47,000
stare out the window

345
0:15:48.487,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and know that by doing nothing

346
0:15:51.356,000 --> 0:15:55,000
you are actually being your most productive and creative self.

347
0:15:56.082,000 --> 0:15:58,000
It might feel weird and uncomfortable at first,

348
0:15:58.829,000 --> 0:16:,000
but boredom truly can lead to brilliance.

349
0:16:02.214,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Thank you.

350
0:16:03.39,000 --> 0:16:07,000
(Applause)

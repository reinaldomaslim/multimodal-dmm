2
0:00:17.69,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This sound,

3
0:00:21.113,000 --> 0:00:24,000
this smell,

4
0:00:24.848,000 --> 0:00:28,000
this sight

5
0:00:28.953,000 --> 0:00:31,000
all remind me of the campfires of my childhood,

6
0:00:32.481,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when anyone could become a storyteller in front of the dancing flames.

7
0:00:39.877,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There was this wondrous ending

8
0:00:42.8,000 --> 0:00:46,000
when people and fire fell asleep almost in unison.

9
0:00:47.366,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It was dreaming time.

10
0:00:51.347,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now my story has a lot to do with dreaming,

11
0:00:54.684,000 --> 0:00:57,000
although I'm known to make my dreams come true.

12
0:00:58.394,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Last year, I created a one-man show.

13
0:01:01.685,000 --> 0:01:05,000
For an hour and a half I shared with the audience

14
0:01:05.918,000 --> 0:01:07,000
a lifetime of creativity,

15
0:01:08.585,000 --> 0:01:12,000
how I pursue perfection, how I cheat the impossible.

16
0:01:13.019,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And then TED challenged me:

17
0:01:15.368,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"Philippe, can you shrink this lifetime to 18 minutes?"

18
0:01:18.533,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:19.923,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Eighteen minutes, clearly impossible.

20
0:01:23.45,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But here I am.

21
0:01:25.713,000 --> 0:01:27,000
One solution was to rehearse a machine gun delivery

22
0:01:28.075,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in which every syllable, every second will have its importance

23
0:01:30.276,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and hope to God the audience will be able to follow me.

24
0:01:32.041,000 --> 0:01:33,000
No, no, no.

25
0:01:33.459,000 --> 0:01:35,000
No, the best way for me to start

26
0:01:36.34,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is to pay my respects to the gods of creativity.

27
0:01:40.009,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So please join me for a minute of silence.

28
0:02:01.286,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Okay, I cheated, it was a mere 20 seconds.

29
0:02:03.446,000 --> 0:02:05,000
But hey, we're on TED time.

30
0:02:06.164,000 --> 0:02:08,000
When I was six years old,

31
0:02:08.221,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I fell in love with magic.

32
0:02:11.019,000 --> 0:02:13,000
For Christmas I got a magic box

33
0:02:13.438,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and a very old book on card manipulation.

34
0:02:17.893,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Somehow I was more interested in pure manipulation

35
0:02:21.046,000 --> 0:02:25,000
than in all the silly little tricks in the box.

36
0:02:25.279,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So I looked in the book for the most difficult move,

37
0:02:28.545,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and it was this.

38
0:02:32.167,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now I'm not supposed to share that with you,

39
0:02:34.06,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but I have to show you the card is hidden in the back of the hand.

40
0:02:39.357,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now that manipulation

41
0:02:41.86,000 --> 0:02:44,000
was broken down into seven moves

42
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:48,000
described over seven pages.

43
0:02:48.434,000 --> 0:02:5,000
One, two, three,

44
0:02:51.029,000 --> 0:02:54,000
four, five, six and seven.

45
0:02:54.643,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And let me show you something else.

46
0:02:56.244,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The cards were bigger than my hands.

47
0:03:06.693,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Two months later, six years old,

48
0:03:09.296,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I'm able to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

49
0:03:12.555,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I go to see a famous magician

50
0:03:14.695,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and proudly ask him, "Well what do you think?"

51
0:03:17.421,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Six years old.

52
0:03:18.761,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The magician looked at me and said, "This is a disaster.

53
0:03:22.143,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You cannot do that in two seconds

54
0:03:25.029,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and have a minuscule part of the card showing.

55
0:03:28.494,000 --> 0:03:33,000
For the move to be professional, it has to be less than one second

56
0:03:33.978,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and it has to be perfect."

57
0:03:38.1,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Two years later, one -- zoop.

58
0:03:42.713,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I'm not cheating. It's in the back. It's perfect.

59
0:03:50.53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Passion is the motto

60
0:03:56.899,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of all my actions.

61
0:03:59.091,000 --> 0:04:03,000
As I'm studying magic,

62
0:04:03.301,000 --> 0:04:05,000
juggling is mentioned repeatedly

63
0:04:05.918,000 --> 0:04:09,000
as a great way to acquire dexterity and coordination.

64
0:04:10.486,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now I had long admired how fast and fluidly

65
0:04:14.801,000 --> 0:04:16,000
jugglers make objects fly.

66
0:04:17.035,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So that's it. I'm 14; I'm becoming a juggler.

67
0:04:20.963,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I befriend a young juggler in a juggling troupe,

68
0:04:24.751,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and he agrees to sell me three clubs.

69
0:04:29.202,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But in America you have to explain. What are clubs?

70
0:04:31.369,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Nothing to do with golf.

71
0:04:32.885,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They are those beautiful oblong objects,

72
0:04:37.419,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but quite difficult to make.

73
0:04:39.019,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They have to be precisely lathed.

74
0:04:40.885,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Oh, when I was buying the clubs,

75
0:04:43.053,000 --> 0:04:46,000
somehow the young juggler was hiding from the others.

76
0:04:46.202,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Well I didn't think much of it at the time.

77
0:04:48.552,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Anyway, here I was progressing with my new clubs.

78
0:04:52.518,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But I could not understand.

79
0:04:54.854,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I was pretty fast, but I was not fluid at all.

80
0:04:58.62,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The clubs were escaping me at each throw.

81
0:05:01.802,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And I was trying constantly to bring them back to me.

82
0:05:04.819,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Until one day I practiced in front of Francis Brunn,

83
0:05:08.952,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the world's greatest juggler.

84
0:05:11.12,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And he was frowning.

85
0:05:12.635,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And he finally asked, "Can I see those?"

86
0:05:15.052,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So I proudly showed him my clubs.

87
0:05:17.418,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He said, "Philippe, you have been had.

88
0:05:19.835,000 --> 0:05:22,000
These are rejects. They are completely out of alignment.

89
0:05:23.236,000 --> 0:05:28,000
They are impossible to juggle."

90
0:05:28.387,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Tenacity is how I kept at it

91
0:05:34.752,000 --> 0:05:35,000
against all odds.

92
0:05:36.634,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So I went to the circus to see more magicians, more jugglers,

93
0:05:40.186,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and I saw -- oh no, no, no, I didn't see.

94
0:05:42.668,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It was more interesting; I heard.

95
0:05:44.586,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I heard about those amazing men and women

96
0:05:46.953,000 --> 0:05:48,000
who walk on thin air --

97
0:05:49.638,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the high-wire walkers.

98
0:05:52.494,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now I have been playing with ropes and climbing all my childhood,

99
0:05:56.156,000 --> 0:06:,000
so that's it. I'm 16; I'm becoming a wire walker.

100
0:06:00.879,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I found two trees --

101
0:06:05.352,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but not any kind of trees,

102
0:06:07.538,000 --> 0:06:09,000
trees with character --

103
0:06:10.007,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and then a very long rope.

104
0:06:11.756,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I put the rope around and around

105
0:06:13.541,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and around and around and around till I had no more rope.

106
0:06:16.006,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now I have all of those ropes parallel like this.

107
0:06:18.523,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I get a pair of pliers and some coat hangers,

108
0:06:21.043,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and I gather them together in some kind of ropey path.

109
0:06:26.475,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So I just created the widest tightrope in the world.

110
0:06:30.093,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What did I need? I needed the widest shoes in the world.

111
0:06:33.571,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So I found some enormous, ridiculous, giant ski boots

112
0:06:37.41,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and then wobbly, wobbly I get on the ropes.

113
0:06:40.593,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Well within a few days I'm able to do one crossing.

114
0:06:44.604,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So I cut one rope off.

115
0:06:46.647,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And the next day one rope off.

116
0:06:48.392,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And a few days later, I was practicing on a single tightrope.

117
0:06:53.191,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now you can imagine at that time

118
0:06:54.991,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I had to switch the ridiculous boots for some slippers.

119
0:06:59.425,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So that is how -- in case there are people here in the audience who would like to try --

120
0:07:04.392,000 --> 0:07:07,000
this is how not to learn wire walking.

121
0:07:07.862,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

122
0:07:09.376,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Intuition is a tool essential in my life.

123
0:07:17.908,000 --> 0:07:21,000
In the meantime, I am being thrown out of five different schools

124
0:07:22.526,000 --> 0:07:23,000
because instead of listening to the teachers,

125
0:07:24.194,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I am my own teacher, progressing in my new art

126
0:07:28.225,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and becoming a street juggler.

127
0:07:31.359,000 --> 0:07:33,000
On the high wire, within months,

128
0:07:34.01,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I'm able to master all the tricks they do in the circus,

129
0:07:36.692,000 --> 0:07:38,000
except I am not satisfied.

130
0:07:39.275,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I was starting to invent my own moves and bring them to perfection.

131
0:07:47.536,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But nobody wanted to hire me.

132
0:07:50.24,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So I started putting a wire up in secret and performing without permission.

133
0:07:55.659,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Notre Dame,

134
0:07:59.545,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the Sydney Harbor Bridge,

135
0:08:03.583,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the World Trade Center.

136
0:08:06.677,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And I developed a certitude, a faith

137
0:08:08.95,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that convinced me that I will get safely to the other side.

138
0:08:12.51,000 --> 0:08:14,000
If not, I will never do that first step.

139
0:08:15.262,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Well nonetheless,

140
0:08:17.461,000 --> 0:08:2,000
on the top of the World Trade Center

141
0:08:20.474,000 --> 0:08:27,000
my first step was terrifying.

142
0:08:28.371,000 --> 0:08:32,000
All of a sudden the density of the air is no longer the same.

143
0:08:32.644,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Manhattan no longer spreads its infinity.

144
0:08:35.48,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The murmur of the city dissolves into a squall

145
0:08:38.76,000 --> 0:08:41,000
whose chilling power I no longer feel.

146
0:08:42.493,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I lift the balancing pole. I approach the edge.

147
0:08:45.359,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I step over the beam.

148
0:08:47.091,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I put my left foot on the cable,

149
0:08:50.489,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the weight of my body raised on my right leg

150
0:08:53.858,000 --> 0:08:56,000
anchored to the flank of the building.

151
0:08:57.138,000 --> 0:09:,000
Shall I ever so slightly shift my weight to the left?

152
0:09:00.957,000 --> 0:09:02,000
My right leg will be unburdened,

153
0:09:03.474,000 --> 0:09:06,000
my right foot will freely meet the wire.

154
0:09:06.977,000 --> 0:09:1,000
On one side, a mass of a mountain, a life I know.

155
0:09:11.549,000 --> 0:09:13,000
On the other, the universe of the clouds,

156
0:09:14.274,000 --> 0:09:17,000
so full of unknown we think it's empty.

157
0:09:17.842,000 --> 0:09:23,000
At my feet, the path to the north tower -- 60 yards of wire rope.

158
0:09:24.057,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's a straight line, which sags,

159
0:09:27.438,000 --> 0:09:3,000
which sways, which vibrates,

160
0:09:30.959,000 --> 0:09:31,000
which rolls on itself,

161
0:09:32.523,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which is ice,

162
0:09:34.258,000 --> 0:09:38,000
which is three tons tight, ready to explode,

163
0:09:38.627,000 --> 0:09:4,000
ready to swallow me.

164
0:09:41.241,000 --> 0:09:43,000
An inner howl assails me,

165
0:09:44.207,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the wild longing to flee.

166
0:09:47.224,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But it is too late.

167
0:09:49.691,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The wire is ready.

168
0:09:52.341,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Decisively my other foot sets itself onto the cable.

169
0:10:04.978,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Faith is what replaces doubt

170
0:10:09.473,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in my dictionary.

171
0:10:11.503,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So after the walk

172
0:10:12.729,000 --> 0:10:13,000
people ask me, "How can you top that?"

173
0:10:14.573,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Well I didn't have that problem.

174
0:10:16.878,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I was not interested in collecting the gigantic,

175
0:10:19.48,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in breaking records.

176
0:10:21.562,000 --> 0:10:26,000
In fact, I put my World Trade Center crossing

177
0:10:26.591,000 --> 0:10:29,000
at the same artistic level as some of my smaller walks --

178
0:10:30.141,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or some completely different type of performance.

179
0:10:35.057,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Let's see, such as my street juggling, for example.

180
0:10:41.219,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So each time

181
0:10:43.687,000 --> 0:10:46,000
I draw my circle of chalk on the pavement

182
0:10:46.908,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and enter as the improvising comic silent character

183
0:10:51.751,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I created 45 years ago,

184
0:10:53.676,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I am as happy as when I am in the clouds.

185
0:10:57.723,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But this here,

186
0:10:59.678,000 --> 0:11:01,000
this is not the street.

187
0:11:02.009,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So I cannot street juggle here, you understand.

188
0:11:04.585,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So you don't want me to street juggle here, right?

189
0:11:06.758,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You know that, right?

190
0:11:08.124,000 --> 0:11:1,000
You don't want me to juggle, right?

191
0:11:10.373,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Applause)

192
0:11:18.595,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Music)

193
0:13:10.46,000 --> 0:13:15,000
(Applause)

194
0:13:15.498,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Thank you. Thank you.

195
0:13:29.98,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Each time I street juggle

196
0:13:32.932,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I use improvisation.

197
0:13:44.025,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now improvisation is empowering

198
0:13:46.227,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because it welcomes the unknown.

199
0:13:50.427,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And since what's impossible is always unknown,

200
0:13:54.559,000 --> 0:14:01,000
it allows me to believe I can cheat the impossible.

201
0:14:02.149,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Now I have done the impossible not once,

202
0:14:04.593,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but many times.

203
0:14:06.778,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So what should I share? Oh, I know. Israel.

204
0:14:09.224,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Some years ago I was invited to open the Israel Festival

205
0:14:13.895,000 --> 0:14:14,000
by a high-wire walk.

206
0:14:15.861,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And I chose to put my wire

207
0:14:17.71,000 --> 0:14:21,000
between the Arab quarters and the Jewish quarter of Jerusalem

208
0:14:21.713,000 --> 0:14:22,000
over the Ben Hinnom Valley.

209
0:14:23.644,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I thought it would be incredible

210
0:14:25.811,000 --> 0:14:26,000
if in the middle of the wire

211
0:14:27.634,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I stopped and, like a magician,

212
0:14:29.617,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I produce a dove and send her in the sky

213
0:14:33.382,000 --> 0:14:35,000
as a living symbol of peace.

214
0:14:35.732,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Well now I must say,

215
0:14:38.549,000 --> 0:14:4,000
it was a little bit hard to find a dove in Israel, but I got one.

216
0:14:41.533,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And in my hotel room,

217
0:14:44.457,000 --> 0:14:48,000
each time I practiced making it appear and throwing her in the air,

218
0:14:49.437,000 --> 0:14:51,000
she would graze the wall and end up on the bed.

219
0:14:52.056,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So I said, now it's okay. The room is too small.

220
0:14:54.821,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I mean, a bird needs space to fly.

221
0:14:56.57,000 --> 0:14:58,000
It will go perfectly on the day of the walk.

222
0:14:58.822,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Now comes the day of the walk.

223
0:15:02.203,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Eighty thousand people spread over the entire valley.

224
0:15:05.853,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The mayor of Jerusalem, Teddy Kollek, comes to wish me the best.

225
0:15:10.437,000 --> 0:15:12,000
But he seemed nervous.

226
0:15:13.322,000 --> 0:15:15,000
There was tension in my wire,

227
0:15:15.571,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but I also could feel tension on the ground.

228
0:15:17.686,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Because all those people

229
0:15:19.004,000 --> 0:15:22,000
were made up of people who, for the most part,

230
0:15:22.103,000 --> 0:15:24,000
considered each other enemies.

231
0:15:24.988,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So I start the walk. Everything is fine.

232
0:15:27.724,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I stop in the middle.

233
0:15:29.502,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I make the dove appear.

234
0:15:32.221,000 --> 0:15:33,000
People applaud in delight.

235
0:15:34.137,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And then in the most magnificent gesture,

236
0:15:36.906,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I send the bird of peace into the azure.

237
0:15:40.437,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But the bird, instead of flying away,

238
0:15:42.186,000 --> 0:15:45,000
goes flop, flop, flop and lands on my head.

239
0:15:45.237,000 --> 0:15:47,000
(Laughter)

240
0:15:47.321,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And people scream.

241
0:15:49.22,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So I grab the dove,

242
0:15:51.838,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and for the second time I send her in the air.

243
0:15:56.634,000 --> 0:15:59,000
But the dove, who obviously didn't go to flying school,

244
0:15:59.807,000 --> 0:16:03,000
goes flop, flop, flop and ends up at the end of my balancing pole.

245
0:16:03.854,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Laughter)

246
0:16:05.17,000 --> 0:16:07,000
You laugh, you laugh. But hey.

247
0:16:07.425,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I sit down immediately. It's a reflex of wire walkers.

248
0:16:10.854,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.

249
0:16:14.073,000 --> 0:16:16,000
They must think this guy with this dove,

250
0:16:16.437,000 --> 0:16:18,000
he must have spent years working with him.

251
0:16:18.603,000 --> 0:16:19,000
What a genius, what a professional.

252
0:16:20.02,000 --> 0:16:21,000
(Laughter)

253
0:16:21.991,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So I take a bow. I salute with my hand.

254
0:16:24.97,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And at the end I bang my hand against the pole

255
0:16:27.038,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to dislodge the bird.

256
0:16:28.555,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Now the dove, who, now you know, obviously cannot fly,

257
0:16:32.204,000 --> 0:16:34,000
does for the third time a little flop, flop, flop

258
0:16:34.955,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and ends up on the wire behind me.

259
0:16:36.988,000 --> 0:16:39,000
And the entire valley goes crazy.

260
0:16:40.004,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Now but hold on, I'm not finished.

261
0:16:42.087,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So now I'm like 50 yards from my arrival

262
0:16:44.621,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and I'm exhausted, so my steps are slow.

263
0:16:47.27,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And something happened.

264
0:16:48.853,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Somebody somewhere, a group of people,

265
0:16:51.322,000 --> 0:16:54,000
starts clapping in rhythm with my steps.

266
0:16:54.504,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And within seconds the entire valley

267
0:16:56.353,000 --> 0:16:59,000
is applauding in unison with each of my steps.

268
0:17:00.337,000 --> 0:17:02,000
But not an applause of delight like before,

269
0:17:02.47,000 --> 0:17:05,000
an applause encouragement.

270
0:17:05.854,000 --> 0:17:09,000
For a moment, the entire crowd had forgotten their differences.

271
0:17:10.019,000 --> 0:17:14,000
They had become one, pushing me to triumph.

272
0:17:14.968,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I want you just for a second

273
0:17:17.635,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to experience this amazing human symphony.

274
0:17:20.648,000 --> 0:17:23,000
So let's say I am here and the chair is my arrival.

275
0:17:23.784,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So I walk, you clap, everybody in unison.

276
0:17:27.684,000 --> 0:17:33,000
(Clapping)

277
0:17:33.898,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Applause)

278
0:17:40.323,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So after the walk, Teddy and I become friends.

279
0:17:43.179,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And he tells me, he has on his desk a picture of me

280
0:17:46.832,000 --> 0:17:48,000
in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head.

281
0:17:49.267,000 --> 0:17:5,000
He didn't know the true story.

282
0:17:50.684,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And whenever he's daunted by an impossible situation

283
0:17:54.332,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to solve in this hard-to-manage city,

284
0:17:56.732,000 --> 0:17:59,000
instead of giving up, he looks at the picture and he says,

285
0:17:59.75,000 --> 0:18:01,000
"If Philippe can do that, I can do this,"

286
0:18:02.083,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and he goes back to work.

287
0:18:05.702,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Inspiration.

288
0:18:14.728,000 --> 0:18:16,000
By inspiring ourselves

289
0:18:17.176,000 --> 0:18:19,000
we inspire others.

290
0:18:19.366,000 --> 0:18:2,000
I will never forget this music,

291
0:18:21.149,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and I hope now neither will you.

292
0:18:23.666,000 --> 0:18:25,000
Please take this music with you home,

293
0:18:26.398,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and start gluing feathers to your arms

294
0:18:29.904,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and take off and fly,

295
0:18:32.222,000 --> 0:18:38,000
and look at the world from a different perspective.

296
0:18:38.23,000 --> 0:18:4,000
And when you see mountains,

297
0:18:40.675,000 --> 0:18:42,000
remember mountains can be moved.

298
0:18:43.468,000 --> 0:18:51,000
(Applause)

299
0:18:51.6,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Thank you. Thank you.

300
0:18:54.618,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Thank you.

301
0:18:58.29,000 --> 0:19:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:00.12,000 --> 0:00:03,000
A leader is steady, firm, decisive, unwavering.

2
0:00:03.8,000 --> 0:00:05,000
Never let 'em see you sweat, always have an answer.

3
0:00:06.28,000 --> 0:00:08,000
[The Way We Work]

4
0:00:10.6,000 --> 0:00:13,000
My name is Dan, I'm a partner at a global creative consultancy.

5
0:00:14.52,000 --> 0:00:16,000
But there's another side to me:

6
0:00:17.32,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Carrie Dragshaw,

7
0:00:18.64,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the character I created on Instagram.

8
0:00:20.56,000 --> 0:00:24,000
As I thought about my double life, I couldn't help but wonder ...

9
0:00:25.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
When your true self is a little nontraditional,

10
0:00:28.56,000 --> 0:00:3,000
how much of it can you really bring to the office?

11
0:00:32.04,000 --> 0:00:36,000
For some of us is authenticity off-limits?

12
0:00:36.52,000 --> 0:00:38,000
For the first 10 years of my career,

13
0:00:39.2,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I thought there was one way to be a leader:

14
0:00:41.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
decisive and serious.

15
0:00:43.84,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But that's not me.

16
0:00:45.52,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I'd put on basically office drag to fit the role:

17
0:00:49.28,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'd talk in a deeper voice, try to hold in my hand motions.

18
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I'm someone who gets really excited about things,

19
0:00:54.88,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so I'd temper that.

20
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I had this little voice in my head, telling me,

21
0:00:59.32,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"You're too gay, too feminine, too flamboyant."

22
0:01:02.88,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I had one well-intentioned adviser who said,

23
0:01:05.68,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Everyone knows you're gay. And that's great.

24
0:01:07.88,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But you don't need to beat them over the head with it."

25
0:01:10.8,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Cut to: me in a tutu, for Halloween 2016.

26
0:01:15.92,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I dressed up as my favorite TV show character, Carrie Bradshaw,

27
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:21,000
thinking my friends would get a kick out of it.

28
0:01:21.6,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And then, things got crazy.

29
0:01:23.64,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The post went viral, and at first it was pure fun.

30
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I started getting these incredible messages from people

31
0:01:29.64,000 --> 0:01:3,000
about how happy it made them,

32
0:01:31.08,000 --> 0:01:33,000
how it encouraged them to be their authentic selves.

33
0:01:34.04,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I started to think,

34
0:01:35.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
maybe this is the time to tell that little voice in my head to just shut up

35
0:01:39.92,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and let myself be me.

36
0:01:42.52,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But then things got a little too big.

37
0:01:44.64,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Carrie Dragshaw was everywhere -- In the "New York Post", "US Weekly" --

38
0:01:48.36,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and I got terrified:

39
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"What would my bosses think?

40
0:01:51.24,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Would my coworkers still respect me as a leader?

41
0:01:53.52,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What would my clients think?"

42
0:01:55.12,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I thought I was going to have to get a different job.

43
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
But then, something happened, something small.

44
0:02:00.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I got a text from my boss, it wasn't long, it just said,

45
0:02:03.92,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Wow, Cosmo!"

46
0:02:05.48,000 --> 0:02:08,000
With a link to an article that had just gone up about me.

47
0:02:09.039,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it let me put that little, scared voice away

48
0:02:11.96,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and just be excited about this whole new world,

49
0:02:14.48,000 --> 0:02:15,000
rather than freaked out.

50
0:02:16.2,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That's the power of one person,

51
0:02:17.8,000 --> 0:02:21,000
sometimes all it takes is one ally to make you feel comfortable.

52
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And my coworkers started acting differently.

53
0:02:24.28,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They became more open, more playful with me,

54
0:02:26.8,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it was as if knowing this other side of me

55
0:02:29.04,000 --> 0:02:31,000
gave them permission to be more of themselves as well.

56
0:02:31.8,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I thought that openness and vulnerability

57
0:02:34.6,000 --> 0:02:36,000
would actually decrease my standing with my team.

58
0:02:37.36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But it's done the opposite.

59
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Two years in,

60
0:02:40.92,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I never could have imagined that this part of me would not just be embraced,

61
0:02:45.32,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but could actually help my career.

62
0:02:47.4,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now, I'm lucky.

63
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I work in New York City,

64
0:02:50.44,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in an office where creativity is valued

65
0:02:52.88,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and I was already pretty established in my career when all of this started.

66
0:02:56.92,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Maybe that's you, maybe it isn't.

67
0:02:59.6,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But all of this has taught me so much

68
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:04,000
about just the importance of bringing your whole self to work.

69
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And it's really challenged my own misperceptions

70
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:08,000
about what it takes to be successful.

71
0:03:09.56,000 --> 0:03:11,000
There's no one kind of way to be a leader.

72
0:03:12.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's about finding your strengths and finding ways to amplify them.

73
0:03:16.32,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Before, if a meeting was hard, I'd put on my perfect leader mask.

74
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, I can say, "Gosh, that was frustrating."

75
0:03:24.32,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We can talk about challenges and struggles in an open way,

76
0:03:27.88,000 --> 0:03:3,000
rather than everybody pretending that they're fine until it's too late.

77
0:03:31.64,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Concealing an identity takes work.

78
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Think of all the wasted energy spent pretending,

79
0:03:37.92,000 --> 0:03:38,000
wishing you were someone different.

80
0:03:39.96,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What's most interesting to me, though, is that in this big study of covering,

81
0:03:44.28,000 --> 0:03:46,000
93 percent of those who say they're doing it

82
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:49,000
also believe their organization values inclusion.

83
0:03:50.44,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So clearly, our workplaces and all of our strange inner voices

84
0:03:55.2,000 --> 0:03:57,000
have a long way to go on acceptance.

85
0:03:57.36,000 --> 0:04:01,000
There's a big difference between adapting and disguising.

86
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I think I learned that a little late.

87
0:04:04.52,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Personally, I'm taking all of this as a call to be the ally

88
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
who, like my boss did for me,

89
0:04:09.72,000 --> 0:04:11,000
lets people know that it's OK to open up.

90
0:04:12.335,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If you're gay, or proud of your ethnic background,

91
0:04:15.176,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or have a disability or are deeply religious,

92
0:04:17.777,000 --> 0:04:2,000
see what it's like being your full self at work.

93
0:04:21.338,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You might be pleasantly surprised.

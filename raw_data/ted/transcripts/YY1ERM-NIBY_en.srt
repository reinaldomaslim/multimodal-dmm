1
0:00:12.927,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Who do you want to be?

2
0:00:15.317,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It's a simple question,

3
0:00:17.319,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and whether you know it or not,

4
0:00:19.095,000 --> 0:00:22,000
you're answering it every day through your actions.

5
0:00:22.971,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This one question will define your professional success

6
0:00:27.468,000 --> 0:00:29,000
more than any other,

7
0:00:29.516,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because how you show up and treat people means everything.

8
0:00:34.116,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Either you lift people up by respecting them,

9
0:00:38.342,000 --> 0:00:42,000
making them feel valued, appreciated and heard,

10
0:00:43.029,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or you hold people down by making them feel small,

11
0:00:47.994,000 --> 0:00:5,000
insulted, disregarded or excluded.

12
0:00:52.314,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And who you choose to be means everything.

13
0:00:56.631,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I study the effects of incivility on people.

14
0:00:59.628,000 --> 0:01:,000
What is incivility?

15
0:01:01.337,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's disrespect or rudeness.

16
0:01:03.62,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It includes a lot of different behaviors,

17
0:01:06.006,000 --> 0:01:08,000
from mocking or belittling someone

18
0:01:08.384,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to teasing people in ways that sting

19
0:01:10.947,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to telling offensive jokes

20
0:01:12.83,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to texting in meetings.

21
0:01:14.663,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And what's uncivil to one person may be absolutely fine to another.

22
0:01:19.414,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Take texting while someone's speaking to you.

23
0:01:22.106,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Some of us may find it rude,

24
0:01:24.292,000 --> 0:01:26,000
others may think it's absolutely civil.

25
0:01:27.171,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So it really depends.

26
0:01:28.855,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It's all in the eyes of the beholder and whether that person felt disrespected.

27
0:01:34.748,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We may not mean to make someone feel that way,

28
0:01:37.561,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but when we do, it has consequences.

29
0:01:41.736,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Over 22 years ago,

30
0:01:43.654,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I vividly recall walking into this stuffy hospital room.

31
0:01:47.901,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It was heartbreaking to see my dad, this strong, athletic, energetic guy,

32
0:01:53.943,000 --> 0:01:56,000
lying in the bed with electrodes strapped to his bare chest.

33
0:01:58.548,000 --> 0:02:,000
What put him there was work-related stress.

34
0:02:02.033,000 --> 0:02:04,000
For over a decade,

35
0:02:04.075,000 --> 0:02:07,000
he suffered an uncivil boss.

36
0:02:09.244,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And for me, I thought he was just an outlier at that time.

37
0:02:14.382,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But just a couple years later,

38
0:02:16.892,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I witnessed and experienced a lot of incivility

39
0:02:19.806,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in my first job out of college.

40
0:02:22.441,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I spent a year going to work every day

41
0:02:24.886,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and hearing things from coworkers like,

42
0:02:27.251,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"Are you an idiot? That's not how it's done,"

43
0:02:30.493,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and, "If I wanted your opinion, I'd ask."

44
0:02:35.025,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So I did the natural thing.

45
0:02:37.862,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I quit, and I went back to grad school to study the effects of this.

46
0:02:42.437,000 --> 0:02:44,000
There, I met Christine Pearson.

47
0:02:45.218,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And she had a theory that small, uncivil actions

48
0:02:48.894,000 --> 0:02:5,000
can lead to much bigger problems

49
0:02:51.306,000 --> 0:02:53,000
like aggression and violence.

50
0:02:53.908,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We believed that incivility affected performance and the bottom line.

51
0:02:57.92,000 --> 0:03:,000
So we launched a study, and what we found was eye-opening.

52
0:03:02.383,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We sent a survey to business school alumni

53
0:03:05.077,000 --> 0:03:07,000
working in all different organizations.

54
0:03:07.492,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We asked them to write a few sentences

55
0:03:09.991,000 --> 0:03:12,000
about one experience where they were treated rudely,

56
0:03:13.029,000 --> 0:03:15,000
disrespectfully or insensitively,

57
0:03:15.643,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and to answer questions about how they reacted.

58
0:03:20.621,000 --> 0:03:23,000
One person told us about a boss that made insulting statements like,

59
0:03:24.417,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"That's kindergartner's work,"

60
0:03:26.772,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and another tore up someone's work in front of the entire team.

61
0:03:31.751,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And what we found is that incivility made people less motivated:

62
0:03:36.18,000 --> 0:03:39,000
66 percent cut back work efforts,

63
0:03:39.443,000 --> 0:03:42,000
80 percent lost time worrying about what happened,

64
0:03:42.486,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and 12 percent left their job.

65
0:03:46.506,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And after we published these results, two things happened.

66
0:03:50.201,000 --> 0:03:52,000
One, we got calls from organizations.

67
0:03:53.503,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Cisco read about these numbers,

68
0:03:55.305,000 --> 0:03:59,000
took just a few of these and estimated, conservatively,

69
0:03:59.873,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that incivility was costing them 12 million dollars a year.

70
0:04:03.961,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The second thing that happened was, we heard from others in our academic field

71
0:04:08.725,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who said, "Well, people are reporting this, but how can you really show it?

72
0:04:13.393,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Does people's performance really suffer?"

73
0:04:16.711,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I was curious about that, too.

74
0:04:19.046,000 --> 0:04:23,000
With Amir Erez, I compared those that experienced incivility

75
0:04:23.312,000 --> 0:04:25,000
to those that didn't experience incivility.

76
0:04:26.112,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And what we found is that those that experience incivility

77
0:04:29.815,000 --> 0:04:31,000
do actually function much worse.

78
0:04:33.571,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"OK," you may say. "This makes sense.

79
0:04:36.007,000 --> 0:04:39,000
After all, it's natural that their performance suffers."

80
0:04:40.394,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But what about if you're not the one who experiences it?

81
0:04:44.202,000 --> 0:04:46,000
What if you just see or hear it?

82
0:04:46.855,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You're a witness.

83
0:04:48.38,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We wondered if it affected witnesses, too.

84
0:04:51.809,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So we conducted studies

85
0:04:53.104,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where five participants would witness an experimenter act rudely

86
0:04:56.725,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to someone who arrived late to the study.

87
0:04:59.678,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The experimenter said, "What is it with you?

88
0:05:02.406,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You arrive late, you're irresponsible.

89
0:05:04.708,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Look at you! How do you expect to hold a job in the real world?"

90
0:05:09.008,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And in another study in a small group,

91
0:05:11.293,000 --> 0:05:14,000
we tested the effects of a peer insulting a group member.

92
0:05:15.442,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now, what we found was really interesting,

93
0:05:17.849,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because witnesses' performance decreased, too --

94
0:05:20.541,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and not just marginally, quite significantly.

95
0:05:26.159,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Incivility is a bug.

96
0:05:28.576,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's contagious,

97
0:05:30.221,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and we become carriers of it just by being around it.

98
0:05:34.525,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And this isn't confined to the workplace.

99
0:05:37.136,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We can catch this virus anywhere --

100
0:05:39.681,000 --> 0:05:43,000
at home, online, in schools and in our communities.

101
0:05:45.069,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It affects our emotions, our motivation, our performance

102
0:05:49.612,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and how we treat others.

103
0:05:51.531,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It even affects our attention and can take some of our brainpower.

104
0:05:56.283,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And this happens not only if we experience incivility

105
0:05:59.883,000 --> 0:06:,000
or we witness it.

106
0:06:01.452,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It can happen even if we just see or read rude words.

107
0:06:06.029,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Let me give you an example of what I mean.

108
0:06:09.424,000 --> 0:06:12,000
To test this, we gave people combinations of words

109
0:06:12.547,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to use to make a sentence.

110
0:06:14.591,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But we were very sneaky.

111
0:06:16.85,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Half the participants got a list with 15 words used to trigger rudeness:

112
0:06:22.357,000 --> 0:06:26,000
impolitely, interrupt, obnoxious, bother.

113
0:06:27.414,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Half the participants received a list of words

114
0:06:30.153,000 --> 0:06:32,000
with none of these rude triggers.

115
0:06:32.95,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And what we found was really surprising,

116
0:06:35.738,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because the people who got the rude words

117
0:06:38.162,000 --> 0:06:42,000
were five times more likely to miss information right in front of them

118
0:06:42.497,000 --> 0:06:43,000
on the computer screen.

119
0:06:44.671,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And as we continued this research,

120
0:06:46.765,000 --> 0:06:49,000
what we found is that those that read the rude words

121
0:06:50.145,000 --> 0:06:51,000
took longer to make decisions,

122
0:06:52.129,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to record their decisions,

123
0:06:53.897,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and they made significantly more errors.

124
0:06:57.263,000 --> 0:06:58,000
This can be a big deal,

125
0:06:58.999,000 --> 0:07:01,000
especially when it comes to life-and-death situations.

126
0:07:02.887,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Steve, a physician, told me about a doctor that he worked with

127
0:07:06.67,000 --> 0:07:07,000
who was never very respectful,

128
0:07:08.42,000 --> 0:07:1,000
especially to junior staff and nurses.

129
0:07:11.381,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But Steve told me about this one particular interaction

130
0:07:14.808,000 --> 0:07:16,000
where this doctor shouted at a medical team.

131
0:07:18.544,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Right after the interaction,

132
0:07:20.361,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the team gave the wrong dosage of medication to their patient.

133
0:07:25.289,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Steve said the information was right there on the chart,

134
0:07:29.144,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but somehow everyone on the team missed it.

135
0:07:33.307,000 --> 0:07:36,000
He said they lacked the attention or awareness to take it into account.

136
0:07:37.698,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Simple mistake, right?

137
0:07:39.803,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Well, that patient died.

138
0:07:42.462,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Researchers in Israel have actually shown

139
0:07:45.664,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that medical teams exposed to rudeness

140
0:07:48.173,000 --> 0:07:51,000
perform worse not only in all their diagnostics,

141
0:07:51.63,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but in all the procedures they did.

142
0:07:54.607,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This was mainly because the teams exposed to rudeness

143
0:07:57.799,000 --> 0:07:59,000
didn't share information as readily,

144
0:08:00.251,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and they stopped seeking help from their teammates.

145
0:08:03.128,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And I see this not only in medicine but in all industries.

146
0:08:08.581,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So if incivility has such a huge cost,

147
0:08:11.659,000 --> 0:08:13,000
why do we still see so much of it?

148
0:08:14.636,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was curious, so we surveyed people about this, too.

149
0:08:18.068,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The number one reason is stress.

150
0:08:20.958,000 --> 0:08:21,000
People feel overwhelmed.

151
0:08:23.849,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The other reason that people are not more civil

152
0:08:26.552,000 --> 0:08:28,000
is because they're skeptical and even concerned

153
0:08:29.35,000 --> 0:08:31,000
about being civil or appearing nice.

154
0:08:32.004,000 --> 0:08:34,000
They believe they'll appear less leader-like.

155
0:08:34.551,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They wonder: Do nice guys finish last?

156
0:08:38.042,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Or in other words: Do jerks get ahead?

157
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Laughter)

158
0:08:43.088,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's easy to think so,

159
0:08:44.6,000 --> 0:08:46,000
especially when we see a few prominent examples

160
0:08:47.549,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that dominate the conversation.

161
0:08:50.466,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Well, it turns out, in the long run, they don't.

162
0:08:54.063,000 --> 0:08:57,000
There's really rich research on this by Morgan McCall and Michael Lombardo

163
0:08:58.063,000 --> 0:09:,000
when they were at the Center for Creative Leadership.

164
0:09:00.726,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They found that the number one reason tied to executive failure

165
0:09:05.559,000 --> 0:09:08,000
was an insensitive, abrasive or bullying style.

166
0:09:10.428,000 --> 0:09:14,000
There will always be some outliers that succeed despite their incivility.

167
0:09:14.818,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Sooner or later, though,

168
0:09:16.405,000 --> 0:09:19,000
most uncivil people sabotage their success.

169
0:09:20.217,000 --> 0:09:21,000
For example, with uncivil executives,

170
0:09:22.234,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it comes back to hurt them when they're in a place of weakness

171
0:09:25.306,000 --> 0:09:26,000
or they need something.

172
0:09:26.747,000 --> 0:09:27,000
People won't have their backs.

173
0:09:29.795,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But what about nice guys?

174
0:09:31.74,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Does civility pay?

175
0:09:33.413,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Yes, it does.

176
0:09:35.853,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And being civil doesn't just mean that you're not a jerk.

177
0:09:40.288,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Not holding someone down isn't the same as lifting them up.

178
0:09:44.605,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Being truly civil means doing the small things,

179
0:09:47.864,000 --> 0:09:5,000
like smiling and saying hello in the hallway,

180
0:09:50.938,000 --> 0:09:52,000
listening fully when someone's speaking to you.

181
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Now, you can have strong opinions,

182
0:09:56.315,000 --> 0:10:01,000
disagree, have conflict or give negative feedback civilly,

183
0:10:01.358,000 --> 0:10:02,000
with respect.

184
0:10:02.87,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Some people call it "radical candor,"

185
0:10:05.306,000 --> 0:10:06,000
where you care personally,

186
0:10:06.818,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but you challenge directly.

187
0:10:09.612,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So yes, civility pays.

188
0:10:12.474,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In a biotechnology firm, colleagues and I found

189
0:10:15.393,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that those that were seen as civil

190
0:10:17.492,000 --> 0:10:19,000
were twice as likely to be viewed as leaders,

191
0:10:20.153,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and they performed significantly better.

192
0:10:23.066,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Why does civility pay?

193
0:10:25.067,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Because people see you as an important -- and a powerful --

194
0:10:29.839,000 --> 0:10:32,000
unique combination of two key characteristics:

195
0:10:33.566,000 --> 0:10:36,000
warm and competent, friendly and smart.

196
0:10:37.184,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In other words, being civil isn't just about motivating others.

197
0:10:41.708,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's about you.

198
0:10:43.643,000 --> 0:10:46,000
If you're civil, you're more likely to be seen as a leader.

199
0:10:47.174,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You'll perform better, and you're seen as warm and competent.

200
0:10:51.722,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But there's an even bigger story about how civility pays,

201
0:10:55.454,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and it ties to one of the most important questions around leadership:

202
0:11:00.234,000 --> 0:11:02,000
What do people want most from their leaders?

203
0:11:03.993,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We took data from over 20,000 employees around the world,

204
0:11:07.73,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and we found the answer was simple:

205
0:11:10.933,000 --> 0:11:11,000
respect.

206
0:11:12.711,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Being treated with respect was more important

207
0:11:15.941,000 --> 0:11:17,000
than recognition and appreciation,

208
0:11:18.461,000 --> 0:11:19,000
useful feedback,

209
0:11:20.04,000 --> 0:11:21,000
even opportunities for learning.

210
0:11:22.675,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Those that felt respected were healthier,

211
0:11:26.406,000 --> 0:11:27,000
more focused,

212
0:11:27.805,000 --> 0:11:29,000
more likely to stay with their organization

213
0:11:30.335,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and far more engaged.

214
0:11:34.123,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So where do you start?

215
0:11:36.219,000 --> 0:11:39,000
How can you lift people up and make people feel respected?

216
0:11:40.411,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Well, the nice thing is, it doesn't require a huge shift.

217
0:11:43.977,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Small things can make a big difference.

218
0:11:47.108,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I found that thanking people,

219
0:11:49.79,000 --> 0:11:5,000
sharing credit,

220
0:11:51.28,000 --> 0:11:52,000
listening attentively,

221
0:11:53.663,000 --> 0:11:55,000
humbly asking questions,

222
0:11:56.116,000 --> 0:11:58,000
acknowledging others and smiling

223
0:11:58.855,000 --> 0:11:59,000
has an impact.

224
0:12:01.497,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Patrick Quinlan, former CEO of Ochsner Health [System],

225
0:12:05.256,000 --> 0:12:07,000
told me about the effects of their 10-5 way,

226
0:12:08.137,000 --> 0:12:1,000
where if you're within 10 feet of someone,

227
0:12:10.419,000 --> 0:12:12,000
you make eye contact and smile,

228
0:12:13.093,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and if you're within five feet,

229
0:12:14.789,000 --> 0:12:15,000
you say hello.

230
0:12:16.721,000 --> 0:12:18,000
He explained that civility spread,

231
0:12:19.405,000 --> 0:12:21,000
patient satisfaction scores rose,

232
0:12:21.835,000 --> 0:12:22,000
as did patient referrals.

233
0:12:24.916,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Civility and respect can be used to boost an organization's performance.

234
0:12:29.808,000 --> 0:12:34,000
When my friend Doug Conant took over as CEO of Campbell's Soup Company in 2001,

235
0:12:35.58,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the company's market share had just dropped in half.

236
0:12:38.531,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Sales were declining,

237
0:12:40.23,000 --> 0:12:42,000
lots of people had just been laid off.

238
0:12:42.863,000 --> 0:12:45,000
A Gallup manager said it was the least engaged organization

239
0:12:46.711,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that they had surveyed.

240
0:12:48.969,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And as Doug drove up to work his first day,

241
0:12:51.918,000 --> 0:12:54,000
he noticed that the headquarters was surrounded by barbwire fence.

242
0:12:56.313,000 --> 0:12:58,000
There were guard towers in the parking lot.

243
0:12:59.775,000 --> 0:13:02,000
He said it looked like a minimum security prison.

244
0:13:03.436,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It felt toxic.

245
0:13:06.771,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Within five years, Doug had turned things around.

246
0:13:10.182,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And within nine years, they were setting all-time performance records

247
0:13:13.764,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and racking up awards, including best place to work.

248
0:13:17.449,000 --> 0:13:18,000
How did he do it?

249
0:13:19.416,000 --> 0:13:21,000
On day one, Doug told employees

250
0:13:21.867,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that he was going to have high standards for performance,

251
0:13:24.558,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but they were going to do it with civility.

252
0:13:26.667,000 --> 0:13:29,000
He walked the talk, and he expected his leaders to.

253
0:13:30.805,000 --> 0:13:34,000
For Doug, it all came down to being tough-minded on standards

254
0:13:35.544,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and tenderhearted with people.

255
0:13:38.119,000 --> 0:13:41,000
For him, he said it was all about these touch points,

256
0:13:41.356,000 --> 0:13:44,000
or these daily interactions he had with employees,

257
0:13:44.587,000 --> 0:13:47,000
whether in the hallway, in the cafeteria or in meetings.

258
0:13:49.064,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And if he handled each touch point well,

259
0:13:51.766,000 --> 0:13:53,000
he'd make employees feel valued.

260
0:13:55.089,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Another way that Doug made employees feel valued

261
0:13:58.628,000 --> 0:14:,000
and showed them that he was paying attention

262
0:14:01.048,000 --> 0:14:06,000
is that he handwrote over 30,000 thank-you notes to employees.

263
0:14:06.949,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And this set an example for other leaders.

264
0:14:10.456,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Leaders have about 400 of these touch points a day.

265
0:14:14.165,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Most don't take long, less than two minutes each.

266
0:14:17.537,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The key is to be agile and mindful in each of these moments.

267
0:14:22.933,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Civility lifts people.

268
0:14:25.179,000 --> 0:14:28,000
We'll get people to give more and function at their best

269
0:14:28.688,000 --> 0:14:29,000
if we're civil.

270
0:14:30.528,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Incivility chips away at people and their performance.

271
0:14:33.699,000 --> 0:14:35,000
It robs people of their potential,

272
0:14:35.984,000 --> 0:14:37,000
even if they're just working around it.

273
0:14:39.001,000 --> 0:14:43,000
What I know from my research is that when we have more civil environments,

274
0:14:43.313,000 --> 0:14:48,000
we're more productive, creative, helpful, happy and healthy.

275
0:14:49.428,000 --> 0:14:5,000
We can do better.

276
0:14:51.479,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Each one of us can be more mindful

277
0:14:54.511,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and can take actions to lift others up around us,

278
0:14:58.105,000 --> 0:15:01,000
at work, at home, online,

279
0:15:01.417,000 --> 0:15:02,000
in schools

280
0:15:02.605,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and in our communities.

281
0:15:04.943,000 --> 0:15:06,000
In every interaction, think:

282
0:15:07.829,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Who do you want to be?

283
0:15:10.419,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Let's put an end to incivility bug

284
0:15:12.956,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and start spreading civility.

285
0:15:15.404,000 --> 0:15:17,000
After all, it pays.

286
0:15:18.219,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Thank you.

287
0:15:19.408,000 --> 0:15:21,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.162,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When I was young, I prided myself as a nonconformist

2
0:00:17.704,000 --> 0:00:21,000
in the conservative U.S. state I live in, Kansas.

3
0:00:22.429,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I didn't follow along with the crowd.

4
0:00:24.742,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I wasn't afraid to try weird clothing trends or hairstyles.

5
0:00:28.173,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was outspoken and extremely social.

6
0:00:31.762,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Even these pictures and postcards of my London semester abroad 16 years ago

7
0:00:38.093,000 --> 0:00:44,000
show that I obviously didn't care if I was perceived as weird or different.

8
0:00:44.097,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:46.681,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But that same year I was in London, 16 years ago,

10
0:00:51.29,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I realized something about myself that actually was somewhat unique,

11
0:00:56.699,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and that changed everything.

12
0:01:01.169,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I became the opposite of who I thought I once was.

13
0:01:05.079,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I stayed in my room instead of socializing.

14
0:01:08.005,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I stopped engaging in clubs and leadership activities.

15
0:01:12.385,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I didn't want to stand out in the crowd anymore.

16
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I told myself it was because I was growing up and maturing,

17
0:01:20.325,000 --> 0:01:23,000
not that I was suddenly looking for acceptance.

18
0:01:23.559,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I had always assumed I was immune to needing acceptance.

19
0:01:26.58,000 --> 0:01:28,000
After all, I was a bit unconventional.

20
0:01:29.814,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But I realize now

21
0:01:31.351,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that the moment I realized something was different about me

22
0:01:35.516,000 --> 0:01:4,000
was the exact same moment that I began conforming and hiding.

23
0:01:41.728,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Hiding is a progressive habit,

24
0:01:44.2,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and once you start hiding,

25
0:01:45.948,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it becomes harder and harder to step forward and speak out.

26
0:01:51.888,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In fact, even now,

27
0:01:53.822,000 --> 0:01:56,000
when I was talking to people about what this talk was about,

28
0:01:57.697,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I made up a cover story

29
0:01:59.533,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and I even hid the truth about my TED Talk.

30
0:02:04.388,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So it is fitting and scary

31
0:02:09.329,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that I have returned to this city 16 years later

32
0:02:13.519,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I have chosen this stage to finally stop hiding.

33
0:02:20.093,000 --> 0:02:24,000
What have I been hiding for 16 years?

34
0:02:26.205,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I am a lesbian.

35
0:02:29.602,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Applause)

36
0:02:45.513,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Thank you.

37
0:02:48.038,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I've struggled to say those words,

38
0:02:50.397,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because I didn't want to be defined by them.

39
0:02:53.573,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Every time I would think about coming out in the past,

40
0:02:56.202,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I would think to myself, but I just want to be known as Morgana,

41
0:03:01.266,000 --> 0:03:03,000
uniquely Morgana,

42
0:03:03.43,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but not "my lesbian friend Morgana," or "my gay coworker Morgana."

43
0:03:08.439,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Just Morgana.

44
0:03:10.893,000 --> 0:03:13,000
For those of you from large metropolitan areas,

45
0:03:14.302,000 --> 0:03:16,000
this may not seem like a big deal to you.

46
0:03:16.895,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It may seem strange that I have suppressed the truth

47
0:03:19.839,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and hidden this for so long.

48
0:03:23.035,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But I was paralyzed by my fear of not being accepted.

49
0:03:28.818,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I'm not alone, of course.

50
0:03:31.459,000 --> 0:03:35,000
A 2013 Deloitte study found that a surprisingly large number of people

51
0:03:36.308,000 --> 0:03:38,000
hide aspects of their identity.

52
0:03:39.078,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Of all the employees they surveyed,

53
0:03:41.949,000 --> 0:03:46,000
61 percent reported changing an aspect of their behavior or their appearance

54
0:03:47.568,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in order to fit in at work.

55
0:03:49.841,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Of all the gay, lesbian and bisexual employees,

56
0:03:54.47,000 --> 0:03:58,000
83 percent admitted to changing some aspects of themselves

57
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
so they would not appear at work "too gay."

58
0:04:04.417,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The study found that even in companies

59
0:04:07.34,000 --> 0:04:1,000
with diversity policies and inclusion programs,

60
0:04:11.253,000 --> 0:04:13,000
employees struggle to be themselves at work

61
0:04:14.006,000 --> 0:04:16,000
because they believe conformity is critical

62
0:04:16.989,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to their long-term career advancement.

63
0:04:20.496,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And while I was surprised that so many people just like me

64
0:04:25.438,000 --> 0:04:28,000
waste so much energy trying to hide themselves,

65
0:04:29.231,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I was scared when I discovered that my silence

66
0:04:33.122,000 --> 0:04:39,000
has life-or-death consequences and long-term social repercussions.

67
0:04:41.117,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Twelve years:

68
0:04:43.308,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the length by which life expectancy is shortened

69
0:04:46.979,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for gay, lesbian and bisexual people in highly anti-gay communities

70
0:04:53.017,000 --> 0:04:55,000
compared to accepting communities.

71
0:04:56.603,000 --> 0:05:,000
Twelve years reduced life expectancy.

72
0:05:01.301,000 --> 0:05:04,000
When I read that in The Advocate magazine this year,

73
0:05:04.429,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I realized I could no longer afford to keep silent.

74
0:05:08.904,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The effects of personal stress and social stigmas are a deadly combination.

75
0:05:16.692,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The study found that gays in anti-gay communities

76
0:05:19.963,000 --> 0:05:24,000
had higher rates of heart disease, violence and suicide.

77
0:05:25.71,000 --> 0:05:28,000
What I once thought was simply a personal matter

78
0:05:29.04,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I realized had a ripple effect

79
0:05:31.226,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that went into the workplace and out into the community

80
0:05:33.82,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for every story just like mine.

81
0:05:37.185,000 --> 0:05:4,000
My choice to hide and not share who I really am

82
0:05:41.005,000 --> 0:05:45,000
may have inadvertently contributed to this exact same environment

83
0:05:45.048,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and atmosphere of discrimination.

84
0:05:48.192,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I'd always told myself there's no reason to share that I was gay,

85
0:05:53.592,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but the idea that my silence has social consequences

86
0:05:57.809,000 --> 0:06:01,000
was really driven home this year when I missed an opportunity

87
0:06:02.669,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to change the atmosphere of discrimination in my own home state of Kansas.

88
0:06:08.421,000 --> 0:06:13,000
In February, the Kansas House of Representatives brought up a bill for vote

89
0:06:13.623,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that would have essentially allowed businesses

90
0:06:16.147,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to use religious freedom as a reason to deny gays services.

91
0:06:25.063,000 --> 0:06:28,000
A former coworker and friend of mine

92
0:06:28.245,000 --> 0:06:32,000
has a father who serves in the Kansas House of Representatives.

93
0:06:33.068,000 --> 0:06:38,000
He voted in favor of the bill,

94
0:06:38.253,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in favor of a law that would allow businesses to not serve me.

95
0:06:46.647,000 --> 0:06:47,000
How does my friend feel

96
0:06:48.436,000 --> 0:06:53,000
about lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning people?

97
0:06:53.922,000 --> 0:06:55,000
How does her father feel?

98
0:06:56.611,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I don't know, because I was never honest with them about who I am.

99
0:07:02.499,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And that shakes me to the core.

100
0:07:05.773,000 --> 0:07:08,000
What if I had told her my story years ago?

101
0:07:09.204,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Could she have told her father my experience?

102
0:07:11.853,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Could I have ultimately helped change his vote?

103
0:07:16.885,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I will never know,

104
0:07:19.348,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and that made me realize I had done nothing

105
0:07:23.48,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to try to make a difference.

106
0:07:27.053,000 --> 0:07:31,000
How ironic that I work in human resources,

107
0:07:31.074,000 --> 0:07:33,000
a profession that works to welcome,

108
0:07:33.512,000 --> 0:07:36,000
connect and encourage the development of employees,

109
0:07:37.097,000 --> 0:07:4,000
a profession that advocates that the diversity of society

110
0:07:40.339,000 --> 0:07:42,000
should be reflected in the workplace,

111
0:07:43.004,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and yet I have done nothing to advocate for diversity.

112
0:07:48.779,000 --> 0:07:5,000
When I came to this company one year ago,

113
0:07:51.649,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I thought to myself, this company has anti-discrimination policies

114
0:07:56.724,000 --> 0:08:,000
that protect gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people.

115
0:08:00.777,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Their commitment to diversity is evident through their global inclusion programs.

116
0:08:06.483,000 --> 0:08:11,000
When I walk through the doors of this company, I will finally come out.

117
0:08:12.551,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But I didn't.

118
0:08:14.54,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity,

119
0:08:18.25,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I did nothing.

120
0:08:31.838,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Applause)

121
0:08:39.737,000 --> 0:08:42,000
When I was looking through my London journal and scrapbook

122
0:08:43.652,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from my London semester abroad 16 years ago,

123
0:08:46.902,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I came across this modified quote from Toni Morrison's book, "Paradise."

124
0:08:53.547,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"There are more scary things inside than outside."

125
0:08:57.841,000 --> 0:09:,000
And then I wrote a note to myself at the bottom:

126
0:09:01.099,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"Remember this."

127
0:09:03.983,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I'm sure I was trying to encourage myself to get out and explore London,

128
0:09:08.685,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but the message I missed was the need to start exploring and embracing myself.

129
0:09:15.762,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What I didn't realize until all these years later

130
0:09:19.465,000 --> 0:09:23,000
is that the biggest obstacles I will ever have to overcome

131
0:09:24.371,000 --> 0:09:28,000
are my own fears and insecurities.

132
0:09:28.438,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I believe that by facing my fears inside, I will be able to change reality outside.

133
0:09:37.498,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I made a choice today

134
0:09:39.791,000 --> 0:09:45,000
to reveal a part of myself that I have hidden for too long.

135
0:09:46.333,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I hope that this means I will never hide again,

136
0:09:50.644,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and I hope that by coming out today, I can do something to change the data

137
0:09:57.492,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and also to help others who feel different be more themselves and more fulfilled

138
0:10:03.903,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in both their professional and personal lives.

139
0:10:08.394,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Thank you.

140
0:10:11.147,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Applause)

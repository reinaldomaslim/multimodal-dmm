Nicole Paris: TEDYouth, make some noise!

2
0:00:14.738,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Beatboxing)

3
0:00:16.643,000 --> 0:00:17,000
TEDYouth, make some --

4
0:00:18.168,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Beatboxing)

5
0:00:40.216,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Beatboxing ends)

6
0:00:43.199,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Are you ready?

7
0:00:44.377,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Cheers and applause)

8
0:00:45.655,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Are you ready?

9
0:00:47.956,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Ed Cage: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

10
0:00:49.38,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Beatboxing)

11
0:00:55.357,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:57.596,000 --> 0:00:59,000
EC: Y'all like that? Let me show you how we used to do it --

13
0:01:00.438,000 --> 0:01:01,000
NP: Get it pops, go ahead.

14
0:01:01.715,000 --> 0:01:03,000
EC: ... when I was growing up in the '90s.

15
0:01:04.107,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Beatboxing)

16
0:01:09.815,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Beatboxing ends)

17
0:01:12.555,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:14.432,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Beatboxing)

19
0:01:27.912,000 --> 0:01:28,000
NP: Pops, pops, pops, pops, pops, pops,

20
0:01:29.849,000 --> 0:01:3,000
hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up!

21
0:01:31.866,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Oh my God.

22
0:01:34.151,000 --> 0:01:35,000
OK, he's trying to battle me.

23
0:01:35.716,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Hold on, right now, hold on.

24
0:01:37.882,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Do you remember when you used to beatbox me to sleep?

25
0:01:41.895,000 --> 0:01:42,000
EC: Yeah, yeah, I remember.

26
0:01:43.348,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That's when she was a little baby.

27
0:01:45.925,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We would do something like this.

28
0:01:47.491,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Beatboxing)

29
0:01:56.273,000 --> 0:01:57,000
NP: I remember that.

30
0:01:57.744,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Beatboxing)

31
0:02:08.008,000 --> 0:02:1,000
NP: All right, pops, pops, pops, chill out, chill out.

32
0:02:10.785,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

33
0:02:12.297,000 --> 0:02:13,000
EC: Y'all remember the video.

34
0:02:13.71,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is like a little payback or something

35
0:02:15.914,000 --> 0:02:17,000
for 50 million people calling me the loser.

36
0:02:18.437,000 --> 0:02:19,000
NP: Hold up, hold up.

37
0:02:19.819,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But a lot of people out there don't really know what beatboxing is,

38
0:02:23.002,000 --> 0:02:24,000
where it started from.

39
0:02:24.549,000 --> 0:02:25,000
EC: Right, right.

40
0:02:25.724,000 --> 0:02:26,000
NP: Where it came from.

41
0:02:26.941,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So why don't you give them a little history --

42
0:02:29.322,000 --> 0:02:31,000
just a tickle -- a bit of history of where it comes from.

43
0:02:32.037,000 --> 0:02:33,000
EC: Beatbox started here in New York.

44
0:02:33.918,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Cheers)

45
0:02:35.093,000 --> 0:02:38,000
That's right, that's right. New York, New York!

46
0:02:38.604,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Everybody like, "Yeah!"

47
0:02:40.255,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Well, we from St. Louis.

48
0:02:41.769,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:42.811,000 --> 0:02:44,000
NP: Now you can put y'all hands down.

50
0:02:44.955,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:46.278,000 --> 0:02:47,000
EC: But beatbox started here in New York.

52
0:02:48.279,000 --> 0:02:5,000
What you would have is that, when we would go to parties,

53
0:02:50.994,000 --> 0:02:52,000
you would have the DJ and you would have the rapper.

54
0:02:53.494,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But because I don't have electricity coming out of me,

55
0:02:56.261,000 --> 0:02:59,000
we had to emulate what the beats was doing.

56
0:02:59.41,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So when you would see the beatboxer,

57
0:03:02.027,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you would see us over to the side.

58
0:03:03.987,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Then you would see a rapper, and when the rapper began to rap,

59
0:03:06.937,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we would do a simple beat,

60
0:03:08.215,000 --> 0:03:1,000
because back then the beats were simple --

61
0:03:10.261,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Beatboxing)

62
0:03:15.146,000 --> 0:03:16,000
or --

63
0:03:16.321,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Beatboxing)

64
0:03:22.041,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Those were simple beats.

65
0:03:23.892,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But now, you got folks that want to do all type of stuff

66
0:03:28.318,000 --> 0:03:29,000
with their beats now,

67
0:03:29.559,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and they want to humiliate their father,

68
0:03:31.972,000 --> 0:03:34,000
which is not right when you want to humiliate the person

69
0:03:35.246,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that take care of you, pay all your tuition, (Nicole laughs)

70
0:03:38.136,000 --> 0:03:4,000
especially when you have 50 million people

71
0:03:40.547,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that just go around and call you "the loser."

72
0:03:42.688,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Well, I'm taking that to heart.

73
0:03:44.617,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But now we do something different in our house,

74
0:03:46.849,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so we have these jam sessions,

75
0:03:48.774,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and our jam sessions consist of us jamming in church.

76
0:03:53.032,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You know, in church, we'll look at each other like,

77
0:03:55.489,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Beatboxing)

78
0:03:56.664,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:57.689,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and we'll text the beat to each other.

80
0:04:00.018,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Or we'll be in the kitchen cooking,

81
0:04:02.411,000 --> 0:04:03,000
road trips, airports.

82
0:04:04.69,000 --> 0:04:07,000
NP: Standing right there in the corner, "Aw, Dad -- listen to that."

83
0:04:07.988,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Beatboxing)

84
0:04:09.2,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Naw, I'm kidding. But you know what?

85
0:04:11.852,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We're talking all about this jam session and everything.

86
0:04:15.079,000 --> 0:04:16,000
EC: Yeah.

87
0:04:16.253,000 --> 0:04:2,000
NP: Why don't we give them a little peek, just a tiny bit of our jam session?

88
0:04:20.774,000 --> 0:04:23,000
NP: Y'all want to hear some jam session? EC: Y'all ready for a jam session?

89
0:04:24.34,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Cheers)

90
0:04:25.365,000 --> 0:04:26,000
NP: Sorry? I can't hear you.

91
0:04:26.734,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Cheers)

92
0:04:27.759,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Yeah! Kick it, pops!

93
0:04:28.934,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Beatboxing)

94
0:05:30.382,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Applause)

95
0:05:33.864,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Beatboxing)

96
0:06:02.265,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Beatboxing ends)

97
0:06:04.958,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Applause)

98
0:06:09.263,000 --> 0:06:1,000
NP: I'm getting ready to go!

99
0:06:10.645,000 --> 0:06:13,000
EC: Y'all ready? Everybody stand up! Come on, everybody stand up!

100
0:06:13.776,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Get on up! Come on, stretch!

101
0:06:16.494,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Beatboxing)

102
0:06:46.61,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Beatboxing ends)

103
0:06:48.74,000 --> 0:06:49,000
NP: That's it.

104
0:06:49.917,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Cheers and applause)

105
0:06:53.063,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Thank you! Make some noise!

106
0:06:54.39,000 --> 0:06:55,000
EG: Thank you, everybody!

107
0:06:55.612,000 --> 0:06:56,000
NP: Make some noise! Make some noise!

108
0:06:57.516,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Thank you!

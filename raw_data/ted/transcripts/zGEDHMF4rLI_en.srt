1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm here today, as June said,

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to talk about a project

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We're crocheting a coral reef.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And it's a project that we've actually

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
been now joined by hundreds of people around the world,

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
have actually been involved in this project,

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in many of its different aspects.

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's a project that now reaches across three continents,

11
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and its roots go into the fields of mathematics,

12
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
marine biology, feminine handicraft

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and environmental activism.

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's true.

15
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's also a project

16
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that in a very beautiful way,

17
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the development of this

18
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth,

19
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying

20
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
right here in February 2009 --

21
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which, as one of our previous speakers told us,

22
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is the 200th anniversary

23
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
of the birth of Charles Darwin.

24
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
All of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope.

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But let me first begin by showing you

26
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
some pictures of what this thing looks like.

27
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Just to give you an idea of scale,

28
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that installation there is about six feet across,

29
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.

30
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is some more images of it.

31
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
That one on the right is about five feet high.

32
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models.

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people

34
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
have contributed all over the world as part of this.

35
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The totality of this project

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
involves tens of thousands of hours

37
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
of human labor --

38
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
99 percent of it done by women.

39
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
On the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation

40
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that is about 12 feet long.

41
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
My sister and I started this project in 2005

42
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because in that year, at least in the science press,

43
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
there was a lot of talk about global warming,

44
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.

45
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Corals are very delicate organisms,

46
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.

47
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It causes these vast bleaching events

48
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that are the first signs of corals of being sick.

49
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And if the bleaching doesn't go away --

50
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
if the temperatures don't go down -- reefs start to die.

51
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef,

52
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
particularly in coral reefs all over the world.

53
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.

54
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring,

55
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
which is a little organization we started

56
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to promote, to do projects about the

57
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.

58
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site,

59
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
asking for people to join us in this enterprise.

60
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
To our surprise, one of the first people who called

61
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
was the Andy Warhol Museum.

62
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And they said they were having an exhibition

63
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
about artists' response to global warming,

64
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.

65
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it,

66
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you can have a little bit of it."

67
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So in 2007 we had an exhibition,

68
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a small exhibition of this crochet reef.

69
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And then some people in Chicago came along and they said,

70
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is

71
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
global warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery

72
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and we want you to fill it with your reef."

73
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."

74
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now I say "naively" because actually

75
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
my profession is as a science writer.

76
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.

77
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I've written books about the history of space,

78
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the history of physics and religion,

79
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.

80
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.

81
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So I said yes to this proposition.

82
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And I went home, and I told my sister Christine.

83
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And she nearly had a fit

84
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because Christine is a professor at one of

85
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
L.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts,

86
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.

87
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
She thought I'd gone off my head.

88
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But she went into crochet overdrive.

89
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And to cut a long story short, eight months later

90
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's

91
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
3,000 square foot gallery.

92
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
By this stage the project had taken on

93
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a viral dimension of its own,

94
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
which got completely beyond us.

95
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The people in Chicago decided

96
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do

97
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
was have the local people there make a reef.

98
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.

99
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.

100
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And it was exhibited alongside ours.

101
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
There were hundreds of people involved in that.

102
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We got invited to do the whole thing

103
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in New York, and in London,

104
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and in Los Angeles.

105
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
In each of these cities, the local citizens,

106
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
hundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.

107
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And more and more people get involved in this,

108
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
most of whom we've never met.

109
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So the whole thing has sort of morphed

110
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
into this organic, ever-evolving creature,

111
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.

112
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now some of you are sitting here thinking,

113
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"What planet are these people on?

114
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef?

115
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly

116
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
two concepts that go together.

117
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?

118
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Cast it in bronze."

119
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
But it turns out there is a very good reason

120
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
why we are crocheting it

121
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because many organisms in coral reefs

122
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
have a very particular kind of structure.

123
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The frilly crenulated forms that you see

124
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs,

125
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.

126
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And the only way that mathematicians know

127
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
how to model this structure

128
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is with crochet. It happens to be a fact.

129
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way,

130
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and it's almost impossible to do it on computers.

131
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So what is this hyperbolic geometry

132
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that corals and sea slugs embody?

133
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up

134
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to the level of a sea slug.

135
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Laughter)

136
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics

137
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
when it was first discovered in the 19th century.

138
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand

139
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
how they could model it.

140
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In 1997 a mathematician

141
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
at Cornell, Daina Taimina,

142
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
made the discovery that this structure

143
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
could actually be done in knitting and crochet.

144
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The first one she did was knitting.

145
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized

146
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
crochet was the better thing.

147
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But what she was doing was actually making a model

148
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians

149
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
had thought it was actually impossible to model.

150
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And indeed they thought that anything like this structure

151
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
was impossible per se.

152
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years

153
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
trying to prove that this structure was impossible.

154
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?

155
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Before hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew

156
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
about two kinds of space:

157
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Euclidean space, and spherical space.

158
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And they have different properties.

159
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.

160
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.

161
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.

162
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And what they do is, they do it through the concept

163
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of parallel lines.

164
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So here we have a line and a point outside the line.

165
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?

166
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I ask the question, how many lines can I draw through

167
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the point but never meet the original line?"

168
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?

169
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
One. Great. Okay.

170
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That's our definition of a parallel line.

171
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's a definition really of Euclidean space.

172
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But there is another possibility that you all know of:

173
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
spherical space.

174
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Think of the surface of a sphere --

175
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.

176
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I have a straight line on my spherical surface.

177
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines

178
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
can I draw through the point

179
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
but never meet the original line?

180
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
What do we mean to talk about

181
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
a straight line on a curved surface?

182
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now mathematicians have answered that question.

183
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
They've understood there is a generalized concept

184
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of straightness, it's called a geodesic.

185
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And on the surface of a sphere,

186
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.

187
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.

188
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So we ask the question again,

189
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"How many straight lines can I draw through the point,

190
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but never meet the original line?"

191
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Does someone want to guess?

192
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Zero. Very good.

193
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative.

194
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far,

195
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Zero and one.

196
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Two answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.

197
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
To a mathematician if there are two answers,

198
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and the first two are zero and one,

199
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
there is another number that immediately suggests itself

200
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
as the third alternative.

201
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Does anyone want to guess what it is?

202
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly.

203
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
There is, there's a third alternative.

204
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This is what it looks like.

205
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
There's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines

206
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
that go through the point and never meet the original line.

207
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is the drawing.

208
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers

209
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.

210
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Thinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.

211
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a

212
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
flat surface.

213
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Mathematicians for several hundred years

214
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
had to really struggle with this.

215
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
How could they see this?

216
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
What did it mean to actually have a physical model

217
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that looked like this?

218
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.

219
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Then our mathematicians come along

220
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and said, "There's this thing called a sphere,

221
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the lines come together at the north and south pole."

222
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But you don't know what a sphere looks like.

223
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And someone that comes along and says, "Look here's a ball."

224
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.

225
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I can touch it. I can play with it."

226
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And that's exactly what happened

227
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
when Daina Taimina

228
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
in 1997, showed that you could crochet models

229
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in hyperbolic space.

230
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Here is this diagram in crochetness.

231
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.

232
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And the lines look curved.

233
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But look, I can prove to you that they're straight

234
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because I can take any one of these lines,

235
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and I can fold along it.

236
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And it's a straight line.

237
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So here, in wool,

238
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
through a domestic feminine art,

239
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
is the proof that the most famous postulate

240
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in mathematics is wrong.

241
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Applause)

242
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical

243
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
theorems onto these surfaces.

244
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics

245
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that is called non-Euclidean geometry.

246
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And this is actually the field of mathematics

247
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that underlies general relativity

248
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and is actually ultimately going to show us

249
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
about the shape of the universe.

250
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So there is this direct line

251
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
between feminine handicraft,

252
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Euclid and general relativity.

253
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.

254
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate --

255
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
didn't know it was impossible to violate,

256
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and they're simply getting on with it.

257
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.

258
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I once asked the mathematicians why it was

259
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible

260
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.

261
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Their answer was interesting.

262
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians

263
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
sitting around looking at sea slugs."

264
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.

265
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It also says a whole lot of things

266
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
about what mathematicians thought mathematics was,

267
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
what they thought it could and couldn't do,

268
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
what they thought it could and couldn't represent.

269
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Even mathematicians, who in some sense

270
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
are the freest of all thinkers,

271
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
literally couldn't see

272
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
not only the sea slugs around them,

273
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but the lettuce on their plate --

274
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because lettuces, and all those curly vegetables,

275
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.

276
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And so in some sense they literally,

277
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
they had such a symbolic view of mathematics,

278
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
they couldn't actually see what was going on

279
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
on the lettuce in front of them.

280
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.

281
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And so, too, we've discovered

282
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that there is an infinite taxonomy

283
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of crochet hyperbolic creatures.

284
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
We started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors,

285
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
doing the simple mathematically perfect models.

286
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But we found that when we deviated from the specific

287
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
setness of the mathematical code

288
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that underlies it -- the simple algorithm

289
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
crochet three, increase one --

290
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code,

291
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the models immediately started to look more natural.

292
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And all of our contributors, who are an amazing

293
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
collection of people around the world,

294
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
do their own embellishments.

295
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
As it were, we have this ever-evolving,

296
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
crochet taxonomic tree of life.

297
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Just as the morphology

298
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and the complexity of life on earth is never ending,

299
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
little embellishments and complexifications

300
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in the DNA code

301
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
lead to new things like giraffes, or orchids --

302
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
so too, do little embellishments in the crochet code

303
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
lead to new and wondrous creatures

304
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in the evolutionary tree of crochet life.

305
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So this project really has

306
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
taken on this inner organic life of its own.

307
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
There is the totality of all the people who have come to it.

308
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And their individual visions,

309
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and their engagement with this mathematical mode.

310
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We have these technologies. We use them.

311
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
But why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?

312
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
For Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here

313
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
is that these things suggest

314
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
the importance and value of embodied knowledge.

315
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We live in a society

316
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that completely tends to valorize

317
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
symbolic forms of representation --

318
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
algebraic representations,

319
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
equations, codes.

320
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We live in a society that's obsessed

321
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
with presenting information in this way,

322
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
teaching information in this way.

323
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But through this sort of modality,

324
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
crochet, other plastic forms of play --

325
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
people can be engaged with the most abstract,

326
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
high-powered, theoretical ideas,

327
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go

328
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to university departments to study in higher mathematics,

329
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.

330
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But you can do it through playing with material objects.

331
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
One of the ways that we've come to think about this

332
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring

333
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and projects like this, we're trying to have

334
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
kindergarten for grown-ups.

335
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized

336
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
system of education,

337
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
established by a man named Friedrich Froebel,

338
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
who was a crystallographer in the 19th century.

339
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
He believed that the crystal was the model

340
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
for all kinds of representation.

341
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
He developed a radical alternative system

342
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
of engaging the smallest children

343
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
with the most abstract ideas

344
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
through physical forms of play.

345
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.

346
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
The value of education

347
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
is something that Froebel championed,

348
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
through plastic modes of play.

349
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We live in a society now

350
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
where we have lots of think tanks,

351
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
where great minds go to think about the world.

352
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
They write these great symbolic treatises

353
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
called books, and papers,

354
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and op-ed articles.

355
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We want to propose, Chrissy and I,

356
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
through The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things,

357
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
which is the play tank.

358
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
And the play tank, like the think tank,

359
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
is a place where people can go

360
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and engage with great ideas.

361
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
But what we want to propose,

362
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
is that the highest levels of abstraction,

363
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. --

364
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
all of this can be engaged with,

365
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
not just through purely cerebral algebraic

366
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
symbolic methods,

367
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
but by literally, physically playing with ideas.

368
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Thank you very much.

369
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Applause)

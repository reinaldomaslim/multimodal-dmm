1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
A tourist is backpacking

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
through the highlands of Scotland,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and he stops at a pub to get a drink.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the only people in there is a bartender

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and an old man nursing a beer.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And he orders a pint, and they sit in silence for a while.

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And suddenly the old man turns to him and goes,

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"You see this bar?

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I built this bar with my bare hands

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
from the finest wood in the county.

11
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Gave it more love and care than my own child.

12
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But do they call me MacGregor the bar builder? No."

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Points out the window.

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"You see that stone wall out there?

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I built that stone wall with my bare hands.

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Found every stone, placed them just so through the rain and the cold.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But do they call me MacGregor the stone wall builder? No."

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Points out the window.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"You see that pier on the lake out there?

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I built that pier with my bare hands.

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Drove the pilings against the tide of the sand, plank by plank.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But do they call me MacGregor the pier builder? No.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But you fuck one goat ... "

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Storytelling --

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is joke telling.

28
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's knowing your punchline,

29
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
your ending,

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
knowing that everything you're saying, from the first sentence to the last,

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is leading to a singular goal,

32
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and ideally confirming some truth

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that deepens our understandings

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of who we are as human beings.

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We all love stories.

36
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We're born for them.

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Stories affirm who we are.

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We all want affirmations that our lives have meaning.

39
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And nothing does a greater affirmation

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
than when we connect through stories.

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
It can cross the barriers of time,

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
past, present and future,

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and allow us to experience

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the similarities between ourselves

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and through others, real and imagined.

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The children's television host Mr. Rogers

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
always carried in his wallet

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a quote from a social worker

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that said, "Frankly, there isn't anyone you couldn't learn to love

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
once you've heard their story."

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the way I like to interpret that

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is probably the greatest story commandment,

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which is "Make me care" --

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
please, emotionally,

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
intellectually, aesthetically,

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
just make me care.

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We all know what it's like to not care.

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You've gone through hundreds of TV channels,

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
just switching channel after channel,

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and then suddenly you actually stop on one.

61
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
It's already halfway over,

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but something's caught you and you're drawn in and you care.

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's not by chance,

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that's by design.

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So it got me thinking, what if I told you my history was story,

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
how I was born for it,

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
how I learned along the way this subject matter?

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And to make it more interesting,

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we'll start from the ending

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and we'll go to the beginning.

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And so if I were going to give you the ending of this story,

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it would go something like this:

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And that's what ultimately led me

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to speaking to you here at TED

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
about story.

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And the most current story lesson that I've had

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
was completing the film I've just done

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
this year in 2012.

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The film is "John Carter." It's based on a book called "The Princess of Mars,"

80
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
which was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And Edgar Rice Burroughs actually put himself

82
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
as a character inside this movie, and as the narrator.

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And he's summoned by his rich uncle, John Carter, to his mansion

84
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with a telegram saying, "See me at once."

85
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But once he gets there,

86
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
he's found out that his uncle has mysteriously passed away

87
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and been entombed in a mausoleum on the property.

88
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Video) Butler: You won't find a keyhole.

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Thing only opens from the inside.

90
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He insisted,

91
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
no embalming, no open coffin,

92
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
no funeral.

93
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You don't acquire the kind of wealth your uncle commanded

94
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
by being like the rest of us, huh?

95
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Come, let's go inside.

96
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
AS: What this scene is doing, and it did in the book,

97
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is it's fundamentally making a promise.

98
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's making a promise to you

99
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that this story will lead somewhere that's worth your time.

100
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And that's what all good stories should do at the beginning, is they should give you a promise.

101
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You could do it an infinite amount of ways.

102
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Sometimes it's as simple as "Once upon a time ... "

103
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
These Carter books always had Edgar Rice Burroughs as a narrator in it.

104
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I always thought it was such a fantastic device.

105
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's like a guy inviting you around the campfire,

106
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or somebody in a bar saying, "Here, let me tell you a story.

107
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It didn't happen to me, it happened to somebody else,

108
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but it's going to be worth your time."

109
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
A well told promise

110
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is like a pebble being pulled back in a slingshot

111
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and propels you forward through the story

112
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to the end.

113
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In 2008,

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I pushed all the theories that I had on story at the time

115
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to the limits of my understanding on this project.

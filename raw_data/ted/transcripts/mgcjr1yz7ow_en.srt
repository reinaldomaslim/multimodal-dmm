1
0:00:13.087,000 --> 0:00:16,000
For me, it was not being invited to a friend's wedding.

2
0:00:17.184,000 --> 0:00:19,000
At first, I didn't really mind.

3
0:00:19.358,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I thought he was having a small reception.

4
0:00:22.044,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But then I kept meeting people who were going to the same wedding,

5
0:00:25.521,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and they weren't as close to the groom as I was ...

6
0:00:29.192,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I felt left out.

7
0:00:30.703,000 --> 0:00:31,000
That really sucked.

8
0:00:32.013,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It felt really unfair.

9
0:00:34.813,000 --> 0:00:38,000
For my daughters, Lipsi and Greta, it was last week.

10
0:00:40.124,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They were taking turns massaging their mom's back

11
0:00:42.726,000 --> 0:00:44,000
with a toy for back rubs,

12
0:00:44.838,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and then one of the girls felt that the other girl had a longer go.

13
0:00:48.604,000 --> 0:00:49,000
That's when I walk into the room

14
0:00:50.435,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to find Greta in a rage, shouting, "That's not fair!"

15
0:00:53.709,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and Lipsi in tears,

16
0:00:55.698,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and my wife holding a stopwatch

17
0:00:57.68,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to make sure that each girl had precisely one minute on the toy.

18
0:01:03.963,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So if you're anything like me or my girls,

19
0:01:08.764,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the last thing that upset you

20
0:01:11.495,000 --> 0:01:13,000
probably also had to do with unfairness.

21
0:01:14.756,000 --> 0:01:17,000
That's because unfairness triggers us so strongly

22
0:01:18.312,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that we can't think straight.

23
0:01:20.446,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We become afraid and suspicious.

24
0:01:23.826,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Our unfairness antennae stick up.

25
0:01:27.533,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We feel pain, and we walk away.

26
0:01:30.479,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Unfairness is one of the defining issues of our society,

27
0:01:34.314,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it's one of the root causes of polarization,

28
0:01:37.474,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and it's bad news for business.

29
0:01:40.477,000 --> 0:01:44,000
At work, unfairness makes people defensive and disengaged.

30
0:01:45.419,000 --> 0:01:51,000
A study shows that 70 percent of workers in the US are disengaged,

31
0:01:52.404,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and this is costing the companies

32
0:01:54.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
550 billion dollars a year every year.

33
0:01:58.576,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is, like, half the total spent on education in the US.

34
0:02:03.476,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is the size of the GDP of a country like Austria.

35
0:02:08.255,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So removing unfairness and promoting fairness

36
0:02:11.606,000 --> 0:02:12,000
should be our priority.

37
0:02:13.969,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But what does it mean in practice?

38
0:02:15.765,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Is it about more rules? Is it about systems?

39
0:02:18.74,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Is it about equality?

40
0:02:20.52,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Well, partly, but fairness is more interesting than rules and equality.

41
0:02:25.471,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Fairness works in surprising ways.

42
0:02:28.669,000 --> 0:02:33,000
15 years ago, I left a US investment bank

43
0:02:33.781,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to join a large Italian state-owned oil company.

44
0:02:38.702,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It was a different world.

45
0:02:40.487,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I thought the key to getting the best performance

46
0:02:42.859,000 --> 0:02:43,000
was a risk-reward system

47
0:02:44.781,000 --> 0:02:48,000
where you could give the high performers bonuses and promotions

48
0:02:48.988,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and give the underperformers something to worry about.

49
0:02:52.435,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But in this company, we had fixed salaries

50
0:02:56.466,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and lifelong jobs.

51
0:02:58.903,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Careers were set,

52
0:03:00.406,000 --> 0:03:02,000
so my toolkit wasn't very effective,

53
0:03:02.864,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and I was frustrated.

54
0:03:04.867,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But then I saw that this company was producing some pockets of excellence,

55
0:03:10.082,000 --> 0:03:12,000
areas in which they beat the competition

56
0:03:12.225,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in very tough, competitive sectors.

57
0:03:14.67,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This was true in trading,

58
0:03:16.408,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in project management --

59
0:03:18.551,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it was very true in exploration.

60
0:03:20.926,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Our exploration team was finding more oil and gas

61
0:03:24.219,000 --> 0:03:25,000
than any other company in the world.

62
0:03:26.878,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It was a phenomenon.

63
0:03:28.649,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Everyone was trying to figure out how this was possible.

64
0:03:31.561,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I thought it was luck,

65
0:03:33.802,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but after each new discovery, that became less and less likely.

66
0:03:38.215,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So did we have a special tool? No.

67
0:03:42.635,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Did we have a killer application that no one else had? No.

68
0:03:46.844,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Was it one genius who was finding oil for the whole team?

69
0:03:50.119,000 --> 0:03:52,000
No, we hadn't hired a senior guy in years.

70
0:03:54.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So what was our secret sauce?

71
0:03:57.723,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I started looking at them really carefully.

72
0:03:59.869,000 --> 0:04:,000
I looked at my friend,

73
0:04:01.28,000 --> 0:04:03,000
who drilled seven dry wells,

74
0:04:03.71,000 --> 0:04:05,000
writing off more than a billion dollars for the company,

75
0:04:06.519,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and found oil on the eighth.

76
0:04:08.865,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I was nervous for him ...

77
0:04:12.491,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but he was so relaxed.

78
0:04:14.611,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I mean, these guys knew what they were doing.

79
0:04:17.41,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And then it hit me: it was about fairness.

80
0:04:21.502,000 --> 0:04:22,000
These guys were working in a company

81
0:04:23.241,000 --> 0:04:25,000
where they didn't need to worry about short-term results.

82
0:04:26.539,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They weren't going to be penalized for bad luck or for an honest mistake.

83
0:04:31.77,000 --> 0:04:33,000
They knew they were valued for what they were trying to do,

84
0:04:34.786,000 --> 0:04:35,000
not the outcome.

85
0:04:36.056,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They were valued as human beings. They were part of a community.

86
0:04:39.08,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Whatever happened, the company would stand by them.

87
0:04:41.715,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And for me, this is the definition of fairness.

88
0:04:44.712,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It's when you can lower those unfairness antennae, put them at rest.

89
0:04:48.537,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Then great things follow.

90
0:04:50.376,000 --> 0:04:53,000
These guys could be true to their purpose, which was finding oil and gas.

91
0:04:54.645,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They didn't have to worry about company politics or greed or fear.

92
0:04:59.814,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They could be good risk-takers,

93
0:05:02.363,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because they weren't too defensive

94
0:05:04.886,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and they weren't gambling to take huge rewards.

95
0:05:08.583,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And they were excellent team workers.

96
0:05:11.528,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They could trust their colleagues.

97
0:05:13.173,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They didn't need to look behind their backs.

98
0:05:16.293,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And they were basically having fun.

99
0:05:18.651,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They were having so much fun,

100
0:05:20.476,000 --> 0:05:22,000
one guy even confessed

101
0:05:22.684,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that he was having more fun at the company Christmas dinner

102
0:05:26.058,000 --> 0:05:27,000
than at his own Christmas dinner.

103
0:05:27.89,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:30.135,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But these guys, essentially, were working in a fair system

105
0:05:35.24,000 --> 0:05:37,000
where they could do what they felt was right

106
0:05:37.826,000 --> 0:05:39,000
instead of what's selfish, what's quick, what's convenient,

107
0:05:40.66,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and to be able to do what we feel is right

108
0:05:43.561,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is a key ingredient for fairness, but it is also a great motivator.

109
0:05:49.187,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And it wasn't just explorers who were doing the right thing.

110
0:05:52.639,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There was an HR director who proposed that I hire someone internally

111
0:05:58.747,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and give him a managerial job.

112
0:06:00.685,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This guy was very good, but he didn't finish high school,

113
0:06:03.526,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so formally, he had no qualifications.

114
0:06:06.39,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But he was so good, it made sense, and so we gave him the job.

115
0:06:10.451,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Or the other guy, who asked me for a budget to build a cheese factory

116
0:06:15.349,000 --> 0:06:18,000
next to our plant in Ecuador, in the village.

117
0:06:18.955,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It didn't make any sense: no one ever built a cheese factory.

118
0:06:21.837,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But this is what the village wanted, because the milk they had would spoil

119
0:06:25.423,000 --> 0:06:27,000
before they could sell it, so that's what they needed.

120
0:06:28.042,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And so we built it.

121
0:06:29.67,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So in these examples and many others,

122
0:06:31.678,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I learned that to be fair,

123
0:06:34.678,000 --> 0:06:37,000
my colleagues and I, we needed to take a risk and stick our head out,

124
0:06:38.283,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but in a fair system, you can do that.

125
0:06:40.186,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You can dare to be fair.

126
0:06:42.309,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So I realized that these guys and other colleagues

127
0:06:46.975,000 --> 0:06:5,000
were achieving great results, doing great things,

128
0:06:51.896,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in a way that no bonus could buy.

129
0:06:54.716,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So I was fascinated.

130
0:06:55.979,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I wanted to learn how this thing really worked,

131
0:06:58.194,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and I wanted to learn it also for myself, to become a better leader.

132
0:07:01.815,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So I started talking to colleagues, to coaches,

133
0:07:04.668,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to headhunters and neuroscientists,

134
0:07:07.194,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and what I discovered

135
0:07:08.81,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is that what these guys were up to and the way they worked

136
0:07:11.96,000 --> 0:07:13,000
is really supported by recent brain science.

137
0:07:15.263,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And I've also discovered that this can work at all levels

138
0:07:18.652,000 --> 0:07:19,000
in any type of company.

139
0:07:19.906,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You don't need the fixed salaries or the stable careers.

140
0:07:24.254,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This is because science shows

141
0:07:27.827,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that humans have an innate sense of fairness.

142
0:07:33.039,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We know what is right and what is wrong

143
0:07:35.865,000 --> 0:07:36,000
before we can talk or think about it.

144
0:07:39.009,000 --> 0:07:41,000
My favorite experiment

145
0:07:41.492,000 --> 0:07:43,000
has six-month old babies

146
0:07:44.245,000 --> 0:07:47,000
watching a ball trying to struggle up a hill.

147
0:07:48.943,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And there's a helpful, friendly square that pushes the ball up the hill,

148
0:07:52.994,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and then a mean triangle pushes the ball back down.

149
0:07:57.042,000 --> 0:07:59,000
After watching this several times,

150
0:07:59.448,000 --> 0:08:01,000
they ask the babies to pick,

151
0:08:01.542,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to choose what to play with.

152
0:08:02.908,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They can pick a ball, a square or a triangle.

153
0:08:07.265,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They never pick up the triangle.

154
0:08:09.48,000 --> 0:08:1,000
All the babies want to be the square.

155
0:08:13.59,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And science also shows

156
0:08:15.686,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that when we see or perceive fairness,

157
0:08:18.472,000 --> 0:08:21,000
our brain releases a substance that gives us pleasure,

158
0:08:22.189,000 --> 0:08:23,000
proper joy.

159
0:08:24.225,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But when we perceive unfairness, we feel pain ...

160
0:08:28.601,000 --> 0:08:29,000
even greater pain

161
0:08:29.829,000 --> 0:08:31,000
than the same type of pain as if I really hurt myself.

162
0:08:33.275,000 --> 0:08:37,000
That's because unfairness triggers the primitive, reptile part of our brain,

163
0:08:37.435,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the part that deals with threats and survival,

164
0:08:40.941,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and when unfairness triggers a threat, that's all we can think about.

165
0:08:44.473,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Motivation, creativity, teamwork,

166
0:08:47.521,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they all go way back.

167
0:08:50.119,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And it makes sense that we're wired this way,

168
0:08:52.326,000 --> 0:08:53,000
because we're social animals.

169
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We need to be part of a community to survive.

170
0:08:58.134,000 --> 0:09:,000
We're born so helpless

171
0:09:00.246,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that someone needs to look after us until we're maybe 10 years old,

172
0:09:03.476,000 --> 0:09:05,000
so our brain evolves towards food.

173
0:09:05.746,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We need to be in that community.

174
0:09:07.659,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So whether I like it or not,

175
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
not being invited to the friend's wedding,

176
0:09:13.154,000 --> 0:09:15,000
my lizard brain is generating the same response

177
0:09:16.171,000 --> 0:09:18,000
as if I'm about to be pushed out from my community.

178
0:09:20.763,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So science explains quite nicely why fairness is good

179
0:09:25.089,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and why unfairness makes us really defensive,

180
0:09:27.486,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but science also shows that in a fair environment,

181
0:09:31.025,000 --> 0:09:34,000
not only do we all want to be the square,

182
0:09:34.124,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but we tend to be the square,

183
0:09:36.233,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and this allows other people to be fair in turn.

184
0:09:39.758,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This creates a beautiful fairness circle.

185
0:09:43.934,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But while we start off fair ...

186
0:09:46.934,000 --> 0:09:51,000
one drop of unfairness contaminates the whole pool,

187
0:09:52.021,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and unfortunately, there's plenty of drops in that pool.

188
0:09:56.606,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So our effort should be to filter out

189
0:10:00.591,000 --> 0:10:02,000
as much unfairness as we can from everywhere,

190
0:10:02.711,000 --> 0:10:04,000
starting from our communities, starting from our companies.

191
0:10:06.687,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I worry about this a lot because I lead a team of 3,000 excellent people,

192
0:10:12.259,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and the difference between 3,000 happy, motivated team workers

193
0:10:16.553,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and 3,000 clock-watchers is everything.

194
0:10:21.154,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So the first thing I try to do in my fairness crusade

195
0:10:26.531,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is to try to take myself out of the equation.

196
0:10:29.901,000 --> 0:10:31,000
That means being aware of my own biases.

197
0:10:32.021,000 --> 0:10:34,000
For example, I really like people who say yes

198
0:10:34.695,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to whatever I suggest.

199
0:10:35.957,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

200
0:10:37.326,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But that's not very good for the company

201
0:10:39.378,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and not very good for anyone who has different ideas.

202
0:10:41.88,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So we try to actively promote a culture of diversity of opinions

203
0:10:46.144,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and diversity of character.

204
0:10:47.853,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The second thing we do is a little more procedural.

205
0:10:50.259,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We look at all the rules, the processes, the systems in the company,

206
0:10:53.987,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the ones we use to take decisions and allocate resources,

207
0:10:57.607,000 --> 0:11:,000
and we try to get rid of anything that's not very clear,

208
0:11:00.994,000 --> 0:11:01,000
not very rational, doesn't make sense,

209
0:11:02.868,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and we also try to fix anything that's limiting

210
0:11:05.203,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the transfer of information within the company.

211
0:11:07.89,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We then look at the culture and the motivation for the same reasons.

212
0:11:11.202,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But my point is that however hard you look at the rules,

213
0:11:13.941,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the processes, the systems -- and we have to do that --

214
0:11:16.588,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but however hard we look,

215
0:11:18.282,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we're never going to do enough to get to the real essence of fairness.

216
0:11:21.766,000 --> 0:11:25,000
That's because the last mile of fairness requires something else.

217
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It's about what people's emotions are,

218
0:11:29.624,000 --> 0:11:3,000
what their needs are,

219
0:11:31.211,000 --> 0:11:33,000
what's going on in their private lives,

220
0:11:33.854,000 --> 0:11:34,000
what society needs.

221
0:11:36.994,000 --> 0:11:38,000
These are all questions and elements

222
0:11:39.781,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that are very hard to put into a spreadsheet, into an algorithm.

223
0:11:43.655,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's very hard to make them part of our rational decision.

224
0:11:46.902,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But if we miss these, we're missing key important points,

225
0:11:50.562,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and the outcome is likely to feel unfair.

226
0:11:54.18,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So we should cross-check our decisions with our fairness center switched on.

227
0:11:59.502,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Is it right that this guy should get the job he's really hoping to get?

228
0:12:03.414,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Is it right that this guy should be fired?

229
0:12:07.273,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Is it right that we should be charging so much for this product?

230
0:12:12.129,000 --> 0:12:13,000
These are tough questions.

231
0:12:15.241,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But if we take the time to ask ourselves

232
0:12:19.146,000 --> 0:12:23,000
whether the rational answer is the right one ...

233
0:12:24.529,000 --> 0:12:26,000
we all know deep inside what the answer is.

234
0:12:27.41,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We've known since we were babies.

235
0:12:30.975,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And to know what the right answer is

236
0:12:33.339,000 --> 0:12:34,000
is pretty cool for decision-making.

237
0:12:37.13,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And if we turn on our hearts,

238
0:12:39.871,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that's the key to getting the real best out of people,

239
0:12:42.538,000 --> 0:12:44,000
because they can smell it if you care,

240
0:12:45.205,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and only when you really care will they leave their fears behind

241
0:12:48.326,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and bring their true selves to work.

242
0:12:51.731,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So if fairness is a keystone of life,

243
0:12:54.364,000 --> 0:12:56,000
why isn't every leader making it their priority?

244
0:12:58.019,000 --> 0:13:,000
Wouldn't it be cool to work in a company that was more fair?

245
0:13:02.492,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Wouldn't it be great to have colleagues and bosses

246
0:13:05.091,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that were selected and trained for fairness and for character

247
0:13:09.207,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and not based on 60-year-old GMATs?

248
0:13:13.225,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to knock on the door

249
0:13:15.654,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of a Chief Fairness Officer?

250
0:13:18.172,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We'll get there, but why is it not happening now?

251
0:13:21.502,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Well, partly, it's because of inertia,

252
0:13:23.861,000 --> 0:13:26,000
partly, it's because fairness isn't always easy.

253
0:13:27.042,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It requires judgment and risk.

254
0:13:29.741,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Drilling that eighth well was a risk.

255
0:13:33.336,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Promoting the guy who didn't finish high school was a risk.

256
0:13:37.164,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Building a cheese factory in Ecuador was a risk.

257
0:13:41.354,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But fairness is a risk worth taking,

258
0:13:45.197,000 --> 0:13:47,000
so we should be asking ourselves,

259
0:13:47.777,000 --> 0:13:49,000
where can we take this risk?

260
0:13:51.031,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Where can we push ourselves a little bit further,

261
0:13:55.302,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to go beyond what's rational and do what's right?

262
0:13:59.865,000 --> 0:14:,000
Thank you.

263
0:14:01.04,000 --> 0:14:06,000
(Applause)

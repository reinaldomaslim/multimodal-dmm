0:00:12.261,000 --> 0:00:13,000
[A provocation from Danny Hillis:]

2
0:00:13.929,000 --> 0:00:15,000
[It's time to start talking about engineering our climate]

3
0:00:16.897,000 --> 0:00:19,000
What if there was a way to build a thermostat

4
0:00:20.39,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that allowed you to turn down the temperature of the earth

5
0:00:23.157,000 --> 0:00:24,000
anytime you wanted?

6
0:00:25.695,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now, you would think if somebody had a plausible idea about how to do that,

7
0:00:30.109,000 --> 0:00:32,000
everybody would be very excited about it,

8
0:00:32.387,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and there would be lots of research on how to do it.

9
0:00:35.45,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But in fact, a lot of people do understand how to do that.

10
0:00:40.711,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But there's not much support for research in this area.

11
0:00:45.444,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I think part of it

12
0:00:47.655,000 --> 0:00:5,000
is because there are some real misunderstandings about it.

13
0:00:51.021,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I'm not going to try to convince you today that this is a good idea.

14
0:00:55.863,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But I am going to try to get your curiosity going about it

15
0:01:00.57,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and clear up some of the misunderstandings.

16
0:01:04.266,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, the basic idea of solar geoengineering

17
0:01:08.411,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is that we can cool things down

18
0:01:11.062,000 --> 0:01:13,000
just by reflecting a little bit more sunlight

19
0:01:13.824,000 --> 0:01:14,000
back into space.

20
0:01:15.728,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And ideas about how to do this have been around literally for decades.

21
0:01:22.023,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Clouds are a great way to do that, these low-lying clouds.

22
0:01:26.506,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Everybody knows it's cooler under a cloud.

23
0:01:29.475,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I like this cloud because it has exactly the same water content

24
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:34,000
as the transparent air around it.

25
0:01:36.093,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And it just shows that even a little bit of a change in the flow of the air

26
0:01:40.363,000 --> 0:01:41,000
can cause a cloud to form.

27
0:01:42.482,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We make artificial clouds all the time.

28
0:01:45.823,000 --> 0:01:48,000
These are contrails, which are artificial water clouds

29
0:01:49.204,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that are made by the passing of a jet engine.

30
0:01:52.251,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so, we're already changing the clouds on earth.

31
0:01:57.617,000 --> 0:01:58,000
By accident.

32
0:01:58.958,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Or, if you like to believe it, by supersecret government conspiracy.

33
0:02:03.559,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:05.658,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But we are already doing this quite a lot.

35
0:02:08.807,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is a NASA picture of shipping lanes.

36
0:02:12.403,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Passing ships actually cause clouds to form,

37
0:02:15.855,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and this is a big enough effect

38
0:02:17.99,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that it actually helps reduce global warming already by about a degree.

39
0:02:23.513,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So we already are doing solar engineering.

40
0:02:27.347,000 --> 0:02:29,000
There's lots of ideas about how to do this.

41
0:02:29.418,000 --> 0:02:3,000
People have looked at everything,

42
0:02:31.422,000 --> 0:02:34,000
from building giant parasols out into space

43
0:02:34.87,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to fizzing bubble waters in the ocean.

44
0:02:38.306,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And some of these are actually very plausible ideas.

45
0:02:42.656,000 --> 0:02:46,000
One that was published recently by David Keith at Harvard

46
0:02:47.038,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is to take chalk and put dust up into the stratosphere,

47
0:02:50.751,000 --> 0:02:52,000
where it reflects off sunlight.

48
0:02:53.036,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And that's a really neat idea,

49
0:02:54.513,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because chalk is one of the most common minerals on earth,

50
0:02:57.958,000 --> 0:03:,000
and it's very safe -- it's so safe, we put it into baby food.

51
0:03:02.665,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And basically, if you throw chalk up into the stratosphere,

52
0:03:06.888,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it comes down in a couple of years all by itself, dissolved in rainwater.

53
0:03:12.587,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now, before you start worrying about all this chalk in your rainwater,

54
0:03:16.738,000 --> 0:03:2,000
let me explain to you how little of it it actually takes.

55
0:03:21.453,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And that turns out to be very easy to calculate.

56
0:03:25.118,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is a back-of-the-envelope calculation I made.

57
0:03:27.879,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:29.269,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause)

59
0:03:31.483,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I assure you, people have done much more careful calculations,

60
0:03:35.975,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and it comes out with the same answer,

61
0:03:37.85,000 --> 0:03:42,000
which is that you have to put chalk up at the rate of about 10 teragrams a year

62
0:03:43.637,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to undo the effects of the CO2 that we've already done --

63
0:03:47.467,000 --> 0:03:5,000
just in terms of temperature, not all the effects, but the temperature.

64
0:03:51.339,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So what does that look like?

65
0:03:53.562,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I can't visualize 10 teragrams per year.

66
0:03:57.593,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So I asked the Cambridge Fire Department and Taylor Milsal

67
0:04:03.823,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to lend me a hand.

68
0:04:06.965,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This is a hose pumping water at 10 teragrams a year.

69
0:04:12.506,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And that is how much

70
0:04:15.284,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you would have to pump into the stratosphere

71
0:04:18.887,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to cool the earth back down to pre-industrial levels.

72
0:04:23.815,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And it's amazingly little; it's like one hose for the entire earth.

73
0:04:29.244,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now of course, you wouldn't really use a hose,

74
0:04:31.513,000 --> 0:04:33,000
you'd fly it up in airplanes or something like that.

75
0:04:34.442,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But it's so little, it would be like putting a handful of chalk

76
0:04:39.561,000 --> 0:04:41,000
into every Olympic swimming pool full of rain.

77
0:04:42.886,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's almost nothing.

78
0:04:45.192,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So why don't people like this idea?

79
0:04:49.569,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Why isn't it taken more seriously?

80
0:04:51.315,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And there are some very good reasons for that.

81
0:04:55.323,000 --> 0:05:,000
A lot of people really don't think we should be talking about this at all.

82
0:05:00.396,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And, in fact, I have some very good friends in the audience

83
0:05:04.86,000 --> 0:05:05,000
who I respect a lot,

84
0:05:07.13,000 --> 0:05:1,000
who really don't think I should be talking about this.

85
0:05:11.056,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And the reason is that they're concerned

86
0:05:13.922,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that if people imagine there's some easy way out,

87
0:05:17.398,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that we won't give up our addiction to fossil fuels.

88
0:05:21.553,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And I do worry about that.

89
0:05:23.871,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I think it's actually a serious problem.

90
0:05:26.927,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But there's also, I think, a deeper problem,

91
0:05:32.657,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which is: nobody likes the idea of messing with the entire earth --

92
0:05:38.056,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I certainly don't.

93
0:05:39.779,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I love this planet, I really do.

94
0:05:42.175,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I don't want to mess with it.

95
0:05:44.63,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But we're already changing our atmosphere,

96
0:05:48.494,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we're already messing with it.

97
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And so I think it makes sense for us to look for ways

98
0:05:57.285,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to mitigate that impact.

99
0:05:59.519,000 --> 0:06:,000
And we need to do research to do that.

100
0:06:01.456,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We need to understand the science behind that.

101
0:06:04.878,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I've noticed that there's a theme that's kind of developed at TED,

102
0:06:10.212,000 --> 0:06:14,000
which is kind of, "fear versus hope,"

103
0:06:14.576,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or "creativity versus caution."

104
0:06:19.026,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And of course, we need both of those.

105
0:06:21.747,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So there aren't any silver bullets.

106
0:06:24.255,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This is certainly not a silver bullet.

107
0:06:28.331,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But we need science to tell us what our options are;

108
0:06:32.159,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that informs both our creativity and our caution.

109
0:06:37.293,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So I am an optimist about our future selves,

110
0:06:42.426,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but I'm not an optimist because I think our problems are small.

111
0:06:47.204,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I'm an optimist because I think our capacity to deal with our problems

112
0:06:53.22,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is much greater than we imagine.

113
0:06:55.859,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Thank you very much.

114
0:06:57.182,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Applause)

115

This talk sparked a lot of controversy at TED2017,

116
0:07:00.403,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and we encourage you to look at discussions online

117
0:07:02.483,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to see other points of view.

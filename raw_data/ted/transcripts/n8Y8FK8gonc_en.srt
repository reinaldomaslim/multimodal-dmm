1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So, I was in the hospital for a long time.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And a few years after I left, I went back,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me --

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
said, "Dan, I have a fantastic new treatment for you."

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I was very excited. I walked with him to his office.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And he explained to me that, when I shave,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is,

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but on the right side of my face

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I was badly burned so I have no hair,

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and this creates lack of symmetry.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And what's the brilliant idea he had?

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
He was going to tattoo little black dots

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on the right side of my face

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and make me look very symmetric.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It sounded interesting. He asked me to go and shave.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Let me tell you, this was a strange way to shave,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because I thought about it

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I realized that the way I was shaving then

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life --

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because I had to keep the width the same.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
When I got back to his office,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I wasn't really sure.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I said, "Can I see some evidence for this?"

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So he showed me some pictures

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
of little cheeks with little black dots --

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
not very informative.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I said, "What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white?

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What would happen then?"

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"Oh, don't worry about it," he said.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"We have lasers; we can whiten it out."

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But I was still concerned,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
so I said, "You know what, I'm not going to do it."

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This is coming from a Jewish guy, all right, so that means a lot.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And he said, "Dan, what's wrong with you?

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric?

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this?

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Do women feel pity for you

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and have sex with you more frequently?"

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
None of those happened.

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
And this was very surprising to me,

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because I've gone through many treatments --

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
there were many treatments I decided not to do --

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I never got this guilt trip to this extent.

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But I decided not to have this treatment.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And I went to his deputy and asked him, "What was going on?

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Where was this guilt trip coming from?"

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already,

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing.

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now you probably think that this guy's a schmuck.

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Right, that's what he seems like.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story.

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
A few years ago, I was running some of my own experiments in the lab.

56
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And when we run experiments,

57
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another.

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high,

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
another group that I thought their performance would be very low,

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and when I got the results, that's what we got --

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I was very happy -- aside from one person.

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
There was one person in the group

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that was supposed to have very high performance

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that was actually performing terribly.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And he pulled the whole mean down,

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
destroying my statistical significance of the test.

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So I looked carefully at this guy.

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample.

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
came one day to the lab

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
wanting to make some easy cash

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and this was the guy.

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"Fantastic!" I thought. "Let's throw him out.

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample?"

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But a couple of days later,

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we thought about it with my students,

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and we said, "What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition?

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What would have happened if he was in the other group?

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Would we have thrown him out then?"

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We probably wouldn't have looked at the data at all,

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and if we did look at the data,

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
we'd probably have said, "Fantastic! What a smart guy who is performing this low,"

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
giving us even stronger statistical results than we could.

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment.

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But you know, these stories,

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and lots of other experiments that we've done on conflicts of interest,

88
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
basically kind of bring two points

89
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to the foreground for me.

90
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The first one is that in life we encounter many people

91
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
who, in some way or another,

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
try to tattoo our faces.

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and give us advice that is inherently biased.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And I'm sure that it's something that we all recognize,

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and we see that it happens.

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Maybe we don't recognize it every time,

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but we understand that it happens.

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The most difficult thing, of course, is to recognize

100
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that sometimes we too

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
are blinded by our own incentives.

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And that's a much, much more difficult lesson to take into account.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Because we don't see how conflicts of interest work on us.

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
When I was doing these experiments,

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in my mind, I was helping science.

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I was eliminating the data

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to get the true pattern of the data to shine through.

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I wasn't doing something bad.

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In my mind, I was actually a knight

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
trying to help science move along.

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But this was not the case.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions.

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I think the real challenge is to figure out

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
where are the cases in our lives

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
where conflicts of interest work on us,

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it,

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but to try to do things

118
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors,

119
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances.

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I do want to leave you with one positive thought.

121
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I mean, this is all very depressing, right --

122
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
people have conflicts of interest, we don't see it, and so on.

123
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The positive perspective, I think, of all of this

124
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
is that, if we do understand when we go wrong,

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
if we understand the deep mechanisms

126
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
of why we fail and where we fail,

127
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we can actually hope to fix things.

128
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And that, I think, is the hope. Thank you very much.

129
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Applause)

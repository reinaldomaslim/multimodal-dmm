1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen, gather around.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I would love to share with you a story.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Once upon a time

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in 19th century Germany,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
there was the book.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now during this time,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the book was the king of storytelling.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It was venerable.

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It was ubiquitous.

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But it was a little bit boring.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Because in its 400 years of existence,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
storytellers never evolved the book

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
as a storytelling device.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But then one author arrived,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and he changed the game forever.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Music)

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
His name was Lothar,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Lothar Meggendorfer.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and he said, "Genug ist genug!"

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
He grabbed his pen,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
he snatched his scissors.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and just decided to fold.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
as -- who else? --

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the world's first true inventor

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
of the children's pop-up book.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Music)

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
For this delight and for this wonder,

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
people rejoiced.

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Cheering)

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They were happy because the story survived,

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and that the world would keep on spinning.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn't the first

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to evolve the way a story was told,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and he certainly wasn't the last.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Whether storytellers realized it or not,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
they were channeling Meggendorfer's spirit

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when they moved opera to vaudville,

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
radio news to radio theater,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
film to film in motion

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to film in sound, color, 3D,

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
on VHS and on DVD.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around.

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Because, not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world,

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but they could do so

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices.

51
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
For example, one company

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
would tell a story of love

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
through its very own search engine.

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
One Taiwanese production studio

55
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
would interpret American politics in 3D.

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And one man would tell the stories of his father

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
by using a platform called Twitter

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate.

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And after all this, everyone paused;

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
they took a step back.

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They realized that, in 6,000 years of storytelling,

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
they've gone from depicting hunting on cave walls

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls.

65
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And this was a cause for celebration.

66
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged.

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And for the most part, the stories are recycled.

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But the way that humans tell the stories

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
has always evolved

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
with pure, consistent novelty.

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And they remembered a man,

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
one amazing German,

73
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
every time a new storytelling device

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
popped up next.

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And for that,

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the audience --

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the lovely, beautiful audience --

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
would live happily ever after.

79
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Applause)

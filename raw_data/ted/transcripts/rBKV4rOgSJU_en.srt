1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
doesn't mean it's not there."

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
What I wanted to do is to

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
show the world that the little things

6
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
can be the biggest things.

7
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We all seem to think that,

8
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.

9
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And we use the word "nothing."

10
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.

11
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My mother told me that, when I was a child,

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that I should always respect the little things.

13
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
What made me do this work? I shall go into my story.

14
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This all started when I was age five.

15
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
What made me do it? At school, I will admit this:

16
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
academically, I couldn't express myself.

17
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."

18
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
My world was seen as less.

19
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.

20
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I thought, I need to retreat

21
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
into something else.

22
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So when my mother used to take me to school,

23
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
she thought I was at school,

24
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned,

25
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.

26
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, the one time I was in the shed,

27
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and my mother suspected something,

28
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
thinking I was at school.

29
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.

30
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So you'd just see her feet.

31
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So I was hiding in the shed, like that.

33
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And all of a sudden ...

34
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And then I saw her legs.

35
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And then she said -- grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big --

36
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and she lifted me up and she says,

37
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"How come you're not at school?"

38
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I told her I couldn't face it because the way

39
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me,

40
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and using me as an example of failure.

41
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I told her.

42
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
At that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way,

43
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but I told her I didn't feel right.

44
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."

45
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And walked off. And I didn't expect that,

46
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because I expected one of these ...

47
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But I didn't get it.

48
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So I'm sitting there thinking.

49
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And as I looked down on the ground,

50
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I noticed there was some ants running around.

51
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And I went into this little fantasy world.

52
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And I thought,

53
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?

54
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Or do they need somewhere to live?"

55
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So I thought "Perhaps,

56
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
if I made these ants some apartments,

57
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they'll move in."

58
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So I did.

60
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.

61
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass,

62
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
constructed this little apartment.

63
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.

64
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.

65
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And so they did.

66
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
That was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments

67
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.

68
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.

69
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And then I sat down and all the ants came along.

70
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And all I could hear was "Is this for us?"

71
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And I say, "Yes, they're all for you."

73
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.

74
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And from there I was watching this little world.

76
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
It became part of me.

77
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
When I discovered that I had this gift,

78
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I wanted to experiment with this world

79
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that we can't see.

80
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So I realized that there was more to life

81
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
than just everything that we see around us that's huge.

82
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.

83
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother.

84
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
My mother told me to take it smaller.

85
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Now I shall show you something here.

86
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And I'll explain.

87
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
As you can see,

88
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that's a pinhead.

89
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Applause)

91
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now that is called the Huf Haus.

92
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The gentleman who commissioned me to do this

93
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
was a gentleman called Peter Huf.

94
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"

95
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?"

97
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And then he said to me,

99
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?"

100
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And I says, "Well, try me."

101
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."

102
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, to cut a long story short,

103
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I went home, went underneath the microscope,

104
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and I crushed up a piece of glass,

105
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
crushed it up.

106
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And underneath the microscope

107
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
there were splinters of glass.

108
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Some of them were quite jagged.

109
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So I was crushing up these pieces of glass,

110
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which, as you can see,

111
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that's the actual frame of the house.

112
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber,

113
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.

114
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

115
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So I got the teddy bear and I said,

116
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"

117
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So I did.

118
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat.

119
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So I decided to slice these up

120
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with the tool that I make

121
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.

122
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And then I actually

123
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
slow down my whole nervous system.

124
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And then I work between my heartbeat,

125
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I have one-and-a-half seconds

126
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to actually move.

127
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale

128
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
my own work, at the same time.

129
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

130
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Applause)

131
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Because that has happened to me.

132
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.

134
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I found these little bits of glass.

135
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I had to make them square.

136
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"

137
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.

138
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them.

139
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.

140
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.

141
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And then I started rubbing, very very gently,

142
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it.

143
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And how I constructed it,

144
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.

145
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.

146
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And as I was doing it, what happened?

147
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.

148
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And it went like this ...

149
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And then that was it.

150
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

151
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Gone.

152
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy

153
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
when I told him his house has gone to another,

154
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
into the atmosphere somewhere."

155
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So to cut the story short,

156
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I decided that I had to go back and do it.

157
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So I found some more. And I decided to, sort of,

158
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
construct it very, very slowly,

159
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
holding my breath, working between my heartbeat,

160
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and making sure everything is leveled.

161
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Because it's such a small sculpture,

162
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
nothing can go wrong.

163
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And I decided to build it up.

164
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Then I used fibers out of my jumper,

165
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which I held and stretched.

166
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And made the beams going around the house.

167
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And the actual windows and the balcony

168
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
had to be sort of constructed.

169
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I used a money spider's web

170
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to actually attach certain things,

171
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which sent me insane.

172
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But I managed to do it.

173
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And when I finished it, I came back the next day.

174
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I noticed that the house was occupied.

175
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Have we ever heard of a dust mite?

176
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Darren dust mite and his family moved in.

177
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

178
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So basically I'd completed the house.

179
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And there you are.

180
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
(Applause)

181
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Right. As you can see,

183
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Bart Simpson is having a little argument.

184
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.

185
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
There's not enough room for the two of them.

186
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.

187
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I think he was just warning him actually.

188
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But this one was made out of a nylon tag

189
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
out of my shirt.

190
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
What I did, I plucked the tag out

191
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and put it underneath the microscope.

192
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.

193
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?

194
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Audience: No.

195
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
WW: So what I did is the same process where I

196
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
just kind of hold my breath

197
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and just work away very, very slowly,

198
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.

199
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.

200
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Because it's on this molecular level things change

201
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and they act different.

202
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.

203
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And, you know, all different things happen.

204
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane,

205
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to stop it moving.

206
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Then static electricity set in.

207
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And it went ...

208
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything.

209
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So there is sweat dripping off my head,

210
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.

211
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And after I've cut out the shape,

212
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck.

213
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So after I've done the same thing,

214
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
then I have to paint it.

215
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And after I've actually sculpted them,

216
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I have to paint them.

217
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I experimented with a --

218
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I found a dead fly.

219
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.

220
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Decided to make a paintbrush.

221
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

222
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But I would never do it to a living fly.

223
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Because I've heard a fly in pain.

225
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And they go "Meow! Ow!"

226
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Even though they get on our nerves,

227
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
I would never kill an insect

228
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
because, "All creatures great and small" --

229
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
there is a hymn that says that.

230
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So what I decided to do

231
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is to pluck fine hair out of my face.

232
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.

233
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
That was the paintbrush.

234
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful,

235
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.

236
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And it starts to dry very quickly.

237
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So I have to be very quick.

238
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
If I'm not, it will end up looking

239
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
not like what it's supposed to look like.

240
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.

241
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So I have to be very very careful.

242
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
This one took me approximately,

243
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I would say, six to seven weeks.

244
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
My work, rough estimate,

245
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
sometimes five, six to seven weeks;

246
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
you can't always anticipate.

247
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause)

248
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
As you can see,

249
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.

250
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Laughter)

251
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
He says to me, "Willard" --

252
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
You can see him saying, "Why me?"

253
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why."

254
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.

255
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
That's just to show the scale

256
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and the actual size of the sculpture.

257
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I would say it probably measures ...

258
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
a quarter of a millimeter.

259
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
In America they say a period stop.

260
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So say if you cut a period stop in half,

261
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.

262
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
It's made -- the chariot is made of gold.

263
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber,

264
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
which I took out of the air.

265
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.

266
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And what I normally do is walk 'round a room --

267
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Laughter) --

268
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope.

269
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.

270
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.

271
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And she saw me walking around like this.

272
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Laughter)

273
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And then she looked at me.

274
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And then I went ...

275
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."

276
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Yeah, to actually do this thing --

277
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the actual chariot is made of gold.

278
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I had a 24-karat gold ring.

279
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And I cut off a little flake of gold.

280
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And I bent it 'round,

281
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and made it into the chariot.

282
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And the horse is made from nylon.

283
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.

284
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
To get the symmetrical shape of the horse

285
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
was very difficult,

286
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
because I had to get the horse to rear up

287
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and look as though it was in some kind of action.

288
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
When I did this one,

289
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
a gentleman seen it and said to me,

290
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
"There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.

291
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
There's no way a man can do that.

292
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It must be a machine."

293
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..."

294
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Laughter)

295
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Applause)

296
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
That one took me approximately six weeks.

297
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Applause)

298
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
The most famous statue in the world.

299
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
This one, I would say,

300
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
was a serious challenge.

301
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Laughter)

302
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Because I had to put the torch on the top.

303
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
That one is, more or less, the same type of process.

304
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand,

305
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.

306
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I used a microscopic shard of diamond

307
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
to actually carve the actual base.

308
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this,

309
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
because that statue has always sort of

310
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
kept an image in my head of, you know,

311
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
the beginning of people coming to America.

312
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.

313
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And that's the first thing they saw.

314
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
So I wanted to have that little image.

315
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And this is it.

316
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Laughter)

317
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
And we all know that is the Hulk.

318
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.

319
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Because we know we see needles,

320
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle

321
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
apart from putting a thread through it.

322
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So I broke the needle.

323
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And made a needle look like

324
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
the Hulk's broken it.

325
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
It's -- I had to make little holes

326
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.

327
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So most of my work, I don't use glue.

328
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
They go in with their own friction.

329
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And that's how I managed to do it.

330
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
As you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face.

331
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And his mouth must be probably about

332
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:35,000
three microns.

333
0:17:35.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.

334
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
That ship there,

335
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
that's made from 24-karat gold.

336
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.

337
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But I had to rig it with strands of glue.

338
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane,

339
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
because I couldn't get the web to move off.

340
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
And that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it.

341
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Constructed each plank of gold.

342
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.

343
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.

344
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.

345
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
(Applause)

346
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
As you can see, dressage.

347
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
(Laughter)

348
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.

349
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:39,000
The actual rigging on the reins on the horse

350
0:18:39.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
are made from the same sort of thing.

351
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And that was done with a particle from my shirt.

352
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
And the pinhead I've made green around there

353
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
by scraping the particles off a green shirt

354
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and then pressed onto the needle.

355
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
It's very painstaking work,

356
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
but the best things come in small packages.

357
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
(Laughter)

358
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Bruno Giussani: Willard Wigan!

359
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
(Applause)

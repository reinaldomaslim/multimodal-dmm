2
0:00:15.865,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I essentially drag sledges for a living,

3
0:00:17.619,000 --> 0:00:2,000
so it doesn't take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually,

4
0:00:20.803,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but I'm going to read this question

5
0:00:22.345,000 --> 0:00:24,000
from an interview earlier this year:

6
0:00:24.812,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"Philosophically, does the constant supply of information

7
0:00:28.204,000 --> 0:00:3,000
steal our ability to imagine

8
0:00:30.939,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or replace our dreams of achieving?

9
0:00:33.755,000 --> 0:00:35,000
After all, if it is being done somewhere by someone,

10
0:00:36.541,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we can participate virtually,

11
0:00:38.844,000 --> 0:00:41,000
then why bother leaving the house?"

12
0:00:42.345,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I'm usually introduced as a polar explorer.

13
0:00:44.994,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'm not sure that's the most progressive or 21st-century

14
0:00:47.295,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of job titles, but I've spent more than two percent now

15
0:00:52.061,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle,

16
0:00:55.789,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so I get out of the house a fair bit.

17
0:00:59.316,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And in my nature, I guess, I am a doer of things

18
0:01:02.863,000 --> 0:01:06,000
more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things,

19
0:01:07.355,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it's that dichotomy, the gulf between ideas and action

20
0:01:11.579,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that I'm going to try and explore briefly.

21
0:01:14.445,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The pithiest answer to the question "why?"

22
0:01:17.778,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that's been dogging me for the last 12 years

23
0:01:20.146,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was credited certainly to this chap, the rakish-looking gentleman

24
0:01:22.93,000 --> 0:01:24,000
standing at the back, second from the left,

25
0:01:25.186,000 --> 0:01:27,000
George Lee Mallory. Many of you will know his name.

26
0:01:27.824,000 --> 0:01:3,000
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds

27
0:01:31.813,000 --> 0:01:32,000
near the summit of Mt. Everest.

28
0:01:33.487,000 --> 0:01:36,000
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest,

29
0:01:36.742,000 --> 0:01:37,000
more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary.

30
0:01:38.718,000 --> 0:01:4,000
No one knows if he got to the top. It's still a mystery.

31
0:01:41.414,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But he was credited with coining the phrase, "Because it's there."

32
0:01:44.483,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now I'm not actually sure that he did say that.

33
0:01:47.173,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There's very little evidence to suggest it, but what he did say

34
0:01:49.499,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is actually far nicer,

35
0:01:51.979,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and again, I've printed this. I'm going to read it out.

36
0:01:55.033,000 --> 0:01:56,000
"The first question which you will ask

37
0:01:56.987,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and which I must try to answer is this:

38
0:01:59.484,000 --> 0:02:02,000
What is the use of climbing Mt. Everest?

39
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And my answer must at once be, it is no use.

40
0:02:05.948,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever.

41
0:02:09.709,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior

42
0:02:11.582,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of the human body at high altitudes,

43
0:02:13.664,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and possibly medical men may turn our observation

44
0:02:16.328,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to some account for the purposes of aviation,

45
0:02:19.357,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but otherwise nothing will come of it.

46
0:02:21.557,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver,

47
0:02:23.943,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and not a gem, nor any coal or iron.

48
0:02:26.542,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted

49
0:02:29.341,000 --> 0:02:33,000
with crops to raise food. So it is no use.

50
0:02:33.483,000 --> 0:02:34,000
If you cannot understand that there is something in man

51
0:02:35.142,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which responds to the challenge of this mountain

52
0:02:37.814,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and goes out to meet it, that the struggle

53
0:02:41.037,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward,

54
0:02:45.491,000 --> 0:02:48,000
then you won't see why we go.

55
0:02:48.739,000 --> 0:02:51,000
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy,

56
0:02:51.868,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and joy, after all, is the end of life.

57
0:02:54.802,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We don't live to eat and make money.

58
0:02:57.005,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.

59
0:02:59.467,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That is what life means, and that is what life is for."

60
0:03:04.375,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Mallory's argument that leaving the house,

61
0:03:07.829,000 --> 0:03:09,000
embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun,

62
0:03:10.272,000 --> 0:03:13,000
however, doesn't tally that neatly with my own experience.

63
0:03:14.178,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The furthest I've ever got away from my front door

64
0:03:17.58,000 --> 0:03:2,000
was in the spring of 2004. I still don't know exactly

65
0:03:20.724,000 --> 0:03:22,000
what came over me, but my plan was to make

66
0:03:23.231,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean.

67
0:03:27.474,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia

68
0:03:30.031,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to the North Pole, and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada.

69
0:03:33.363,000 --> 0:03:35,000
No one had ever done this. I was 26 at the time.

70
0:03:36.271,000 --> 0:03:38,000
A lot of experts were saying it was impossible,

71
0:03:38.523,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and my mum certainly wasn't very keen on the idea.

72
0:03:41.877,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:44.23,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The journey from a small weather station on the north coast

74
0:03:47.156,000 --> 0:03:49,000
of Siberia up to my final starting point,

75
0:03:49.341,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the edge of the pack ice, the coast of the Arctic Ocean,

76
0:03:51.893,000 --> 0:03:54,000
took about five hours, and if anyone watched fearless

77
0:03:55.354,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Felix Baumgartner going up, rather than just coming down,

78
0:03:58.666,000 --> 0:04:,000
you'll appreciate the sense of apprehension,

79
0:04:01.27,000 --> 0:04:04,000
as I sat in a helicopter thundering north,

80
0:04:04.582,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and the sense, I think if anything, of impending doom.

81
0:04:07.239,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into.

82
0:04:10.929,000 --> 0:04:12,000
There was a bit of fun, a bit of joy.

83
0:04:12.973,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I was 26. I remember sitting there

84
0:04:14.814,000 --> 0:04:16,000
looking down at my sledge. I had my skis ready to go,

85
0:04:17.406,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I had a satellite phone, a pump-action shotgun

86
0:04:19.647,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in case I was attacked by a polar bear.

87
0:04:21.67,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter.

88
0:04:23.961,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn,

89
0:04:27.447,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne

90
0:04:30.312,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and Wilfred Thesiger. Part of me

91
0:04:33.204,000 --> 0:04:39,000
felt quite proud of myself, but mostly I was just utterly terrified.

92
0:04:39.526,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And that journey lasted 10 weeks, 72 days.

93
0:04:41.616,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I didn't see anyone else. We took this photo next to the helicopter.

94
0:04:44.115,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Beyond that, I didn't see anyone for 10 weeks.

95
0:04:46.674,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea,

96
0:04:48.616,000 --> 0:04:51,000
so I'm traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean.

97
0:04:51.877,000 --> 0:04:55,000
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began.

98
0:04:55.987,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies,

99
0:04:59.643,000 --> 0:05:01,000
about 400 pounds. The average temperature for the 10 weeks

100
0:05:02.244,000 --> 0:05:04,000
was minus 35. Minus 50 was the coldest.

101
0:05:04.935,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So again, there wasn't an awful lot of joy or fun to be had.

102
0:05:12.214,000 --> 0:05:13,000
One of the magical things about this journey, however,

103
0:05:13.747,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is that because I'm walking over the sea,

104
0:05:15.85,000 --> 0:05:19,000
over this floating, drifting, shifting crust of ice

105
0:05:19.912,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that's floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is

106
0:05:22.107,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it's an environment that's in a constant state of flux.

107
0:05:24.055,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The ice is always moving, breaking up, drifting around,

108
0:05:26.401,000 --> 0:05:29,000
refreezing, so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months

109
0:05:29.861,000 --> 0:05:32,000
was unique to me. No one else will ever, could ever,

110
0:05:33.308,000 --> 0:05:38,000
possibly see the views, the vistas, that I saw for 10 weeks.

111
0:05:38.337,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And that, I guess, is probably the finest argument for leaving the house.

112
0:05:42.3,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I can try to tell you what it was like,

113
0:05:46.182,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but you'll never know what it was like,

114
0:05:48.027,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely,

115
0:05:50.955,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles,

116
0:05:54.674,000 --> 0:05:58,000
it was cold, nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day,

117
0:05:58.979,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the more words fall short, and I'm unable to do it justice.

118
0:06:02.811,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And it seems to me, therefore, that the doing,

119
0:06:07.002,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you know, to try to experience, to engage, to endeavor,

120
0:06:12.3,000 --> 0:06:17,000
rather than to watch and to wonder, that's where

121
0:06:17.686,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the real meat of life is to be found,

122
0:06:19.912,000 --> 0:06:22,000
the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days.

123
0:06:23.856,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And I would add a cautionary note here, however.

124
0:06:26.339,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In my experience, there is something addictive

125
0:06:28.427,000 --> 0:06:32,000
about tasting life at the very edge of what's humanly possible.

126
0:06:32.866,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now I don't just mean in the field of

127
0:06:35.101,000 --> 0:06:37,000
daft macho Edwardian style derring-do,

128
0:06:37.388,000 --> 0:06:39,000
but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer,

129
0:06:39.581,000 --> 0:06:4,000
there is something addictive about this, and in my case,

130
0:06:41.488,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed

131
0:06:44.038,000 --> 0:06:45,000
from having a crack habit.

132
0:06:45.42,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I can't explain quite how good it is until you've tried it,

133
0:06:49.125,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on,

134
0:06:52.942,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to ruin every relationship I've ever had,

135
0:06:56.52,000 --> 0:07:,000
so be careful what you wish for.

136
0:07:00.921,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Mallory postulated that there is something in man

137
0:07:03.302,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that responds to the challenge of the mountain,

138
0:07:05.942,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and I wonder if that's the case whether there's something

139
0:07:07.968,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the challenge itself, in the endeavor, and particularly

140
0:07:11.025,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in the big, unfinished, chunky challenges that face humanity

141
0:07:14.137,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that call out to us, and in my experience that's certainly the case.

142
0:07:18.453,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There is one unfinished challenge

143
0:07:20.233,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that's been calling out to me for most of my adult life.

144
0:07:23.505,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Many of you will know the story.

145
0:07:24.933,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team.

146
0:07:27.524,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try

147
0:07:29.397,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to become the first person to reach the South Pole.

148
0:07:32.664,000 --> 0:07:33,000
No one knew what was there. It was utterly unmapped

149
0:07:34.488,000 --> 0:07:36,000
at the time. We knew more about the surface of the moon

150
0:07:36.513,000 --> 0:07:38,000
than we did about the heart of Antarctica.

151
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Scott, as many of you will know, was beaten to it

152
0:07:42.176,000 --> 0:07:44,000
by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team,

153
0:07:44.469,000 --> 0:07:46,000
who used dogs and dogsleds. Scott's team were on foot,

154
0:07:46.824,000 --> 0:07:48,000
all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges,

155
0:07:49.245,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there,

156
0:07:53.677,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I'd imagine pretty bitter and demoralized.

157
0:07:56.935,000 --> 0:07:58,000
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast

158
0:07:59.205,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and all five died on that return journey.

159
0:08:02.793,000 --> 0:08:04,000
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that

160
0:08:05.027,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it's all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure.

161
0:08:08.653,000 --> 0:08:09,000
When I talk about Antarctica, people often say,

162
0:08:09.94,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"Hasn't, you know, that's interesting,

163
0:08:11.23,000 --> 0:08:14,000
hasn't that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike?"

164
0:08:14.423,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Or, "That's nice. You know, my grandmother's going

165
0:08:18.013,000 --> 0:08:2,000
on a cruise to Antarctica next year. You know.

166
0:08:20.643,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Is there a chance you'll see her there?"

167
0:08:23.509,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:25.327,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But Scott's journey remains unfinished.

169
0:08:28.541,000 --> 0:08:3,000
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica

170
0:08:30.868,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to the South Pole and back again.

171
0:08:32.665,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It is, arguably, the most audacious endeavor

172
0:08:35.439,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of that Edwardian golden age of exploration,

173
0:08:38.064,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and it seemed to me high time, given everything

174
0:08:40.617,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we have figured out in the century since

175
0:08:42.538,000 --> 0:08:45,000
from scurvy to solar panels, that it was high time

176
0:08:46.119,000 --> 0:08:47,000
someone had a go at finishing the job.

177
0:08:47.896,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So that's precisely what I'm setting out to do.

178
0:08:50.592,000 --> 0:08:52,000
This time next year, in October, I'm leading a team of three.

179
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
It will take us about four months to make this return journey.

180
0:08:56.019,000 --> 0:08:59,000
That's the scale. The red line is obviously halfway to the pole.

181
0:08:59.072,000 --> 0:09:,000
We have to turn around and come back again.

182
0:09:00.466,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I'm well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be

183
0:09:02.713,000 --> 0:09:04,000
blogging and tweeting. You'll be able to live

184
0:09:05.448,000 --> 0:09:07,000
vicariously and virtually through this journey

185
0:09:07.881,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in a way that no one has ever before.

186
0:09:10.888,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And it'll also be a four-month chance for me to finally

187
0:09:13.471,000 --> 0:09:16,000
come up with a pithy answer to the question, "Why?"

188
0:09:17.345,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable

189
0:09:22.278,000 --> 0:09:24,000
than they have ever been. There certainly isn't much call

190
0:09:24.86,000 --> 0:09:27,000
for explorers nowadays. My career advisor at school

191
0:09:28.718,000 --> 0:09:3,000
never mentioned it as an option.

192
0:09:31.359,000 --> 0:09:33,000
If I wanted to know, for example,

193
0:09:33.781,000 --> 0:09:35,000
how many stars were in the Milky Way,

194
0:09:36.077,000 --> 0:09:38,000
how old those giant heads on Easter Island were,

195
0:09:38.656,000 --> 0:09:4,000
most of you could find that out right now

196
0:09:40.781,000 --> 0:09:42,000
without even standing up.

197
0:09:43.607,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And yet, if I've learned anything in nearly 12 years now

198
0:09:46.372,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of dragging heavy things around cold places,

199
0:09:49.459,000 --> 0:09:52,000
it is that true, real inspiration and growth

200
0:09:53.418,000 --> 0:09:57,000
only comes from adversity and from challenge,

201
0:09:57.678,000 --> 0:10:,000
from stepping away from what's comfortable and familiar

202
0:10:00.694,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and stepping out into the unknown.

203
0:10:03.175,000 --> 0:10:06,000
In life, we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to,

204
0:10:06.716,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and I think metaphorically speaking, at least,

205
0:10:08.525,000 --> 0:10:1,000
we could all benefit from getting outside the house

206
0:10:11.395,000 --> 0:10:14,000
a little more often, if only we could summon up the courage.

207
0:10:15.276,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit

208
0:10:18.501,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and take a look at what's outside.

209
0:10:21.397,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Thank you very much.

210
0:10:22.625,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Applause)

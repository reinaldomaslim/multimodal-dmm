1
0:00:12.535,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I am a computer science and engineering professor here at Carnegie Mellon,

2
0:00:15.98,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and my research focuses on usable privacy and security,

3
0:00:20.228,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and so my friends like to give me examples

4
0:00:22.996,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of their frustrations with computing systems,

5
0:00:25.198,000 --> 0:00:28,000
especially frustrations related to

6
0:00:28.552,000 --> 0:00:32,000
unusable privacy and security.

7
0:00:32.664,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So passwords are something that I hear a lot about.

8
0:00:35.375,000 --> 0:00:37,000
A lot of people are frustrated with passwords,

9
0:00:38.255,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and it's bad enough

10
0:00:39.949,000 --> 0:00:41,000
when you have to have one really good password

11
0:00:42.593,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that you can remember

12
0:00:44.415,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but nobody else is going to be able to guess.

13
0:00:47.309,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But what do you do when you have accounts

14
0:00:48.946,000 --> 0:00:49,000
on a hundred different systems

15
0:00:50.754,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and you're supposed to have a unique password

16
0:00:53.03,000 --> 0:00:56,000
for each of these systems?

17
0:00:56.067,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's tough.

18
0:00:58.251,000 --> 0:00:59,000
At Carnegie Mellon, they used to make it

19
0:01:00.01,000 --> 0:01:01,000
actually pretty easy for us

20
0:01:01.309,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to remember our passwords.

21
0:01:03.046,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The password requirement up through 2009

22
0:01:05.449,000 --> 0:01:07,000
was just that you had to have a password

23
0:01:07.828,000 --> 0:01:09,000
with at least one character.

24
0:01:10.039,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Pretty easy. But then they changed things,

25
0:01:12.927,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and at the end of 2009, they announced

26
0:01:15.597,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that we were going to have a new policy,

27
0:01:17.973,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and this new policy required

28
0:01:19.836,000 --> 0:01:21,000
passwords that were at least eight characters long,

29
0:01:22.517,000 --> 0:01:23,000
with an uppercase letter, lowercase letter,

30
0:01:24.292,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a digit, a symbol,

31
0:01:25.58,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you couldn't use the same character more than three times,

32
0:01:28.218,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and it wasn't allowed to be in a dictionary.

33
0:01:30.652,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, when they implemented this new policy,

34
0:01:32.834,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a lot of people, my colleagues and friends,

35
0:01:35.144,000 --> 0:01:36,000
came up to me and they said, "Wow,

36
0:01:36.998,000 --> 0:01:37,000
now that's really unusable.

37
0:01:38.51,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Why are they doing this to us,

38
0:01:39.703,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and why didn't you stop them?"

39
0:01:41.414,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And I said, "Well, you know what?

40
0:01:42.77,000 --> 0:01:43,000
They didn't ask me."

41
0:01:44.278,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But I got curious, and I decided to go talk

42
0:01:47.743,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to the people in charge of our computer systems

43
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and find out what led them to introduce

44
0:01:52.511,000 --> 0:01:53,000
this new policy,

45
0:01:54.359,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and they said that the university

46
0:01:55.943,000 --> 0:01:57,000
had joined a consortium of universities,

47
0:01:58.309,000 --> 0:02:,000
and one of the requirements of membership

48
0:02:00.943,000 --> 0:02:02,000
was that we had to have stronger passwords

49
0:02:03.191,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that complied with some new requirements,

50
0:02:05.463,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and these requirements were that our passwords

51
0:02:07.567,000 --> 0:02:08,000
had to have a lot of entropy.

52
0:02:09.171,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now entropy is a complicated term,

53
0:02:11.449,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but basically it measures the strength of passwords.

54
0:02:14.247,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But the thing is, there isn't actually

55
0:02:16.226,000 --> 0:02:17,000
a standard measure of entropy.

56
0:02:18.175,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, the National Institute of Standards and Technology

57
0:02:20.574,000 --> 0:02:21,000
has a set of guidelines

58
0:02:22.127,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which have some rules of thumb

59
0:02:24.695,000 --> 0:02:25,000
for measuring entropy,

60
0:02:26.135,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but they don't have anything too specific,

61
0:02:29.03,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and the reason they only have rules of thumb

62
0:02:31.367,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is it turns out they don't actually have any good data

63
0:02:34.503,000 --> 0:02:35,000
on passwords.

64
0:02:36.023,000 --> 0:02:38,000
In fact, their report states,

65
0:02:38.335,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"Unfortunately, we do not have much data

66
0:02:40.663,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on the passwords users choose under particular rules.

67
0:02:43.505,000 --> 0:02:45,000
NIST would like to obtain more data

68
0:02:45.838,000 --> 0:02:47,000
on the passwords users actually choose,

69
0:02:48.3,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but system administrators are understandably reluctant

70
0:02:50.763,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to reveal password data to others."

71
0:02:53.703,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So this is a problem, but our research group

72
0:02:56.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
looked at it as an opportunity.

73
0:02:58.94,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We said, "Well, there's a need for good password data.

74
0:03:02.04,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Maybe we can collect some good password data

75
0:03:04.188,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and actually advance the state of the art here.

76
0:03:06.892,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So the first thing we did is,

77
0:03:08.564,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we got a bag of candy bars

78
0:03:10.12,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and we walked around campus

79
0:03:11.206,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and talked to students, faculty and staff,

80
0:03:14.004,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and asked them for information

81
0:03:15.534,000 --> 0:03:16,000
about their passwords.

82
0:03:17.086,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now we didn't say, "Give us your password."

83
0:03:20.09,000 --> 0:03:22,000
No, we just asked them about their password.

84
0:03:22.751,000 --> 0:03:23,000
How long is it? Does it have a digit?

85
0:03:24.229,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Does it have a symbol?

86
0:03:25.297,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And were you annoyed at having to create

87
0:03:27.342,000 --> 0:03:29,000
a new one last week?

88
0:03:30.086,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So we got results from 470 students,

89
0:03:33.292,000 --> 0:03:33,000
faculty and staff,

90
0:03:34.263,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and indeed we confirmed that the new policy

91
0:03:36.777,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was very annoying,

92
0:03:38.23,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but we also found that people said

93
0:03:40.022,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they felt more secure with these new passwords.

94
0:03:43.152,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We found that most people knew

95
0:03:45.458,000 --> 0:03:47,000
they were not supposed to write their password down,

96
0:03:47.61,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and only 13 percent of them did,

97
0:03:50.001,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but disturbingly, 80 percent of people

98
0:03:52.417,000 --> 0:03:54,000
said they were reusing their password.

99
0:03:54.541,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Now, this is actually more dangerous

100
0:03:56.337,000 --> 0:03:58,000
than writing your password down,

101
0:03:58.359,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because it makes you much more susceptible to attackers.

102
0:04:01.92,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So if you have to, write your passwords down,

103
0:04:05.038,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but don't reuse them.

104
0:04:06.837,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We also found some interesting things

105
0:04:08.588,000 --> 0:04:1,000
about the symbols people use in passwords.

106
0:04:11.549,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So CMU allows 32 possible symbols,

107
0:04:14.348,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but as you can see, there's only a small number

108
0:04:16.781,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that most people are using,

109
0:04:18.583,000 --> 0:04:2,000
so we're not actually getting very much strength

110
0:04:21.524,000 --> 0:04:23,000
from the symbols in our passwords.

111
0:04:23.99,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So this was a really interesting study,

112
0:04:26.701,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and now we had data from 470 people,

113
0:04:29.165,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but in the scheme of things,

114
0:04:30.47,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that's really not very much password data,

115
0:04:33.05,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and so we looked around to see

116
0:04:34.495,000 --> 0:04:36,000
where could we find additional password data?

117
0:04:37.055,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So it turns out there are a lot of people

118
0:04:39.231,000 --> 0:04:41,000
going around stealing passwords,

119
0:04:41.433,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and they often go and post these passwords

120
0:04:43.91,000 --> 0:04:44,000
on the Internet.

121
0:04:45.247,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So we were able to get access

122
0:04:46.92,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to some of these stolen password sets.

123
0:04:50.89,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This is still not really ideal for research, though,

124
0:04:53.218,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because it's not entirely clear

125
0:04:55.255,000 --> 0:04:57,000
where all of these passwords came from,

126
0:04:57.439,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or exactly what policies were in effect

127
0:04:59.681,000 --> 0:05:01,000
when people created these passwords.

128
0:05:01.789,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So we wanted to find some better source of data.

129
0:05:05.341,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So we decided that one thing we could do

130
0:05:06.975,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is we could do a study and have people

131
0:05:09.104,000 --> 0:05:12,000
actually create passwords for our study.

132
0:05:12.344,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So we used a service called Amazon Mechanical Turk,

133
0:05:15.165,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and this is a service where you can post

134
0:05:17.499,000 --> 0:05:19,000
a small job online that takes a minute,

135
0:05:19.803,000 --> 0:05:2,000
a few minutes, an hour,

136
0:05:21.303,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and pay people, a penny, ten cents, a few dollars,

137
0:05:23.887,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to do a task for you,

138
0:05:25.233,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and then you pay them through Amazon.com.

139
0:05:27.355,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So we paid people about 50 cents

140
0:05:29.649,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to create a password following our rules

141
0:05:32.245,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and answering a survey,

142
0:05:33.655,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and then we paid them again to come back

143
0:05:36.18,000 --> 0:05:38,000
two days later and log in

144
0:05:38.251,000 --> 0:05:4,000
using their password and answering another survey.

145
0:05:40.825,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So we did this, and we collected 5,000 passwords,

146
0:05:45.289,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and we gave people a bunch of different policies

147
0:05:47.984,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to create passwords with.

148
0:05:49.492,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So some people had a pretty easy policy,

149
0:05:51.402,000 --> 0:05:52,000
we call it Basic8,

150
0:05:52.941,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and here the only rule was that your password

151
0:05:55.087,000 --> 0:05:58,000
had to have at least eight characters.

152
0:05:58.503,000 --> 0:06:,000
Then some people had a much harder policy,

153
0:06:00.754,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and this was very similar to the CMU policy,

154
0:06:03.291,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that it had to have eight characters

155
0:06:05.225,000 --> 0:06:07,000
including uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol,

156
0:06:07.601,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and pass a dictionary check.

157
0:06:09.99,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And one of the other policies we tried,

158
0:06:11.325,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and there were a whole bunch more,

159
0:06:12.595,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but one of the ones we tried was called Basic16,

160
0:06:14.835,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and the only requirement here

161
0:06:17.467,000 --> 0:06:2,000
was that your password had to have at least 16 characters.

162
0:06:20.62,000 --> 0:06:22,000
All right, so now we had 5,000 passwords,

163
0:06:23.078,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and so we had much more detailed information.

164
0:06:26.641,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Again we see that there's only a small number

165
0:06:29.2,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of symbols that people are actually using

166
0:06:31.115,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in their passwords.

167
0:06:33.001,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We also wanted to get an idea of how strong

168
0:06:35.6,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the passwords were that people were creating,

169
0:06:38.371,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but as you may recall, there isn't a good measure

170
0:06:40.991,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of password strength.

171
0:06:42.745,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So what we decided to do was to see

172
0:06:45.057,000 --> 0:06:47,000
how long it would take to crack these passwords

173
0:06:47.427,000 --> 0:06:48,000
using the best cracking tools

174
0:06:48.841,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that the bad guys are using,

175
0:06:50.649,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or that we could find information about

176
0:06:52.665,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in the research literature.

177
0:06:54.202,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So to give you an idea of how bad guys

178
0:06:56.96,000 --> 0:06:58,000
go about cracking passwords,

179
0:06:59.13,000 --> 0:07:,000
they will steal a password file

180
0:07:01.081,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that will have all of the passwords

181
0:07:03.234,000 --> 0:07:05,000
in kind of a scrambled form, called a hash,

182
0:07:06.123,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and so what they'll do is they'll make a guess

183
0:07:08.685,000 --> 0:07:09,000
as to what a password is,

184
0:07:10.397,000 --> 0:07:11,000
run it through a hashing function,

185
0:07:12.294,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and see whether it matches

186
0:07:14.059,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the passwords they have on their stolen password list.

187
0:07:18.009,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So a dumb attacker will try every password in order.

188
0:07:21.114,000 --> 0:07:24,000
They'll start with AAAAA and move on to AAAAB,

189
0:07:24.682,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and this is going to take a really long time

190
0:07:27.1,000 --> 0:07:28,000
before they get any passwords

191
0:07:28.626,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that people are really likely to actually have.

192
0:07:31.323,000 --> 0:07:33,000
A smart attacker, on the other hand,

193
0:07:33.506,000 --> 0:07:34,000
does something much more clever.

194
0:07:34.892,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They look at the passwords

195
0:07:36.718,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that are known to be popular

196
0:07:38.518,000 --> 0:07:39,000
from these stolen password sets,

197
0:07:40.245,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and they guess those first.

198
0:07:41.434,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So they're going to start by guessing "password,"

199
0:07:43.568,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and then they'll guess "I love you," and "monkey,"

200
0:07:46.319,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and "12345678,"

201
0:07:48.902,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because these are the passwords

202
0:07:50.214,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that are most likely for people to have.

203
0:07:52.119,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In fact, some of you probably have these passwords.

204
0:07:57.191,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So what we found

205
0:07:58.489,000 --> 0:08:01,000
by running all of these 5,000 passwords we collected

206
0:08:01.895,000 --> 0:08:05,000
through these tests to see how strong they were,

207
0:08:06.001,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we found that the long passwords

208
0:08:08.753,000 --> 0:08:09,000
were actually pretty strong,

209
0:08:10.033,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and the complex passwords were pretty strong too.

210
0:08:13.295,000 --> 0:08:15,000
However, when we looked at the survey data,

211
0:08:15.737,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we saw that people were really frustrated

212
0:08:18.761,000 --> 0:08:2,000
by the very complex passwords,

213
0:08:21.1,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and the long passwords were a lot more usable,

214
0:08:23.73,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and in some cases, they were actually

215
0:08:25.055,000 --> 0:08:27,000
even stronger than the complex passwords.

216
0:08:27.963,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So this suggests that,

217
0:08:29.132,000 --> 0:08:3,000
instead of telling people that they need

218
0:08:30.835,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to put all these symbols and numbers

219
0:08:32.357,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and crazy things into their passwords,

220
0:08:35.199,000 --> 0:08:37,000
we might be better off just telling people

221
0:08:37.221,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to have long passwords.

222
0:08:39.873,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Now here's the problem, though:

223
0:08:41.665,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Some people had long passwords

224
0:08:43.92,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that actually weren't very strong.

225
0:08:45.475,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You can make long passwords

226
0:08:47.472,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that are still the sort of thing

227
0:08:49.028,000 --> 0:08:5,000
that an attacker could easily guess.

228
0:08:50.77,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So we need to do more than just say long passwords.

229
0:08:54.135,000 --> 0:08:55,000
There has to be some additional requirements,

230
0:08:56.071,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and some of our ongoing research is looking at

231
0:08:59.04,000 --> 0:09:01,000
what additional requirements we should add

232
0:09:01.479,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to make for stronger passwords

233
0:09:03.583,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that also are going to be easy for people

234
0:09:05.895,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to remember and type.

235
0:09:08.593,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Another approach to getting people to have

236
0:09:10.719,000 --> 0:09:12,000
stronger passwords is to use a password meter.

237
0:09:12.976,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Here are some examples.

238
0:09:14.361,000 --> 0:09:15,000
You may have seen these on the Internet

239
0:09:15.762,000 --> 0:09:18,000
when you were creating passwords.

240
0:09:18.819,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We decided to do a study to find out

241
0:09:21.067,000 --> 0:09:23,000
whether these password meters actually work.

242
0:09:23.954,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Do they actually help people

243
0:09:25.375,000 --> 0:09:26,000
have stronger passwords,

244
0:09:26.828,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and if so, which ones are better?

245
0:09:28.914,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So we tested password meters that were

246
0:09:31.421,000 --> 0:09:33,000
different sizes, shapes, colors,

247
0:09:33.519,000 --> 0:09:34,000
different words next to them,

248
0:09:34.935,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and we even tested one that was a dancing bunny.

249
0:09:38.21,000 --> 0:09:39,000
As you type a better password,

250
0:09:39.792,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the bunny dances faster and faster.

251
0:09:42.331,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So this was pretty fun.

252
0:09:44.86,000 --> 0:09:45,000
What we found

253
0:09:46.427,000 --> 0:09:49,000
was that password meters do work.

254
0:09:49.999,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

255
0:09:51.8,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Most of the password meters were actually effective,

256
0:09:55.133,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and the dancing bunny was very effective too,

257
0:09:57.654,000 --> 0:09:59,000
but the password meters that were the most effective

258
0:10:00.535,000 --> 0:10:02,000
were the ones that made you work harder

259
0:10:02.89,000 --> 0:10:03,000
before they gave you that thumbs up and said

260
0:10:04.87,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you were doing a good job,

261
0:10:06.247,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and in fact we found that most

262
0:10:07.759,000 --> 0:10:09,000
of the password meters on the Internet today

263
0:10:10.04,000 --> 0:10:1,000
are too soft.

264
0:10:10.992,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They tell you you're doing a good job too early,

265
0:10:13.195,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and if they would just wait a little bit

266
0:10:15.124,000 --> 0:10:17,000
before giving you that positive feedback,

267
0:10:17.173,000 --> 0:10:2,000
you probably would have better passwords.

268
0:10:20.333,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now another approach to better passwords, perhaps,

269
0:10:24.18,000 --> 0:10:26,000
is to use pass phrases instead of passwords.

270
0:10:27.07,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago,

271
0:10:30.488,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the cartoonist suggests

272
0:10:32.162,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that we should all use pass phrases,

273
0:10:34.358,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and if you look at the second row of this cartoon,

274
0:10:37.528,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you can see the cartoonist is suggesting

275
0:10:39.385,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that the pass phrase "correct horse battery staple"

276
0:10:42.826,000 --> 0:10:44,000
would be a very strong pass phrase

277
0:10:45.307,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and something really easy to remember.

278
0:10:47.223,000 --> 0:10:49,000
He says, in fact, you've already remembered it.

279
0:10:50.02,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And so we decided to do a research study

280
0:10:52.17,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to find out whether this was true or not.

281
0:10:54.762,000 --> 0:10:55,000
In fact, everybody who I talk to,

282
0:10:56.537,000 --> 0:10:58,000
who I mention I'm doing password research,

283
0:10:58.579,000 --> 0:10:59,000
they point out this cartoon.

284
0:10:59.979,000 --> 0:11:,000
"Oh, have you seen it? That xkcd.

285
0:11:01.553,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Correct horse battery staple."

286
0:11:03.155,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So we did the research study to see

287
0:11:04.961,000 --> 0:11:06,000
what would actually happen.

288
0:11:07.32,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So in our study, we used Mechanical Turk again,

289
0:11:10.38,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and we had the computer pick the random words

290
0:11:14.547,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in the pass phrase.

291
0:11:15.647,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now the reason we did this

292
0:11:16.8,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is that humans are not very good

293
0:11:18.386,000 --> 0:11:19,000
at picking random words.

294
0:11:19.77,000 --> 0:11:2,000
If we asked a human to do it,

295
0:11:21.032,000 --> 0:11:23,000
they would pick things that were not very random.

296
0:11:24.03,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So we tried a few different conditions.

297
0:11:26.062,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In one condition, the computer picked

298
0:11:28.152,000 --> 0:11:3,000
from a dictionary of the very common words

299
0:11:30.368,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in the English language,

300
0:11:31.73,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and so you'd get pass phrases like

301
0:11:33.494,000 --> 0:11:34,000
"try there three come."

302
0:11:35.418,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And we looked at that, and we said,

303
0:11:37.15,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"Well, that doesn't really seem very memorable."

304
0:11:40.2,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So then we tried picking words

305
0:11:42.44,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that came from specific parts of speech,

306
0:11:44.961,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so how about noun-verb-adjective-noun.

307
0:11:47.143,000 --> 0:11:49,000
That comes up with something that's sort of sentence-like.

308
0:11:49.72,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So you can get a pass phrase like

309
0:11:51.79,000 --> 0:11:52,000
"plan builds sure power"

310
0:11:53.098,000 --> 0:11:55,000
or "end determines red drug."

311
0:11:55.884,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And these seemed a little bit more memorable,

312
0:11:58.56,000 --> 0:12:,000
and maybe people would like those a little bit better.

313
0:12:01.382,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We wanted to compare them with passwords,

314
0:12:03.954,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and so we had the computer pick random passwords,

315
0:12:07.15,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and these were nice and short, but as you can see,

316
0:12:09.14,000 --> 0:12:11,000
they don't really look very memorable.

317
0:12:11.946,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And then we decided to try something called

318
0:12:13.342,000 --> 0:12:14,000
a pronounceable password.

319
0:12:14.988,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So here the computer picks random syllables

320
0:12:17.233,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and puts them together

321
0:12:18.367,000 --> 0:12:2,000
so you have something sort of pronounceable,

322
0:12:20.842,000 --> 0:12:22,000
like "tufritvi" and "vadasabi."

323
0:12:23.444,000 --> 0:12:25,000
That one kind of rolls off your tongue.

324
0:12:25.591,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So these were random passwords that were

325
0:12:27.807,000 --> 0:12:29,000
generated by our computer.

326
0:12:30.551,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So what we found in this study was that, surprisingly,

327
0:12:33.529,000 --> 0:12:36,000
pass phrases were not actually all that good.

328
0:12:37.297,000 --> 0:12:39,000
People were not really better at remembering

329
0:12:40.09,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the pass phrases than these random passwords,

330
0:12:43.043,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and because the pass phrases are longer,

331
0:12:45.797,000 --> 0:12:46,000
they took longer to type

332
0:12:47.023,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and people made more errors while typing them in.

333
0:12:50.033,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So it's not really a clear win for pass phrases.

334
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Sorry, all of you xkcd fans.

335
0:12:56.605,000 --> 0:12:57,000
On the other hand, we did find

336
0:12:58.497,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that pronounceable passwords

337
0:13:00.301,000 --> 0:13:01,000
worked surprisingly well,

338
0:13:01.772,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and so we actually are doing some more research

339
0:13:04.19,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to see if we can make that approach work even better.

340
0:13:07.385,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So one of the problems

341
0:13:09.197,000 --> 0:13:1,000
with some of the studies that we've done

342
0:13:10.82,000 --> 0:13:11,000
is that because they're all done

343
0:13:12.503,000 --> 0:13:13,000
using Mechanical Turk,

344
0:13:14.093,000 --> 0:13:15,000
these are not people's real passwords.

345
0:13:15.905,000 --> 0:13:17,000
They're the passwords that they created

346
0:13:18.01,000 --> 0:13:2,000
or the computer created for them for our study.

347
0:13:20.505,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And we wanted to know whether people

348
0:13:22.073,000 --> 0:13:24,000
would actually behave the same way

349
0:13:24.385,000 --> 0:13:26,000
with their real passwords.

350
0:13:26.612,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So we talked to the information security office at Carnegie Mellon

351
0:13:30.293,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and asked them if we could have everybody's real passwords.

352
0:13:34.096,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Not surprisingly, they were a little bit reluctant

353
0:13:35.85,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to share them with us,

354
0:13:37.4,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but we were actually able to work out

355
0:13:39.21,000 --> 0:13:4,000
a system with them

356
0:13:40.25,000 --> 0:13:42,000
where they put all of the real passwords

357
0:13:42.359,000 --> 0:13:45,000
for 25,000 CMU students, faculty and staff,

358
0:13:45.45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
into a locked computer in a locked room,

359
0:13:47.898,000 --> 0:13:48,000
not connected to the Internet,

360
0:13:49.292,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and they ran code on it that we wrote

361
0:13:51.14,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to analyze these passwords.

362
0:13:53.292,000 --> 0:13:54,000
They audited our code.

363
0:13:54.618,000 --> 0:13:55,000
They ran the code.

364
0:13:55.93,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And so we never actually saw

365
0:13:57.668,000 --> 0:13:59,000
anybody's password.

366
0:14:00.485,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We got some interesting results,

367
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and those of you Tepper students in the back

368
0:14:03.696,000 --> 0:14:05,000
will be very interested in this.

369
0:14:06.571,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So we found that the passwords created

370
0:14:10.302,000 --> 0:14:12,000
by people affiliated with the school of computer science

371
0:14:12.46,000 --> 0:14:14,000
were actually 1.8 times stronger

372
0:14:14.784,000 --> 0:14:17,000
than those affiliated with the business school.

373
0:14:18.522,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We have lots of other really interesting

374
0:14:20.562,000 --> 0:14:22,000
demographic information as well.

375
0:14:22.8,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The other interesting thing that we found

376
0:14:24.646,000 --> 0:14:26,000
is that when we compared the Carnegie Mellon passwords

377
0:14:27.086,000 --> 0:14:29,000
to the Mechanical Turk-generated passwords,

378
0:14:29.369,000 --> 0:14:31,000
there was actually a lot of similarities,

379
0:14:31.988,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and so this helped validate our research method

380
0:14:33.936,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and show that actually, collecting passwords

381
0:14:36.446,000 --> 0:14:37,000
using these Mechanical Turk studies

382
0:14:38.254,000 --> 0:14:4,000
is actually a valid way to study passwords.

383
0:14:41.042,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So that was good news.

384
0:14:43.327,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Okay, I want to close by talking about

385
0:14:45.741,000 --> 0:14:47,000
some insights I gained while on sabbatical

386
0:14:47.809,000 --> 0:14:5,000
last year in the Carnegie Mellon art school.

387
0:14:51.01,000 --> 0:14:52,000
One of the things that I did

388
0:14:52.291,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is I made a number of quilts,

389
0:14:53.815,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and I made this quilt here.

390
0:14:55.363,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It's called "Security Blanket."

391
0:14:57.262,000 --> 0:14:59,000
(Laughter)

392
0:14:59.693,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And this quilt has the 1,000

393
0:15:02.788,000 --> 0:15:04,000
most frequent passwords stolen

394
0:15:05.116,000 --> 0:15:07,000
from the RockYou website.

395
0:15:07.687,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And the size of the passwords is proportional

396
0:15:09.748,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to how frequently they appeared

397
0:15:11.649,000 --> 0:15:13,000
in the stolen dataset.

398
0:15:13.897,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And what I did is I created this word cloud,

399
0:15:16.529,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and I went through all 1,000 words,

400
0:15:18.661,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and I categorized them into

401
0:15:20.456,000 --> 0:15:22,000
loose thematic categories.

402
0:15:22.836,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And it was, in some cases,

403
0:15:24.739,000 --> 0:15:26,000
it was kind of difficult to figure out

404
0:15:26.777,000 --> 0:15:27,000
what category they should be in,

405
0:15:28.532,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and then I color-coded them.

406
0:15:30.431,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So here are some examples of the difficulty.

407
0:15:33.05,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So "justin."

408
0:15:34.231,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Is that the name of the user,

409
0:15:36.06,000 --> 0:15:37,000
their boyfriend, their son?

410
0:15:37.382,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Maybe they're a Justin Bieber fan.

411
0:15:40.27,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Or "princess."

412
0:15:42.495,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Is that a nickname?

413
0:15:44.13,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Are they Disney princess fans?

414
0:15:45.725,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Or maybe that's the name of their cat.

415
0:15:49.419,000 --> 0:15:5,000
"Iloveyou" appears many times

416
0:15:51.074,000 --> 0:15:52,000
in many different languages.

417
0:15:52.619,000 --> 0:15:55,000
There's a lot of love in these passwords.

418
0:15:56.354,000 --> 0:15:57,000
If you look carefully, you'll see there's also

419
0:15:58.034,000 --> 0:16:,000
some profanity,

420
0:16:00.301,000 --> 0:16:01,000
but it was really interesting to me to see

421
0:16:02.251,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that there's a lot more love than hate

422
0:16:04.558,000 --> 0:16:06,000
in these passwords.

423
0:16:06.85,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And there are animals,

424
0:16:08.34,000 --> 0:16:09,000
a lot of animals,

425
0:16:09.7,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and "monkey" is the most common animal

426
0:16:12.004,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and the 14th most popular password overall.

427
0:16:15.679,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And this was really curious to me,

428
0:16:17.91,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and I wondered, "Why are monkeys so popular?"

429
0:16:20.433,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And so in our last password study,

430
0:16:23.785,000 --> 0:16:24,000
any time we detected somebody

431
0:16:25.471,000 --> 0:16:27,000
creating a password with the word "monkey" in it,

432
0:16:28.12,000 --> 0:16:31,000
we asked them why they had a monkey in their password.

433
0:16:31.15,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And what we found out --

434
0:16:33.06,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we found 17 people so far, I think,

435
0:16:35.163,000 --> 0:16:36,000
who have the word "monkey" --

436
0:16:36.446,000 --> 0:16:37,000
We found out about a third of them said

437
0:16:38.258,000 --> 0:16:39,000
they have a pet named "monkey"

438
0:16:39.998,000 --> 0:16:41,000
or a friend whose nickname is "monkey,"

439
0:16:42.289,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and about a third of them said

440
0:16:43.949,000 --> 0:16:44,000
that they just like monkeys

441
0:16:45.482,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and monkeys are really cute.

442
0:16:47.12,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And that guy is really cute.

443
0:16:50.759,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So it seems that at the end of the day,

444
0:16:54.167,000 --> 0:16:55,000
when we make passwords,

445
0:16:55.95,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we either make something that's really easy

446
0:16:57.924,000 --> 0:17:,000
to type, a common pattern,

447
0:17:00.933,000 --> 0:17:02,000
or things that remind us of the word password

448
0:17:03.419,000 --> 0:17:06,000
or the account that we've created the password for,

449
0:17:06.731,000 --> 0:17:08,000
or whatever.

450
0:17:09.348,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Or we think about things that make us happy,

451
0:17:11.99,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and we create our password

452
0:17:13.294,000 --> 0:17:15,000
based on things that make us happy.

453
0:17:15.532,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And while this makes typing

454
0:17:18.395,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and remembering your password more fun,

455
0:17:21.265,000 --> 0:17:22,000
it also makes it a lot easier

456
0:17:23.072,000 --> 0:17:24,000
to guess your password.

457
0:17:24.578,000 --> 0:17:25,000
So I know a lot of these TED Talks

458
0:17:26.326,000 --> 0:17:27,000
are inspirational

459
0:17:27.96,000 --> 0:17:29,000
and they make you think about nice, happy things,

460
0:17:30.421,000 --> 0:17:31,000
but when you're creating your password,

461
0:17:32.318,000 --> 0:17:33,000
try to think about something else.

462
0:17:34.309,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Thank you.

463
0:17:35.416,000 --> 0:17:35,000
(Applause)

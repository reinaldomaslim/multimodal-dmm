1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is my first trip,

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
my first foreign trip as a first lady.

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Can you believe that?

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Applause)

5
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.,

6
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.

7
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.

8
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is based not only on the relationship between governments,

9
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but the common language and the values that we share,

10
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.

11
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
During my visit I've been especially honored

12
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women --

13
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
women who are paving the way for all of you.

14
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I'm honored to meet you,

15
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the future leaders of Great Britain and this world.

16
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,

17
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America,

18
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and you, just getting through school,

19
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I want you to know that we have very much in common.

20
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
For nothing in my life's path

21
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
would have predicted that I'd be standing here

22
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as the first African-American First Lady

23
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
of the United States of America.

24
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
There is nothing in my story that would land me here.

25
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I wasn't raised with wealth or resources

26
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or any social standing to speak of.

27
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.

28
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That's the real part of Chicago.

29
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I was the product of a working-class community.

30
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
My father was a city worker all of his life,

31
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.

32
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.

33
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Neither of them attended university.

34
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis

35
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the prime of his life.

36
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But even as it got harder for him to walk

37
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and get dressed in the morning --

38
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I saw him struggle more and more --

39
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
my father never complained about his struggle.

40
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
He was grateful for what he had.

41
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.

42
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:

43
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
love, strong values

44
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and a belief that with a good education

45
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and a whole lot of hard work,

46
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that there was nothing that we could not do.

47
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I am an example of what's possible

48
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when girls from the very beginning of their lives

49
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
are loved and nurtured by the people around them.

50
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life:

51
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
grandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,

52
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.

53
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And my mother, the most important role model in my life,

54
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
who lives with us at the White House

55
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and helps to care for our two little daughters,

56
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Malia and Sasha.

57
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,

58
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and is instilling in them

59
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
the same values that she taught me and my brother:

60
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
things like compassion, and integrity,

61
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and confidence, and perseverance --

62
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love

63
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that only a grandmother can give.

64
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged

65
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
by some strong male role models as well,

66
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.

67
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The men in my life taught me some important things, as well.

68
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They taught me about what a respectful relationship

69
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
should look like between men and women.

70
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:

71
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that it's built on faith and commitment

72
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.

73
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They taught me about what it means

74
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to be a father

75
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and to raise a family.

76
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And not only to invest in your own home

77
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but to reach out and help raise kids

78
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in the broader community.

79
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And these were the same qualities

80
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that I looked for in my own husband,

81
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Barack Obama.

82
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And when we first met,

83
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.

84
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.

85
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

86
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I know, how romantic.

87
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But when we met, Barack was a community organizer.

89
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
He worked, helping people to find jobs

90
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.

91
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
As he talked to the residents in that community center,

92
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
he talked about two concepts.

93
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."

94
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.

95
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
What he said, that all too often,

96
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.

97
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is,

98
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.

99
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But Barack reminded us on that day,

100
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
all of us in that room, that we all know

101
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
what our world should look like.

102
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.

103
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We all know.

104
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And he urged the people in that meeting,

105
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in that community,

106
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to devote themselves to closing the gap

107
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
between those two ideas,

108
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to work together to try to make the world as it is

109
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and the world as it should be, one and the same.

110
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And I think about that today because I am

111
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
reminded and convinced that all of you in this school

112
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
are very important parts of closing that gap.

113
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You are the women who will build the world as it should be.

114
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You're going to write the next chapter in history.

115
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Not just for yourselves, but for your generation

116
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and generations to come.

117
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And that's why getting a good education

118
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is so important.

119
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That's why all of this that you're going through --

120
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't --

121
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
why it's so important.

122
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Because communities and countries and ultimately the world

123
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
are only as strong as the health of their women.

124
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And that's important to keep in mind.

125
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Part of that health includes an outstanding education.

126
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one

127
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is often the presence of an empowered woman

128
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
or women at the center of that family.

129
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The difference between a broken community and a thriving one

130
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
is often the healthy respect between men and women

131
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.

132
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The difference between a languishing nation

133
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and one that will flourish

134
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
is the recognition that we need equal access to education

135
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
for both boys and girls.

136
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor,

137
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,

138
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Mary Seacole,

139
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,"

140
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and the English author, Emily Bronte,

141
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
honor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance,

142
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to pursue their passions to feed their own souls.

143
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They allowed for no obstacles.

144
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
As the sign said back there, "without limitations."

145
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They knew no other way to live

146
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
than to follow their dreams.

147
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And having done so, these women

148
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
moved many obstacles.

149
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And they opened many new doors

150
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
for millions of female doctors and nurses

151
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and artists and authors,

152
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
all of whom have followed them.

153
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And by getting a good education,

154
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
you too can control your own destiny.

155
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Please remember that.

156
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here,

157
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it's because of education.

158
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.

159
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I never did it.

160
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I loved getting As.

161
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I liked being smart.

162
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.

163
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.

164
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And you too, with these same values,

165
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
can control your own destiny.

166
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You too can pave the way.

167
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You too can realize your dreams,

168
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and then your job is to reach back

169
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and to help someone just like you do the same thing.

170
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
History proves that it doesn't matter

171
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
whether you come from a council estate

172
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
or a country estate.

173
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Your success will be determined

174
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
by your own fortitude,

175
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
your own confidence, your own individual hard work.

176
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.

177
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
You now have control over your own destiny.

178
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.

179
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
But you have everything you need.

180
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Everything you need to succeed,

181
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you already have, right here.

182
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
My husband works in this big office.

183
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
They call it the Oval Office.

184
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In the White House, there's the desk that he sits at --

185
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
it's called the Resolute desk.

186
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute

187
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and given by Queen Victoria.

188
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.

189
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And its name, Resolute,

190
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
is a reminder of the strength of character that's required

191
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
not only to lead a country,

192
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but to live a life of purpose, as well.

193
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute,

194
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
that you go forward without limits,

195
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them;

196
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it's there --

197
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that you use them to create the world as it should be.

198
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Because we are counting on you.

199
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We are counting on every single one of you

200
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to be the very best that you can be.

201
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Because the world is big.

202
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And it's full of challenges.

203
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And we need strong, smart, confident young women

204
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to stand up and take the reins.

205
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much.

206
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Applause)

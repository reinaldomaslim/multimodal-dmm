1
0:00:13.388,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm an MIT professor,

2
0:00:15.598,000 --> 0:00:17,000
but I do not design buildings or computer systems.

3
0:00:18.938,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Rather, I build body parts,

4
0:00:22.133,000 --> 0:00:25,000
bionic legs that augment human walking and running.

5
0:00:25.812,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In 1982, I was in a mountain-climbing accident,

6
0:00:28.769,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and both of my legs had to be amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite.

7
0:00:33.245,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Here, you can see my legs:

8
0:00:35.206,000 --> 0:00:4,000
24 sensors, six microprocessors and muscle-tendon-like actuators.

9
0:00:40.53,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm basically a bunch of nuts and bolts from the knee down.

10
0:00:43.846,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But with this advanced bionic technology,

11
0:00:46.226,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I can skip, dance and run.

12
0:00:50.138,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Applause)

13
0:00:51.206,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Thank you.

14
0:00:52.381,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:55.015,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I'm a bionic man, but I'm not yet a cyborg.

16
0:01:02.284,000 --> 0:01:04,000
When I think about moving my legs,

17
0:01:05.11,000 --> 0:01:08,000
neural signals from my central nervous system

18
0:01:08.253,000 --> 0:01:09,000
pass through my nerves

19
0:01:09.896,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and activate muscles within my residual limbs.

20
0:01:15.38,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Artificial electrodes sense these signals,

21
0:01:18.063,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and small computers in the bionic limb

22
0:01:20.552,000 --> 0:01:24,000
decode my nerve pulses into my intended movement patterns.

23
0:01:26.493,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Stated simply,

24
0:01:28.418,000 --> 0:01:29,000
when I think about moving,

25
0:01:29.773,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that command is communicated to the synthetic part of my body.

26
0:01:34.466,000 --> 0:01:37,000
However, those computers can't input information into my nervous system.

27
0:01:38.838,000 --> 0:01:4,000
When I touch and move my synthetic limbs,

28
0:01:41.751,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I do not experience normal touch and movement sensations.

29
0:01:46.108,000 --> 0:01:5,000
If I were a cyborg and could feel my legs

30
0:01:51.255,000 --> 0:01:54,000
via small computers inputting information into my nervous system,

31
0:01:55.105,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it would fundamentally change, I believe,

32
0:01:57.487,000 --> 0:01:59,000
my relationship to my synthetic body.

33
0:02:00.605,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Today, I can't feel my legs,

34
0:02:03.788,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and because of that,

35
0:02:04.994,000 --> 0:02:07,000
my legs are separate tools from my mind and my body.

36
0:02:08.463,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They're not part of me.

37
0:02:11.48,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I believe that if I were a cyborg and could feel my legs,

38
0:02:14.79,000 --> 0:02:16,000
they would become part of me, part of self.

39
0:02:17.923,000 --> 0:02:21,000
At MIT, we're thinking about NeuroEmbodied Design.

40
0:02:22.092,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In this design process,

41
0:02:25.11,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the designer designs human flesh and bone, the biological body itself,

42
0:02:30.597,000 --> 0:02:34,000
along with synthetics to enhance the bidirectional communication

43
0:02:35.558,000 --> 0:02:37,000
between the nervous system and the built world.

44
0:02:39.406,000 --> 0:02:43,000
NeuroEmbodied Design is a methodology to create cyborg function.

45
0:02:45.843,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In this design process, designers contemplate a future

46
0:02:50.218,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in which technology no longer compromises separate,

47
0:02:53.393,000 --> 0:02:55,000
lifeless tools from our minds and our bodies,

48
0:02:56.345,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a future in which technology has been carefully integrated

49
0:03:00.195,000 --> 0:03:01,000
within our nature,

50
0:03:01.79,000 --> 0:03:04,000
a world in which what is biological and what is not,

51
0:03:04.989,000 --> 0:03:06,000
what is human and what is not,

52
0:03:07.099,000 --> 0:03:09,000
what is nature and what is not

53
0:03:09.18,000 --> 0:03:11,000
will be forever blurred.

54
0:03:11.391,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That future will provide humanity new bodies.

55
0:03:16.156,000 --> 0:03:18,000
NeuroEmbodied Design will extend our nervous systems

56
0:03:18.919,000 --> 0:03:19,000
into the synthetic world,

57
0:03:20.617,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and the synthetic world into us,

58
0:03:23.117,000 --> 0:03:25,000
fundamentally changing who we are.

59
0:03:26.994,000 --> 0:03:29,000
By designing the biological body to better communicate

60
0:03:30.072,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with the built design world,

61
0:03:33.08,000 --> 0:03:35,000
humanity will end disability in this 21st century

62
0:03:36.089,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and establish the scientific and technological basis

63
0:03:39.663,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for human augmentation,

64
0:03:41.937,000 --> 0:03:45,000
extending human capability beyond innate, physiological levels,

65
0:03:46.418,000 --> 0:03:49,000
cognitively, emotionally and physically.

66
0:03:50.218,000 --> 0:03:54,000
There are many ways in which to build new bodies across scale,

67
0:03:54.474,000 --> 0:03:57,000
from the biomolecular to the scale of tissues and organs.

68
0:03:58.443,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Today, I want to talk about one area of NeuroEmbodied Design,

69
0:04:01.673,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in which the body's tissues are manipulated and sculpted

70
0:04:05.761,000 --> 0:04:07,000
using surgical and regenerative processes.

71
0:04:10.331,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The current amputation paradigm

72
0:04:11.991,000 --> 0:04:15,000
hasn't changed fundamentally since the US Civil War

73
0:04:16.082,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and has grown obsolete in light of dramatic advancements

74
0:04:19.86,000 --> 0:04:22,000
in actuators, control systems and neural interfacing technologies.

75
0:04:25.058,000 --> 0:04:29,000
A major deficiency is the lack of dynamic muscle interactions

76
0:04:29.36,000 --> 0:04:31,000
for control and proprioception.

77
0:04:32.682,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What is proprioception?

78
0:04:34.556,000 --> 0:04:37,000
When you flex your ankle, muscles in the front of your leg contract,

79
0:04:37.818,000 --> 0:04:39,000
simultaneously stretching muscles in the back of your leg.

80
0:04:40.818,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The opposite happens when you extend your ankle.

81
0:04:43.327,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Here, muscles in the back of your leg contract,

82
0:04:45.583,000 --> 0:04:46,000
stretching muscles in the front.

83
0:04:47.328,000 --> 0:04:48,000
When these muscles flex and extend,

84
0:04:49.328,000 --> 0:04:51,000
biological sensors within the muscle tendons

85
0:04:51.686,000 --> 0:04:53,000
send information through nerves to the brain.

86
0:04:54.186,000 --> 0:04:56,000
This is how we're able to feel where our feet are

87
0:04:56.814,000 --> 0:04:58,000
without seeing them with our eyes.

88
0:05:00.186,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The current amputation paradigm breaks these dynamic muscle relationships,

89
0:05:04.433,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and in so doing eliminates normal proprioceptive sensations.

90
0:05:08.553,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Consequently, a standard artificial limb

91
0:05:11.316,000 --> 0:05:13,000
cannot feed back information into the nervous system

92
0:05:14.015,000 --> 0:05:16,000
about where the prosthesis is in space.

93
0:05:16.783,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The patient therefore cannot sense and feel

94
0:05:19.964,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the positions and movements of the prosthetic joint

95
0:05:22.955,000 --> 0:05:24,000
without seeing it with their eyes.

96
0:05:26.153,000 --> 0:05:29,000
My legs were amputated using this Civil War-era methodology.

97
0:05:30.626,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I can feel my feet, I can feel them right now

98
0:05:33.206,000 --> 0:05:34,000
as a phantom awareness.

99
0:05:35.089,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But when I try to move them, I cannot.

100
0:05:37.002,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It feels like they're stuck inside rigid ski boots.

101
0:05:40.73,000 --> 0:05:41,000
To solve these problems,

102
0:05:41.91,000 --> 0:05:46,000
at MIT, we invented the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface,

103
0:05:46.972,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or AMI, for short.

104
0:05:48.829,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The AMI is a method to connect nerves within the residuum

105
0:05:52.487,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to an external, bionic prosthesis.

106
0:05:55.405,000 --> 0:05:58,000
How is the AMI designed, and how does it work?

107
0:05:59.508,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The AMI comprises two muscles that are surgically connected,

108
0:06:03.041,000 --> 0:06:05,000
an agonist linked to an antagonist.

109
0:06:05.909,000 --> 0:06:07,000
When the agonist contracts upon electrical activation,

110
0:06:08.732,000 --> 0:06:1,000
it stretches the antagonist.

111
0:06:11.248,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This muscle dynamic interaction

112
0:06:13.554,000 --> 0:06:16,000
causes biological sensors within the muscle tendon

113
0:06:16.61,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to send information through the nerve to the central nervous system,

114
0:06:20.103,000 --> 0:06:24,000
relating information on the muscle tendon's length, speed and force.

115
0:06:24.731,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This is how muscle tendon proprioception works,

116
0:06:27.073,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and it's the primary way we, as humans,

117
0:06:29.74,000 --> 0:06:33,000
can feel and sense the positions, movements and forces on our limbs.

118
0:06:34.386,000 --> 0:06:35,000
When a limb is amputated,

119
0:06:35.712,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the surgeon connects these opposing muscles within the residuum

120
0:06:39.856,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to create an AMI.

121
0:06:41.097,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now, multiple AMI constructs can be created

122
0:06:44.214,000 --> 0:06:47,000
for the control and sensation of multiple prosthetic joints.

123
0:06:48.199,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Artificial electrodes are then placed on each AMI muscle,

124
0:06:51.621,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and small computers within the bionic limb decode those signals

125
0:06:55.296,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to control powerful motors on the bionic limb.

126
0:06:58.933,000 --> 0:07:,000
When the bionic limb moves,

127
0:07:01.117,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the AMI muscles move back and forth,

128
0:07:02.998,000 --> 0:07:04,000
sending signals through the nerve to the brain,

129
0:07:05.214,000 --> 0:07:09,000
enabling a person wearing the prosthesis to experience natural sensations

130
0:07:09.38,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of positions and movements of the prosthesis.

131
0:07:12.492,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Can these tissue-design principles be used in an actual human being?

132
0:07:17.786,000 --> 0:07:2,000
A few years ago, my good friend Jim Ewing -- of 34 years --

133
0:07:21.619,000 --> 0:07:22,000
reached out to me for help.

134
0:07:24.272,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Jim was in an a terrible climbing accident.

135
0:07:26.352,000 --> 0:07:28,000
He fell 50 feet in the Cayman Islands

136
0:07:29.074,000 --> 0:07:32,000
when his rope failed to catch him hitting the ground's surface.

137
0:07:33.339,000 --> 0:07:35,000
He suffered many, many injuries:

138
0:07:35.833,000 --> 0:07:38,000
punctured lungs and many broken bones.

139
0:07:40.06,000 --> 0:07:43,000
After his accident, he dreamed of returning to his chosen sport

140
0:07:43.814,000 --> 0:07:44,000
of mountain climbing,

141
0:07:45.142,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but how might this be possible?

142
0:07:49.322,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The answer was Team Cyborg,

143
0:07:52.369,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a team of surgeons, scientists and engineers

144
0:07:55.632,000 --> 0:07:59,000
assembled at MIT to rebuild Jim back to his former climbing prowess.

145
0:08:00.498,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Team member Dr. Matthew Carty amputated Jim's badly damaged leg

146
0:08:04.578,000 --> 0:08:06,000
at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston,

147
0:08:06.714,000 --> 0:08:08,000
using the AMI surgical procedure.

148
0:08:09.262,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Tendon pulleys were created and attached to Jim's tibia bone

149
0:08:12.691,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to reconnect the opposing muscles.

150
0:08:15.46,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The AMI procedure reestablished the neural link

151
0:08:18.389,000 --> 0:08:2,000
between Jim's ankle-foot muscles and his brain.

152
0:08:21.854,000 --> 0:08:23,000
When Jim moves his phantom limb,

153
0:08:24.442,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the reconnected muscles move in dynamic pairs,

154
0:08:27.474,000 --> 0:08:31,000
causing signals of proprioception to pass through nerves to the brain,

155
0:08:31.935,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so Jim experiences normal sensations with ankle-foot positions and movements,

156
0:08:35.579,000 --> 0:08:36,000
even when blindfolded.

157
0:08:37.842,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Here's Jim at the MIT laboratory after his surgeries.

158
0:08:41.303,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We electrically linked Jim's AMI muscles, via the electrodes,

159
0:08:44.447,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to a bionic limb,

160
0:08:45.629,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and Jim quickly learned how to move the bionic limb

161
0:08:48.414,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in four distinct ankle-foot movement directions.

162
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We were excited by these results, but then Jim stood up,

163
0:08:55.087,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and what occurred was truly remarkable.

164
0:08:57.977,000 --> 0:09:01,000
All the natural biomechanics mediated by the central nervous system

165
0:09:02.017,000 --> 0:09:05,000
emerged via the synthetic limb

166
0:09:05.39,000 --> 0:09:08,000
as an involuntary, reflexive action.

167
0:09:08.929,000 --> 0:09:11,000
All the intricacies of foot placement during stair ascent --

168
0:09:12.85,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

169
0:09:16.372,000 --> 0:09:17,000
emerged before our eyes.

170
0:09:19.644,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Here's Jim descending steps,

171
0:09:21.493,000 --> 0:09:23,000
reaching with his bionic toe to the next stair tread,

172
0:09:24.509,000 --> 0:09:26,000
automatically exhibiting natural motions

173
0:09:27.049,000 --> 0:09:29,000
without him even trying to move his limb.

174
0:09:29.865,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Because Jim's central nervous system is receiving the proprioceptive signals,

175
0:09:34.502,000 --> 0:09:38,000
it knows exactly how to control the synthetic limb in a natural way.

176
0:09:39.635,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now, Jim moves and behaves as if the synthetic limb is part of him.

177
0:09:45.746,000 --> 0:09:46,000
For example, one day in the lab,

178
0:09:47.73,000 --> 0:09:5,000
he accidentally stepped on a roll of electrical tape.

179
0:09:50.85,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Now, what do you do when something's stuck to your shoe?

180
0:09:53.501,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You don't reach down like this; it's way too awkward.

181
0:09:56.136,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Instead, you shake it off,

182
0:09:57.454,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and that's exactly what Jim did

183
0:09:59.303,000 --> 0:10:02,000
after being neurally connected to the limb for just a few hours.

184
0:10:03.436,000 --> 0:10:04,000
What was most interesting to me

185
0:10:05.437,000 --> 0:10:07,000
is what Jim was telling us he was experiencing.

186
0:10:08.329,000 --> 0:10:11,000
He said, "The robot became part of me."

187
0:10:12.217,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Jim Ewing: The morning after the first time I was attached to the robot,

188
0:10:16.027,000 --> 0:10:21,000
my daughter came downstairs and asked me how it felt to be a cyborg,

189
0:10:21.417,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and my answer was that I didn't feel like a cyborg.

190
0:10:25.41,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I felt like I had my leg,

191
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and it wasn't that I was attached to the robot

192
0:10:34.005,000 --> 0:10:36,000
so much as the robot was attached to me,

193
0:10:36.65,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and the robot became part of me.

194
0:10:38.206,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It became my leg pretty quickly.

195
0:10:41.617,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Hugh Herr: Thank you.

196
0:10:42.792,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Applause)

197
0:10:45.904,000 --> 0:10:48,000
By connecting Jim's nervous system bidirectionally

198
0:10:49.301,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to his synthetic limb,

199
0:10:51.095,000 --> 0:10:53,000
neurological embodiment was achieved.

200
0:10:54.043,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I hypothesized that because Jim can think and move his synthetic limb,

201
0:10:59.544,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and because he can feel those movements within his nervous system,

202
0:11:03.878,000 --> 0:11:06,000
the prosthesis is no longer a separate tool,

203
0:11:07.029,000 --> 0:11:11,000
but an integral part of Jim, an integral part of his body.

204
0:11:12.108,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Because of this neurological embodiment, Jim doesn't feel like a cyborg.

205
0:11:17.215,000 --> 0:11:19,000
He feels like he just has his leg back,

206
0:11:19.456,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that he has his body back.

207
0:11:21.58,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Now I'm often asked

208
0:11:22.755,000 --> 0:11:25,000
when I'm going to be neurally linked to my synthetic limbs bidirectionally,

209
0:11:26.335,000 --> 0:11:27,000
when I'm going to become a cyborg.

210
0:11:28.143,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The truth is, I'm hesitant to become a cyborg.

211
0:11:31.966,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Before my legs were amputated, I was a terrible student.

212
0:11:35.197,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I got D's and often F's in school.

213
0:11:38.044,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Then, after my limbs were amputated,

214
0:11:40.797,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I suddenly became an MIT professor.

215
0:11:43.353,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Laughter)

216
0:11:45.544,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

217
0:11:49.29,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now I'm worried that once I'm neurally connected to my limbs once again,

218
0:11:53.791,000 --> 0:11:56,000
my brain will remap back to its not-so-bright self.

219
0:11:57.505,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:58.831,000 --> 0:12:02,000
But you know what, that's OK, because at MIT, I already have tenure.

221
0:12:02.926,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

222
0:12:04.578,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Applause)

223
0:12:07.467,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I believe the reach of NeuroEmbodied Design

224
0:12:09.849,000 --> 0:12:11,000
will extend far beyond limb replacement

225
0:12:12.73,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and will carry humanity into realms

226
0:12:15.458,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that fundamentally redefine human potential.

227
0:12:18.866,000 --> 0:12:19,000
In this 21st century,

228
0:12:20.609,000 --> 0:12:24,000
designers will extend the nervous system into powerfully strong exoskeletons

229
0:12:25.07,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that humans can control and feel with their minds.

230
0:12:30.139,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Muscles within the body can be reconfigured

231
0:12:33.306,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for the control of powerful motors,

232
0:12:36.243,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and to feel and sense exoskeletal movements,

233
0:12:40.371,000 --> 0:12:43,000
augmenting humans' strength, jumping height and running speed.

234
0:12:44.807,000 --> 0:12:48,000
In this 21st century, I believe humans will become superheroes.

235
0:12:50.313,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Humans may also extend their bodies

236
0:12:53.948,000 --> 0:12:55,000
into non-anthropomorphic structures, such as wings,

237
0:12:57.805,000 --> 0:13:01,000
controlling and feeling each wing movement within the nervous system.

238
0:13:02.716,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Leonardo da Vinci said, "When once you have tasted flight,

239
0:13:06.134,000 --> 0:13:09,000
you will forever walk the earth with your eyes turned skyward,

240
0:13:09.685,000 --> 0:13:13,000
for there you have been and there you will always long to return."

241
0:13:15.49,000 --> 0:13:17,000
During the twilight years of this century,

242
0:13:17.554,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I believe humans will be unrecognizable in morphology and dynamics

243
0:13:21.808,000 --> 0:13:22,000
from what we are today.

244
0:13:23.785,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Humanity will take flight and soar.

245
0:13:27.695,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Jim Ewing fell to earth and was badly broken,

246
0:13:31.021,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but his eyes turned skyward, where he always longed to return.

247
0:13:35.281,000 --> 0:13:37,000
After his accident, he not only dreamed to walk again,

248
0:13:37.861,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but also to return to his chosen sport of mountain climbing.

249
0:13:41.657,000 --> 0:13:45,000
At MIT, Team Cyborg built Jim a specialized limb for the vertical world,

250
0:13:46.419,000 --> 0:13:5,000
a brain-controlled leg with full position and movement sensations.

251
0:13:52.065,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Using this technology, Jim returned to the Cayman Islands,

252
0:13:55.312,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the site of his accident,

253
0:13:57.243,000 --> 0:14:01,000
rebuilt as a cyborg to climb skyward once again.

254
0:14:01.275,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Crashing waves)

255
0:14:27.727,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Applause)

256
0:14:43.578,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Thank you.

257
0:14:44.753,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

258
0:14:48.358,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Ewing, the first cyborg rock climber.

259
0:14:51.843,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
One of the most humiliating things

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that you can say about someone is "they choked."

3
0:00:19.64,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And boy, do I know that feeling.

4
0:00:22.72,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Growing up, I was an avid athlete.

5
0:00:25.12,000 --> 0:00:28,000
My main sport was soccer, and I was a goalkeeper,

6
0:00:28.92,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which is both the best and the worst position on the field.

7
0:00:34.64,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You see, when you're a goalie, you get this special uniform,

8
0:00:37.88,000 --> 0:00:4,000
you get all the glory for a great shot saved,

9
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but you also get the grief when you land a shot in the goal.

10
0:00:47.08,000 --> 0:00:48,000
When you're a goalie,

11
0:00:48.32,000 --> 0:00:49,000
all eyes are on you,

12
0:00:49.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and with that comes the pressure.

13
0:00:53.36,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I distinctly remember one game in high school.

14
0:00:56.28,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was playing for the California state team

15
0:00:58.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
which is part of the Olympic Development Program.

16
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I was having a great game ...

17
0:01:04.2,000 --> 0:01:1,000
until I realized that the national coach was standing right behind me.

18
0:01:11.24,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That's when everything changed.

19
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
In a matter of seconds,

20
0:01:16.2,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I went from playing at the top to the bottom of my ability.

21
0:01:22.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Just knowing that I was being evaluated changed my performance

22
0:01:27.4,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and forever how I thought about the mental aspect of how we perform.

23
0:01:34.32,000 --> 0:01:37,000
All of a sudden the ball seemed to go in slow motion,

24
0:01:38.12,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I was fixated on my every move.

25
0:01:42.12,000 --> 0:01:44,000
The next shot that came I bobbled,

26
0:01:44.2,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but thankfully it didn't land in the goal.

27
0:01:47.08,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The shot after that,

28
0:01:48.72,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I wasn't so lucky:

29
0:01:50.52,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I tipped it right into the net.

30
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
My team lost;

31
0:01:56.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the national coach walked away.

32
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I choked under the pressure of those evaluative eyes on me.

33
0:02:05.84,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Just about everyone does it from time to time --

34
0:02:08.6,000 --> 0:02:1,000
there are so many opportunities,

35
0:02:11.08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
whether it's taking a test,

36
0:02:13.12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
giving a talk,

37
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:15,000
pitching to a client

38
0:02:16.6,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or that special form of torture I like to call the job interview.

39
0:02:21.6,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:23.12,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But the question is why.

41
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Why do we sometimes fail to perform up to our potential under pressure?

42
0:02:29.88,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It's especially bewildering in the case of athletes

43
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:36,000
who spend so much time physically honing their craft.

44
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But what about their minds?

45
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Not as much.

46
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is true off the playing field as well.

47
0:02:45.12,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Whether we're taking a test of giving a talk,

48
0:02:48.6,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it's easy to feel like we're ready --

49
0:02:50.48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at the top of our game --

50
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and then perform at our worst when it matters most.

51
0:02:56.88,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It turns out that rarely do we practice

52
0:02:59.4,000 --> 0:03:02,000
under the types of conditions we're actually going to perform under,

53
0:03:03.24,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and as a result,

54
0:03:04.52,000 --> 0:03:06,000
when all eyes are on us,

55
0:03:06.64,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we sometimes flub our performance.

56
0:03:10.44,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Of course, the question is, why is this the case?

57
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And my experience on the playing field --

58
0:03:17.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and in other important facets of my life --

59
0:03:20.28,000 --> 0:03:23,000
really pushed me into the field of cognitive science.

60
0:03:23.44,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I wanted to know how we could reach our limitless potential.

61
0:03:28.44,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I wanted to understand how we could use our knowledge

62
0:03:31.6,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of the mind and the brain

63
0:03:33.56,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to come up with psychological tools that would help us perform at our best.

64
0:03:39.96,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So why does it happen?

65
0:03:41.76,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Why do we sometimes fail to perform up to what we're capable of

66
0:03:46.08,000 --> 0:03:47,000
when the pressure is on?

67
0:03:48.96,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It may not be so surprising to hear that in stressful situations, we worry.

68
0:03:53.76,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We worry about the situation,

69
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the consequences,

70
0:03:57.52,000 --> 0:03:59,000
what others will think of us.

71
0:03:59.96,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But what is surprising is that we often get in our own way

72
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:09,000
precisely because our worries prompt us to concentrate too much.

73
0:04:09.96,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That's right --

74
0:04:11.2,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we pay too much attention to what we're doing.

75
0:04:14.92,000 --> 0:04:16,000
When we're concerned about performing our best,

76
0:04:17.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we often try and control aspects of what we're doing

77
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that are best left on autopilot,

78
0:04:23.72,000 --> 0:04:25,000
outside conscious awareness,

79
0:04:25.88,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and as a result,

80
0:04:27.52,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we mess up.

81
0:04:29.839,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Think about a situation where you're shuffling down the stairs.

82
0:04:33.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What would happen if I asked you

83
0:04:35.24,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to think about what you're doing with your knee

84
0:04:37.48,000 --> 0:04:38,000
while you're doing that?

85
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:4,000
There's a good chance you'd fall on your face.

86
0:04:41.6,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We as humans only have the ability to pay attention to so much at once,

87
0:04:46.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which is why, by the way,

88
0:04:47.72,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it's not a good idea to drive and talk on the cell phone.

89
0:04:51.28,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And under pressure,

90
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:54,000
when we're concerned about performing at our best,

91
0:04:55.08,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we can try and control aspects of what we're doing

92
0:04:58.72,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that should be left outside conscious control.

93
0:05:02.56,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The end result is that we mess up.

94
0:05:05.72,000 --> 0:05:09,000
My research team and I have studied this phenomenon of overattention,

95
0:05:10.04,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we call it paralysis by analysis.

96
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In one study, we asked college soccer players to dribble a soccer ball

97
0:05:18.08,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and to pay attention to an aspect of their performance

98
0:05:21.52,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that they would not otherwise attend to.

99
0:05:24.707,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We asked them to pay attention

100
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
to what side of the foot was contacting the ball.

101
0:05:30.04,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We showed that performance was slower and more error-prone

102
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
when we drew their attention to the step-by-step details

103
0:05:37.72,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of what they were doing.

104
0:05:39.56,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When the pressure is on,

105
0:05:41.08,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we're often concerned with performing at our best,

106
0:05:44.24,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and as a result we try and control what we're doing

107
0:05:47.72,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to force the best performance.

108
0:05:50.12,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The end result is that we actually screw up.

109
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:55,000
In basketball,

110
0:05:55.4,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the term "unconscious" is used to describe a shooter who can't miss.

111
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And San Antonio Spurs star Tim Duncan has said,

112
0:06:05.04,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"When you have to stop and think, that's when you mess up."

113
0:06:08.92,000 --> 0:06:11,000
In dance, the great choreographer, George Balanchine,

114
0:06:12.68,000 --> 0:06:13,000
used to urge his dancers,

115
0:06:14.52,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"Don't think, just do."

116
0:06:17.8,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When the pressure's on,

117
0:06:19.32,000 --> 0:06:21,000
when we want to put our best foot forward,

118
0:06:21.88,000 --> 0:06:22,000
somewhat ironically,

119
0:06:23.12,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we often try and control what we're doing in a way that leads to worse performance.

120
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So what do we do?

121
0:06:31.68,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Knowing that we have this overactive attention,

122
0:06:35.36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
how do we ensure that we perform at our best?

123
0:06:39.72,000 --> 0:06:41,000
A lot of it comes down to the prefrontal cortex,

124
0:06:42.24,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that front part of our brain that sits over our eyes

125
0:06:45.32,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and usually helps us focus in positive ways.

126
0:06:48.32,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It often gets hooked on the wrong things.

127
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So how do we unhook it?

128
0:06:53.76,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Something as simple as singing a song,

129
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or paying attention to one's pinky toe,

130
0:06:59.36,000 --> 0:07:02,000
as pro golfer Jack Nicklaus was rumored to do,

131
0:07:02.6,000 --> 0:07:06,000
can help us take our mind off those pesky details.

132
0:07:07.64,000 --> 0:07:1,000
It's also true that practicing under conditions

133
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that we're going to perform under --

134
0:07:13.2,000 --> 0:07:16,000
closing the gap between training and competition

135
0:07:16.36,000 --> 0:07:19,000
can help us get used to that feeling of all eyes on us.

136
0:07:20.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This is true off the playing field as well.

137
0:07:23.8,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Whether it's getting ready for an exam

138
0:07:26.88,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or preparing for a big talk --

139
0:07:29.28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
one that might have a little pressure associated with it --

140
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:33.28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
getting used to the types of situations you're going to perform under

142
0:07:36.56,000 --> 0:07:37,000
really matters.

143
0:07:38.04,000 --> 0:07:4,000
When you're taking a test, close the book,

144
0:07:40.56,000 --> 0:07:43,000
practice retrieving the answer from memory under timed situations,

145
0:07:44.52,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and when you're giving a talk,

146
0:07:46.04,000 --> 0:07:47,000
practice in front of others.

147
0:07:47.56,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And if you can't find anyone who will listen,

148
0:07:50.08,000 --> 0:07:53,000
practice in front of a video camera or even a mirror.

149
0:07:53.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The ability to get used to what it will feel like can make the difference

150
0:07:58.44,000 --> 0:08:,000
in whether we choke or thrive.

151
0:08:01.6,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We've also figured out some ways to get rid of those pesky worries

152
0:08:04.76,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and self-doubts that tend to creep up in the stressful situations.

153
0:08:09.24,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Researchers have shown that simply jotting down your thoughts and worries

154
0:08:12.72,000 --> 0:08:13,000
before a stressful event

155
0:08:14.52,000 --> 0:08:16,000
can help to download them from mind --

156
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
make them less likely to pop up in the moment.

157
0:08:20.8,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's kind of like when you wake up in the middle of the night

158
0:08:23.72,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and you're really worried about what you have to do the next day,

159
0:08:26.84,000 --> 0:08:28,000
you're trying to think about everything you have to accomplish,

160
0:08:29.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and you write it down and then you can go back to sleep.

161
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Journaling, or getting those thoughts down on paper,

162
0:08:35.08,000 --> 0:08:38,000
makes it less likely they'll pop up and distract you in the moment.

163
0:08:39.08,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The end result is that you can perform your best when it matters most.

164
0:08:45.12,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So up until now,

165
0:08:46.64,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I've talked about what happens when we put limits on ourselves

166
0:08:50.679,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and some tips we can use to help perform up to our potential.

167
0:08:55.159,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But it's important to remember

168
0:08:56.64,000 --> 0:09:,000
that it's not just our own individual being

169
0:09:00.76,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that can put limits and that can perform poorly;

170
0:09:03.72,000 --> 0:09:07,000
our environment has an effect on whether we choke or thrive.

171
0:09:07.76,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Our parents, our teachers, our coaches, our bosses all influence

172
0:09:12.72,000 --> 0:09:15,000
whether or not we can put our best foot forward when it matters most.

173
0:09:18.28,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Take math as an example.

174
0:09:21.24,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That's right, I said it:

175
0:09:22.76,000 --> 0:09:23,000
math.

176
0:09:24.2,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Lots of people profess to choke or are anxious about doing math,

177
0:09:28.92,000 --> 0:09:32,000
whether it's taking a test or even calculating the tip on a dinner bill

178
0:09:33.04,000 --> 0:09:35,000
as our smart friends look on.

179
0:09:37.08,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And it's quite socially acceptable

180
0:09:39.04,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to talk about choking or performing poorly in math.

181
0:09:42.64,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You don't hear highly educated people walking around talking about the fact

182
0:09:46.68,000 --> 0:09:48,000
or bragging about the fact that they're not good readers,

183
0:09:49.6,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but you hear people all the time bragging about how they're not math people.

184
0:09:54.72,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And unfortunately,

185
0:09:55.96,000 --> 0:09:59,000
in the US, this tends to be more so among girls and women

186
0:10:00.12,000 --> 0:10:01,000
than boys and men.

187
0:10:03.04,000 --> 0:10:07,000
My research team and I have tried to understand

188
0:10:07.12,000 --> 0:10:09,000
where this fear of math comes from,

189
0:10:09.52,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and we've actually peered inside the brains

190
0:10:11.68,000 --> 0:10:13,000
using functional magnetic resonance imaging,

191
0:10:14.44,000 --> 0:10:16,000
of people who are worried about math.

192
0:10:17.04,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We've shown that math phobia correlates with a concrete visceral sensation

193
0:10:22.56,000 --> 0:10:23,000
such as pain,

194
0:10:23.92,000 --> 0:10:26,000
of which we have every right to feel anxious.

195
0:10:27.2,000 --> 0:10:29,000
In fact, when people who are worried about math

196
0:10:29.92,000 --> 0:10:31,000
are just getting ready to take a math test --

197
0:10:32.68,000 --> 0:10:34,000
they're not even taking it, they're just getting ready --

198
0:10:35.4,000 --> 0:10:41,000
areas of the brain known the be involved in our neural pain response are active.

199
0:10:41.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
When we say math is painful,

200
0:10:43.4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
there's some truth to it for some people.

201
0:10:47.96,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But where does this math anxiety come from?

202
0:10:50.88,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It turns out that math anxiety is contagious.

203
0:10:55.56,000 --> 0:10:57,000
When adults are worried about math,

204
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
the children around them start worrying, too.

205
0:11:01.04,000 --> 0:11:03,000
As young as first grade,

206
0:11:03.36,000 --> 0:11:04,000
when kids are in classrooms

207
0:11:04.88,000 --> 0:11:07,000
with teachers who are anxious about their own math ability,

208
0:11:08.44,000 --> 0:11:1,000
these kids learn less across the school year.

209
0:11:11.68,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And it turns out that this is more prevalent in girls than boys.

210
0:11:16.56,000 --> 0:11:17,000
At this young age,

211
0:11:17.8,000 --> 0:11:2,000
kids tend to mimic same-sex adults,

212
0:11:21.12,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and at least in the US,

213
0:11:22.68,000 --> 0:11:25,000
over 90 percent of our elementary school teachers are women.

214
0:11:28.32,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Of course, it's not just what happens in the classroom.

215
0:11:31.72,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Social media plays a big role here, too.

216
0:11:34.76,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It wasn't so long ago

217
0:11:36.56,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that you could purchase a Teen Talk Barbie

218
0:11:39.6,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that when the cord was pulled,

219
0:11:41.08,000 --> 0:11:42,000
it would say things like,

220
0:11:42.8,000 --> 0:11:44,000
"Will we ever have enough clothes?"

221
0:11:45.36,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and "Math class is tough."

222
0:11:48.24,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And just a few years ago,

223
0:11:49.64,000 --> 0:11:52,000
major retailers were marketing T-shirts at our young girls

224
0:11:53.56,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that read things like, "I'm too pretty to do math,"

225
0:11:58.04,000 --> 0:12:01,000
or, "I'm too pretty to do my homework so my brother does it for me."

226
0:12:03.56,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And let's not forget about the parents.

227
0:12:06.12,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Oh, the parents.

228
0:12:08.48,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It turns out that when parents are worried about their own math ability

229
0:12:12.44,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and they help their kids a lot with math homework,

230
0:12:15.96,000 --> 0:12:18,000
their kids learn less math across the school year.

231
0:12:20.76,000 --> 0:12:22,000
As one parent put it,

232
0:12:22.8,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"I judge my first grader's math homework

233
0:12:25.08,000 --> 0:12:28,000
by whether it's a one-glass assignment or a three-glass night."

234
0:12:28.76,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

235
0:12:32.96,000 --> 0:12:34,000
When adults are anxious about their own math ability,

236
0:12:35.96,000 --> 0:12:36,000
it rubs off on their kids

237
0:12:37.56,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and it affects whether they choke or thrive.

238
0:12:40.96,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But just as we can put limits on others,

239
0:12:43.24,000 --> 0:12:44,000
we can take them off.

240
0:12:45.2,000 --> 0:12:46,000
My research team and I have shown

241
0:12:46.88,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that when we help parents do fun math activities with their kids --

242
0:12:51.12,000 --> 0:12:55,000
rather than, say, just doing bedtime stories or bedtime reading,

243
0:12:55.28,000 --> 0:12:56,000
they do bedtime math,

244
0:12:57.28,000 --> 0:13:,000
which are fun story problems to do with your kids at night,

245
0:13:01.32,000 --> 0:13:04,000
not only do children's attitudes about math improve,

246
0:13:04.36,000 --> 0:13:07,000
but their math performance across the school year improves as well.

247
0:13:09.44,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Our environment matters.

248
0:13:11.84,000 --> 0:13:15,000
From the classroom to parents to media,

249
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and it can really make a difference in terms of whether we choke or thrive.

250
0:13:23.48,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Fast-forward from my high school soccer game

251
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to my freshman year in college.

252
0:13:30.72,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I was in the chemistry sequence for science majors,

253
0:13:34.2,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and boy did I not belong.

254
0:13:37.48,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Even though I studied for my first midterm exam --

255
0:13:42.32,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I thought I was ready to go --

256
0:13:44.92,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I bombed it.

257
0:13:46.92,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I literally got the worst grade in a class of 400 students.

258
0:13:52.8,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I was convinced I wasn't going to be a science major,

259
0:13:55.32,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that maybe I was dropping out of college altogether.

260
0:13:58.68,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But then I changed how I studied.

261
0:14:01.76,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Instead of studying alone,

262
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I started studying with a group of friends

263
0:14:05.68,000 --> 0:14:08,000
who at the end of the study session would close their book

264
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and compete for the right answer.

265
0:14:12.12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We learned to practice under stress.

266
0:14:15.28,000 --> 0:14:18,000
If you could've looked inside my brain during that first midterm exam,

267
0:14:19.2,000 --> 0:14:21,000
you likely would've seen a neural pain response

268
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
a lot like the math-anxious individuals I study.

269
0:14:25.68,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It was probably there during the stressful study situation as well.

270
0:14:30.48,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But when I walked into the final,

271
0:14:32.6,000 --> 0:14:33,000
my mind was quiet,

272
0:14:34.36,000 --> 0:14:37,000
and I actually got one of the highest grades in the entire class.

273
0:14:40.48,000 --> 0:14:43,000
It wasn't just about learning the material;

274
0:14:43.64,000 --> 0:14:48,000
it was about learning how to overcome my limits when it mattered most.

275
0:14:49.96,000 --> 0:14:51,000
What happens in our heads really matters,

276
0:14:52.88,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and knowing this,

277
0:14:55.36,000 --> 0:15:,000
we can learn how to prepare ourselves and others for success,

278
0:15:00.8,000 --> 0:15:03,000
not just on the playing field but in the boardroom

279
0:15:03.88,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and in the classroom as well.

280
0:15:05.92,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Thank you.

281
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
(Applause)

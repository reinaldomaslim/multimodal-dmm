1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I was one of the founding members of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.

2
0:00:19.76,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed,

3
0:00:22.355,000 --> 0:00:24,000
who is an Egyptian-American, who actually had the idea

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to go to the Middle East and try it out before we went out as a tour.

5
0:00:28.633,000 --> 0:00:29,000
He went out solo and did it first.

6
0:00:30.311,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Then there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, being Iranian-American presents its own set of problems,

9
0:00:39.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
as you know.

10
0:00:40.475,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Those two countries aren't getting along these days.

11
0:00:42.976,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So it causes a lot of inner conflict, you know,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
like part of me likes me, part of me hates me.

13
0:00:47.466,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:48.49,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Part of me thinks I should have a nuclear program,

15
0:00:50.871,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the other part thinks I can't be trusted with one.

16
0:00:53.326,000 --> 0:00:55,000
These are dilemmas I have every day.

17
0:00:55.962,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But I was born in Iran; I'm now an American citizen,

18
0:00:58.713,000 --> 0:00:59,000
which means I have the American passport,

19
0:01:00.713,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which means I can travel.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Because if you only have the Iranian passport,

21
0:01:05.475,000 --> 0:01:08,000
you're kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms,

22
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.

23
0:01:11.3,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:14.147,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So, anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you,

25
0:01:17.528,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when you get it, it still says what country you were born in.

26
0:01:20.459,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So I remember getting my American passport.

27
0:01:22.518,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I was like, "Woo-hoo! I'm going to travel."

28
0:01:24.602,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I opened it up, it said, "Born in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!"

29
0:01:28.152,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:29.201,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"I'm trying to go places."

31
0:01:30.495,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:31.579,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But what's interesting is,

33
0:01:32.845,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I've never had trouble in any Western countries with my American passport,

34
0:01:36.381,000 --> 0:01:38,000
even though it says, "Born in Iran" -- no problems.

35
0:01:38.815,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Where I've had problems is in some of the Arab countries.

36
0:01:41.518,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I guess some of the Arab countries aren't getting along with Iran either.

37
0:01:45.023,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So I was in Kuwait recently, doing a comedy show

38
0:01:47.343,000 --> 0:01:48,000
with some other American comedians.

39
0:01:49.062,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They all went through.

40
0:01:50.239,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Then the border patrol saw my American passport: "Ah-ha! American, great."

41
0:01:53.861,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Then he opened it up. "Born in Iran? Wait."

42
0:01:55.934,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:57.494,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And he started asking me questions.

44
0:01:59.214,000 --> 0:02:,000
He said, "What is your father's name?"

45
0:02:01.684,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro."

46
0:02:04.777,000 --> 0:02:06,000
He goes, "What is your grandfather's name?"

47
0:02:07.206,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I said, "He passed away a long time ago.

48
0:02:09.274,000 --> 0:02:1,000
His name was Jabbar."

49
0:02:10.842,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He says, "You wait. I'll be back," and he walked away.

50
0:02:13.422,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I started freaking out,

51
0:02:14.739,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because I don't know what kind of crap my grandfather was into.

52
0:02:17.783,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:20.015,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Thought the guy was going to come back and be like,

54
0:02:22.459,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"We've been looking for you for 200 years."

55
0:02:24.532,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:27.458,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"Your grandfather has a parking violation. It's way overdue.

57
0:02:31.021,000 --> 0:02:32,000
You owe us two billion dollars."

58
0:02:32.838,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:34.534,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But as you can see, when I talk, I speak with an American accent,

60
0:02:37.711,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which you would think, as an Iranian-American actor,

61
0:02:40.362,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I should be able to play any part, good, bad, what have you.

62
0:02:43.261,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But a lot of times in Hollywood,

63
0:02:44.866,000 --> 0:02:47,000
when casting directors find out you're of Middle Eastern descent,

64
0:02:47.956,000 --> 0:02:48,000
they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great!

65
0:02:49.699,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'"

66
0:02:52.402,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I go, "I could say that, but what if I were to say,

67
0:02:54.845,000 --> 0:02:55,000
'Hello. I'm your doctor'?"

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They go, "Great! And then you hijack the hospital."

69
0:02:58.915,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:04.356,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Like, I think you're missing the point here.

71
0:03:07.156,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.

72
0:03:09.554,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank.

73
0:03:11.777,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I want to rob a bank in a film,

74
0:03:13.607,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but do it with a gun, not with a bomb strapped around me, right?

75
0:03:16.904,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:18.144,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Because I imagine the director: "Maz, I think your character

77
0:03:21.142,000 --> 0:03:23,000
would rob the bank with a bomb around him."

78
0:03:23.767,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"Why would I do that?

79
0:03:25.83,000 --> 0:03:27,000
If I want the money, why would I kill myself?"

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:31.375,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Right?

82
0:03:32.575,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Applause)

83
0:03:35.534,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up!"

84
0:03:37.945,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:41.815,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"Well, then blow yourself up.

86
0:03:43.564,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:44.844,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Just do it outside, please."

88
0:03:46.416,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:50.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But the fact is, there's good people everywhere.

90
0:03:52.546,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That's what I try and show in my stand-up, good people everywhere.

91
0:03:55.686,000 --> 0:03:56,000
All it takes in one person to mess it up.

92
0:03:57.671,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Like a couple months ago in Times Square in New York,

93
0:04:00.173,000 --> 0:04:03,000
there was a Pakistani Muslim guy who tried to blow up a car bomb.

94
0:04:03.257,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, I happened to be in Times Square that night doing a comedy show.

95
0:04:06.523,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And a few months before that, there was a white American guy in Austin, Texas

96
0:04:10.173,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who flew his airplane into the IRS building,

97
0:04:12.887,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and I happened to be in Austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show.

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now I'll tell you, as a Middle-Eastern male,

99
0:04:19.38,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when you show up around a lot of these activities,

100
0:04:22.148,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you start feeling guilty at one point.

101
0:04:24.118,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:25.143,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I was watching the news. I'm like, "Am I involved in this crap?"

103
0:04:28.256,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:33.18,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"

105
0:04:35.386,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:37.335,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But what was interesting was,

107
0:04:38.752,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the Pakistani Muslim guy -- see, he gives a bad name to Muslims

108
0:04:41.787,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis from all over the world.

109
0:04:44.721,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And one thing that happened there was also the Pakistani Taliban

110
0:04:47.842,000 --> 0:04:49,000
took credit for that failed car bombing.

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
My question is: Why would you take credit for a failed car bombing?

112
0:04:54.558,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"We just want to say:

113
0:04:56.79,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we tried."

114
0:04:58.003,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:02.412,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"And furthermore ...

116
0:05:03.912,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:05.085,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it is the thought that counts."

118
0:05:06.708,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:08.43,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause)

120
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."

121
0:05:17.394,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:19.459,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But what happened was, when the white guy flew his plane into the building,

123
0:05:23.033,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I know all my Middle Eastern and Muslim friends in the States

124
0:05:25.922,000 --> 0:05:26,000
were watching TV, going,

125
0:05:27.102,000 --> 0:05:3,000
"Please, don't be Middle Eastern. Don't be Hassan or Hussein."

126
0:05:30.186,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And the name came out: Jack. I'm like, "Woooo! That's not one of us!"

127
0:05:34.501,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But I kept watching the news in case they came back,

128
0:05:37.069,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and were like, "Before he did it, he converted to Islam."

129
0:05:39.879,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"

130
0:05:43.881,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But the fact is, I've been lucky

131
0:05:45.53,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to get a chance to perform all over the world,

132
0:05:47.722,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and I did a lot of shows in the Middle East.

133
0:05:49.855,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I just did a seven-country solo tour.

134
0:05:51.672,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.

135
0:05:54.014,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I was in Dubai.

136
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And it's great, there's good people everywhere.

137
0:05:57.483,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And you learn great things about these places.

138
0:05:59.658,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I encourage people always to go visit these places.

139
0:06:02.106,000 --> 0:06:03,000
For example, Dubai -- cool place.

140
0:06:03.708,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They're obsessed with having the biggest, tallest, longest, as we all know.

141
0:06:07.292,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.

142
0:06:09.238,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.

143
0:06:11.928,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!" I'm like, "What are you doing here?"

144
0:06:15.587,000 --> 0:06:17,000
He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store. It's three miles away.

145
0:06:18.507,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Out of my way. Out of my way. Out of my way."

146
0:06:20.835,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:22.109,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And what's crazy -- there's a recession going on, even in Dubai,

148
0:06:25.201,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but you wouldn't know by the prices.

149
0:06:26.999,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Like in the Dubai Mall, they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.

150
0:06:31.301,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's like a drug deal.

151
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst! Habibi, my friend."

152
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

153
0:06:38.424,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"You want some frozen yogurt?

154
0:06:40.077,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:41.648,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Come here. Come here. Come here.

156
0:06:43.765,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram. How many gram do you want?"

157
0:06:46.873,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:47.937,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I bought five grams. 10 dollars. 10 dollars! I said, "What's in this?"

159
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
He's like, "Good stuff, man. Colombian. Top of the line."

160
0:06:54.024,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

161
0:06:55.086,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The other thing you learn when you travel in these countries,

162
0:06:57.988,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in the Middle East, Latin American, South American countries,

163
0:07:00.888,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a lot of times when they build stuff, there's no rules and regulations.

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
For example, I took my two-year-old son to the playground at the Dubai Mall.

165
0:07:07.92,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And I've taken him to playgrounds all over the United States.

166
0:07:10.855,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And when you put your two-year-old on a slide in the United States,

167
0:07:14.076,000 --> 0:07:15,000
they put something on the slide

168
0:07:16.015,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide.

169
0:07:19.103,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Not in the Middle East.

170
0:07:20.717,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:23.188,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I put my two-year-old on the slide, he went whoosh! He took off!

172
0:07:26.437,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter)

173
0:07:27.563,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I went down and, "Where's my son?" "On the third floor, sir. Third floor."

174
0:07:31.202,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

175
0:07:33.14,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"You take a taxi. You go to Zara. Make a left."

176
0:07:35.523,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:38.083,000 --> 0:07:4,000
"Try the yogurt. It's very good. Little expensive."

178
0:07:40.824,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

179
0:07:42.931,000 --> 0:07:45,000
But one thing I try to do with my stand-up is break stereotypes.

180
0:07:46.001,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I've been guilty of stereotyping as well.

181
0:07:48.138,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I was in Dubai. And there's a lot of Indians who work in Dubai.

182
0:07:51.126,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And they don't get paid that well.

183
0:07:52.781,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And I got it in my head that all the Indians must be workers.

184
0:07:55.682,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I forgot there's obviously successful Indians in Dubai too.

185
0:07:58.52,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I was doing a show, and they said, "We'll send a driver to pick you up."

186
0:08:01.961,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I went down to the lobby, and saw this Indian guy.

187
0:08:04.355,000 --> 0:08:05,000
I go, "He must be my driver,"

188
0:08:05.772,000 --> 0:08:08,000
since he's standing there in a cheap suit, thin mustache, staring at me.

189
0:08:09.205,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?"

190
0:08:11.083,000 --> 0:08:12,000
He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."

191
0:08:12.884,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

192
0:08:17.354,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I go, "I'm sorry! Why were you staring at me?"

193
0:08:19.596,000 --> 0:08:21,000
He goes, "I thought you were my driver."

194
0:08:21.662,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:24.196,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

196
0:08:32.473,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:35.422,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I'll leave you with this: I try, with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,

198
0:08:38.827,000 --> 0:08:4,000
present Middle Easterners and Muslims in a positive light.

199
0:08:41.611,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I hope that in the coming years,

200
0:08:43.21,000 --> 0:08:45,000
more film and television programs come out of Hollywood,

201
0:08:45.915,000 --> 0:08:46,000
presenting us in a positive light.

202
0:08:47.717,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Who knows? Maybe one day, we'll even have our own James Bond. Right?

203
0:08:51.669,000 --> 0:08:52,000
"My name is Bond.

204
0:08:52.854,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Jamal Bond."

205
0:08:54.039,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

206
0:08:55.506,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Til then, I'll keep telling jokes. Hope you keep laughing.

207
0:08:58.253,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Have a good day. Thank you.

208
0:08:59.574,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

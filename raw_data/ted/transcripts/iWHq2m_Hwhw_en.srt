1
0:00:12.602,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The first patient to ever be treated with an antibiotic

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
was a policeman in Oxford.

3
0:00:17.693,000 --> 0:00:19,000
On his day off from work,

4
0:00:19.8,000 --> 0:00:22,000
he was scratched by a rose thorn while working in the garden.

5
0:00:23.173,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That small scratch became infected.

6
0:00:26.848,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Over the next few days, his head was swollen

7
0:00:29.163,000 --> 0:00:3,000
with abscesses,

8
0:00:30.884,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and in fact his eye was so infected

9
0:00:33.167,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that they had to take it out,

10
0:00:35.07,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and by February of 1941,

11
0:00:38.05,000 --> 0:00:4,000
this poor man was on the verge of dying.

12
0:00:40.487,000 --> 0:00:43,000
He was at Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford,

13
0:00:43.685,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and fortunately for him,

14
0:00:45.991,000 --> 0:00:46,000
a small team of doctors

15
0:00:47.041,000 --> 0:00:48,000
led by a Dr. Howard Florey

16
0:00:48.93,000 --> 0:00:5,000
had managed to synthesize

17
0:00:50.997,000 --> 0:00:52,000
a very small amount of penicillin,

18
0:00:53.82,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a drug that had been discovered

19
0:00:55.901,000 --> 0:00:57,000
12 years before by Alexander Fleming

20
0:00:58.223,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but had never actually been used to treat a human,

21
0:01:01.93,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and indeed no one even knew if the drug would work,

22
0:01:04.34,000 --> 0:01:07,000
if it was full of impurities that would kill the patient,

23
0:01:07.98,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but Florey and his team figured

24
0:01:09.894,000 --> 0:01:1,000
if they had to use it, they might as well use it

25
0:01:11.616,000 --> 0:01:13,000
on someone who was going to die anyway.

26
0:01:14.181,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So they gave Albert Alexander,

27
0:01:17.836,000 --> 0:01:19,000
this Oxford policeman, the drug,

28
0:01:20.715,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and within 24 hours,

29
0:01:23.132,000 --> 0:01:25,000
he started getting better.

30
0:01:25.394,000 --> 0:01:28,000
His fever went down, his appetite came back.

31
0:01:29.37,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Second day, he was doing much better.

32
0:01:31.683,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They were starting to run out of penicillin,

33
0:01:33.921,000 --> 0:01:35,000
so what they would do was run with his urine

34
0:01:35.983,000 --> 0:01:37,000
across the road to re-synthesize the penicillin from his urine

35
0:01:38.833,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and give it back to him,

36
0:01:40.768,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and that worked.

37
0:01:42.016,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Day four, well on the way to recovery.

38
0:01:44.496,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This was a miracle.

39
0:01:46.134,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Day five, they ran out of penicillin,

40
0:01:50.37,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the poor man died.

41
0:01:52.637,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So that story didn't end that well,

42
0:01:55.35,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but fortunately for millions of other people,

43
0:01:59.7,000 --> 0:02:02,000
like this child who was treated again in the early 1940s,

44
0:02:02.706,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who was again dying of a sepsis,

45
0:02:05.74,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and within just six days, you can see,

46
0:02:08.89,000 --> 0:02:11,000
recovered thanks to this wonder drug, penicillin.

47
0:02:12.243,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Millions have lived,

48
0:02:14.201,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and global health has been transformed.

49
0:02:17.785,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Now, antibiotics have been used

50
0:02:20.578,000 --> 0:02:23,000
for patients like this,

51
0:02:23.705,000 --> 0:02:25,000
but they've also been used rather frivolously

52
0:02:25.842,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in some instances,

53
0:02:27.586,000 --> 0:02:29,000
for treating someone with just a cold or the flu,

54
0:02:29.949,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which they might not have responded to an antibiotic,

55
0:02:32.423,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and they've also been used in large quantities

56
0:02:36.161,000 --> 0:02:39,000
sub-therapeutically, which means in small concentrations,

57
0:02:39.803,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to make chicken and hogs grow faster.

58
0:02:42.986,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Just to save a few pennies on the price of meat,

59
0:02:46.552,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we've spent a lot of antibiotics on animals,

60
0:02:49.252,000 --> 0:02:51,000
not for treatment, not for sick animals,

61
0:02:51.614,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but primarily for growth promotion.

62
0:02:54.73,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now, what did that lead us to?

63
0:02:57.587,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Basically, the massive use of antibiotics

64
0:03:00.298,000 --> 0:03:01,000
around the world

65
0:03:01.783,000 --> 0:03:04,000
has imposed such large selection pressure on bacteria

66
0:03:05.587,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that resistance is now a problem,

67
0:03:08.24,000 --> 0:03:09,000
because we've now selected for just

68
0:03:10.01,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the resistant bacteria.

69
0:03:11.985,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I'm sure you've all read about this in the newspapers,

70
0:03:14.825,000 --> 0:03:15,000
you've seen this in every magazine

71
0:03:16.629,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that you come across,

72
0:03:18.528,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but I really want you to appreciate

73
0:03:20.328,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the significance of this problem.

74
0:03:22.499,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is serious.

75
0:03:23.95,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The next slide I'm about to show you is of carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter.

76
0:03:28.766,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Acinetobacter is a nasty hospital bug,

77
0:03:31.154,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and carbapenem is pretty much

78
0:03:32.487,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the strongest class of antibiotics

79
0:03:34.265,000 --> 0:03:36,000
that we can throw at this bug.

80
0:03:36.721,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And you can see in 1999

81
0:03:39.99,000 --> 0:03:41,000
this is the pattern of resistance,

82
0:03:42.185,000 --> 0:03:45,000
mostly under about 10 percent across the United States.

83
0:03:45.218,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now watch what happens when we play the video.

84
0:03:58.461,000 --> 0:04:,000
So I don't know where you live,

85
0:04:00.516,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but wherever it is, it certainly is a lot worse now

86
0:04:03.418,000 --> 0:04:05,000
than it was in 1999,

87
0:04:05.915,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and that is the problem of antibiotic resistance.

88
0:04:09.886,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's a global issue

89
0:04:11.573,000 --> 0:04:13,000
affecting both rich and poor countries,

90
0:04:14.001,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and at the heart of it, you might say, well,

91
0:04:16.242,000 --> 0:04:17,000
isn't this really just a medical issue?

92
0:04:18.17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
If we taught doctors how not to use antibiotics as much,

93
0:04:20.731,000 --> 0:04:22,000
if we taught patients how not to demand antibiotics,

94
0:04:23.676,000 --> 0:04:24,000
perhaps this really wouldn't be an issue,

95
0:04:25.131,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and maybe the pharmaceutical companies

96
0:04:27.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
should be working harder to develop

97
0:04:28.875,000 --> 0:04:29,000
more antibiotics.

98
0:04:30.511,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now, it turns out that there's something fundamental about antibiotics

99
0:04:33.89,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which makes it different from other drugs,

100
0:04:35.673,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which is that if I misuse antibiotics

101
0:04:37.694,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or I use antibiotics,

102
0:04:39.431,000 --> 0:04:42,000
not only am I affected but others are affected as well,

103
0:04:43.291,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in the same way as if I choose to drive to work

104
0:04:45.629,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or take a plane to go somewhere,

105
0:04:48.268,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that the costs I impose on others

106
0:04:50.242,000 --> 0:04:52,000
through global climate change go everywhere,

107
0:04:52.682,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I don't necessarily take these costs into consideration.

108
0:04:55.455,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is what economists might call a problem of the commons,

109
0:04:58.334,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and the problem of the commons is exactly

110
0:05:00.314,000 --> 0:05:02,000
what we face in the case of antibiotics as well:

111
0:05:02.739,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that we don't consider —

112
0:05:04.889,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and we, including individuals, patients,

113
0:05:07.891,000 --> 0:05:1,000
hospitals, entire health systems —

114
0:05:11.05,000 --> 0:05:13,000
do not consider the costs that they impose on others

115
0:05:13.198,000 --> 0:05:15,000
by the way antibiotics are actually used.

116
0:05:15.554,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now, that's a problem that's similar

117
0:05:17.959,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to another area that we all know about,

118
0:05:19.941,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which is of fuel use and energy,

119
0:05:21.87,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and of course energy use

120
0:05:23.369,000 --> 0:05:26,000
both depletes energy as well as

121
0:05:26.451,000 --> 0:05:29,000
leads to local pollution and climate change.

122
0:05:29.713,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And typically, in the case of energy,

123
0:05:31.523,000 --> 0:05:33,000
there are two ways in which you can deal with the problem.

124
0:05:33.831,000 --> 0:05:36,000
One is, we can make better use of the oil that we have,

125
0:05:37.576,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and that's analogous to making better use

126
0:05:39.691,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of existing antibiotics,

127
0:05:41.239,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and we can do this in a number of ways

128
0:05:42.93,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that we'll talk about in a second,

129
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but the other option is the "drill, baby, drill" option,

130
0:05:48.847,000 --> 0:05:52,000
which in the case of antibiotics is to go find new antibiotics.

131
0:05:53.05,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, these are not separate.

132
0:05:55.1,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They're related, because if we invest heavily

133
0:05:58.522,000 --> 0:06:,000
in new oil wells,

134
0:06:00.806,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we reduce the incentives for conservation of oil

135
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in the same way that's going to happen for antibiotics.

136
0:06:06.286,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The reverse is also going to happen, which is that

137
0:06:08.454,000 --> 0:06:1,000
if we use our antibiotics appropriately,

138
0:06:10.792,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we don't necessarily have to make the investments

139
0:06:13.573,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in new drug development.

140
0:06:15.75,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And if you thought that these two were entirely,

141
0:06:18.466,000 --> 0:06:19,000
fully balanced between these two options,

142
0:06:20.288,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you might consider the fact that

143
0:06:22.471,000 --> 0:06:24,000
this is really a game that we're playing.

144
0:06:24.743,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The game is really one of coevolution,

145
0:06:27.184,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and coevolution is, in this particular picture,

146
0:06:30.116,000 --> 0:06:32,000
between cheetahs and gazelles.

147
0:06:32.472,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Cheetahs have evolved to run faster,

148
0:06:34.09,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because if they didn't run faster,

149
0:06:35.667,000 --> 0:06:36,000
they wouldn't get any lunch.

150
0:06:37.613,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Gazelles have evolved to run faster because

151
0:06:40.3,000 --> 0:06:43,000
if they don't run faster, they would be lunch.

152
0:06:43.509,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Now, this is the game we're playing against the bacteria,

153
0:06:46.395,000 --> 0:06:48,000
except we're not the cheetahs,

154
0:06:48.452,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we're the gazelles,

155
0:06:49.929,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the bacteria would,

156
0:06:52.716,000 --> 0:06:53,000
just in the course of this little talk,

157
0:06:54.549,000 --> 0:06:55,000
would have had kids and grandkids

158
0:06:55.975,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and figured out how to be resistant

159
0:06:58.36,000 --> 0:07:,000
just by selection and trial and error,

160
0:07:00.834,000 --> 0:07:01,000
trying it over and over again.

161
0:07:02.746,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Whereas how do we stay ahead of the bacteria?

162
0:07:06.518,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We have drug discovery processes,

163
0:07:08.572,000 --> 0:07:09,000
screening molecules,

164
0:07:10.202,000 --> 0:07:11,000
we have clinical trials,

165
0:07:11.93,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and then, when we think we have a drug,

166
0:07:14.078,000 --> 0:07:17,000
then we have the FDA regulatory process.

167
0:07:17.823,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And once we go through all of that,

168
0:07:20.001,000 --> 0:07:22,000
then we try to stay one step ahead

169
0:07:22.266,000 --> 0:07:24,000
of the bacteria.

170
0:07:24.562,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, this is clearly not a game that can be sustained,

171
0:07:27.339,000 --> 0:07:28,000
or one that we can win

172
0:07:28.476,000 --> 0:07:29,000
by simply innovating to stay ahead.

173
0:07:30.313,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We've got to slow the pace of coevolution down,

174
0:07:33.618,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and there are ideas that we can borrow from energy

175
0:07:37.3,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that are helpful in thinking about

176
0:07:39.07,000 --> 0:07:4,000
how we might want to do this in the case

177
0:07:40.607,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of antibiotics as well.

178
0:07:42.153,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, if you think about how we deal with

179
0:07:44.393,000 --> 0:07:45,000
energy pricing, for instance,

180
0:07:45.816,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we consider emissions taxes,

181
0:07:47.665,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which means we're imposing the costs of pollution

182
0:07:50.249,000 --> 0:07:52,000
on people who actually use that energy.

183
0:07:53.08,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We might consider doing that for antibiotics as well,

184
0:07:56.06,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and perhaps that would make sure that antibiotics

185
0:07:58.771,000 --> 0:08:,000
actually get used appropriately.

186
0:08:01.172,000 --> 0:08:03,000
There are clean energy subsidies,

187
0:08:03.2,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which are to switch to fuels which don't pollute as much

188
0:08:06.255,000 --> 0:08:08,000
or perhaps don't need fossil fuels.

189
0:08:09.1,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now, the analogy here is, perhaps we need

190
0:08:11.96,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to move away from using antibiotics,

191
0:08:14.22,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and if you think about it, what are good substitutes for antibiotics?

192
0:08:17.936,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Well, turns out that anything that reduces

193
0:08:20.1,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the need for the antibiotic would really work,

194
0:08:22.343,000 --> 0:08:25,000
so that could include improving hospital infection control

195
0:08:25.485,000 --> 0:08:27,000
or vaccinating people,

196
0:08:28.38,000 --> 0:08:3,000
particularly against the seasonal influenza.

197
0:08:30.677,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And the seasonal flu is probably

198
0:08:33.208,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the biggest driver of antibiotic use,

199
0:08:36.212,000 --> 0:08:38,000
both in this country as well as in many other countries,

200
0:08:39.131,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and that could really help.

201
0:08:41.151,000 --> 0:08:45,000
A third option might include something like tradeable permits.

202
0:08:45.254,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And these seem like faraway scenarios,

203
0:08:49.5,000 --> 0:08:51,000
but if you consider the fact that we might not

204
0:08:51.927,000 --> 0:08:54,000
have antibiotics for many people who have infections,

205
0:08:55.31,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we might consider the fact that we might

206
0:08:57.547,000 --> 0:08:59,000
want to allocate who actually gets to use

207
0:08:59.858,000 --> 0:09:01,000
some of these antibiotics over others,

208
0:09:02.572,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and some of these might have to be on the basis of clinical need,

209
0:09:05.898,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but also on the basis of pricing.

210
0:09:07.833,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And certainly consumer education works.

211
0:09:09.743,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Very often, people overuse antibiotics

212
0:09:12.344,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or prescribe too much without necessarily

213
0:09:14.621,000 --> 0:09:15,000
knowing that they do so,

214
0:09:16.227,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and feedback mechanisms

215
0:09:17.658,000 --> 0:09:18,000
have been found to be useful,

216
0:09:19.56,000 --> 0:09:2,000
both on energy —

217
0:09:21.489,000 --> 0:09:22,000
When you tell someone that they're using

218
0:09:23.029,000 --> 0:09:24,000
a lot of energy during peak hour,

219
0:09:24.946,000 --> 0:09:25,000
they tend to cut back,

220
0:09:26.416,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and the same sort of example has been performed

221
0:09:28.183,000 --> 0:09:29,000
even in the case of antibiotics.

222
0:09:29.993,000 --> 0:09:3,000
A hospital in St. Louis basically would put up

223
0:09:31.974,000 --> 0:09:35,000
on a chart the names of surgeons

224
0:09:36.166,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in the ordering of how much antibiotics they'd used

225
0:09:38.385,000 --> 0:09:39,000
in the previous month,

226
0:09:40.329,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and this was purely an informational feedback,

227
0:09:42.671,000 --> 0:09:43,000
there was no shaming,

228
0:09:43.854,000 --> 0:09:45,000
but essentially that provided some information back

229
0:09:45.989,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to surgeons that maybe they could rethink

230
0:09:47.943,000 --> 0:09:49,000
how they were using antibiotics.

231
0:09:50.172,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Now, there's a lot that can be done

232
0:09:52.186,000 --> 0:09:54,000
on the supply side as well.

233
0:09:54.335,000 --> 0:09:55,000
If you look at the price of penicillin,

234
0:09:56.112,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the cost per day is about 10 cents.

235
0:09:57.763,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's a fairly cheap drug.

236
0:09:59.521,000 --> 0:10:01,000
If you take drugs that have been introduced since then —

237
0:10:01.658,000 --> 0:10:03,000
linezolid or daptomycin —

238
0:10:04.302,000 --> 0:10:05,000
those are significantly more expensive,

239
0:10:06.18,000 --> 0:10:11,000
so to a world that has been used to paying 10 cents a day for antibiotics,

240
0:10:11.633,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the idea of paying 180 dollars per day

241
0:10:14.163,000 --> 0:10:15,000
seems like a lot.

242
0:10:15.73,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But what is that really telling us?

243
0:10:17.717,000 --> 0:10:18,000
That price is telling us

244
0:10:19.682,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that we should no longer

245
0:10:21.58,000 --> 0:10:25,000
take cheap, effective antibiotics as a given

246
0:10:25.697,000 --> 0:10:26,000
into the foreseeable future,

247
0:10:27.464,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and that price is a signal to us

248
0:10:29.994,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that perhaps we need to be paying

249
0:10:31.603,000 --> 0:10:33,000
much more attention to conservation.

250
0:10:34.156,000 --> 0:10:36,000
That price is also a signal

251
0:10:36.86,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that maybe we need to start looking at other technologies,

252
0:10:39.735,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in the same way that gasoline prices are a signal

253
0:10:42.387,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and an impetus, to, say,

254
0:10:44.977,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the development of electric cars.

255
0:10:46.845,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Prices are important signals

256
0:10:48.622,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and we need to pay attention,

257
0:10:50.208,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but we also need to consider the fact that

258
0:10:52.66,000 --> 0:10:56,000
although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics,

259
0:10:56.912,000 --> 0:10:58,000
they're nothing compared to the price per day

260
0:10:59.151,000 --> 0:11:,000
of some cancer drugs,

261
0:11:00.535,000 --> 0:11:03,000
which might save a patient's life only for a few months or perhaps a year,

262
0:11:03.905,000 --> 0:11:04,000
whereas antibiotics would potentially

263
0:11:05.675,000 --> 0:11:06,000
save a patient's life forever.

264
0:11:07.501,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So this is going to involve

265
0:11:08.82,000 --> 0:11:09,000
a whole new paradigm shift,

266
0:11:10.782,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and it's also a scary shift because

267
0:11:12.638,000 --> 0:11:14,000
in many parts of this country,

268
0:11:14.967,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in many parts of the world,

269
0:11:16.711,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the idea of paying 200 dollars

270
0:11:18.78,000 --> 0:11:2,000
for a day of antibiotic treatment

271
0:11:21.671,000 --> 0:11:23,000
is simply unimaginable.

272
0:11:24.213,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So we need to think about that.

273
0:11:25.947,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Now, there are backstop options,

274
0:11:27.76,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which is other alternative technologies

275
0:11:30.436,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that people are working on.

276
0:11:31.63,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It includes bacteriophages, probiotics,

277
0:11:34.282,000 --> 0:11:38,000
quorum sensing, synbiotics.

278
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Now, all of these are useful avenues to pursue,

279
0:11:41.369,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and they will become even more lucrative

280
0:11:43.979,000 --> 0:11:46,000
when the price of new antibiotics starts going higher,

281
0:11:47.06,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and we've seen that the market does actually respond,

282
0:11:49.957,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the government is now considering

283
0:11:51.965,000 --> 0:11:54,000
ways of subsidizing new antibiotics and development.

284
0:11:55.732,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But there are challenges here.

285
0:11:57.455,000 --> 0:11:58,000
We don't want to just throw money at a problem.

286
0:11:59.03,000 --> 0:12:,000
What we want to be able to do

287
0:12:00.549,000 --> 0:12:02,000
is invest in new antibiotics

288
0:12:02.828,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in ways that actually encourage

289
0:12:05.804,000 --> 0:12:08,000
appropriate use and sales of those antibiotics,

290
0:12:08.824,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and that really is the challenge here.

291
0:12:11.287,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Now, going back to these technologies,

292
0:12:13.616,000 --> 0:12:15,000
you all remember the line from that famous

293
0:12:15.979,000 --> 0:12:17,000
dinosaur film, "Nature will find a way."

294
0:12:18.205,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So it's not as if these are permanent solutions.

295
0:12:21.524,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We really have to remember that, whatever the technology might be,

296
0:12:25.61,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that nature will find some way to work around it.

297
0:12:28.486,000 --> 0:12:3,000
You might think, well, this is just a problem

298
0:12:30.557,000 --> 0:12:32,000
just with antibiotics and with bacteria,

299
0:12:33.301,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but it turns out that we have the exact same

300
0:12:35.247,000 --> 0:12:37,000
identical problem in many other fields as well,

301
0:12:37.981,000 --> 0:12:39,000
with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,

302
0:12:40.933,000 --> 0:12:43,000
which is a serious problem in India and South Africa.

303
0:12:44.495,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Thousands of patients are dying because

304
0:12:46.282,000 --> 0:12:47,000
the second-line drugs are so expensive,

305
0:12:48.116,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and in some instances, even those don't work

306
0:12:50.343,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and you have XDR TB.

307
0:12:52.413,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Viruses are becoming resistant.

308
0:12:54.224,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Agricultural pests. Malaria parasites.

309
0:12:57.39,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Right now, much of the world depends on

310
0:12:59.173,000 --> 0:13:02,000
one drug, artemisinin drugs,

311
0:13:02.87,000 --> 0:13:03,000
essentially to treat malaria.

312
0:13:04.826,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Resistance to artemisinin has already emerged,

313
0:13:07.413,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and if this were to become widespread,

314
0:13:09.767,000 --> 0:13:1,000
that puts at risk

315
0:13:11.115,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the single drug that we have to treat malaria around the world

316
0:13:14.006,000 --> 0:13:17,000
in a way that's currently safe and efficacious.

317
0:13:17.22,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Mosquitos develop resistance.

318
0:13:19.018,000 --> 0:13:21,000
If you have kids, you probably know about head lice,

319
0:13:21.255,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and if you're from New York City,

320
0:13:22.968,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I understand that the specialty there is bedbugs.

321
0:13:25.701,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So those are also resistant.

322
0:13:27.956,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And we have to bring an example from across the pond.

323
0:13:30.835,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Turns out that rats are also resistant to poisons.

324
0:13:33.19,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Now, what's common to all of these things is

325
0:13:35.891,000 --> 0:13:37,000
the idea that we've had these technologies

326
0:13:38.597,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to control nature only for the last 70, 80 or 100 years

327
0:13:43.218,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and essentially in a blink,

328
0:13:46.246,000 --> 0:13:48,000
we have squandered our ability to control,

329
0:13:48.797,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because we have not recognized

330
0:13:51.288,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that natural selection and evolution was going to find

331
0:13:54.1,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a way to get back,

332
0:13:55.274,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and we need to completely rethink

333
0:13:57.323,000 --> 0:13:59,000
how we're going to use

334
0:13:59.666,000 --> 0:14:02,000
measures to control biological organisms,

335
0:14:02.76,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and rethink how we incentivize

336
0:14:06.224,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the development, introduction,

337
0:14:08.45,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in the case of antibiotics prescription,

338
0:14:11.118,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and use of these valuable resources.

339
0:14:14.89,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And we really now need to start thinking about them

340
0:14:17.27,000 --> 0:14:18,000
as natural resources.

341
0:14:19.228,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And so we stand at a crossroads.

342
0:14:21.466,000 --> 0:14:24,000
An option is to go through that rethinking

343
0:14:24.625,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and carefully consider incentives

344
0:14:26.438,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to change how we do business.

345
0:14:28.992,000 --> 0:14:3,000
The alternative is

346
0:14:31.253,000 --> 0:14:34,000
a world in which even a blade of grass

347
0:14:34.336,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is a potentially lethal weapon.

348
0:14:36.765,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Thank you.

349
0:14:38.565,000 --> 0:14:4,000

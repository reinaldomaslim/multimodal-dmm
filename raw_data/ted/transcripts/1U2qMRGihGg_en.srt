1
0:00:13.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What if you could make your sleep more efficient?

2
0:00:17.4,000 --> 0:00:18,000
As a sleep scientist,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
this is the question that has captivated me

4
0:00:22.08,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for the past 10 years.

5
0:00:24.36,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Because while the lightbulb and technology have brought about a world

6
0:00:28.96,000 --> 0:00:31,000
of 24-hour work and productivity,

7
0:00:32.44,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it has come at the cost

8
0:00:34.12,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of our naturally occurring circadian rhythm

9
0:00:37.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and our body's need for sleep.

10
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The circadian rhythm dictates our energy level throughout the day,

11
0:00:44.479,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and only recently we've been conducting a global experiment on this rhythm,

12
0:00:49.36,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which is putting our sleep health

13
0:00:51.44,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and ultimately our life quality in jeopardy.

14
0:00:56.24,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Because of this,

15
0:00:57.52,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we aren't getting the sleep we need,

16
0:00:59.68,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with the average American sleeping a whole hour less

17
0:01:03.44,000 --> 0:01:05,000
than they did in the 1940s.

18
0:01:05.96,000 --> 0:01:06,000
For some reason,

19
0:01:07.24,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we decided to wear it as a badge of honor

20
0:01:09.52,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that we can get by on not enough sleep.

21
0:01:12.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This all adds up to a real health crisis.

22
0:01:16.879,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Most of us know that poor sleep is linked to diseases

23
0:01:20.56,000 --> 0:01:22,000
like Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease,

24
0:01:23.32,000 --> 0:01:25,000
stroke and diabetes.

25
0:01:25.88,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And if you go untreated with a sleep disorder like sleep apnea,

26
0:01:29.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you're more likely to get many of these illnesses.

27
0:01:33.08,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But did you know about sleep's impact on your mental states?

28
0:01:38.36,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Poor sleep makes us make risky, rash decisions

29
0:01:42.76,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and is a drain on our capacity for empathy.

30
0:01:46.72,000 --> 0:01:51,000
When sleep deprivation literally makes us more sensitive to our own pain,

31
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it's not so surprising that we have a hard time relating to others

32
0:01:56.2,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and just generally being a good and healthy person

33
0:01:59.44,000 --> 0:02:,000
when we're sleep-deprived.

34
0:02:01.64,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Scientists are now starting to understand

35
0:02:04.32,000 --> 0:02:06,000
how not only the quantity

36
0:02:06.52,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but also the quality of sleep impacts our health and well-being.

37
0:02:12.36,000 --> 0:02:13,000
My research focuses

38
0:02:14.2,000 --> 0:02:19,000
on what many scientists believe is the most regenerative stage of sleep:

39
0:02:19.24,000 --> 0:02:2,000
deep sleep.

40
0:02:20.919,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We now know that generally speaking,

41
0:02:23.28,000 --> 0:02:25,000
there are three stages of sleep:

42
0:02:25.92,000 --> 0:02:26,000
light sleep,

43
0:02:27.28,000 --> 0:02:29,000
rapid eye movement or REM

44
0:02:29.32,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and deep sleep.

45
0:02:31.08,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We measure these stages by connecting electrodes to the scalp, chin and chest.

46
0:02:37.6,000 --> 0:02:38,000
In light sleep and REM,

47
0:02:39.08,000 --> 0:02:43,000
our brain waves are very similar to our brain waves in waking life.

48
0:02:43.72,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But our brain waves in deep sleep have these long-burst brain waves

49
0:02:47.84,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that are very different from our waking life brain waves.

50
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:55,000
These long-burst brain waves are called delta waves.

51
0:02:56.6,000 --> 0:02:58,000
When we don't get the deep sleep we need,

52
0:02:59.08,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it inhibits our ability to learn

53
0:03:01.28,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and for our cells and bodies to recover.

54
0:03:04.92,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Deep sleep is how we convert all those interactions

55
0:03:08.12,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that we make during the day

56
0:03:09.84,000 --> 0:03:11,000
into our long-term memory and personalities.

57
0:03:13.2,000 --> 0:03:14,000
As we get older,

58
0:03:14.48,000 --> 0:03:17,000
we're more likely to lose these regenerative delta waves.

59
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So in way, deep sleep and delta waves

60
0:03:20.84,000 --> 0:03:23,000
are actually a marker for biological youth.

61
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So naturally, I wanted to get more deep sleep for myself

62
0:03:29.24,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and I literally tried almost every gadget, gizmo, device and hack out there --

63
0:03:34.96,000 --> 0:03:35,000
consumer-grade, clinical-grade,

64
0:03:36.92,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what have you.

65
0:03:38.72,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I learned a lot, and I found I really do need, like most people,

66
0:03:42.56,000 --> 0:03:43,000
eight hours of sleep.

67
0:03:44.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I even shifted my circadian component

68
0:03:47.32,000 --> 0:03:5,000
by changing my meals, exercise and light exposure,

69
0:03:51.04,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but I still couldn't find a way to get a deeper night of sleep ...

70
0:03:55.32,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that is until I met Dr. Dmitry Gerashchenko

71
0:03:58.4,000 --> 0:04:,000
from Harvard Medical School.

72
0:04:00.72,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Dmitry told me about a new finding in the literature,

73
0:04:03.92,000 --> 0:04:07,000
where a lab out of Germany showed that if you could play certain sounds

74
0:04:08.36,000 --> 0:04:1,000
at the right time in people's sleep,

75
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:13,000
you could actually make sleep deeper and more efficient.

76
0:04:15.08,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And what's more, is that this lab showed

77
0:04:17.76,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that you actually could improve next-day memory performance

78
0:04:21.28,000 --> 0:04:22,000
with this sound.

79
0:04:23.08,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Dmitry and I teamed up,

80
0:04:24.48,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and we began working on a way to build this technology.

81
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:31,000
With our research lab collaborators at Penn State,

82
0:04:32.44,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we designed experiments in order to validate our system.

83
0:04:35.88,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And we've since received grant funding from the National Science Foundation

84
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and the National Institute of Health

85
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to develop this deep-sleep stimulating technology.

86
0:04:45.48,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Here's how it works.

87
0:04:47.08,000 --> 0:04:48,000
People came into the lab

88
0:04:48.36,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we hooked them up to a number of devices,

89
0:04:50.76,000 --> 0:04:51,000
two of which I have on right here --

90
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
not a fashion statement.

91
0:04:53.84,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:56.2,000 --> 0:04:58,000
When we detected that people were in deep sleep,

93
0:04:59.04,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we played the deep-sleep stimulating sounds

94
0:05:01.72,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that were shown to make them have deeper sleep.

95
0:05:04.4,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'm going to demo this sound for you right now.

96
0:05:08.28,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Repeating sound waves)

97
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Pretty weird, right?

98
0:05:17.84,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:19.6,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So that sound is actually at the same burst frequency as your brain waves

100
0:05:25.08,000 --> 0:05:27,000
when your brain is in deep sleep.

101
0:05:27.44,000 --> 0:05:3,000
That sound pattern actually primes your mind

102
0:05:30.72,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to have more of these regenerative delta waves.

103
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
When we asked participants the next day about the sounds,

104
0:05:37.04,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they were completely unaware that we played the sounds,

105
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:42,000
yet their brains responded with more of these delta waves.

106
0:05:44.28,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Here's an image of someone's brain waves from the study that we conducted.

107
0:05:48.2,000 --> 0:05:49,000
See the bottom panel?

108
0:05:49.92,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This shows the sound being played at that burst frequency.

109
0:05:53.44,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now look at the brain waves in the upper part of the graph.

110
0:05:56.56,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You can see from the graph

111
0:05:58.52,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that the sound is actually producing more of these regenerative delta waves.

112
0:06:04.12,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We learned that we could accurately track sleep

113
0:06:06.96,000 --> 0:06:08,000
without hooking people up to electrodes

114
0:06:09.68,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and make people sleep deeper.

115
0:06:12.8,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We're continuing to develop

116
0:06:14.24,000 --> 0:06:17,000
the right sound environment and sleep habitat

117
0:06:17.68,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to improve people's sleep health.

118
0:06:20.64,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Our sleep isn't as regenerative as it could be,

119
0:06:24.28,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but maybe one day soon,

120
0:06:26.12,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we could wear a small device

121
0:06:28.56,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and get more out of our sleep.

122
0:06:31.04,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Thank you.

123
0:06:32.28,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Applause)

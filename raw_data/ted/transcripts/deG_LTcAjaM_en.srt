1
0:00:13.404,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Almost 20 years have passed since 9/11.

2
0:00:18.12,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It is time to take stock of where we stand

3
0:00:21.36,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and stop and think.

4
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It is time to ask ourselves,

5
0:00:26.12,000 --> 0:00:28,000
have the assumptions and policies

6
0:00:28.28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
we developed in the wake of those tragic events

7
0:00:30.6,000 --> 0:00:32,000
truly made us more secure?

8
0:00:33.88,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Have they made our societies, both in Europe and in the United States,

9
0:00:38.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
more resilient?

10
0:00:40.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I've worked all my life in the field of security and defense,

11
0:00:44.759,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I am convinced that now, more than ever,

12
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we need to radically reframe the way we think and act about security,

13
0:00:53.44,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and especially about international security.

14
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
By international security, I actually mean what we do,

15
0:01:00.64,000 --> 0:01:01,000
how we prepare our countries

16
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to better respond and prevent external threats,

17
0:01:05.52,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and how we protect our citizens.

18
0:01:08.76,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The key to both

19
0:01:10.48,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is to focus on protecting civilians,

20
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
both in our own countries

21
0:01:14.8,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and in those where we are present in the name of security.

22
0:01:19.28,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, this idea goes against the fixed narrative

23
0:01:21.96,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that we developed over the past 20 years

24
0:01:24.72,000 --> 0:01:26,000
over what security is and how to get it,

25
0:01:28.4,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but that narrative is flawed, and worse, it is counterproductive.

26
0:01:34.68,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Over the past 20 years,

27
0:01:36.72,000 --> 0:01:38,000
both in the United States and in Europe,

28
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we've come to accept that we must talk about security in zero sum terms,

29
0:01:44.36,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as if the only way to gain more security is by compromising on values and rights:

30
0:01:49.92,000 --> 0:01:52,000
security versus human rights,

31
0:01:53.04,000 --> 0:01:56,000
safety versus freedom and development.

32
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is a false opposition.

33
0:01:59.52,000 --> 0:02:,000
It just doesn't work like that.

34
0:02:01.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We need to recognize

35
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that security and human rights are not opposite values,

36
0:02:05.92,000 --> 0:02:07,000
they are intrinsically related.

37
0:02:09.08,000 --> 0:02:12,000
After all, the most basic human right

38
0:02:12.44,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is the right to live and to be free from violence,

39
0:02:15.8,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and a state's most basic responsibility

40
0:02:18.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is to guarantee that right for its citizens.

41
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Conversely, if we think about communities all over the world

42
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
affected by war and conflict,

43
0:02:28.88,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it is insecurity and violence

44
0:02:31.24,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that stops them from achieving their full freedom and development.

45
0:02:35.68,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, they need basic security just as much as we do

46
0:02:39.72,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and they need it so they can live a normal life

47
0:02:43.08,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and so that they can enjoy their human rights.

48
0:02:45.96,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This is why we need to shift.

49
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We need to acknowledge that sustainable security

50
0:02:51.04,000 --> 0:02:53,000
builds on a foundation of human rights,

51
0:02:53.88,000 --> 0:02:56,000
builds on promoting and respecting human rights.

52
0:02:58.32,000 --> 0:03:,000
Also, over the past two decades,

53
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we have accepted that the best way to guarantee our own security

54
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is by defeating our enemies,

55
0:03:07.08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and to do that, we need to rely almost exclusively on the military.

56
0:03:12.6,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Again, this clashes with my work, with my research,

57
0:03:15.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with what I see in the field.

58
0:03:17.125,000 --> 0:03:2,000
What I see is that building sustainable security

59
0:03:20.76,000 --> 0:03:22,000
has a lot less to do with crushing enemies,

60
0:03:23.32,000 --> 0:03:25,000
has a lot less to do with winning on the battlefield,

61
0:03:25.96,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and has a lot more to do with protecting victims

62
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and building stability.

63
0:03:30.76,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And to do that, well, the military alone

64
0:03:33.28,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is simply insufficient.

65
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This is why I believe we need to shelve the never-ending War on Terror,

66
0:03:41.08,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and we need to replace it with a security agenda

67
0:03:43.68,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that is driven by the principle of protecting civilians,

68
0:03:47.64,000 --> 0:03:5,000
no matter where they are from, what passport they hold,

69
0:03:51.08,000 --> 0:03:52,000
or where they live:

70
0:03:52.72,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Vancouver, New York,

71
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Kabul, Mosul, Aleppo or Douma.

72
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Sustainable security tells us that we're more likely

73
0:04:02.96,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to have long-term security at home for ourselves

74
0:04:06.8,000 --> 0:04:1,000
if we focus our engagements abroad on protecting civilians

75
0:04:10.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and on ensuring their lives are lived in dignity and free from violence.

76
0:04:16.72,000 --> 0:04:19,000
For example, we all know that defeating ISIS

77
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is a security achievement.

78
0:04:21.8,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Absolutely.

79
0:04:23.12,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But rebuilding destroyed homes,

80
0:04:26.52,000 --> 0:04:27,000
restoring order,

81
0:04:28.48,000 --> 0:04:31,000
ensuring a representative political system,

82
0:04:31.68,000 --> 0:04:33,000
these are just as, if not more important,

83
0:04:34.68,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and not just for the security of civilians in Iraq and in Syria,

84
0:04:38.24,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but for our own security and for global stability.

85
0:04:43.2,000 --> 0:04:44,000
More fundamentally,

86
0:04:45.76,000 --> 0:04:5,000
ISIS's danger should not just be counted in the number of weapons it holds

87
0:04:51.2,000 --> 0:04:54,000
but also in the number of children it has kept out of school

88
0:04:54.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
or indoctrinated.

89
0:04:57.04,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This is from a security perspective.

90
0:04:59.36,000 --> 0:05:,000
From a security perspective,

91
0:05:01,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the long-term generational impact of having millions of children in Syria

92
0:05:07.04,000 --> 0:05:11,000
growing up knowing only war and out of school,

93
0:05:11.52,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this is a far more dangerous threat to stability

94
0:05:14.84,000 --> 0:05:16,000
than all of ISIS's weapons combined,

95
0:05:17.68,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and we should spend just as much time and just as much energy to counter this

96
0:05:23.84,000 --> 0:05:27,000
as what we spend when countering ISIS militarily.

97
0:05:29.48,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Over the past two decades, our security policy has been short-term.

98
0:05:33.36,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It has focused on the here and now.

99
0:05:35.96,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It has systematically downplayed the link between what we do today

100
0:05:40.32,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in the name of security

101
0:05:41.84,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and the long-term impact of those choices.

102
0:05:44.76,000 --> 0:05:46,000
In the years after 9/11,

103
0:05:46.96,000 --> 0:05:48,000
some of the choices,

104
0:05:49.04,000 --> 0:05:51,000
some of the policies we've implemented

105
0:05:51.48,000 --> 0:05:55,000
have probably made us less, not more secure in the long term.

106
0:05:56.84,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Sustainable, civilian-centered security

107
0:06:00.08,000 --> 0:06:03,000
needs to look at what happens in the long term.

108
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Again, for example,

109
0:06:05.6,000 --> 0:06:09,000
relying on drones to target enemies in faraway countries may be a tool.

110
0:06:10.56,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It may be a tool to make sure or to lessen the threat

111
0:06:13.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
of an imminent attack on the United States.

112
0:06:16.84,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But what about the long-term impact?

113
0:06:20.24,000 --> 0:06:22,000
If civilians are killed,

114
0:06:22.52,000 --> 0:06:24,000
if communities are targeted,

115
0:06:25.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
this will feed a vicious circle

116
0:06:28.44,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of war, conflict, trauma and radicalization,

117
0:06:32.52,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and that vicious circle is at the center of so many of the security challenges

118
0:06:36.24,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we face today.

119
0:06:38.12,000 --> 0:06:4,000
This will not make us safer in the long term.

120
0:06:41.96,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We need civilian security,

121
0:06:45.24,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we need sustainable civilian-centered security,

122
0:06:48.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and we need it now.

123
0:06:50.48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We need to encourage thinking and research around this concept,

124
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and to implement it.

125
0:06:56.84,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We live in a dangerous world.

126
0:06:59.32,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We have many threats to peace and conflict.

127
0:07:03.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Much like in the days after 9/11,

128
0:07:05.92,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we simply cannot afford not to think about international security.

129
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But we have to learn the lessons of the past 20 years.

130
0:07:14.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
To get it right, to get security right,

131
0:07:17.32,000 --> 0:07:19,000
we need to focus on the long term.

132
0:07:19.56,000 --> 0:07:21,000
We need to focus on protecting civilians.

133
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And we need to respect and acknowledge the fact

134
0:07:24.68,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that sustainable security builds on a foundation of human rights.

135
0:07:30.2,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Otherwise, in the name of security,

136
0:07:33.44,000 --> 0:07:34,000
we risk leaving the world

137
0:07:35.2,000 --> 0:07:38,000
a far more dangerous and unstable place

138
0:07:38.68,000 --> 0:07:39,000
than what we already found it in.

139
0:07:41.88,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Thank you.

140
0:07:43.12,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Applause)

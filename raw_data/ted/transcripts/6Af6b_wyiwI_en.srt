1
0:00:17.504,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When I was a kid,

2
0:00:19.398,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.

3
0:00:23.819,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement,

4
0:00:27.085,000 --> 0:00:29,000
filled with cans of food and water.

5
0:00:30.256,000 --> 0:00:31,000
When the nuclear attack came,

6
0:00:31.901,000 --> 0:00:35,000
we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.

7
0:00:37.877,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe

8
0:00:41.597,000 --> 0:00:43,000
doesn't look like this.

9
0:00:44.457,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Instead, it looks like this.

10
0:00:48.438,000 --> 0:00:53,000
If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades,

11
0:00:53.929,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus

12
0:00:57.314,000 --> 0:00:59,000
rather than a war.

13
0:00:59.792,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Not missiles, but microbes.

14
0:01:03.679,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, part of the reason for this is that

15
0:01:05.878,000 --> 0:01:09,000
we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.

16
0:01:10.081,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.

17
0:01:16.129,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We're not ready for the next epidemic.

18
0:01:20.023,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Let's look at Ebola.

19
0:01:21.758,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper,

20
0:01:25.615,000 --> 0:01:26,000
lots of tough challenges.

21
0:01:27.221,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools

22
0:01:30.876,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we use to track polio eradication.

23
0:01:35.721,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And as you look at what went on,

24
0:01:37.573,000 --> 0:01:41,000
the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough,

25
0:01:42.081,000 --> 0:01:45,000
the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.

26
0:01:46.589,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.

27
0:01:51.028,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone,

28
0:01:55.94,000 --> 0:01:58,000
seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.

29
0:01:59.696,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The case reports came in on paper.

30
0:02:02.452,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It was very delayed before they were put online

31
0:02:04.808,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they were extremely inaccurate.

32
0:02:07.492,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.

33
0:02:09.858,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We didn't have a way of preparing people.

34
0:02:12.453,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers.

35
0:02:17.784,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But even so, we were far slower than we should have been

36
0:02:20.88,000 --> 0:02:23,000
getting the thousands of workers into these countries.

37
0:02:24.022,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.

38
0:02:32.752,000 --> 0:02:36,000
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.

39
0:02:37.155,000 --> 0:02:38,000
No one to look at the diagnostics.

40
0:02:38.946,000 --> 0:02:41,000
No one to figure out what tools should be used.

41
0:02:42.243,000 --> 0:02:45,000
As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors,

42
0:02:45.723,000 --> 0:02:5,000
processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.

43
0:02:51.158,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But that was never tried.

44
0:02:53.764,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So there was a lot that was missing.

45
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And these things are really a global failure.

46
0:03:00.305,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.

47
0:03:07.049,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now, in the movies it's quite different.

48
0:03:09.842,000 --> 0:03:13,000
There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go,

49
0:03:14.674,000 --> 0:03:19,000
they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.

50
0:03:22.177,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic

51
0:03:25.887,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola

52
0:03:30.735,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year.

53
0:03:36.311,000 --> 0:03:38,000
About 10,000 people died,

54
0:03:39.149,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and nearly all were in the three West African countries.

55
0:03:43.846,000 --> 0:03:45,000
There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.

56
0:03:46.433,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.

57
0:03:50.874,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They found the people and they prevented more infections.

58
0:03:54.136,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The second is the nature of the virus.

59
0:03:56.621,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Ebola does not spread through the air.

60
0:03:59.697,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And by the time you're contagious,

61
0:04:01.81,000 --> 0:04:03,000
most people are so sick that they're bedridden.

62
0:04:06.22,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Third, it didn't get into many urban areas.

63
0:04:10.411,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And that was just luck.

64
0:04:12.115,000 --> 0:04:14,000
If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas,

65
0:04:14.355,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the case numbers would have been much larger.

66
0:04:17.877,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So next time, we might not be so lucky.

67
0:04:21.466,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious

68
0:04:26.53,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that they get on a plane or they go to a market.

69
0:04:29.842,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola,

70
0:04:32.846,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or it could be bioterrorism.

71
0:04:34.826,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.

72
0:04:39.474,000 --> 0:04:45,000
In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air,

73
0:04:45.475,000 --> 0:04:48,000
like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.

74
0:04:49.63,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So here's what would happen:

75
0:04:51.56,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.

76
0:04:55.558,000 --> 0:05:,000
And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.

77
0:05:00.683,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So this is a serious problem.

78
0:05:02.496,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We should be concerned.

79
0:05:04.257,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But in fact, we can build a really good response system.

80
0:05:08.692,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.

81
0:05:13.836,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We've got cell phones

82
0:05:14.883,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to get information from the public and get information out to them.

83
0:05:18.14,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.

84
0:05:22.319,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We have advances in biology

85
0:05:24.627,000 --> 0:05:27,000
that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen

86
0:05:28.453,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.

87
0:05:33.322,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So we can have tools,

88
0:05:34.888,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.

89
0:05:39.5,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And we need preparedness.

90
0:05:41.793,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared

91
0:05:44.257,000 --> 0:05:46,000
are again, what we do for war.

92
0:05:46.758,000 --> 0:05:5,000
For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go.

93
0:05:51.005,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.

94
0:05:54.316,000 --> 0:05:57,000
NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.

95
0:05:58.005,000 --> 0:06:01,000
NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained?

96
0:06:01.455,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Do they understand about fuel and logistics

97
0:06:03.883,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and the same radio frequencies?

98
0:06:06.241,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So they are absolutely ready to go.

99
0:06:08.779,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.

100
0:06:13.134,000 --> 0:06:15,000
What are the key pieces?

101
0:06:15.301,000 --> 0:06:2,000
First, we need strong health systems in poor countries.

102
0:06:20.591,000 --> 0:06:23,000
That's where mothers can give birth safely,

103
0:06:23.778,000 --> 0:06:24,000
kids can get all their vaccines.

104
0:06:25.295,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on.

105
0:06:30.154,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We need a medical reserve corps:

106
0:06:31.935,000 --> 0:06:33,000
lots of people who've got the training and background

107
0:06:34.501,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who are ready to go, with the expertise.

108
0:06:37.853,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And then we need to pair those medical people with the military.

109
0:06:42.266,000 --> 0:06:46,000
taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics

110
0:06:46.417,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and secure areas.

111
0:06:48.22,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We need to do simulations,

112
0:06:51.129,000 --> 0:06:55,000
germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.

113
0:06:55.927,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The last time a germ game was done in the United States

114
0:06:58.723,000 --> 0:07:01,000
was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well.

115
0:07:02.453,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.

116
0:07:07.49,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Finally, we need lots of advanced R&D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.

117
0:07:13.609,000 --> 0:07:16,000
There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus,

118
0:07:17.246,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that could work very, very quickly.

119
0:07:21.229,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost,

120
0:07:24.599,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.

121
0:07:29.095,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,

122
0:07:33.74,000 --> 0:07:36,000
global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars

123
0:07:37.465,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and we'd have millions and millions of deaths.

124
0:07:41.332,000 --> 0:07:43,000
These investments offer significant benefits

125
0:07:44.317,000 --> 0:07:46,000
beyond just being ready for the epidemic.

126
0:07:46.518,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The primary healthcare, the R&D,

127
0:07:48.982,000 --> 0:07:5,000
those things would reduce global health equity

128
0:07:51.812,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and make the world more just as well as more safe.

129
0:07:55.502,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So I think this should absolutely be a priority.

130
0:07:59.514,000 --> 0:08:,000
There's no need to panic.

131
0:08:00.98,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.

132
0:08:05.469,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.

133
0:08:09.309,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,

134
0:08:15.524,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.

135
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.

136
0:08:26.978,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Thank you.

137
0:08:28.574,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

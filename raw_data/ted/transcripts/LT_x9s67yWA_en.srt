1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If I can leave you with one big idea today,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
it's that the whole of the data

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in which we consume

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is greater that the sum of the parts,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and instead of thinking about information overload,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
what I'd like you to think about is how

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we can use information so that patterns pop

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
organized by age.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This is because, in the mid-area here,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
people are at their most active,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and over here they're at their most frail.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
We can step back out again

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and then reorganize the data by cause of death,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
If we go ahead and we filter by age --

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
say 40 years or less --

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we see that accidents are actually

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So you get the idea

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that viewing information, viewing data in this way,

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
is a lot like swimming

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in a living information info-graphic.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And if we can do this for raw data,

32
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
why not do it for content as well?

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So what we have right here

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
ever produced.

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's all here; it's all on the web.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
You can drill into a particular year.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You can jump right into a specific issue.

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that have appeared in this issue, the sports.

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
which reveals, for me, all the issues

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Applause)

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I might think,

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?"

50
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So I can step back, and expand on that.

51
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I see Greg LeMond now.

52
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And so you get the idea that when you

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
navigate over information this way --

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
going narrower, broader,

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
backing in, backing out --

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you're not searching, you're not browsing.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It's in between, and we think it changes

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the way information can be used.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
with something that's a little bit crazy.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and we reduced it down to a little summary.

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So the summary consists of just a little synopsis

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I'm only showing the top 500

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
most popular Wikipedia pages right here.

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But even in this limited view,

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we can do a lot of things.

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that are most popular on Wikipedia.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'm going to go ahead and select government.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, having selected government,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I can now see that the Wikipedia categories

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that most frequently correspond to that

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
are Time magazine People of the Year.

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So this is really important because this is an insight

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's only possible to see that insight

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when you step back and look at all of them.

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Looking at one of these particular summaries,

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I can then drill into the concept of

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Time magazine Person of the Year,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
bringing up all of them.

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So looking at these people,

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I can see that the majority come from government;

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
some have come from natural sciences;

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
some, fewer still, have come from business --

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
there's my boss --

90
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
and one has come from music.

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And interestingly enough,

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Bono is also a TED Prize winner.

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,

96
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but at a higher level of abstraction.

97
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And so I want to show you one other thing

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that may catch you a little bit by surprise.

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I'm just showing the New York Times website here.

100
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So Pivot, this application --

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,

102
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but you can view web pages with it --

103
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we bring that zoomable technology

104
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to every single web page like this.

105
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So I can step back,

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
pop right back into a specific section.

107
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now the reason why this is important is because,

108
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I can look at my entire browsing history

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in the exact same way.

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So I can drill into what I've done

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
over specific time frames.

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Here, in fact, is the state

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of all the demo that I just gave.

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And, if I want to step back and look at everything,

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I can slice and dice my history,

118
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
perhaps by my search history --

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
here, I was doing some nepotistic searching,

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.

121
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And from these, I can drill into the web page

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and just launch them again.

123
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and in each case it makes the whole greater

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
than the sum of the parts with the data.

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So right now, in this world,

127
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we think about data as being this curse.

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We talk about the curse of information overload.

129
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We talk about drowning in data.

130
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What if we can actually turn that upside down

131
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and turn the web upside down,

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,

133
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,

134
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and then being able to see the patterns

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that were otherwise hidden?

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,

137
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we might actually extract information.

138
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And, instead of dealing just with information,

139
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we can tease out knowledge.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.

141
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So with that, I thank you.

142
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Mockingbirds are badass.

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They are.

4
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos --

5
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
are the emcees of the animal kingdom.

6
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
They listen and mimic and remix what they like.

7
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
They rock the mic outside my window every morning.

8
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms

9
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
like they were songs of spring.

10
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it.

11
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.

12
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation

13
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails.

14
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood,

16
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught

17
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know.

18
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito,

19
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
vente a comer mi hijo!"

20
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound.

21
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac

23
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags

24
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody.

25
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying,

27
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis."

28
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is.

29
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is.

30
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'll get your postman making dinner plans.

31
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I'll get the last time you lied.

32
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide."

33
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it,

34
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute."

35
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring."

37
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring.

38
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, "Good morning."

39
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I'll get everyone's good mornings.

40
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I don't care how you make 'em.

41
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.

42
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.

43
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.

44
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.

45
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for --

46
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
short explanation, hippie parents.

47
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:15,000
What does a violin have to do with technology?

49
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Where in the world is this world heading?

50
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
On one end, gold bars --

51
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
on the other, an entire planet.

52
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We are 12 billion light years from the edge.

53
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That's a guess.

54
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely,

55
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America

56
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us.

57
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
You might wanna avert your gaze, because that

58
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is a newt about to regenerate its limb,

59
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing.

60
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
There's about 10 million phage per job.

61
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.

62
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings;

63
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we build strong suns.

64
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,

65
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and here we are, right in the middle.

66
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn.

68
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:07,000
When all the little mockingbirds fly away,

69
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
they're going to sound like the last four days.

70
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers,

71
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:16,000
broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers,

72
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men,

73
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters.

74
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Everybody gets heard.

75
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.

76
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I'm on this.

77
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads,

78
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed

79
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
singing, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word.

80
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Wait for the man with the mockingbird."

81
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Yeah. And then come the news crews, and

83
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor.

84
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide,

85
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip

86
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the City Council of Monterey, California off to me,

87
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and they'll offer me a key to the city.

88
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:56,000
A gold-plated, oversized key to the city

89
0:03:56,000 --> 0:04:,000
and that is all I need, 'cause if I get that, I can unlock the air.

90
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there.

91
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Thank you, TED.

92
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Applause)

93
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Chris Anderson: Wow.

94
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Applause)

95
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Wow.

96
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Applause)

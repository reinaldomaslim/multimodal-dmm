1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I've been spending a lot of time

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
traveling around the world these days,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
talking to groups of students and professionals,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
On the one hand, people say,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"The time for change is now."

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
They want to be part of it.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But on the other hand,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I hear people talking about fear,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
a sense of risk-aversion.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but I don't know where to start.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I don't want to disappoint my family or friends."

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I work in global poverty.

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And they say, "I want to work in global poverty,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but what will it mean about my career?

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Will I be marginalized?

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Will I not make enough money?

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Will I never get married or have children?"

21
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older --

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I'm glad I waited --

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
-- and has no children,

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I look at these young people

26
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Your job is only to be human.

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And nothing important happens in life

29
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
without a cost."

30
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
These conversations really reflect what's happening

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
at the national and international level.

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Our leaders and ourselves

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
want everything,

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
but we don't talk about the costs.

35
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We don't talk about the sacrifice.

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
One of my favorite quotes from literature

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was written by Tillie Olsen,

38
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the great American writer from the South.

39
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In a short story called "Oh Yes,"

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
she talks about a white woman in the 1950s

41
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
who has a daughter

42
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
who befriends a little African American girl,

43
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and she looks at her child with a sense of pride,

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but she also wonders,

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
what price will she pay?

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"Better immersion

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
than to live untouched."

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But the real question is,

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
what is the cost of not daring?

50
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What is the cost of not trying?

51
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I've been so privileged in my life

52
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to know extraordinary leaders

53
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
who have chosen to live lives of immersion.

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
One woman I knew who was a fellow

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
was named Ingrid Washinawatok.

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
She was a leader of the Menominee tribe,

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a Native American peoples.

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And when we would gather as fellows,

60
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
she would push us to think about

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
how the elders in Native American culture

62
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
make decisions.

63
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And she said they would literally visualize

64
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the faces of children

65
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for seven generations into the future,

66
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
looking at them from the Earth,

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and they would look at them, holding them as stewards

68
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
for that future.

69
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other,

70
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
not only as human beings,

71
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but to every living thing on the planet.

72
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And tragically, in 1999,

73
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
when she was in Colombia

74
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
working with the U'wa people,

75
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
focused on preserving their culture and language,

76
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
she and two colleagues were abducted

77
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and tortured and killed by the FARC.

78
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And whenever we would gather the fellows after that,

79
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And more than a decade later,

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
when I talk to NGO fellows,

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and we talk about Ingrid,

84
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom

85
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and her spirit

86
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and really build on the unfulfilled work

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
of her life's mission.

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And when we think about legacy,

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I can think of no more powerful one,

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
despite how short her life was.

91
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And I've been touched by Cambodian women --

92
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
beautiful women,

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.

94
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I met them in the early '90s.

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the artists, the dancers.

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And at the end of the war,

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And the women, who I was so privileged to meet

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
when there were three survivors,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
told these stories about lying in their cots

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in the refugee camps.

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They said they would try so hard

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to remember the fragments of the dance,

107
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
hoping that others were alive and doing the same.

108
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
her hands at her side,

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and she talked about

111
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the reunion of the 30 after the war

112
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and how extraordinary it was.

113
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And these big tears fell down her face,

114
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but she never lifted her hands to move them.

115
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And the women decided that they would train

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,

117
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but the next generation.

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I sat there in the studio

119
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
watching these women clapping their hands --

120
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
beautiful rhythms --

121
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
as these little fairy pixies

122
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
were dancing around them,

123
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
wearing these beautiful silk colors.

124
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And I thought, after all this atrocity,

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
this is how human beings really pray.

126
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Because they're focused on honoring

127
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
what is most beautiful about our past

128
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and building it into

129
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the promise of our future.

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And what these women understood

131
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
is sometimes the most important things that we do

132
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and that we spend our time on

133
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
are those things that we cannot measure.

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I also have been touched

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
by the dark side of power and leadership.

136
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And I have learned that power,

137
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
particularly in its absolute form,

138
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
is an equal opportunity provider.

139
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
In 1986, I moved to Rwanda,

140
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women

141
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to start that country's first microfinance bank.

142
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And one of the women was Agnes --

143
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
there on your extreme left --

144
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
she was one of the first three

145
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
women parliamentarians in Rwanda,

146
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and her legacy should have been

147
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to be one of the mothers of Rwanda.

148
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We built this institution based on social justice,

149
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
gender equity,

150
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
this idea of empowering women.

151
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power

152
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
than she did principle at the end.

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And though she had been part of building a liberal party,

154
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a political party

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that was focused on diversity and tolerance,

156
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
about three months before the genocide, she switched parties

157
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and she became the Minister of Justice

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
under the genocide regime

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and was known for inciting men to kill faster

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and stop behaving like women.

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
She was convicted

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of category one crimes of genocide.

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And I would visit her in the prisons,

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
sitting side-by-side, knees touching,

166
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and I would have to admit to myself

167
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that monsters exist in all of us,

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but that maybe it's not monsters so much,

169
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
but the broken parts of ourselves,

170
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
sadnesses, secret shame,

171
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues

172
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to prey on those parts,

173
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
those fragments, if you will,

174
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and to make us look at other beings, human beings,

175
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
as lesser than ourselves --

176
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and in the extreme, to do terrible things.

177
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And there is no group

178
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
than young men.

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet

181
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is the adolescent male.

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And so in a gathering

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
where we're focused on women,

184
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
while it is so critical that we invest in our girls

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and we even the playing field

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and we find ways to honor them,

187
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we have to remember that the girls and the women

188
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are most isolated and violated

189
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and victimized and made invisible

190
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in those very societies

191
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
where our men and our boys

192
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
feel disempowered,

193
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
unable to provide.

194
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And that, when they sit on those street corners

195
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and all they can think of in the future

196
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is no job, no education,

197
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
no possibility,

198
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
well then it's easy to understand

199
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
how the greatest source of status

200
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
can come from a uniform

201
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and a gun.

202
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Sometimes very small investments

203
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
can release enormous, infinite potential

204
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that exists in all of us.

205
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,

206
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Suraj Sudhakar,

207
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
has what we call moral imagination --

208
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes

209
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and lead from that perspective.

210
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And he's been working with this young group of men

211
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.

212
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And they're incredible guys.

213
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And together they started a book club

214
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
for a hundred people in the slums,

215
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and they're reading many TED authors and liking it.

216
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And then they created a business plan competition.

217
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Then they decided that they would do TEDx's.

218
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And I have learned so much

219
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
from Chris and Kevin

220
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and Alex and Herbert

221
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and all of these young men.

222
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Alex, in some ways, said it best.

223
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
He said, "We used to feel like nobodies,

224
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but now we feel like somebodies."

225
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And I think we have it all wrong

226
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
when we think that income is the link.

227
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
What we really yearn for as human beings

228
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is to be visible to each other.

229
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And the reason these young guys

230
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
told me that they're doing these TEDx's

231
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is because they were sick and tired

232
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
of the only workshops coming to the slums

233
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
being those workshops focused on HIV,

234
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
or at best, microfinance.

235
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And they wanted to celebrate

236
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare --

237
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the photojournalists and the creatives,

238
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.

239
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And they're doing it.

240
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And my hat's off to you in Kibera.

241
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
My own work focuses

242
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
on making philanthropy more effective

243
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and capitalism more inclusive.

244
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources

245
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and we invest what we call patient capital --

246
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor

247
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
not as passive recipients of charity,

248
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but as full-bodied agents of change

249
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
who want to solve their own problems

250
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and make their own decisions.

251
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We leave our money for 10 to 15 years,

252
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations

253
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that focus on change.

254
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I know it works.

255
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,

256
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars

257
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
into these forgotten markets.

258
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services

259
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
like maternal health care and housing,

260
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
emergency services, solar energy,

261
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
so that people can have more dignity

262
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in solving their problems.

263
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Patient capital is uncomfortable

264
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
for people searching for simple solutions,

265
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
easy categories,

266
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.

267
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But we find those entrepreneurs

268
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
who put people and the planet

269
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
before profit.

270
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement

271
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that is about measuring impact,

272
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
measuring what is most important to us.

273
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And my dream is we'll have a world one day

274
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
where we don't just honor those who take money

275
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and make more money from it,

276
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but we find those individuals who take our resources

277
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and convert it into changing the world

278
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in the most positive ways.

279
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And it's only when we honor them

280
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and celebrate them and give them status

281
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that the world will really change.

282
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period

283
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
where I saw two visions of the world

284
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
living side-by-side --

285
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
one based on violence

286
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and the other on transcendence.

287
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan

288
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
on the day that two mosques were attacked

289
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
by suicide bombers.

290
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And the reason these mosques were attacked

291
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
is because the people praying inside

292
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
were from a particular sect of Islam

293
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.

294
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And not only did those suicide bombers

295
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
take a hundred lives,

296
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but they did more,

297
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear

298
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and certainly despair.

299
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
But less than 24 hours,

300
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I was 13 miles away from those mosques,

301
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
visiting one of our Acumen investees,

302
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
an incredible man, Jawad Aslam,

303
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who dares to live a life of immersion.

304
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Born and raised in Baltimore,

305
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,

306
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.

307
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,

308
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer

309
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
named Tasneem Saddiqui.

310
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And he had a dream that he would build a housing community

311
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
on this barren piece of land

312
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
using patient capital,

313
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
but he continued to pay a price.

314
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
He stood on moral ground

315
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and refused to pay bribes.

316
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It took almost two years just to register the land.

317
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise

318
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
from one person's action.

319
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses

320
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in this beautiful community.

321
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And there's schools and clinics and shops.

322
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But there's only one mosque.

323
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And so I asked Jawad,

324
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.

325
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?"

326
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
He said, "Long story.

327
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
It was hard, it was a difficult road,

328
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
but ultimately the leaders of the community came together,

329
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
realizing we only have each other.

330
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And we decided that we would elect

331
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
the three most respected imams,

332
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and those imams would take turns,

333
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
they would rotate who would say Friday prayer.

334
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
But the whole community,

335
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,

336
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
would sit together and pray."

337
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We need that kind of moral leadership and courage

338
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in our worlds.

339
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We face huge issues as a world --

340
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the financial crisis,

341
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
global warming

342
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and this growing sense of fear and otherness.

343
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And every day we have a choice.

344
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We can take the easier road,

345
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the more cynical road,

346
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
which is a road based on

347
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
sometimes dreams of a past that never really was,

348
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
a fear of each other,

349
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
distancing and blame.

350
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Or we can take the much more difficult path

351
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
of transformation, transcendence,

352
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
compassion and love,

353
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
but also accountability and justice.

354
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I had the great honor

355
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,

356
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
who stood up for change

357
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
during the Civil Rights movement in the United States.

358
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And he tells this incredible story

359
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,

360
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the first child to desegregate schools in the South --

361
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
in this case, New Orleans.

362
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And he said that every day

363
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,

364
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
would walk with real grace

365
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
through a phalanx of white people

366
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
screaming angrily, calling her a monster,

367
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
threatening to poison her --

368
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
distorted faces.

369
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And every day he would watch her,

370
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and it looked like she was talking to the people.

371
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?"

372
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And she'd say, "I'm not talking."

373
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking.

374
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What are you saying?"

375
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking;

376
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I'm praying."

377
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And he said, "Well, what are you praying?"

378
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,

379
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
for they know not what they are doing.'"

380
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
At age six,

381
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
this child was living a life of immersion,

382
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and her family paid a price for it.

383
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
But she became part of history

384
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and opened up this idea

385
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
that all of us should have access to education.

386
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
My final story is about a young, beautiful man

387
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
named Josephat Byaruhanga,

388
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
who was another Acumen Fund fellow,

389
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
who hails from Uganda, a farming community.

390
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,

391
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
just 200 miles away.

392
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And he said to me at the end of his year,

393
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,

394
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
because I thought as a farmer and as an African

395
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I would understand how to transcend culture.

396
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But especially when I was talking to the African women,

397
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I sometimes made these mistakes --

398
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
it was so hard for me to learn how to listen."

399
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways,

400
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
leadership is like a panicle of rice.

401
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Because at the height of the season,

402
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
at the height of its powers,

403
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,

404
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
it reaches to the heavens."

405
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And he said, "But right before the harvest,

406
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
it bends over

407
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
with great gratitude and humility

408
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to touch the earth from where it came."

409
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We need leaders.

410
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
We ourselves need to lead

411
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
from a place that has the audacity

412
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to believe we can, ourselves,

413
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
extend the fundamental assumption

414
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that all men are created equal

415
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
to every man, woman and child on this planet.

416
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And we need to have the humility to recognize

417
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
that we cannot do it alone.

418
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Robert Kennedy once said

419
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
that "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,

420
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
but each of us can work

421
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
to change a small portion of events."

422
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And it is in the total of all those acts

423
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that the history of this generation will be written.

424
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
Our lives are so short,

425
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and our time on this planet

426
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
is so precious,

427
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and all we have is each other.

428
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
So may each of you

429
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
live lives of immersion.

430
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
They won't necessarily be easy lives,

431
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
but in the end, it is all that will sustain us.

432
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Thank you.

433
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Applause)

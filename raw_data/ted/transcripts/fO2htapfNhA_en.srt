1
0:00:12.87,000 --> 0:00:14,000
A traumatic brain injury, or TBI,

2
0:00:15.148,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is a disruption in brain function caused by an external blow to the head.

3
0:00:21.046,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And when you hear that definition,

4
0:00:23.265,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you might think about sports and professional athletes,

5
0:00:26.549,000 --> 0:00:3,000
since it's the kind of injury we're used to seeing on the playing field.

6
0:00:31.162,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And this imagery has really come to define TBI in the public consciousness.

7
0:00:37.41,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I myself do research on TBI in retired and college athletes.

8
0:00:41.716,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I stood on a TED stage in 2010,

9
0:00:44.652,000 --> 0:00:47,000
talking about concussions in kids' sports.

10
0:00:48.714,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I have to say, as someone who researches and treats these injuries,

11
0:00:52.243,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I've been really gratified to see the growing awareness of TBI

12
0:00:56.745,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and specifically, the short- and long-term risks to athletes.

13
0:01:01.518,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Today, though, I want to introduce you to a larger but no less controversial

14
0:01:07.221,000 --> 0:01:1,000
group of people impacted by traumatic brain injury,

15
0:01:10.791,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who don't often show up in the headlines.

16
0:01:14.086,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I've come to recognize these inmates and probationers

17
0:01:17.882,000 --> 0:01:21,000
as surprisingly among the most vulnerable members of society.

18
0:01:23.977,000 --> 0:01:26,000
For the last six years, my colleagues and I have been doing research

19
0:01:27.216,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that has completely changed the way we think about the criminal justice system

20
0:01:30.945,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and the people in it.

21
0:01:32.12,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And it may change the way you think about those things, too.

22
0:01:34.978,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So I'll start with a shocking statistic:

23
0:01:38.507,000 --> 0:01:42,000
50 to 80 percent of people in criminal justice

24
0:01:43.441,000 --> 0:01:44,000
have a traumatic brain injury.

25
0:01:45.913,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Up to 80 percent.

26
0:01:49.13,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In the general public, in this room, for example,

27
0:01:52.157,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that number is less than five percent.

28
0:01:56.097,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And I'm not just talking about getting your bell rung.

29
0:01:58.812,000 --> 0:02:02,000
These are the kinds of injuries that require hospitalization.

30
0:02:04.144,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Most of them are the product of a physical assault,

31
0:02:07.946,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and some of them are actually sustained in jail.

32
0:02:11.489,000 --> 0:02:15,000
All of these numbers are even higher among the women in criminal justice.

33
0:02:16.371,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Almost every single woman in the criminal justice system

34
0:02:21.408,000 --> 0:02:24,000
has been exposed to interpersonal violence and abuse.

35
0:02:26.402,000 --> 0:02:31,000
More than half of these women have been exposed to repeated brain injuries.

36
0:02:32.733,000 --> 0:02:38,000
In this way, these women's brains look like the brains of retired NFL players,

37
0:02:39.52,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they'll likely face the same risks for dementing diseases as they age.

38
0:02:45.833,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The same risks.

39
0:02:49.649,000 --> 0:02:53,000
TBI, together with mental illness and substance abuse and trauma,

40
0:02:54.073,000 --> 0:02:56,000
makes it hard for people to think.

41
0:02:56.859,000 --> 0:03:,000
They have cognitive impairments like poor judgment and poor impulse control,

42
0:03:01.168,000 --> 0:03:04,000
problems that make criminal justice a revolving door.

43
0:03:05.632,000 --> 0:03:07,000
People get arrested and booked into jail.

44
0:03:08.505,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They oftentimes get into trouble while they're in there.

45
0:03:11.237,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They get into fights. They fall out of their bunk.

46
0:03:13.692,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And then they get released and do stupid things,

47
0:03:15.996,000 --> 0:03:19,000
like forgetting mandatory check-ins, and they get rearrested.

48
0:03:20.504,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Statistically speaking,

49
0:03:22.066,000 --> 0:03:26,000
they're actually more likely to be rearrested than not.

50
0:03:26.989,000 --> 0:03:31,000
A colleague calls this "serving a life sentence 30 days at a time."

51
0:03:34.132,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And oftentimes, these folks don't know why this is so hard for them.

52
0:03:38.119,000 --> 0:03:41,000
They feel out of control and frustrated.

53
0:03:41.288,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So knowing that TBI is at the root of so many of these challenges,

54
0:03:48.262,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the mission for a group of us in Colorado has been to disrupt that cycle,

55
0:03:53.796,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to jam the revolving the door.

56
0:03:56.353,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So working together with my state and local partners,

57
0:03:59.419,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we crafted a plan to meet everyone's needs:

58
0:04:03.001,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the system, the inmates and probationers,

59
0:04:05.219,000 --> 0:04:06,000
my graduate students.

60
0:04:07.225,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In this program, we assess how each person's brain works

61
0:04:11.531,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so that we can recommend basic modifications

62
0:04:14.333,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to make this system more effective

63
0:04:17.13,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and safer.

64
0:04:18.869,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And here when I say "safer," I mean safer not only for the inmates,

65
0:04:24.652,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but safer also for correctional staff.

66
0:04:28.125,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In some ways, this is such a simple approach.

67
0:04:31.823,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We're not treating the brain injury,

68
0:04:34.682,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we're treating the underlying problem that gets people into all of this trouble

69
0:04:39.624,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in the first place.

70
0:04:41.47,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We do quick neuropsychological screening tests

71
0:04:44.524,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to identify strengths and weaknesses in the way an inmate thinks.

72
0:04:49.055,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Using that information, we write two reports.

73
0:04:52.795,000 --> 0:04:54,000
One, a report for the system

74
0:04:55.341,000 --> 0:04:59,000
with specific recommendations on how to manage that inmate.

75
0:04:59.817,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The other is a letter to the inmate

76
0:05:02.631,000 --> 0:05:05,000
with specific suggestions for how to manage themselves.

77
0:05:07.409,000 --> 0:05:11,000
For example, if our test result suggests that a probationer has a hard time

78
0:05:12.078,000 --> 0:05:14,000
remembering the things they hear,

79
0:05:14.376,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that would be an auditory memory deficit.

80
0:05:16.969,000 --> 0:05:19,000
In that case, our letter to the court might suggest

81
0:05:20.133,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that that probationer get handouts of important information.

82
0:05:23.995,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And our letter to that probationer would say, among other things,

83
0:05:27.824,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that they should carry a notebook to record that information for themselves.

84
0:05:33.047,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Now, most importantly,

85
0:05:35.57,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is that I pause here to be really clear about one point.

86
0:05:40.122,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This program does not minimize responsibility

87
0:05:43.523,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or make excuses for anyone's behavior.

88
0:05:47.322,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This is about changing longstanding negative perceptions

89
0:05:51.261,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and building self-advocacy.

90
0:05:54.084,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's actually about taking responsibility.

91
0:05:57.295,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The inmates move from,

92
0:05:58.993,000 --> 0:06:,000
"I'm a total screwup, I'm a loser,"

93
0:06:01.415,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to, "Here's what I don't do well,

94
0:06:04.196,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and here's what I have to do about it."

95
0:06:08.292,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Applause)

96
0:06:16.225,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And the system comes to see an inmate's problematic behavior

97
0:06:19.84,000 --> 0:06:22,000
as the things they can't do

98
0:06:22.929,000 --> 0:06:24,000
versus the things they won't do.

99
0:06:25.255,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And that change --

100
0:06:26.558,000 --> 0:06:3,000
seeing behavior as a deficit rather than outright defiance --

101
0:06:31.35,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is everything in these settings.

102
0:06:35.632,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We hear from inmates around the country,

103
0:06:38.585,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and they write, and more than anything, they want to know how to help themselves.

104
0:06:43.414,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This is an excerpt from a letter from Troy in Virginia,

105
0:06:47.012,000 --> 0:06:49,000
an excerpt from a 50-page letter.

106
0:06:49.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And he writes,

107
0:06:51.792,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"Can you tell me what you think of all the head traumas I've dealt with?

108
0:06:55.896,000 --> 0:06:58,000
What can I do? Can you help me?"

109
0:07:00.354,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Closer to home, we have thousands of stories like this,

110
0:07:03.47,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and smart stories, stories that have a great outcome.

111
0:07:08.282,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Here's Vinny.

112
0:07:09.857,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Vinny was hit by a car when he was 15,

113
0:07:12.701,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and from that moment forward, spent more time in jail than in school.

114
0:07:17.77,000 --> 0:07:19,000
With some basic skill-building,

115
0:07:20.179,000 --> 0:07:21,000
after our assessment revealed

116
0:07:21.766,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that he had some pretty significant memory impairments,

117
0:07:25.276,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Vinny learned to use the alarm and reminder function on his iPhone

118
0:07:29.266,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to track important appointments,

119
0:07:31.919,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and he keeps a checklist to break larger tasks

120
0:07:35.222,000 --> 0:07:37,000
into smaller, manageable ones.

121
0:07:37.638,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And with basic tools like that under his belt,

122
0:07:40.226,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Vinny's been out of jail for two years,

123
0:07:42.766,000 --> 0:07:43,000
clean for nine months,

124
0:07:44.2,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and recently back to work.

125
0:07:46.894,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Applause)

126
0:07:53.537,000 --> 0:07:55,000
What's so striking for Vinny

127
0:07:55.703,000 --> 0:07:59,000
is that this is his first time off of court supervision

128
0:08:00.413,000 --> 0:08:03,000
since his injury more than 15 years ago.

129
0:08:03.941,000 --> 0:08:05,000
He made it out of the revolving door.

130
0:08:07.743,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Applause)

131
0:08:13.347,000 --> 0:08:16,000
He says now, "I can do anything.

132
0:08:18.038,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I just have to work a lot harder at it." (Laughs)

133
0:08:22.08,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And here's Thomas.

134
0:08:24.475,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Thomas has some pretty significant attention and behavior problems

135
0:08:28.399,000 --> 0:08:31,000
after an injury landed him in a coma for more than a month.

136
0:08:32.968,000 --> 0:08:34,000
After relearning how to walk,

137
0:08:35.124,000 --> 0:08:36,000
his first stop?

138
0:08:36.461,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Court.

139
0:08:37.644,000 --> 0:08:39,000
He couldn't imagine a future where he wasn't in trouble.

140
0:08:40.865,000 --> 0:08:43,000
He now carries a calendar to avoid being held in contempt

141
0:08:44.1,000 --> 0:08:45,000
for missed court dates,

142
0:08:45.668,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and he schedules a break into his day every day

143
0:08:48.836,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to recharge before he gets agitated.

144
0:08:53.586,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And nobody knows the revolving door

145
0:08:55.73,000 --> 0:08:58,000
better than the person sitting at the front of the courtroom.

146
0:08:59.187,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This is my good friend and colleague Judge Brian Bowen.

147
0:09:02.359,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now, Judge Bowen was already on a mission to make the system work for everyone,

148
0:09:06.889,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and when he heard about this program, he saw the perfect fit.

149
0:09:11.124,000 --> 0:09:14,000
He actually sits down with all of his prosecutors

150
0:09:14.427,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to help them see that there's basically two categories of defendants

151
0:09:18.366,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in the courtroom:

152
0:09:20.107,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the ones we're afraid of -- oftentimes, rightfully so --

153
0:09:24.198,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and the ones we're mad at.

154
0:09:26.596,000 --> 0:09:28,000
These are the ones who miss all of their scheduled appointments

155
0:09:29.608,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and they blow through the best-laid probation plans.

156
0:09:32.557,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And Judge Bowen believes that, with a little more support,

157
0:09:35.596,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we could move people in this latter category,

158
0:09:37.92,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the maddening category,

159
0:09:40.361,000 --> 0:09:42,000
through and ultimately out of the system.

160
0:09:44.497,000 --> 0:09:47,000
He proved that with Navy veteran Mike.

161
0:09:48.188,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Judge Bowen saw the correlation between Mike's history of a massive 70-foot fall

162
0:09:54.412,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and his long-standing pattern of difficulty showing up on the right day

163
0:09:59.038,000 --> 0:10:,000
for court appointments

164
0:10:00.688,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and complying with mandatory therapy requirements, for example.

165
0:10:04.813,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And instead of sentencing him to more and more jail time,

166
0:10:08.735,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Judge Bowen sent him home with maps and checklists and handouts

167
0:10:14.292,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and recommended instead vocational rehabilitation

168
0:10:17.901,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and flexible scheduling for those therapies.

169
0:10:21.479,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And this with those supports, Mike's back to work

170
0:10:25.034,000 --> 0:10:28,000
for the first time since his injury while he was in the service.

171
0:10:28.565,000 --> 0:10:31,000
He's repairing relationships with his family,

172
0:10:31.592,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and just last month,

173
0:10:33.626,000 --> 0:10:36,000
he graduated from Judge Bowen's veteran's court.

174
0:10:37.322,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Applause)

175
0:10:45.422,000 --> 0:10:49,000
This program shows us the overwhelming prevalence

176
0:10:49.624,000 --> 0:10:52,000
of traumatic brain injuries and cognitive deficits

177
0:10:53.005,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and the accumulation of brokenness in the criminal justice system.

178
0:10:58.108,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And it highlights the extraordinary power of resilience and responsibility.

179
0:11:04.636,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In Mike and Thomas and Vinny,

180
0:11:06.361,000 --> 0:11:07,000
even Judge Bowen's story,

181
0:11:07.969,000 --> 0:11:12,000
you saw the transformation made possible by a change in perception

182
0:11:13.042,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and some simple accommodations.

183
0:11:16.754,000 --> 0:11:18,000
All told, in this program,

184
0:11:19.135,000 --> 0:11:24,000
these inmates and probationers come to see themselves differently.

185
0:11:25.664,000 --> 0:11:27,000
The system sees them differently,

186
0:11:29.202,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and when you meet them in the community, I hope you see them differently, too.

187
0:11:35.413,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Thanks, guys.

188
0:11:36.643,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Applause)

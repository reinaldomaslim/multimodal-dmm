1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I just came back from a community

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that holds the secret to human survival.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's a place where women run the show,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
have sex to say hello,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and play rules the day --

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
where fun is serious business.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And no, this isn't Burning Man

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or San Francisco.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This is the world of wild bonobos

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in the jungles of Congo.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
your living closest relative.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
That means we all share a common ancestor,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
an evolutionary grandmother,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
who lived around six million years ago.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, chimpanzees are well-known

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
for their aggression.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But unfortunately,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we have made too much of an emphasis

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of this aspect

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in our narratives of human evolution.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But bonobos show us

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the other side of the coin.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
While chimpanzees

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
are dominated by big, scary guys,

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
bonobo society

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
is run by empowered females.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
These guys have really worked something out,

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
since this leads to a highly tolerant society

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
where fatal violence

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
has not been observed yet.

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But unfortunately,

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
bonobos are the least understood

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of the great apes.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and it has been very difficult to study them.

40
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The Congo is a paradox --

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but also the heart of darkness itself --

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the scene of a violent conflict

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that has raged for decades

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and claimed nearly as many lives

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
as the First World War.

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Not surprisingly,

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Bushmeat trades and forest loss

50
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
means we couldn't fill a small stadium

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
with all the bonobos that are left in the world --

52
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and we're not even sure of that to be honest.

53
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,

54
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
you can hear hidden laughter

55
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
swaying the trees.

56
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Who are these cousins?

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We know them as the "make love, not war" apes

58
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
since they have frequent, promiscuous

59
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and bisexual sex

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to manage conflict

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and solve social issues.

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Now, I'm not saying this is the solution

63
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to all of humanity's problems --

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
since there's more to bonobo life

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
than the Kama Sutra.

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Bonobos, like humans,

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
love to play throughout their entire lives.

68
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Play is not just child's games.

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
For us and them,

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
play is foundational for bonding relationships

71
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and fostering tolerance.

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's where we learn to trust

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and where we learn about the rules of the game.

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Play increases creativity

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and resilience,

76
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and it's all about the generation of diversity --

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
diversity of interactions,

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
diversity of behaviors,

79
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
diversity of connections.

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And when you watch bonobo play,

81
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you're seeing the very evolutionary roots

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of human laughter, dance

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and ritual.

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Play is the glue

85
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that binds us together.

86
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, I don't know how you play,

87
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but I want to show you a couple of unique clips

88
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
fresh from the wild.

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --

90
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I do not mean football.

91
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So here,

92
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we have a young female and a male

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
engaged in a chase game.

94
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Have a look what she's doing.

95
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,

96
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
"she's got him by the balls."

97
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?

99
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Yeah.

100
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So sex play is common

102
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in both bonobos and humans.

103
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And this video is really interesting

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because it shows --

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
this video's really interesting

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
because it shows the inventiveness

107
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of bringing unusual elements into play --

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
such as testicles --

109
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and also how play both requires trust

110
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and fosters trust --

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
while at the same time being tremendous fun.

112
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But play's a shapeshifter.

113
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Play's a shapeshifter,

115
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and it can take many forms,

116
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
some of which are more quiet,

117
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
imaginative, curious --

118
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
maybe where wonder is discovered anew.

119
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I want you to see,

120
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
this is Fuku, a young female,

121
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and she is quietly playing with water.

122
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I think, like her,

123
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we sometimes play alone,

124
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and we explore the boundaries

125
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of our inner and our outer worlds.

126
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And it's that playful curiosity

127
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and then the unexpected connections we form

129
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
are the real hotbed for creativity.

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So these are just small tasters

131
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
into the insights that bonobo give us

132
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to our past and present.

133
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But they also hold a secret for our future,

134
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
a future where we need to adapt

135
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to an increasingly challenging world

136
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
through greater creativity

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and greater cooperation.

138
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The secret is that play is the key

139
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to these capacities.

140
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In other words,

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
play is our adaptive wildcard.

142
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In order to adapt successfully

143
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to a changing world,

144
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we need to play.

145
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But will we make the most of our playfulness?

146
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Play is not frivolous.

147
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Play's essential.

148
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
For bonobos and humans alike,

149
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
life is not just red in tooth and claw.

150
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In times when it seems least appropriate to play,

151
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
it might be the times when it is most urgent.

152
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And so, my fellow primates,

153
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
let us embrace this gift from evolution

154
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and play together,

155
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
as we rediscover creativity,

156
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
fellowship and wonder.

157
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Thank you.

158
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

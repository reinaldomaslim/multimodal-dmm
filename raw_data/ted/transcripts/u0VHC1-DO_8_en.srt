1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm an ecologist,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
mostly a coral reef ecologist.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I started out in Chesapeake Bay

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and went diving in the winter

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and became a tropical ecologist overnight.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And it was really a lot of fun

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
for about 10 years.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I mean, somebody pays you

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to go around and travel

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and look at some of the most

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
beautiful places on the planet.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And that was what I did.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And I ended up in Jamaica,

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in the West Indies,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
where the coral reefs were really

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
among the most extraordinary, structurally,

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that I ever saw in my life.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this picture here,

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it's really interesting, it shows two things:

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
First of all, it's in black and white

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because the water was so clear

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and you could see so far,

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and film was so slow

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in the 1960s and early 70s,

25
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you took pictures in black and white.

26
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The other thing it shows you

27
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is that, although there's this beautiful

28
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
forest of coral,

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
there are no fish in that picture.

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica

31
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
were the most studied coral reefs

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in the world for 20 years.

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We were the best and the brightest.

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
People came to study our reefs from Australia,

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which is sort of funny

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because now we go to theirs.

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And the view of scientists

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
was based on these reefs

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
without any fish.

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Then, in 1980,

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I put half the lab

44
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
up in my house.

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
The wind blew very strong.

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The waves were 25

47
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to 50 feet high.

48
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and we thought, "Well, we're real smart.

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We know that hurricanes

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
have always happened in the past."

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And we published a paper in Science,

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the first time that anybody ever

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
described the destruction

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
on a coral reef by a major hurricane.

56
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And we predicted what would happen,

57
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and we got it all wrong.

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And the reason was

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because of overfishing,

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and the fact that a last common grazer,

61
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
a sea urchin, died.

62
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And within a few months

63
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And that is the same reef;

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that's the same reef 15 years ago;

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that's the same reef today.

67
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica

68
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
have a few percent live coral cover

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and a lot of seaweed and slime.

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And that's more or less the story

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of the coral reefs of the Caribbean,

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and increasingly, tragically,

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
the coral reefs worldwide.

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, that's my little, depressing story.

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
All of us in our 60s and 70s

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
have comparable depressing stories.

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
There are tens of thousands

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of those stories out there,

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and it's really hard to conjure up

80
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
much of a sense of well-being,

81
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because it just keeps getting worse.

82
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And the reason it keeps getting worse

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
is that after a natural catastrophe,

84
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
like a hurricane,

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
it used to be that there was

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
some kind of successional sequence of recovery,

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but what's going on now is that

88
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
overfishing and pollution and climate change

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
are all interacting

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in a way that prevents that.

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And so I'm going to sort of go through

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and talk about those three

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
kinds of things.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We hear a lot about

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the collapse of cod.

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It's difficult to imagine that

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
two, or some historians would say three world wars

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
were fought during the colonial era

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for the control of cod.

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.

101
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It fed the slaves

102
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
brought to the Antilles,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
the song "Jamaica Farewell" --

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"Ackee rice salt fish are nice" --

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is an emblem of the importance

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of salt cod from northeastern Canada.

107
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
35,000 people lost their jobs.

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And that was the beginning

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of a kind of serial depletion

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
from bigger and tastier species

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to smaller and not-so-tasty species,

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from species that were near to home

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to species that were all around the world,

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and what have you.

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's a little hard to understand that,

117
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because you can go to a Costco in the United States

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and buy cheap fish.

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,

120
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but it's still cheap,

121
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and everybody thinks it's okay.

122
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It's hard to communicate this,

123
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and one way that I think is really interesting

124
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is to talk about sport fish,

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
because people like to go out and catch fish.

126
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's one of those things.

127
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This picture here shows the trophy fish,

128
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
the biggest fish caught

129
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
by people who pay a lot of money

130
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to get on a boat,

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
go to a place off of Key West in Florida,

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
drink a lot of beer,

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
come back with the biggest and the best fish,

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and the champion trophy fish

136
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
are put on this board, where people take a picture,

137
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and this guy is obviously

138
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
really excited about that fish.

139
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Well, that's what it's like now,

140
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but this is what it was like in the 1950s

141
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
from the same boat in the same place

142
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
on the same board on the same dock.

143
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The trophy fish

144
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
were so big

145
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.

146
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And the average size trophy fish

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,

148
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and if you wanted to go out and kill something,

149
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you could pretty much count on

150
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
being able to catch one of those fish.

151
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And they tasted really good.

152
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And people paid less in 1950 dollars

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to catch that

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
than what people pay now

155
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to catch those little, tiny fish.

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And that's everywhere.

157
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's not just the fish, though,

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that are disappearing.

159
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Industrial fishing uses big stuff,

160
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
big machinery.

161
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We use nets that are 20 miles long.

162
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We use longlines

163
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that have one million or two million hooks.

164
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And we trawl,

165
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
which means to take something

166
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the size of a tractor trailer truck

167
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,

168
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
put it on a big chain,

169
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and drag it across the sea floor

170
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to stir up the bottom and catch the fish.

171
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Think of it as

172
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
being kind of the bulldozing of a city

173
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
or of a forest,

174
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because it clears it away.

175
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And the habitat destruction

176
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is unbelievable.

177
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
This is a photograph,

178
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
a typical photograph,

179
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of what the continental shelves

180
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of the world look like.

181
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
You can see the rows in the bottom,

182
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the way you can see the rows

183
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in a field that has just been plowed

184
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to plant corn.

185
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,

186
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which is a critical habitat

187
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
for the development of fish.

188
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
What it is now is mud,

189
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and the area of the ocean floor

190
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that has been transformed from forest

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to level mud, to parking lot,

192
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is equivalent to the entire area

193
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of all the forests

194
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that have ever been cut down

195
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
on all of the earth

196
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in the history of humanity.

197
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We've managed to do that

198
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
in the last 100 to 150 years.

199
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We tend to think of oil spills

200
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and mercury

201
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and we hear a lot about plastic these days.

202
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And all of that stuff is really disgusting,

203
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but what's really insidious

204
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is the biological pollution that happens

205
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because of the magnitude of the shifts

206
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that it causes

207
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to entire ecosystems.

208
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I'm going to just talk very briefly

209
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
about two kinds of biological pollution:

210
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
one is introduced species

211
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the other is what comes from nutrients.

212
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So this is the infamous

213
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Caulerpa taxifolia,

214
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the so-called killer algae.

215
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
A book was written about it.

216
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's a bit of an embarrassment.

217
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It was accidentally released

218
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
from the aquarium in Monaco,

219
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it was bred to be cold tolerant

220
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to have in peoples aquaria.

221
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's very pretty,

222
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and it has rapidly started

223
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to overgrow

224
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the once very rich

225
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
biodiversity of the

226
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
northwestern Mediterranean.

227
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I don't know how many of you remember the movie

228
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"The Little Shop of Horrors,"

229
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but this is the plant of "The Little Shop of Horrors."

230
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,

231
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
what it's doing is overgrowing

232
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and smothering

233
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life

234
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
of the entire northwestern

235
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Mediterranean Sea.

236
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We don't know anything that eats it,

237
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
we're trying to do all sorts of genetics

238
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and figure out something that could be done,

239
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,

240
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
about which nobody knows what to do.

241
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now another form of pollution

242
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that's biological pollution

243
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is what happens from excess nutrients.

244
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The green revolution,

245
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.

246
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.

247
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It runs down the rivers,

248
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and it feeds the plankton,

249
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the little microscopic plant cells

250
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
in the coastal water.

251
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But since we ate all the oysters

252
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,

253
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
there's nothing to eat the plankton

254
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and there's more and more of it,

255
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
so it dies of old age,

256
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
which is unheard of for plankton.

257
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And when it dies, it falls to the bottom

258
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and then it rots,

259
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which means that bacteria break it down.

260
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And in the process

261
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
they use up all the oxygen,

262
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and in using up all the oxygen

263
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they make the environment utterly lethal

264
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
for anything that can't swim away.

265
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So, what we end up with

266
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is a microbial zoo

267
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
dominated by bacteria

268
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and jellyfish, as you see

269
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
on the left in front of you.

270
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And the only fishery left --

271
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and it is a commercial fishery --

272
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is the jellyfish fishery

273
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
you see on the right, where there used to be prawns.

274
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Even in Newfoundland

275
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
where we used to catch cod,

276
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we now have a jellyfish fishery.

277
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And another version of this sort of thing

278
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is what is often called red tides

279
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
or toxic blooms.

280
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That picture on the left is just staggering to me.

281
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I have talked about it a million times,

282
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
but it's unbelievable.

283
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
In the upper right of that picture on the left

284
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is almost the Mississippi Delta,

285
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and the lower left of that picture

286
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
is the Texas-Mexico border.

287
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
You're looking at the entire

288
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
northwestern Gulf of Mexico;

289
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
you're looking at one toxic

290
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,

291
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
made by that beautiful little creature

292
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
on the lower right.

293
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And in the upper right you see this

294
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
black sort of cloud

295
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
moving ashore.

296
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
That's the same species.

297
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,

298
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and little droplets of the water get into the air,

299
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up

300
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
with people with acute respiratory distress.

301
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And that's retirement homes

302
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
on the west coast of Florida.

303
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood

304
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
we called Hollywood ocean night,

305
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and I was trying to figure out how to

306
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
explain to actors what's going on.

307
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I said,

308
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
"So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu'

309
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
because all the beautiful people have moved

310
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.

311
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And the only people who are left there

312
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
are the people who can't afford

313
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to move away from the coast,

314
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because the coast, instead of being paradise,

315
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is harmful to your health."

316
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And then this is amazing.

317
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.

318
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
This is from the coast of Brittany,

319
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
which is being enveloped

320
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in this green, algal slime.

321
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
The reason that it attracted so much attention,

322
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
besides the fact that it's disgusting,

323
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is that sea birds flying over it

324
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
are asphyxiated by the smell and die,

325
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and a farmer died of it,

326
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and you can imagine the scandal that happened.

327
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And so there's this war

328
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
between the farmers

329
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and the fishermen about it all,

330
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and the net result is that

331
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff

332
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
on a regular basis.

333
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And then, of course, there's climate change,

334
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and we all know about climate change.

335
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I guess the iconic figure of it

336
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
is the melting of the ice

337
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in the Arctic Sea.

338
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died

339
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
trying to find the Northwest Passage.

340
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.

341
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I think it's sort of funny;

342
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
it's on the Siberian coast,

343
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
maybe the Russians will charge tolls.

344
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The governments of the world

345
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
are taking this really seriously.

346
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
The military of the Arctic nations

347
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is taking it really seriously.

348
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
For all the denial of climate change

349
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
by government leaders,

350
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
the CIA

351
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and the navies of Norway

352
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and the U.S. and Canada, whatever

353
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
are busily thinking about

354
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
how they will secure their territory

355
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in this inevitability

356
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
from their point of view.

357
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And, of course, Arctic communities are toast.

358
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
The other kinds of effects of climate change --

359
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?

360
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
All that white coral.

361
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Except it's supposed to be brown.

362
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
What happens is that

363
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
the corals are a symbiosis,

364
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and they have these little algal cells

365
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that live inside them.

366
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And the algae give the corals sugar,

367
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and the corals give the algae

368
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
nutrients and protection.

369
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
But when it gets too hot,

370
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the algae can't make the sugar.

371
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
The corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."

372
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
They kick them out, and then they die.

373
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Not all of them die; some of them survive,

374
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
some more are surviving,

375
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but it's really bad news.

376
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
To try and give you a sense of this,

377
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
imagine you go camping in July

378
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
somewhere in Europe or in North America,

379
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,

380
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and you see that 80 percent of the trees,

381
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
as far as you can see,

382
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.

383
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And you come home, and you discover

384
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that 80 percent of all the trees

385
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in North America and in Europe

386
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
have dropped their leaves.

387
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,

388
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."

389
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean

390
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
during the 1998 El Nino,

391
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
an area vastly greater

392
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
than the size of North America and Europe,

393
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
when 80 percent of all the corals bleached

394
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and a quarter of them died.

395
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And then the really scary thing

396
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
about all of this --

397
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change --

398
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.

399
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,

400
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the synergies among them

401
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that make the whole vastly greater

402
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
than the sum of the parts.

403
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And the great scientific challenge

404
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
for people like me in thinking about all this,

405
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is do we know how

406
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?

407
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.

408
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
But what does that mean?

409
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We really don't know.

410
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
So what are the oceans going to be like

411
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
in 20 or 50 years?

412
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Well, there won't be any fish

413
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
except for minnows,

414
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and the water will be pretty dirty,

415
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and all those kinds of things

416
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and full of mercury, etc., etc.

417
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger

418
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and they'll start to merge,

419
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and we can imagine something like

420
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the dead-zonification

421
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
of the global, coastal ocean.

422
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,

423
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
because it would be a kind of

424
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
gastronomic Russian roulette.

425
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom;

426
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
sometimes you don't.

427
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
That doesn't sell.

428
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
The really scary things though

429
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
are the physical, chemical,

430
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
oceanographic things that are happening.

431
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,

432
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
the water is lighter when it's warmer,

433
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
it becomes harder and harder

434
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to turn the ocean over.

435
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
We say it becomes

436
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
more strongly stratified.

437
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
The consequence of that is that

438
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
all those nutrients

439
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,

440
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
of the sardines of California

441
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
or in Peru or whatever,

442
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
those slow down

443
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and those fisheries collapse.

444
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And, at the same time,

445
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,

446
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
doesn't make it down

447
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and the ocean turns into a desert.

448
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So the question is: How are we all

449
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
going to respond to this?

450
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And we can do

451
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
all sorts of things to fix it,

452
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
but in the final analysis,

453
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
the thing we really need to fix

454
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
is ourselves.

455
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;

456
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
it's not about the climate change.

457
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
It's about us

458
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and our greed and our need for growth

459
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
and our inability to imagine a world

460
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
that is different from the selfish world

461
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
we live in today.

462
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?

463
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I would say that the future of life

464
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and the dignity of human beings

465
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
depends on our doing that.

466
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Thank you. (Applause)

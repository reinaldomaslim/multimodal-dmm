1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Now I'm going to give you a story.

2
0:00:14,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.

3
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Let me begin with my parents.

4
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm a product of this

5
0:00:22,000 --> 0:00:24,000
visionary mother and father.

6
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s --

7
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
'50s and '60s

8
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
didn't belong to girls in India.

9
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They belonged to boys.

10
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
They belonged to boys who would join business

11
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and inherit business from parents,

12
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and girls would be dolled up to get married.

13
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:41,000
My family, in my city,

14
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and almost in the country, was unique.

15
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We were four of us, not one,

16
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and fortunately no boys.

17
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We were four girls and no boys.

18
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And my parents were part

19
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
of a landed property family.

20
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
My father defied his own grandfather,

21
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
almost to the point of disinheritance,

22
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because he decided to educate

23
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
all four of us.

24
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city

25
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and gave us the best education.

26
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,

27
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and when we go to school, we don't choose our school.

28
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Children don't choose a school.

29
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They just get the school which parents choose for them.

30
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So this is the foundation time which I got.

31
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.

32
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And my father used to say at that time,

33
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."

34
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.

35
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I'm the only one who's left in India.

36
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
One is a British, another is an American

37
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and the third is a Canadian.

38
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So we are four of us in four corners of the world.

39
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And since I said they're my role models,

40
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.

41
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One, they said, "Life is on an incline.

42
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You either go up,

43
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or you come down."

44
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And the second thing, which has stayed with me,

45
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
which became my philosophy of life,

46
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
which made all the difference,

47
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.

48
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Out of 100, 90 are your creation.

49
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.

50
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.

51
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.

52
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It's like a death of a relative,

53
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.

54
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You can't do a thing about it.

55
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You've got to just respond to the situation.

56
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But that response comes out of those 90 points.

57
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Since I'm a product of this philosophy,

58
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of 90/10,

59
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and secondly, "life on an incline,"

60
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that's the way I grew up

61
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to be valuing what I got.

62
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'm a product of opportunities,

63
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,

64
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which girls didn't get,

65
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me

66
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
was something unique.

67
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up

68
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to get married with a lot of dowry,

69
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school

70
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.

71
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I thought I must tell you this.

72
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Why I said this, is the background.

73
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is what comes next.

74
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,

75
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
a woman with indefatigable stamina,

76
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.

77
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But I joined the Indian Police Service,

78
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and then it was a new pattern of policing.

79
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:15,000
For me the policing stood for power to correct,

80
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
power to prevent and power to detect.

81
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India --

82
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the power to prevent.

83
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,

84
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
or power to punish.

85
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent,

86
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
because that's what I learned when I was growing up.

87
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?

88
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So this was how it came into my service,

89
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and it was different from the men.

90
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,

91
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because this was the way I was different.

92
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I redefined policing concepts in India.

93
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'm going to take you on two journeys,

94
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:53,000
my policing journey and my prison journey.

95
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What you see, if you see the title

96
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
called "PM's car held."

97
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This was the first time a prime minister of India

98
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:03,000
was given a parking ticket.

99
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
That's the first time in India,

101
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.

102
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It'll never happen again in India,

103
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because now it was once and forever.

104
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And the rule was, because I was sensitive,

105
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,

106
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and I was very pro-justice.

107
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.

108
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I had other options, but I didn't choose them.

109
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So I'm going to move on.

110
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is about tough policing, equal policing.

111
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen."

112
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,

113
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:37,000
postings which others would say no.

114
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.

115
0:04:4,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Normally police officers don't want to do prison.

116
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They sent me to prison to lock me up,

117
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
thinking, "Now there will be no cars

118
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and no VIPs to be given tickets to.

119
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Let's lock her up."

120
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Here I got a prison assignment.

121
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.

122
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Obviously, it was.

123
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But 10,000 men,

124
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 --

125
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
9,000 plus about 600

126
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
were men.

127
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Terrorists, rapists,

128
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
burglars, gangsters --

129
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
some of them I'd sent to jail

130
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
as a police officer outside.

131
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And then how did I deal with them?

132
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The first day when I went in,

133
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I didn't know how to look at them.

134
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?"

135
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.

136
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I said, "Do you pray?"

137
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And they didn't say anything.

138
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"

139
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:34,000
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray."

140
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I prayed for them, and things started to change.

141
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This is a visual of education inside the prison.

142
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Friends, this has never happened,

143
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
where everybody in the prison studies.

144
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I started this with community support.

145
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Government had no budget.

146
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism

147
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in any prison in the world.

148
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This was initiated in Delhi prison.

149
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
You see one sample

150
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
of a prisoner teaching a class.

151
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
These are hundreds of classes.

152
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program --

153
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the same den in which they thought

154
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.

155
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We converted this into an ashram --

156
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
from a prison to an ashram through education.

157
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I think that's the bigger change.

158
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It was the beginning of a change.

159
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.

160
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Books came from donated schoolbooks.

161
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Stationery was donated.

162
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Everything was donated,

163
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because there was no budget of education for the prison.

164
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Now if I'd not done that,

165
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it would have been a hellhole.

166
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
That's the second landmark.

167
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey,

168
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.

169
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
One, the numbers you'll never get to see.

170
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Secondly, this concept.

171
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This was a meditation program inside the prison

172
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of over 1,000 prisoners.

173
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.

174
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
This was one of the most courageous steps

175
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I took as a prison governor.

176
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
And this is what transformed.

177
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You want to know more about this,

178
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."

179
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You will hear about it, and you will love it.

180
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And write to me on KiranBedi.com,

181
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and I'll respond to you.

182
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Let me show you the next slide.

183
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I took the same concept of mindfulness,

184
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?

185
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.

186
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.

187
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Not by preaching, not by telling,

188
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
not by reading, but by addressing your mind.

189
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I took the same thing to the police,

190
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,

191
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and they felt as if it was "we" and "they,"

192
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and that the people don't cooperate.

193
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This worked.

194
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is a feedback box called a petition box.

195
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is a concept which I introduced

196
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.

197
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
This was a magic box.

198
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:47,000
This was a sensitive box.

199
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.

200
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
If you see somebody in the blue --

201
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
yeah, this guy --

202
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.

203
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.

204
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Let me wrap it up.

205
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I'm currently into movements,

206
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
movements of education

207
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
of the under-served children,

208
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:1,000
which is thousands -- India is all about thousands.

209
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.

210
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
That's a big way

211
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:16,000
we, as a small group of activists,

212
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.

213
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Friends, you will hear a lot about it.

214
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving,

215
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and that's the movement and ambition of my life.

216
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Thank you very much.

217
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:31,000
(Applause)

218
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.

219
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

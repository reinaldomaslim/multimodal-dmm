1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Thank you very much.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because it's very old.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Roughness is part of human life

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
forever and forever,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and ancient authors have written about it.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It was very much uncontrollable,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and in a certain sense,

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
it seemed to be the extreme of complexity,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
just a mess, a mess and a mess.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
There are many different kinds of mess.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, in fact,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
by a complete fluke,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I got involved many years ago

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in a study of this form of complexity,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and to my utter amazement,

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I found traces --

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
very strong traces, I must say --

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of order in that roughness.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And so today, I would like to present to you

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
a few examples

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of what this represents.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I prefer the word roughness

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to the word irregularity

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because irregularity --

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to someone who had Latin

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in my long-past youth --

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
means the contrary of regularity.

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But it is not so.

33
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Regularity is the contrary of roughness

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
because the basic aspect of the world

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is very rough.

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So let me show you a few objects.

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Some of them are artificial.

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Others of them are very real, in a certain sense.

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now why do I show a cauliflower,

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Because old and ancient as it may be,

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it's very complicated and it's very simple,

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
both at the same time.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it,

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and when you eat it, the weight matters --

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
but suppose you try to

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
measure its surface.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Well, it's very interesting.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
If you cut, with a sharp knife,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
one of the florets of a cauliflower

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and look at it separately,

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
you think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And then you cut again,

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and you still get small cauliflowers.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So the experience of humanity

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
has always been that there are some shapes

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
which have this peculiar property,

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that each part is like the whole,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but smaller.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Now, what did humanity do with that?

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Very, very little.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So what I did actually is to

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
study this problem,

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and I found something quite surprising.

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That one can measure roughness

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
by a number, a number,

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
One day, a friend of mine,

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to bug me,

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
brought a picture and said,

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"What is the roughness of this curve?"

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I said, "Well, just short of 1.5."

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It was 1.48.

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now, it didn't take me any time.

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I've been looking at these things for so long.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So these numbers are the numbers

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which denote the roughness of these surfaces.

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I hasten to say that these surfaces

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
are completely artificial.

83
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
They were done on a computer,

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the only input is a number,

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and that number is roughness.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So on the left,

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I took the roughness copied from many landscapes.

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
To the right, I took a higher roughness.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So the eye, after a while,

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
can distinguish these two very well.

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Very few things are very smooth.

94
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So then if you try to ask questions:

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"What's the surface of a cauliflower?"

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Well, you measure and measure and measure.

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Each time you're closer, it gets bigger,

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
down to very, very small distances.

99
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What's the length of the coastline

100
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of these lakes?

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The closer you measure, the longer it is.

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The concept of length of coastline,

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
which seems to be so natural

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
because it's given in many cases,

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing.

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You must do it differently.

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
What good is that, to know these things?

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Well, surprisingly enough,

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it's good in many ways.

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
To begin with, artificial landscapes,

111
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which I invented sort of,

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
are used in cinema all the time.

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We see mountains in the distance.

114
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
They may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now it's very easy to do.

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.

117
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now look at that. That's a real lung.

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now a lung is something very strange.

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
If you take this thing,

120
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
you know very well it weighs very little.

121
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The volume of a lung is very small,

122
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but what about the area of the lung?

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Anatomists were arguing very much about that.

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Some say that a normal male's lung

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
has an area of the inside

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
of a basketball [court].

127
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And the others say, no, five basketball [courts].

128
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Enormous disagreements.

129
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is something very ill-defined.

131
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The bronchi branch, branch, branch

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and they stop branching,

133
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
not because of any matter of principle,

134
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but because of physical considerations:

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the mucus, which is in the lung.

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So what happens is that in a way

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
you have a much bigger lung,

138
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but it branches and branches

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man

140
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and for a little rodent.

141
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, what good is it to have that?

142
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough,

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the anatomists had a very poor idea

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of the structure of the lung until very recently.

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I think that my mathematics,

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
surprisingly enough,

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
has been of great help

148
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to the surgeons

149
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
studying lung illnesses

150
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and also kidney illnesses,

151
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
all these branching systems,

152
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
for which there was no geometry.

153
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So I found myself, in other words,

154
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
constructing a geometry,

155
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a geometry of things which had no geometry.

156
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And a surprising aspect of it

157
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is that very often, the rules of this geometry

158
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
are extremely short.

159
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You have formulas that long.

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And you crank it several times.

161
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Sometimes repeatedly: again, again, again,

162
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the same repetition.

163
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And at the end, you get things like that.

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This cloud is completely,

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
100 percent artificial.

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Well, 99.9.

167
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And the only part which is natural

168
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is a number, the roughness of the cloud,

169
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
which is taken from nature.

170
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Something so complicated like a cloud,

171
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so unstable, so varying,

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
should have a simple rule behind it.

173
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now this simple rule

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is not an explanation of clouds.

175
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The seer of clouds had to

176
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
take account of it.

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I don't know how much advanced

178
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
these pictures are. They're old.

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I was very much involved in it,

180
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but then turned my attention to other phenomena.

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Now, here is another thing

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
which is rather interesting.

183
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
One of the shattering events

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in the history of mathematics,

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
which is not appreciated by many people,

186
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
occurred about 130 years ago,

187
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
145 years ago.

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Mathematicians began to create

189
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
shapes that didn't exist.

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Mathematicians got into self-praise

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to an extent which was absolutely amazing,

192
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that man can invent things

193
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that nature did not know.

194
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In particular, it could invent

195
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
things like a curve which fills the plane.

196
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
A curve's a curve, a plane's a plane,

197
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and the two won't mix.

198
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Well, they do mix.

199
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
A man named Peano

200
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
did define such curves,

201
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and it became an object of extraordinary interest.

202
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
It was very important, but mostly interesting

203
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because a kind of break,

204
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
a separation between

205
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand,

206
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.

207
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Well, I was very sorry to point out

208
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that the pure man's mind

209
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
has, in fact,

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
seen at long last

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
what had been seen for a long time.

212
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And so here I introduce something,

213
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.

214
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And well,

215
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it's a story unto itself.

216
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So it was in 1875 to 1925,

217
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
an extraordinary period

218
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.

219
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And the objects which were used

220
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
as examples, when I was

221
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a child and a student, as examples

222
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
of the break between mathematics

223
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and visible reality --

224
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
those objects,

225
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I turned them completely around.

226
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I used them for describing

227
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
some of the aspects of the complexity of nature.

228
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Well, a man named Hausdorff in 1919

229
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke,

230
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and I found that this number

231
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
was a good measurement of roughness.

232
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics

233
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
they said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly]."

234
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Well actually, I was not silly.

235
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well.

236
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The things on the ground are algae.

237
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
He did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West.

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But painting for a long time had a fractal side.

240
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I could speak of that for a long time.

241
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.

242
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower,

243
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood.

244
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
This is a mess, mess, mess, Brownian loop.

245
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
One day I decided --

246
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
halfway through my career,

247
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I was held by so many things in my work --

248
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I decided to test myself.

249
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Could I just look at something

250
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
which everybody had been looking at for a long time

251
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and find something dramatically new?

252
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Well, so I looked at these

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
things called Brownian motion -- just goes around.

254
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I played with it for a while,

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and I made it return to the origin.

256
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Then I was telling my assistant,

257
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?"

258
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So he painted it, which means

259
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
he put inside everything. He said:

260
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
"Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop!

261
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I see; it's an island."

262
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And amazing.

263
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So Brownian motion, which happens to have

264
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a roughness number of two, goes around.

265
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
I measured it, 1.33.

266
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Again, again, again.

267
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Long measurements, big Brownian motions,

268
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
1.33.

269
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Mathematical problem: how to prove it?

270
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It took my friends 20 years.

271
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Three of them were having incomplete proofs.

272
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
They got together, and together they had the proof.

273
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics,

274
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
one of the three medals that people have received

275
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
for proving things which I've seen

276
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
without being able to prove them.

277
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Now everybody asks me at one point or another,

278
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
"How did it all start?

279
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
What got you in that strange business?"

280
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
What got you to be,

281
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
at the same time, a mechanical engineer,

282
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
a geographer

283
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and a mathematician and so on, a physicist?

284
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Well actually I started, oddly enough,

285
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
studying stock market prices.

286
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And so here

287
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I had this theory,

288
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and I wrote books about it --

289
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
financial prices increments.

290
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
To the left you see data over a long period.

291
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
To the right, on top,

292
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
It was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.

294
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

295
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
There are thousands of books on that.

296
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Now compare that with real price increments.

297
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Where are real price increments?

298
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Well, these other lines

299
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
include some real price increments

300
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and some forgery which I did.

301
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So the idea there was

302
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that one must be able to -- how do you say? --

303
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
model price variation.

304
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And it went really well 50 years ago.

305
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
For 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me

306
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because they could do it much, much easier.

307
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.

308
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Laughter)

309
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
These two curves are averages:

310
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Standard & Poor, the blue one;

311
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and the red one is Standard & Poor's

312
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
from which the five biggest discontinuities

313
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
are taken out.

314
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Now discontinuities are a nuisance,

315
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
so in many studies of prices,

316
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
one puts them aside.

317
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
"Well, acts of God.

318
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And you have the little nonsense which is left.

319
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Acts of God." In this picture,

320
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
five acts of God are as important as everything else.

321
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
In other words,

322
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
it is not acts of God that we should put aside.

323
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That is the meat, the problem.

324
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
If you master these, you master price,

325
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and if you don't master these, you can master

326
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the little noise as well as you can,

327
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
but it's not important.

328
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Well, here are the curves for it.

329
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Now, I get to the final thing, which is the set

330
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of which my name is attached.

331
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
In a way, it's the story of my life.

332
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
My adolescence was spent

333
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
during the German occupation of France.

334
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Since I thought that I might

335
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
vanish within a day or a week,

336
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I had very big dreams.

337
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And after the war,

338
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I saw an uncle again.

339
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me,

340
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
"Look, there's a problem

341
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
which I could not solve 25 years ago,

342
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and which nobody can solve.

343
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia

344
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and [Pierre] Fatou.

345
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
If you could

346
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
find something new, anything,

347
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
you will get your career made."

348
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Very simple.

349
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So I looked,

350
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and like the thousands of people that had tried before,

351
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I found nothing.

352
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But then the computer came,

353
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and I decided to apply the computer,

354
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
not to new problems in mathematics --

355
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
like this wiggle wiggle, that's a new problem --

356
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but to old problems.

357
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And I went from what's called

358
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
real numbers, which are points on a line,

359
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to imaginary, complex numbers,

360
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
which are points on a plane,

361
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
which is what one should do there,

362
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and this shape came out.

363
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
This shape is of an extraordinary complication.

364
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
The equation is hidden there,

365
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
z goes into z squared, plus c.

366
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It's so simple, so dry.

367
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
It's so uninteresting.

368
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Now you turn the crank once, twice:

369
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
twice,

370
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
marvels come out.

371
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
I mean this comes out.

372
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I don't want to explain these things.

373
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
This comes out. This comes out.

374
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Shapes which are of such complication,

375
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
such harmony and such beauty.

376
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
This comes out

377
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
repeatedly, again, again, again.

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And that was one of my major discoveries,

379
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to find that these islands were the same

380
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
as the whole big thing, more or less.

381
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And then you get these

382
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.

383
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
All that from this little formula,

384
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
which has whatever, five symbols in it.

385
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And then this one.

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The color was added for two reasons.

387
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
First of all, because these shapes

388
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
are so complicated

389
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.

390
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And if you plot them, you must choose some system.

391
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And so my principle has been

392
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
to always present the shapes

393
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
with different colorings

394
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
because some colorings emphasize that,

395
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and others it is that or that.

396
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It's so complicated.

397
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Laughter)

398
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
In 1990, I was in Cambridge, U.K.

399
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
to receive a prize from the university,

400
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and three days later,

401
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.

402
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
So where did this come from?

403
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Obviously, from extraterrestrials.

404
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Laughter)

405
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge

406
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
published an article about that "discovery"

407
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and received the next day

408
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
5,000 letters from people saying,

409
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
"But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big."

410
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Well, let me finish.

411
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
This shape here just came

412
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
out of an exercise in pure mathematics.

413
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules,

414
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
which are repeated without end.

415
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Thank you very much.

416
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Applause)

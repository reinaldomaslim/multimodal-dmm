1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Last year I showed these two slides so that

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
demonstrate that the arctic ice cap,

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
which for most of the last three million years

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
has been the size of the lower 48 states,

5
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
has shrunk by 40 percent.

6
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem

7
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The arctic ice cap is, in a sense,

9
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the beating heart of the global climate system.

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It expands in winter and contracts in summer.

11
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The next slide I show you will be

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
The permanent ice is marked in red.

14
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
As you see, it expands to the dark blue --

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that's the annual ice in winter,

16
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and it contracts in summer.

17
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older,

18
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
you can see is almost like blood,

19
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
spilling out of the body here.

20
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is a problem because the warming

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean,

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.

25
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere,

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.

27
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska,

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
methane is actively bubbling up out of the water.

29
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska

30
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.

31
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Video: Whoa! (Laughter)

32
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Al Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be.

33
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And one reason is, this enormous heat sink

34
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
heats up Greenland from the north.

35
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
This is an annual melting river.

36
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But the volumes are much larger than ever.

37
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.

38
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
If you want to know how sea level rises

39
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
from land-base ice melting

40
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
this is where it reaches the sea.

41
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
These flows are increasing very rapidly.

42
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
At the other end of the planet, Antarctica

43
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the largest mass of ice on the planet.

44
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Last month scientists reported the entire continent

45
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is now in negative ice balance.

46
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands,

47
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is particularly rapid in its melting.

48
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland.

49
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice:

50
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.

51
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
40 percent of all the people in the world

52
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
get half of their drinking water from that melting flow.

53
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
In the Andes, this glacier is the

54
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
source of drinking water for this city.

55
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The flows have increased.

56
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.

57
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In California there has been a 40 percent

58
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
decline in the Sierra snowpack.

59
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This is hitting the reservoirs.

60
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And the predictions, as you've read, are serious.

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This drying around the world has lead to

62
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a dramatic increase in fires.

63
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And the disasters around the world

64
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary

65
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and unprecedented rate.

66
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Four times as many in the last 30 years

67
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as in the previous 75.

68
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is a completely unsustainable pattern.

69
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If you look at in the context of history

70
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you can see what this is doing.

71
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In the last five years

72
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we've added 70 million tons of CO2

73
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
every 24 hours --

74
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
25 million tons every day to the oceans.

75
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific,

76
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
from the Americas, extending westward,

77
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and on either side of the Indian subcontinent,

78
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.

79
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The biggest single cause of global warming,

80
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.

81
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.

82
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
The United States is one of the two

83
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
largest emitters, along with China.

84
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.

85
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But we're beginning to see a sea change.

86
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years

87
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with some green alternatives proposed.

88
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Applause)

89
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
However there is a political battle

90
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in our country.

91
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And the coal industries and the oil industries

92
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year

93
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
promoting clean coal,

94
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
which is an oxymoron.

95
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
That image reminded me of something.

96
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee,

98
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.

99
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You probably saw it on the news.

100
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.

101
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This happened around Christmas.

102
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.

103
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000

1
0:00:12.973,000 --> 0:00:15,000
2014 is a very special year for me:

2
0:00:16.107,000 --> 0:00:17,000
20 years as a consultant,

3
0:00:18.034,000 --> 0:00:19,000
20 years of marriage,

4
0:00:19.706,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I'm turning 50 in one month.

5
0:00:22.887,000 --> 0:00:27,000
That means I was born in 1964 in a small town in Germany.

6
0:00:28.437,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It was a gray November day,

7
0:00:30.155,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I was overdue.

8
0:00:32.035,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The hospital's maternity ward was really stressed out

9
0:00:35.518,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because a lot of babies were born on this gray November day.

10
0:00:40.023,000 --> 0:00:42,000
As a matter of fact,

11
0:00:42.145,000 --> 0:00:46,000
1964 was the year with the highest birth rate ever in Germany:

12
0:00:46.571,000 --> 0:00:48,000
more than 1.3 million.

13
0:00:48.591,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Last year, we just hit over 600,000,

14
0:00:51.725,000 --> 0:00:52,000
so half of my number.

15
0:00:53.49,000 --> 0:00:56,000
What you can see here is the German age pyramid,

16
0:00:57.321,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and there, the small black point at the top, that's me.

17
0:01:00.13,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

18
0:01:06.307,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In red, you can see the potential working-age population,

19
0:01:10.44,000 --> 0:01:14,000
so people over 15 and under 65,

20
0:01:14.689,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I'm actually only interested in this red area.

21
0:01:18.404,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, let's do a simple simulation

22
0:01:20.447,000 --> 0:01:24,000
of how this age structure will develop over the next couple of years.

23
0:01:24.975,000 --> 0:01:25,000
As you can see,

24
0:01:26.414,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the peak is moving to the right,

25
0:01:28.713,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I, with many other baby boomers, will retire in 2030.

26
0:01:35.238,000 --> 0:01:37,000
By the way, I don't need any forecasts

27
0:01:37.513,000 --> 0:01:39,000
of birth rates for predicting this red area.

28
0:01:40.406,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The red area,

29
0:01:41.678,000 --> 0:01:44,000
so the potential working-age population in 2030,

30
0:01:45.291,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is already set in stone today,

31
0:01:48.589,000 --> 0:01:51,000
except for much higher migration rates.

32
0:01:52.141,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And if you compare this red area in 2030 with the red area in 2014,

33
0:01:58.271,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it is much, much smaller.

34
0:02:01.382,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So before I show you the rest of the world,

35
0:02:03.82,000 --> 0:02:06,000
what does this mean for Germany?

36
0:02:07.117,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So what we know from this picture is that the labor supply,

37
0:02:11.204,000 --> 0:02:12,000
so people who provide labor,

38
0:02:13.131,000 --> 0:02:16,000
will go down in Germany, and will go down significantly.

39
0:02:16.8,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now, what about labor demand?

40
0:02:19.4,000 --> 0:02:2,000
That's where it gets tricky.

41
0:02:22.163,000 --> 0:02:26,000
As you might know, the consultant's favorite answer to any question is,

42
0:02:26.97,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"It depends."

43
0:02:28.711,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So I would say it depends.

44
0:02:31.079,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We didn't want to forecast the future.

45
0:02:33.448,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Highly speculative.

46
0:02:34.957,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We did something else.

47
0:02:36.513,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We looked at the GDP and productivity growth of Germany

48
0:02:39.903,000 --> 0:02:4,000
over the last 20 years,

49
0:02:41.598,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and calculated the following scenario:

50
0:02:44.082,000 --> 0:02:48,000
if Germany wants to continue this GDP and productivity growth,

51
0:02:48.563,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we could directly calculate

52
0:02:50.676,000 --> 0:02:53,000
how many people Germany would need to support this growth.

53
0:02:54.647,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And this is the green line: labor demand.

54
0:02:57.619,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So Germany will run into a major talent shortage very quickly.

55
0:03:03.331,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Eight million people are missing,

56
0:03:05.165,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which is more than 20 percent of our current workforce,

57
0:03:07.928,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so big numbers, really big numbers.

58
0:03:10.598,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And we calculated several scenarios,

59
0:03:12.711,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the picture always looked like this.

60
0:03:16.565,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, to close the gap,

61
0:03:18.446,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Germany has to significantly increase migration,

62
0:03:22.509,000 --> 0:03:24,000
get many more women in the workforce,

63
0:03:24.715,000 --> 0:03:25,000
increase retirement age —

64
0:03:26.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by the way, we just lowered it this year —

65
0:03:28.895,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and all these measures at once.

66
0:03:31.658,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If Germany fails here, Germany will stagnate.

67
0:03:35.721,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We won't grow anymore. Why?

68
0:03:38.043,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Because the workers are not there who can generate this growth.

69
0:03:41.456,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And companies will look for talents somewhere else.

70
0:03:45.913,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But where?

71
0:03:48.73,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now, we simulated labor supply and labor demand

72
0:03:52.776,000 --> 0:03:55,000
for the largest 15 economies in the world,

73
0:03:55.945,000 --> 0:03:58,000
representing more than 70 percent of world GDP,

74
0:03:59.637,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and the overall picture looks like this by 2020.

75
0:04:03.584,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Blue indicates a labor surplus,

76
0:04:06.277,000 --> 0:04:08,000
red indicates a labor shortfall,

77
0:04:08.762,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and gray are those countries which are borderline.

78
0:04:12.454,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So by 2020, we still see a labor surplus in some countries,

79
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:2,000
like Italy, France, the U.S.,

80
0:04:20.743,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but this picture will change dramatically by 2030.

81
0:04:25.34,000 --> 0:04:29,000
By 2030, we will face a global workforce crisis

82
0:04:29.961,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in most of our largest economies,

83
0:04:32.956,000 --> 0:04:34,000
including three out of the four BRIC countries.

84
0:04:35.371,000 --> 0:04:38,000
China, with its former one-child policy, will be hit,

85
0:04:38.529,000 --> 0:04:41,000
as well as Brazil and Russia.

86
0:04:42.453,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, to tell the truth,

87
0:04:46.168,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in reality, the situation will be even more challenging.

88
0:04:50.974,000 --> 0:04:53,000
What you can see here are average numbers.

89
0:04:54.317,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We de-averaged them

90
0:04:56.013,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and broke them down into different skill levels,

91
0:04:58.633,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and what we found

92
0:04:59.95,000 --> 0:05:02,000
were even higher shortfalls for high-skilled people

93
0:05:03.884,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and a partial surplus for low-skilled workers.

94
0:05:08.063,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So on top of an overall labor shortage,

95
0:05:11.221,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we will face a big skill mismatch in the future,

96
0:05:15.477,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and this means huge challenges

97
0:05:17.2,000 --> 0:05:19,000
in terms of education, qualification,

98
0:05:19.289,000 --> 0:05:22,000
upskilling for governments and companies.

99
0:05:24.397,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now, the next thing we looked into was robots, automation, technology.

100
0:05:30.375,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Will technology change this picture and boost productivity?

101
0:05:35.728,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Now, the short answer would be

102
0:05:37.798,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that our numbers already include a significant growth in productivity

103
0:05:42.359,000 --> 0:05:43,000
driven by technology.

104
0:05:45.093,000 --> 0:05:48,000
A long answer would go like this.

105
0:05:48.628,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Let's take Germany again.

106
0:05:51.113,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The Germans have a certain reputation in the world

107
0:05:53.667,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when it comes to productivity.

108
0:05:56.244,000 --> 0:06:,000
In the '90s, I worked in our Boston office for almost two years,

109
0:06:00.841,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and when I left, an old senior partner told me, literally,

110
0:06:04.998,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"Send me more of these Germans, they work like machines."

111
0:06:08.48,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:12.967,000 --> 0:06:15,000
That was 1998.

113
0:06:16.259,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Sixteen years later, you'd probably say the opposite.

114
0:06:19.742,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"Send me more of these machines. They work like Germans."

115
0:06:23.41,000 --> 0:06:27,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

116
0:06:30.108,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Technology will replace a lot of jobs, regular jobs.

117
0:06:34.811,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Not only in the production industry,

118
0:06:36.808,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but even office workers are in jeopardy

119
0:06:38.69,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and might be replaced by robots,

120
0:06:41.521,000 --> 0:06:43,000
artificial intelligence, big data, or automation.

121
0:06:45.12,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So the key question is not if technology replaces some of these jobs,

122
0:06:50.042,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but when, how fast, and to what extent?

123
0:06:53.688,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Or in other words,

124
0:06:55.383,000 --> 0:06:59,000
will technology help us to solve this global workforce crisis?

125
0:07:01.334,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Yes and no.

126
0:07:03.254,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This is a more sophisticated version of "it depends."

127
0:07:06.156,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:07.227,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Let's take the automotive industry as an example,

129
0:07:12.31,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because there, more than 40 percent of industrial robots are already working

130
0:07:16.814,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and automation has already taken place.

131
0:07:21.332,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In 1980, less than 10 percent of the production cost of a car

132
0:07:26.659,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was caused by electronic parts.

133
0:07:29.329,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Today, this number is more than 30 percent

134
0:07:32.58,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030.

135
0:07:37.427,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And these new electronic parts and applications

136
0:07:41.632,000 --> 0:07:45,000
require new skills and have created a lot of new jobs,

137
0:07:45.652,000 --> 0:07:47,000
like the cognitive systems engineer

138
0:07:48.223,000 --> 0:07:52,000
who optimizes the interaction between driver and electronic system.

139
0:07:54.081,000 --> 0:08:,000
In 1980, no one had the slightest clue that such a job would ever exist.

140
0:08:01.534,000 --> 0:08:02,000
As a matter of fact,

141
0:08:03.051,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the overall number of people involved in the production of a car

142
0:08:07.246,000 --> 0:08:1,000
has only changed slightly in the last decades,

143
0:08:10.659,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in spite of robots and automation.

144
0:08:13.677,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So what does this mean?

145
0:08:15.443,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Yes, technology will replace a lot of jobs,

146
0:08:17.88,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but we will also see a lot of new jobs and new skills on the horizon,

147
0:08:23.731,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and that means technology will worsen our overall skill mismatch.

148
0:08:29.768,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And this kind of de-averaging

149
0:08:31.51,000 --> 0:08:34,000
reveals the crucial challenge for governments and businesses.

150
0:08:37.175,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So people, high-skilled people,

151
0:08:41.006,000 --> 0:08:45,000
talents, will be the big thing in the next decade.

152
0:08:45.046,000 --> 0:08:5,000
If they are the scarce resource, we have to understand them much better.

153
0:08:50.688,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Are they actually willing to work abroad?

154
0:08:53.637,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What are their job preferences?

155
0:08:56.552,000 --> 0:09:01,000
To find out, this year we conducted a global survey

156
0:09:01.617,000 --> 0:09:06,000
among more than 200,000 job seekers from 189 countries.

157
0:09:08.021,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Migration is certainly one key measure to close a gap,

158
0:09:13.469,000 --> 0:09:14,000
at least in the short term,

159
0:09:15.013,000 --> 0:09:17,000
so we asked about mobility.

160
0:09:17.613,000 --> 0:09:21,000
More than 60 percent of these 200,000 job seekers

161
0:09:22.234,000 --> 0:09:24,000
are willing to work abroad.

162
0:09:24.834,000 --> 0:09:26,000
For me, a surprisingly high number.

163
0:09:26.994,000 --> 0:09:29,000
If you look at the employees aged 21 to 30,

164
0:09:30.407,000 --> 0:09:32,000
this number is even higher.

165
0:09:32.706,000 --> 0:09:35,000
If you split this number up by country,

166
0:09:36.026,000 --> 0:09:41,000
yes, the world is mobile, but only partly.

167
0:09:41.227,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The least mobile countries are Russia, Germany and the U.S.

168
0:09:46.358,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Now where would these people like to move?

169
0:09:49.632,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Number seven is Australia, where 28 percent could imagine moving.

170
0:09:54.462,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Then France, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, U.K.,

171
0:09:58.804,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and the top choice worldwide is the U.S.

172
0:10:02.744,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Now, what are the job preferences of these 200,000 people?

173
0:10:06.263,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So, what are they looking for?

174
0:10:09.043,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Out of a list of 26 topics, salary is only number eight.

175
0:10:15.475,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The top four topics are all around culture.

176
0:10:20.003,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Number four,

177
0:10:21.558,000 --> 0:10:23,000
having a great relationship with the boss;

178
0:10:24.554,000 --> 0:10:28,000
three, enjoying a great work-life balance;

179
0:10:28.571,000 --> 0:10:31,000
two, having a great relationship with colleagues;

180
0:10:32.332,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the top priority worldwide

181
0:10:35.751,000 --> 0:10:38,000
is being appreciated for your work.

182
0:10:40.321,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So, do I get a thank you?

183
0:10:43.152,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Not only once a year with the annual bonus payment,

184
0:10:46.496,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but every day.

185
0:10:48.701,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And now, our global workforce crisis becomes very personal.

186
0:10:53.926,000 --> 0:10:56,000
People are looking for recognition.

187
0:10:56.967,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Aren't we all looking for recognition in our jobs?

188
0:11:03.302,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Now, let me connect the dots.

189
0:11:06.882,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We will face a global workforce crisis

190
0:11:09.25,000 --> 0:11:11,000
which consists of an overall labor shortage

191
0:11:12.222,000 --> 0:11:13,000
plus a huge skill mismatch,

192
0:11:14.173,000 --> 0:11:17,000
plus a big cultural challenge.

193
0:11:17.307,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And this global workforce crisis is approaching very fast.

194
0:11:21.231,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Right now, we are just at the turning point.

195
0:11:23.971,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So what can we, what can governments, what can companies do?

196
0:11:28.359,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Every company,

197
0:11:29.962,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but also every country,

198
0:11:31.749,000 --> 0:11:32,000
needs a people strategy,

199
0:11:33.677,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and to act on it immediately,

200
0:11:36.649,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and such a people strategy consists of four parts.

201
0:11:40.596,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Number one, a plan

202
0:11:42.407,000 --> 0:11:48,000
for how to forecast supply and demand for different jobs and different skills.

203
0:11:48.537,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Workforce planning will become more important than financial planning.

204
0:11:54.109,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Two, a plan for how to attract great people:

205
0:11:57.732,000 --> 0:12:,000
generation Y, women, but also retirees.

206
0:12:01.865,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Three, a plan for how to educate and upskill them.

207
0:12:05.878,000 --> 0:12:07,000
There's a huge upskilling challenge ahead of us.

208
0:12:09.666,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And four,

209
0:12:11.5,000 --> 0:12:13,000
for how to retain the best people,

210
0:12:14.053,000 --> 0:12:15,000
or in other words,

211
0:12:15.423,000 --> 0:12:19,000
how to realize an appreciation and relationship culture.

212
0:12:23.643,000 --> 0:12:29,000
However, one crucial underlying factor is to change our attitudes.

213
0:12:30.424,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Employees are resources, are assets,

214
0:12:34.627,000 --> 0:12:36,000
not costs, not head counts,

215
0:12:37.096,000 --> 0:12:38,000
not machines,

216
0:12:38.505,000 --> 0:12:39,000
not even the Germans.

217
0:12:40.176,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Thank you.

218
0:12:41.302,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Applause)

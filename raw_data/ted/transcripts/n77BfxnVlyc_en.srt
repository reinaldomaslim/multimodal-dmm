1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It is a thrill to be here at a conference

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that's devoted to "Inspired by Nature" -- you can imagine.

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I'm also thrilled to be in the foreplay section.

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Did you notice this section is foreplay?

5
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Because I get to talk about one of my favorite critters,

6
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which is the Western Grebe. You haven't lived

7
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:5,000
until you've seen these guys do their courtship dance.

8
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was on Bowman Lake in Glacier National Park,

9
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which is a long, skinny lake with sort of mountains upside down in it,

10
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and my partner and I have a rowing shell.

11
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And so we were rowing, and one of these Western Grebes came along.

12
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And what they do for their courtship dance is, they go together,

13
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the two of them, the two mates, and they begin to run underwater.

14
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They paddle faster, and faster, and faster, until they're going so fast

15
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that they literally lift up out of the water,

16
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and they're standing upright, sort of paddling the top of the water.

17
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And one of these Grebes came along while we were rowing.

18
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And so we're in a skull, and we're moving really, really quickly.

19
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And this Grebe, I think, sort of, mistaked us for a prospect,

20
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and started to run along the water next to us,

21
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in a courtship dance -- for miles.

22
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It would stop, and then start, and then stop, and then start.

23
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now that is foreplay.

24
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

25
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I came this close to changing species at that moment.

26
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Obviously, life can teach us something

27
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in the entertainment section. Life has a lot to teach us.

28
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But what I'd like to talk about today

29
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is what life might teach us in technology and in design.

30
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:26,000
What's happened since the book came out --

31
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the book was mainly about research in biomimicry --

32
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and what's happened since then is architects, designers, engineers --

33
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
people who make our world -- have started to call and say,

34
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we want a biologist to sit at the design table

35
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to help us, in real time, become inspired.

36
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Or -- and this is the fun part for me -- we want you to take us out

37
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
into the natural world. We'll come with a design challenge

38
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and we find the champion adapters in the natural world, who might inspire us.

39
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So this is a picture from a Galapagos trip that we took

40
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:02,000
with some wastewater treatment engineers; they purify wastewater.

41
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And some of them were very resistant, actually, to being there.

42
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:1,000
What they said to us at first was, you know, we already do biomimicry.

43
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We use bacteria to clean our water. And we said,

44
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:19,000
well, that's not exactly being inspired by nature.

45
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That's bioprocessing, you know; that's bio-assisted technology:

46
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:28,000
using an organism to do your wastewater treatment

47
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is an old, old technology called "domestication."

48
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This is learning something, learning an idea, from an organism and then applying it.

49
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And so they still weren't getting it.

50
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So we went for a walk on the beach and I said,

51
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:48,000
well, give me one of your big problems. Give me a design challenge,

52
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
sustainability speed bump, that's keeping you from being sustainable.

53
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And they said scaling, which is the build-up of minerals inside of pipes.

54
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And they said, you know what happens is, mineral --

55
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
just like at your house -- mineral builds up.

56
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then the aperture closes, and we have to flush the pipes with toxins,

57
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or we have to dig them up.

58
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So if we had some way to stop this scaling --

59
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and so I picked up some shells on the beach. And I asked them,

60
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
what is scaling? What's inside your pipes?

61
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And they said, calcium carbonate.

62
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And I said, that's what this is; this is calcium carbonate.

63
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And they didn't know that.

64
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They didn't know that what a seashell is,

65
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it's templated by proteins, and then ions from the seawater

66
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
crystallize in place to create a shell.

67
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So the same sort of a process, without the proteins,

68
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is happening on the inside of their pipes. They didn't know.

69
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is not for lack of information; it's a lack of integration.

70
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You know, it's a silo, people in silos. They didn't know

71
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that the same thing was happening. So one of them thought about it

72
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and said, OK, well, if this is just crystallization

73
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that happens automatically out of seawater -- self-assembly --

74
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:08,000
then why aren't shells infinite in size? What stops the scaling?

75
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Why don't they just keep on going?

76
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I said, well, in the same way

77
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization --

78
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and then they all sort of leaned in --

79
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization.

80
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It literally adheres to the growing face of the crystal.

81
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And, in fact, there is a product called TPA

82
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that's mimicked that protein -- that stop-protein --

83
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and it's an environmentally friendly way to stop scaling in pipes.

84
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
That changed everything. From then on,

85
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you could not get these engineers back in the boat.

86
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
The first day they would take a hike,

87
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and it was, click, click, click, click. Five minutes later they were back in the boat.

88
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We're done. You know, I've seen that island.

89
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
After this,

90
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
they were crawling all over. They would snorkel

91
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:08,000
for as long as we would let them snorkel.

92
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:12,000
What had happened was that they realized that there were organisms

93
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
out there that had already solved the problems

94
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that they had spent their careers trying to solve.

95
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Learning about the natural world is one thing;

96
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:26,000
learning from the natural world -- that's the switch.

97
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That's the profound switch.

98
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
What they realized was that the answers to their questions are everywhere;

99
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
they just needed to change the lenses with which they saw the world.

100
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
3.8 billion years of field-testing.

101
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
10 to 30 -- Craig Venter will probably tell you;

102
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I think there's a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions.

103
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The important thing for me is that these are solutions solved in context.

104
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And the context is the Earth --

105
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the same context that we're trying to solve our problems in.

106
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So it's the conscious emulation of life's genius.

107
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It's not slavishly mimicking --

108
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
although Al is trying to get the hairdo going --

109
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it's not a slavish mimicry; it's taking the design principles,

110
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the genius of the natural world, and learning something from it.

111
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Now, in a group with so many IT people, I do have to mention what

112
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I'm not going to talk about, and that is that your field

113
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is one that has learned an enormous amount from living things,

114
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:36,000
on the software side. So there's computers that protect themselves,

115
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
like an immune system, and we're learning from gene regulation

116
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and biological development. And we're learning from neural nets,

117
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
genetic algorithms, evolutionary computing.

118
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:52,000
That's on the software side. But what's interesting to me

119
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is that we haven't looked at this, as much. I mean, these machines

120
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
are really not very high tech in my estimation

121
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:05,000
in the sense that there's dozens and dozens of carcinogens

122
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:08,000
in the water in Silicon Valley.

123
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So the hardware

124
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is not at all up to snuff in terms of what life would call a success.

125
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So what can we learn about making -- not just computers, but everything?

126
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The plane you came in, cars, the seats that you're sitting on.

127
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:32,000
How do we redesign the world that we make, the human-made world?

128
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
More importantly, what should we ask in the next 10 years?

129
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And there's a lot of cool technologies out there that life has.

130
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
What's the syllabus?

131
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Three questions, for me, are key.

132
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
How does life make things?

133
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:5,000
This is the opposite; this is how we make things.

134
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's called heat, beat and treat --

135
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that's what material scientists call it.

136
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And it's carving things down from the top, with 96 percent waste left over

137
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and only 4 percent product. You heat it up; you beat it with high pressures;

138
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you use chemicals. OK. Heat, beat and treat.

139
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Life can't afford to do that. How does life make things?

140
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
How does life make the most of things?

141
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That's a geranium pollen.

142
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And its shape is what gives it the function of being able

143
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to tumble through air so easily. Look at that shape.

144
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Life adds information to matter.

145
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
In other words: structure.

146
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It gives it information. By adding information to matter,

147
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:44,000
it gives it a function that's different than without that structure.

148
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And thirdly, how does life make things disappear into systems?

149
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Because life doesn't really deal in things;

150
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
there are no things in the natural world divorced

151
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
from their systems.

152
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Really quick syllabus.

153
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:09,000
As I'm reading more and more now, and following the story,

154
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:13,000
there are some amazing things coming up in the biological sciences.

155
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And at the same time, I'm listening to a lot of businesses

156
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and finding what their sort of grand challenges are.

157
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The two groups are not talking to each other.

158
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
At all.

159
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:29,000
What in the world of biology might be helpful at this juncture,

160
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to get us through this sort of evolutionary knothole that we're in?

161
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
I'm going to try to go through 12, really quickly.

162
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
One that's exciting to me is self-assembly.

163
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Now, you've heard about this in terms of nanotechnology.

164
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Back to that shell: the shell is a self-assembling material.

165
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:52,000
On the lower left there is a picture of mother of pearl

166
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:56,000
forming out of seawater. It's a layered structure that's mineral

167
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and then polymer, and it makes it very, very tough.

168
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's twice as tough as our high-tech ceramics.

169
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But what's really interesting: unlike our ceramics that are in kilns,

170
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
it happens in seawater. It happens near, in and near, the organism's body.

171
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
This is Sandia National Labs.

172
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:18,000
A guy named Jeff Brinker

173
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:22,000
has found a way to have a self-assembling coding process.

174
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Imagine being able to make ceramics at room temperature

175
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
by simply dipping something into a liquid,

176
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:33,000
lifting it out of the liquid, and having evaporation

177
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
force the molecules in the liquid together,

178
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
so that they jigsaw together

179
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in the same way as this crystallization works.

180
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Imagine making all of our hard materials that way.

181
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Imagine spraying the precursors to a PV cell, to a solar cell,

182
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
onto a roof, and having it self-assemble into a layered structure that harvests light.

183
0:11:57,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Here's an interesting one for the IT world:

184
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:06,000
bio-silicon. This is a diatom, which is made of silicates.

185
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And so silicon, which we make right now --

186
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:14,000
it's part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips --

187
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:18,000
this is a bio-mineralization process that's now being mimicked.

188
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:22,000
This is at UC Santa Barbara. Look at these diatoms.

189
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:25,000
This is from Ernst Haeckel's work.

190
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Imagine being able to -- and, again, it's a templated process,

191
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and it solidifies out of a liquid process -- imagine being able to have that

192
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:38,000
sort of structure coming out at room temperature.

193
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Imagine being able to make perfect lenses.

194
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:46,000
On the left, this is a brittle star; it's covered with lenses

195
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that the people at Lucent Technologies have found

196
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
have no distortion whatsoever.

197
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It's one of the most distortion-free lenses we know of.

198
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And there's many of them, all over its entire body.

199
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:,000
What's interesting, again, is that it self-assembles.

200
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:04,000
A woman named Joanna Aizenberg, at Lucent,

201
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is now learning to do this in a low-temperature process to create

202
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:12,000
these sort of lenses. She's also looking at fiber optics.

203
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
That's a sea sponge that has a fiber optic.

204
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Down at the very base of it, there's fiber optics

205
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that work better than ours, actually, to move light,

206
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:27,000
but you can tie them in a knot; they're incredibly flexible.

207
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Here's another big idea: CO2 as a feedstock.

208
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
A guy named Geoff Coates, at Cornell, said to himself,

209
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:38,000
you know, plants do not see CO2 as the biggest poison of our time.

210
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
We see it that way. Plants are busy making long chains

211
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:47,000
of starches and glucose, right, out of CO2. He's found a way --

212
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
he's found a catalyst -- and he's found a way to take CO2

213
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and make it into polycarbonates. Biodegradable plastics

214
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:56,000
out of CO2 -- how plant-like.

215
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Solar transformations: the most exciting one.

216
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
There are people who are mimicking the energy-harvesting device

217
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:07,000
inside of purple bacterium, the people at ASU. Even more interesting,

218
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
lately, in the last couple of weeks, people have seen

219
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that there's an enzyme called hydrogenase that's able to evolve

220
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:19,000
hydrogen from proton and electrons, and is able to take hydrogen up --

221
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:24,000
basically what's happening in a fuel cell, in the anode of a fuel cell

222
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and in a reversible fuel cell.

223
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
In our fuel cells, we do it with platinum;

224
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
life does it with a very, very common iron.

225
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And a team has now just been able to mimic

226
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that hydrogen-juggling hydrogenase.

227
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
That's very exciting for fuel cells --

228
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to be able to do that without platinum.

229
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Power of shape: here's a whale. We've seen that the fins of this whale

230
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
have tubercles on them. And those little bumps

231
0:14:55,000 --> 0:15:,000
actually increase efficiency in, for instance,

232
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent.

233
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Which is an amazing fossil fuel savings,

234
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:12,000
if we were to just put that on the edge of a wing.

235
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Color without pigments: this peacock is creating color with shape.

236
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Light comes through, it bounces back off the layers;

237
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:22,000
it's called thin-film interference. Imagine being able

238
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to self-assemble products with the last few layers

239
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:29,000
playing with light to create color.

240
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Imagine being able to create a shape on the outside of a surface,

241
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:39,000
so that it's self-cleaning with just water. That's what a leaf does.

242
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
See that up-close picture?

243
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:44,000
That's a ball of water, and those are dirt particles.

244
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And that's an up-close picture of a lotus leaf.

245
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:52,000
There's a company making a product called Lotusan, which mimics --

246
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:56,000
when the building facade paint dries, it mimics the bumps

247
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:01,000
in a self-cleaning leaf, and rainwater cleans the building.

248
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Water is going to be our big, grand challenge:

249
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
quenching thirst.

250
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Here are two organisms that pull water.

251
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:16,000
The one on the left is the Namibian beetle pulling water out of fog.

252
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
The one on the right is a pill bug -- pulls water out of air,

253
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:22,000
does not drink fresh water.

254
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Pulling water out of Monterey fog and out of the sweaty air in Atlanta,

255
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:33,000
before it gets into a building, are key technologies.

256
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Separation technologies are going to be extremely important.

257
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:41,000
What if we were to say, no more hard rock mining?

258
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:47,000
What if we were to separate out metals from waste streams,

259
0:16:47,000 --> 0:16:51,000
small amounts of metals in water? That's what microbes do;

260
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:53,000
they chelate metals out of water.

261
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:56,000
There's a company here in San Francisco called MR3

262
0:16:56,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that is embedding mimics of the microbes' molecules on filters

263
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:05,000
to mine waste streams.

264
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Green chemistry is chemistry in water.

265
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:11,000
We do chemistry in organic solvents.

266
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:15,000
This is a picture of the spinnerets coming out of a spider

267
0:17:15,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and the silk being formed from a spider. Isn't that beautiful?

268
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Green chemistry is replacing our industrial chemistry with nature's recipe book.

269
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
It's not easy, because life uses

270
0:17:31,000 --> 0:17:35,000
only a subset of the elements in the periodic table.

271
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And we use all of them, even the toxic ones.

272
0:17:39,000 --> 0:17:44,000
To figure out the elegant recipes that would take the small subset

273
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:5,000
of the periodic table, and create miracle materials like that cell,

274
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:52,000
is the task of green chemistry.

275
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Timed degradation: packaging that is good

276
0:17:56,000 --> 0:18:,000
until you don't want it to be good anymore, and dissolves on cue.

277
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:03,000
That's a mussel you can find in the waters out here,

278
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and the threads holding it to a rock are timed; at exactly two years,

279
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:09,000
they begin to dissolve.

280
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Healing: this is a good one.

281
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:15,000
That little guy over there is a tardigrade.

282
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:21,000
There is a problem with vaccines around the world

283
0:18:21,000 --> 0:18:24,000
not getting to patients. And the reason is

284
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:28,000
that the refrigeration somehow gets broken;

285
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:3,000
what's called the "cold chain" gets broken.

286
0:18:3,000 --> 0:18:33,000
A guy named Bruce Rosner looked at the tardigrade --

287
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
which dries out completely, and yet stays alive for months

288
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:42,000
and months and months, and is able to regenerate itself.

289
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:45,000
And he found a way to dry out vaccines --

290
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:49,000
encase them in the same sort of sugar capsules

291
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:52,000
as the tardigrade has within its cells --

292
0:18:52,000 --> 0:18:57,000
meaning that vaccines no longer need to be refrigerated.

293
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:01,000
They can be put in a glove compartment, OK.

294
0:19:01,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Learning from organisms. This is a session about water --

295
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:09,000
learning about organisms that can do without water,

296
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:16,000
in order to create a vaccine that lasts and lasts and lasts without refrigeration.

297
0:19:16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
I'm not going to get to 12.

298
0:19:19,000 --> 0:19:23,000
But what I am going to do is tell you that the most important thing,

299
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:28,000
besides all of these adaptations, is the fact that these organisms

300
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:33,000
have figured out a way to do the amazing things they do

301
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
while taking care of the place

302
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:41,000
that's going to take care of their offspring.

303
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:44,000
When they're involved in foreplay,

304
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:47,000
they're thinking about something very, very important --

305
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and that's having their genetic material

306
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:56,000
remain, 10,000 generations from now.

307
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:58,000
And that means finding a way to do what they do

308
0:19:58,000 --> 0:20:02,000
without destroying the place that'll take care of their offspring.

309
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:05,000
That's the biggest design challenge.

310
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Luckily, there are millions and millions of geniuses

311
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:14,000
willing to gift us with their best ideas.

312
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Good luck having a conversation with them.

313
0:20:17,000 --> 0:20:18,000
Thank you.

314
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:32,000
(Applause)

315
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:36,000
Chris Anderson: Talk about foreplay, I -- we need to get to 12, but really quickly.

316
0:20:36,000 --> 0:20:37,000
Janine Benyus: Oh really?

317
0:20:37,000 --> 0:20:4,000
CA: Yeah. Just like, you know, like the 10-second version

318
0:20:4,000 --> 0:20:43,000
of 10, 11 and 12. Because we just -- your slides are so gorgeous,

319
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:45,000
and the ideas are so big, I can't stand to let you go down

320
0:20:45,000 --> 0:20:47,000
without seeing 10, 11 and 12.

321
0:20:47,000 --> 0:20:51,000
JB: OK, put this -- OK, I'll just hold this thing. OK, great.

322
0:20:51,000 --> 0:20:54,000
OK, so that's the healing one.

323
0:20:54,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Sensing and responding: feedback is a huge thing.

324
0:20:57,000 --> 0:21:01,000
This is a locust. There can be 80 million of them in a square kilometer,

325
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:04,000
and yet they don't collide with one another.

326
0:21:04,000 --> 0:21:09,000
And yet we have 3.6 million car collisions a year.

327
0:21:09,000 --> 0:21:11,000
(Laughter)

328
0:21:11,000 --> 0:21:15,000
Right. There's a person at Newcastle

329
0:21:15,000 --> 0:21:18,000
who has figured out that it's a very large neuron.

330
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:21,000
And she's actually figuring out how to make

331
0:21:21,000 --> 0:21:23,000
a collision-avoidance circuitry

332
0:21:23,000 --> 0:21:27,000
based on this very large neuron in the locust.

333
0:21:27,000 --> 0:21:29,000
This is a huge and important one, number 11.

334
0:21:29,000 --> 0:21:31,000
And that's the growing fertility.

335
0:21:31,000 --> 0:21:35,000
That means, you know, net fertility farming.

336
0:21:35,000 --> 0:21:39,000
We should be growing fertility. And, oh yes -- we get food, too.

337
0:21:39,000 --> 0:21:44,000
Because we have to grow the capacity of this planet

338
0:21:44,000 --> 0:21:47,000
to create more and more opportunities for life.

339
0:21:47,000 --> 0:21:49,000
And really, that's what other organisms do as well.

340
0:21:49,000 --> 0:21:52,000
In ensemble, that's what whole ecosystems do:

341
0:21:52,000 --> 0:21:55,000
they create more and more opportunities for life.

342
0:21:55,000 --> 0:21:58,000
Our farming has done the opposite.

343
0:21:58,000 --> 0:22:02,000
So, farming based on how a prairie builds soil,

344
0:22:02,000 --> 0:22:06,000
ranching based on how a native ungulate herd

345
0:22:06,000 --> 0:22:08,000
actually increases the health of the range,

346
0:22:08,000 --> 0:22:13,000
even wastewater treatment based on how a marsh

347
0:22:13,000 --> 0:22:15,000
not only cleans the water,

348
0:22:15,000 --> 0:22:19,000
but creates incredibly sparkling productivity.

349
0:22:19,000 --> 0:22:23,000
This is the simple design brief. I mean, it looks simple

350
0:22:23,000 --> 0:22:28,000
because the system, over 3.8 billion years, has worked this out.

351
0:22:28,000 --> 0:22:33,000
That is, those organisms that have not been able to figure out

352
0:22:33,000 --> 0:22:37,000
how to enhance or sweeten their places,

353
0:22:37,000 --> 0:22:4,000
are not around to tell us about it.

354
0:22:4,000 --> 0:22:43,000
That's the twelfth one.

355
0:22:43,000 --> 0:22:47,000
Life -- and this is the secret trick; this is the magic trick --

356
0:22:47,000 --> 0:22:51,000
life creates conditions conducive to life.

357
0:22:51,000 --> 0:22:55,000
It builds soil; it cleans air; it cleans water;

358
0:22:55,000 --> 0:22:58,000
it mixes the cocktail of gases that you and I need to live.

359
0:22:58,000 --> 0:23:04,000
And it does that in the middle of having great foreplay

360
0:23:04,000 --> 0:23:1,000
and meeting their needs. So it's not mutually exclusive.

361
0:23:1,000 --> 0:23:13,000
We have to find a way to meet our needs,

362
0:23:13,000 --> 0:23:19,000
while making of this place an Eden.

363
0:23:19,000 --> 0:23:2,000
CA: Janine, thank you so much.

364
0:23:2,000 --> 0:23:21,000
(Applause)

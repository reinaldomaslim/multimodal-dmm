1
0:00:13.285,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Picture your dream vacation.

2
0:00:16.277,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Maybe you're dying to go to Rio for Carnival.

3
0:00:19.754,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Or you really just want to hang out on a Mexican beach.

4
0:00:23.481,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Or maybe you're going to join me in New Orleans for Jazz Fest.

5
0:00:28.107,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, I know it's less pleasant,

6
0:00:31.061,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but picture, for a moment,

7
0:00:32.635,000 --> 0:00:34,000
one of the most violent places on earth.

8
0:00:37.53,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Did anyone think of the same place?

9
0:00:41.07,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Brazil is the most violent country in the world today.

10
0:00:43.746,000 --> 0:00:46,000
More people have been dying there over the last three years

11
0:00:46.799,000 --> 0:00:47,000
than in Syria.

12
0:00:48.22,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And in Mexico, more people have died over the last 15 years

13
0:00:52.34,000 --> 0:00:54,000
than in Iraq or Afghanistan.

14
0:00:55.256,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In New Orleans, more people per capita are dying

15
0:00:59.827,000 --> 0:01:,000
than in war-torn Somalia.

16
0:01:02.982,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The fact is, war only results

17
0:01:06.217,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in about 18 percent of violent deaths worldwide.

18
0:01:10.765,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Today, you are more likely to die violently

19
0:01:13.591,000 --> 0:01:16,000
if you live in a middle-income democracy

20
0:01:16.701,000 --> 0:01:18,000
with high levels of income inequality

21
0:01:19.091,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and serious political polarization.

22
0:01:23.109,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The United States has four of the 50 most violent cities on earth.

23
0:01:28.874,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, this is a fundamental alteration in the nature of violence, historically.

24
0:01:33.798,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But it's also an opportunity.

25
0:01:35.847,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Because while few people can do much to end war,

26
0:01:39.503,000 --> 0:01:42,000
violence in our democracies is our problem.

27
0:01:43.809,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And while regular voters are a big part of that problem,

28
0:01:47.369,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we're also key to the solution.

29
0:01:50.263,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, I work at a think tank,

30
0:01:51.629,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,

31
0:01:53.867,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where I advise governments on what to do about violence,

32
0:01:56.558,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but the dirty secret is,

33
0:01:58.419,000 --> 0:02:02,000
most policymakers haven't figured out these changes to violence today.

34
0:02:02.578,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They still believe that the worst violence happens in countries at war

35
0:02:06.793,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or places that are too poor, too weak,

36
0:02:09.452,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to fight violence and control crime.

37
0:02:11.947,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And that had been my assumption too.

38
0:02:14.27,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But if you look at a map of the most violent places on earth,

39
0:02:17.779,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you see something strange.

40
0:02:20.427,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Some of them are at war,

41
0:02:22.837,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and a few are truly failed states.

42
0:02:25.689,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The violence in these places is horrific,

43
0:02:27.698,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but they happen to have small populations,

44
0:02:30.018,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so it actually affects few people.

45
0:02:32.174,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Then there's South Africa, Brazil, Venezuela.

46
0:02:35.237,000 --> 0:02:36,000
These places are not poor.

47
0:02:37.674,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Maybe they're weak.

48
0:02:39.678,000 --> 0:02:41,000
My research assistant and I mapped places

49
0:02:42.123,000 --> 0:02:44,000
based on how well they delivered on World Bank projects

50
0:02:45.083,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and whether they could get public services to their people,

51
0:02:48.256,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and if you did well on both of those,

52
0:02:50.376,000 --> 0:02:53,000
if you could get sanitation and electricity to your people

53
0:02:54.113,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and deliver vaccines,

54
0:02:55.51,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you were in the upper right-hand quadrant.

55
0:02:57.729,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And then we overlaid that

56
0:02:59.452,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with a map of places where journalists were being murdered.

57
0:03:02.933,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Some were happening in weak states,

58
0:03:04.775,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but an awful lot of journalists were being killed

59
0:03:07.306,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in places plenty capable of protecting them.

60
0:03:10.834,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I traveled to every settled continent on earth,

61
0:03:13.706,000 --> 0:03:17,000
comparing places that had faced massive violence and recovered

62
0:03:17.77,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and those that hadn't,

63
0:03:19.096,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and I kept seeing the same pattern.

64
0:03:21.393,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I came to call it "privilege violence,"

65
0:03:23.705,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because it happened in highly unequal democracies,

66
0:03:27.686,000 --> 0:03:28,000
where a small group of people

67
0:03:29.156,000 --> 0:03:32,000
wanted to hold on to inordinate power and privilege.

68
0:03:32.917,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And if they didn't think they could get those policies past the voters,

69
0:03:36.569,000 --> 0:03:39,000
sometimes they would turn to violent groups for help.

70
0:03:40.225,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Drug cartels would finance their campaigns.

71
0:03:43.296,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Organized criminals would help them get out the vote.

72
0:03:46.003,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Gangs would suppress the vote.

73
0:03:47.457,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And in exchange, they'd be given free reign,

74
0:03:50.448,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and violence would grow.

75
0:03:52.712,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Take Venezuela.

76
0:03:54.511,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's the most violent country in the world today,

77
0:03:56.909,000 --> 0:03:57,000
if you look at deaths per capita.

78
0:03:58.921,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Twenty years ago, the current regime gained power in legitimate elections,

79
0:04:02.875,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but they didn't want to risk losing it,

80
0:04:05.701,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and so they turned to gangs, called "colectivos," for help.

81
0:04:10.296,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The gangs were told to get out the vote for the government

82
0:04:13.749,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and force people to vote for the regime in some neighborhoods

83
0:04:16.902,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and keep opposition voters away from the polls in others,

84
0:04:19.601,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and, in exchange, they'd be given control.

85
0:04:22.408,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But if criminals have control,

86
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
then police and courts can't do their jobs.

87
0:04:27.574,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So the second stage in privilege violence

88
0:04:30.888,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is that courts and police are weakened,

89
0:04:33.246,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and politicians politicize budgets,

90
0:04:35.968,000 --> 0:04:36,000
hiring, firing,

91
0:04:37.428,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so that they and the violent groups that they collude with stay out of jail.

92
0:04:43.237,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, pretty soon, good cops leave,

93
0:04:45.905,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and many that remain become brutal.

94
0:04:48.836,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They start off, usually, with rough justice.

95
0:04:52.2,000 --> 0:04:55,000
They kill a drug dealer that they think would be let off by the corrupt courts.

96
0:04:56.52,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But over time, the worst of them realize that there will be no repercussions

97
0:05:01.767,000 --> 0:05:03,000
from the politicians they're in bed with,

98
0:05:04.437,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and they go into business for themselves.

99
0:05:07.443,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In Venezuela, nearly one in three murders is by the security services.

100
0:05:13.377,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now, the poor are hit hardest by violence all over the world,

101
0:05:17.302,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but they're hardly going to turn to such predatory cops for help.

102
0:05:20.493,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So they tend to form vigilante groups.

103
0:05:23.596,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But arm a bunch of 18-year-old boys,

104
0:05:25.843,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and pretty soon, they devolve into gangs over time.

105
0:05:29.624,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Other gangs come in, mafias come in,

106
0:05:31.795,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and they offer to protect people from the other criminals

107
0:05:35.747,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and from the police.

108
0:05:38.281,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Unlike the state,

109
0:05:39.544,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the criminals often try to buy legitimacy.

110
0:05:41.79,000 --> 0:05:43,000
They give charity. They solve disputes.

111
0:05:44.227,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Sometimes, they even build subsidized housing.

112
0:05:48.338,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The last stage of privilege violence happens when regular people

113
0:05:52.87,000 --> 0:05:54,000
start committing a significant portion of the murder.

114
0:05:56.753,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Bar fights and neighborhood arguments turn deadly

115
0:05:59.912,000 --> 0:06:01,000
when violence has become normal

116
0:06:02.12,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and repercussions have evaporated.

117
0:06:05.071,000 --> 0:06:07,000
To outsiders, the culture looks depraved,

118
0:06:08.056,000 --> 0:06:1,000
as if something is deeply wrong with those people.

119
0:06:11.983,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But any country can become this violent

120
0:06:16.769,000 --> 0:06:19,000
when the government is, by turns, absent and predatory.

121
0:06:21.415,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Actually, that's not quite true --

122
0:06:23.143,000 --> 0:06:26,000
it takes one more step for this level of violence to reign.

123
0:06:27.047,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It takes mainstream society

124
0:06:30.025,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to ignore the problem.

125
0:06:31.71,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You'd think that would be impossible,

126
0:06:33.543,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that violence at this level would be unbearable,

127
0:06:35.83,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but it's actually quite bearable to people like you and me.

128
0:06:39.718,000 --> 0:06:41,000
That's because, in every society in the world,

129
0:06:42.395,000 --> 0:06:44,000
even the most violent,

130
0:06:44.544,000 --> 0:06:46,000
violence is highly concentrated.

131
0:06:47.202,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It happens to people on the wrong side of town,

132
0:06:49.957,000 --> 0:06:51,000
people who are poor, often darker,

133
0:06:52.38,000 --> 0:06:54,000
often from groups that are marginalized,

134
0:06:54.686,000 --> 0:06:57,000
groups that mainstream society can separate ourselves from.

135
0:06:59.27,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Violence is so concentrated

136
0:07:01.495,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that we're shocked when the pattern deviates.

137
0:07:05.129,000 --> 0:07:08,000
In Washington, DC, in 2001,

138
0:07:08.701,000 --> 0:07:1,000
a young white college-educated intern

139
0:07:11.596,000 --> 0:07:14,000
went missing after a hike in Northwest DC,

140
0:07:14.717,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and her case was in the papers nearly every day.

141
0:07:20.058,000 --> 0:07:22,000
On the other side of town,

142
0:07:22.273,000 --> 0:07:24,000
a black man had been killed every other day that year.

143
0:07:26.28,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Most of those cases never made the papers even once.

144
0:07:30.353,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Middle class society buys their way out of violence.

145
0:07:33.337,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We live in better neighborhoods.

146
0:07:35.232,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Some people buy private security.

147
0:07:37.443,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And we also tell ourselves a story.

148
0:07:40.033,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We tell ourselves that most of the people who are killed

149
0:07:43.883,000 --> 0:07:45,000
are probably involved in crime themselves.

150
0:07:47.371,000 --> 0:07:51,000
By believing that somehow some people deserve to be murdered,

151
0:07:52.313,000 --> 0:07:54,000
otherwise good people allow ourselves to live

152
0:07:56.066,000 --> 0:07:59,000
in places where life chances are so deeply skewed.

153
0:08:01.46,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We allow ourselves.

154
0:08:03.996,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Because, after all, what else can you do?

155
0:08:07.54,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Well, it turns out, quite a lot.

156
0:08:10.049,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Because violence today is not largely the result of war

157
0:08:13.521,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but is because of rotten politics in our democracies,

158
0:08:16.849,000 --> 0:08:19,000
regular voters are the greatest force for change.

159
0:08:20.362,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Consider the transformation of Bogotá.

160
0:08:23.402,000 --> 0:08:25,000
In 1994, Colombia's incoming president

161
0:08:26.331,000 --> 0:08:29,000
was caught taking millions of dollars in campaign contributions

162
0:08:30.351,000 --> 0:08:32,000
from the Cali drug cartel,

163
0:08:32.676,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and the capital was overrun with gangs and paramilitary groups.

164
0:08:38.832,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But fed-up voters overcame really rabid partisanship,

165
0:08:43.331,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and they delivered nearly two-thirds of the vote

166
0:08:46.108,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to an independent candidate,

167
0:08:48.292,000 --> 0:08:5,000
enough to really overcome business as usual.

168
0:08:51.688,000 --> 0:08:53,000
On Mayor Mockus's first day in office,

169
0:08:54.149,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the police barely bothered to even brief him on homicide,

170
0:08:57.387,000 --> 0:09:,000
and when he asked why, they just shrugged and said,

171
0:09:00.554,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"It's just criminals killing criminals."

172
0:09:03.523,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The corrupt city council

173
0:09:05.499,000 --> 0:09:08,000
wanted to give police even more impunity for brutality.

174
0:09:09.388,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's a really common tactic that's used worldwide

175
0:09:12.5,000 --> 0:09:15,000
when politicians want to posture as tough on crime

176
0:09:15.645,000 --> 0:09:17,000
but don't actually want to change the status quo.

177
0:09:19.126,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And research shows it backfires all over the world.

178
0:09:22.071,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If you throw a lot of low-level offenders into jails,

179
0:09:24.825,000 --> 0:09:26,000
usually already overcrowded jails,

180
0:09:27.286,000 --> 0:09:29,000
they learn from each other and they harden.

181
0:09:30.175,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They start to control the prisons, and from there, the streets.

182
0:09:34.421,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Instead, Mockus insisted that police begin investigating every death.

183
0:09:40.45,000 --> 0:09:42,000
He fought the right-wing city council,

184
0:09:42.576,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and he abandoned SWAT-style police tactics.

185
0:09:45.418,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And he fought the left-wing unions

186
0:09:47.688,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and fired thousands of predatory cops.

187
0:09:50.946,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Honest police were finally free to do their jobs.

188
0:09:55.288,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Mockus then challenged citizens.

189
0:09:56.884,000 --> 0:09:59,000
He asked the middle class to stop opting out of their city,

190
0:10:00.376,000 --> 0:10:01,000
to follow traffic laws

191
0:10:01.972,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and otherwise behave as if they shared the same community of fate.

192
0:10:06.603,000 --> 0:10:09,000
He asked the poor to uphold social norms against violence,

193
0:10:09.731,000 --> 0:10:11,000
often at immense personal risk.

194
0:10:12.433,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And he asked the wealthy to give 10 percent more in taxes, voluntarily.

195
0:10:17.584,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Sixty-three thousand people did.

196
0:10:20.592,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And at the end of the decade that spanned Mayor Mockus's two terms in office,

197
0:10:24.632,000 --> 0:10:26,000
homicide in Bogotá was down 70 percent.

198
0:10:27.666,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Audience: Whoo!

199
0:10:28.84,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

200
0:10:33.894,000 --> 0:10:35,000
People in places with the most violence,

201
0:10:36.419,000 --> 0:10:38,000
whether it's Colombia or the United States,

202
0:10:39.193,000 --> 0:10:4,000
can make the biggest difference.

203
0:10:41.427,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The most important thing we can do is abandon the notion

204
0:10:44.705,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that some lives are just worth less than others,

205
0:10:48.666,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that someone deserves to be raped or murdered,

206
0:10:50.944,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because after all, they did something,

207
0:10:52.995,000 --> 0:10:55,000
they stole or they did something to land themselves in prison

208
0:10:56.106,000 --> 0:10:57,000
where that kind of thing happens.

209
0:10:58.836,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This devaluing of human life,

210
0:11:01.884,000 --> 0:11:04,000
a devaluing we barely admit even to ourselves,

211
0:11:05.655,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is what allows the whole downward spiral to begin.

212
0:11:08.932,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's what allows a bullet shot in a gang war in Rio

213
0:11:12.368,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to lodge in the head of a two-year-old girl

214
0:11:14.995,000 --> 0:11:15,000
climbing on a jungle gym nearby.

215
0:11:18.017,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And it's what allows a SWAT team hunting for a meth dealer in Georgia

216
0:11:23.358,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to throw a flash bang grenade into the crib of a little boy,

217
0:11:29.121,000 --> 0:11:31,000
exploding near his face and maiming him for life.

218
0:11:33.271,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The fact is, most violence everywhere

219
0:11:35.747,000 --> 0:11:37,000
happens to people on the wrong side of town

220
0:11:37.963,000 --> 0:11:38,000
at the wrong time,

221
0:11:39.604,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and some of those people are from communities

222
0:11:41.755,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that we consider quite different.

223
0:11:43.859,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Some of them are people who have done horrible things.

224
0:11:48.298,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But reducing violence begins with privileging every human life,

225
0:11:53.988,000 --> 0:11:54,000
both because it's right

226
0:11:55.424,000 --> 0:12:,000
and because only by prizing each life as worthy of at least due process,

227
0:12:00.954,000 --> 0:12:05,000
can we create societies in which the lives of innocents are safe.

228
0:12:07.366,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Second, recognize that today,

229
0:12:09.66,000 --> 0:12:11,000
inequality within our countries

230
0:12:12.136,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is a vastly greater cause of violence than war between countries.

231
0:12:16.515,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Now, inequality leads to violence for a whole host of reasons,

232
0:12:19.673,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but one of them is that it lets us separate ourselves

233
0:12:22.881,000 --> 0:12:24,000
from what's happening on the other side of town.

234
0:12:26.075,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Those of us who are middle-class or wealthy,

235
0:12:28.155,000 --> 0:12:3,000
who are benefiting from these systems,

236
0:12:30.306,000 --> 0:12:33,000
have to change them at immense cost to ourselves.

237
0:12:34.292,000 --> 0:12:35,000
We have to pay enough taxes

238
0:12:35.992,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and then demand that our governments put good teachers in other kids' schools

239
0:12:40.911,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and well-trained police to protect other peoples' neighborhoods.

240
0:12:46.015,000 --> 0:12:48,000
But, of course, that's not going to do any good

241
0:12:48.23,000 --> 0:12:51,000
if the government is stealing the money or fueling the violence,

242
0:12:51.389,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and so we also need better politicians with better incentives.

243
0:12:55.305,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The fact is, we actually know a lot about what it takes to reduce violence.

244
0:12:59.21,000 --> 0:13:01,000
It's policies like putting more cops

245
0:13:01.488,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in the few places where most violence occurs.

246
0:13:05.082,000 --> 0:13:08,000
But they don't fit easily into the boxes of the Left or the Right,

247
0:13:08.355,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and so you need really honest politicians

248
0:13:12.197,000 --> 0:13:15,000
who are willing to buck knee-jerk partisanship

249
0:13:15.223,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and implement solutions.

250
0:13:16.936,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And if we want good politicians to run,

251
0:13:19.917,000 --> 0:13:22,000
we need to start respecting politicians.

252
0:13:25.4,000 --> 0:13:28,000
There's also a lot we can do to fight privilege violence in other countries.

253
0:13:29.076,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The most violent regimes tend to be fueled by drugs,

254
0:13:31.632,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and then they launder the profits through financial systems

255
0:13:34.577,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in New York and London,

256
0:13:35.998,000 --> 0:13:36,000
through real-estate transactions,

257
0:13:37.728,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and through high-end resorts.

258
0:13:40.444,000 --> 0:13:41,000
If you use drugs,

259
0:13:42.608,000 --> 0:13:44,000
know your supply chain top to bottom,

260
0:13:45.38,000 --> 0:13:48,000
or admit the amount of pain you're willing to cause others

261
0:13:48.424,000 --> 0:13:49,000
for your own pleasure.

262
0:13:51.075,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Meanwhile, I would love to see one of those tourist sites

263
0:13:54.349,000 --> 0:13:56,000
team up with investigative journalists

264
0:13:56.374,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and create a little tiny icon --

265
0:13:58.014,000 --> 0:14:01,000
right next to the one for free WiFi and if a place has a swimming pool,

266
0:14:01.835,000 --> 0:14:02,000
there could be a little tiny gun

267
0:14:03.423,000 --> 0:14:05,000
for "likely criminal money-laundering front."

268
0:14:06.106,000 --> 0:14:07,000
(Laughter)

269
0:14:07.953,000 --> 0:14:11,000
(Applause)

270
0:14:12.041,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But until then,

271
0:14:13.872,000 --> 0:14:16,000
if you're booking a place in a dangerous country,

272
0:14:17.096,000 --> 0:14:19,000
whether that's Jamaica or New Orleans,

273
0:14:19.446,000 --> 0:14:2,000
do a little web research,

274
0:14:20.717,000 --> 0:14:21,000
see if you can see any criminal ties.

275
0:14:22.599,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And, to make that easier,

276
0:14:23.822,000 --> 0:14:24,000
support legislation

277
0:14:25.406,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that makes our financial systems more transparent --

278
0:14:28.443,000 --> 0:14:3,000
things like banning anonymous company ownership.

279
0:14:32.45,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Now, this all probably sounds pretty quixotic,

280
0:14:34.953,000 --> 0:14:35,000
kind of like recycling your cans,

281
0:14:36.832,000 --> 0:14:39,000
just a tiny drop in the ocean of a gigantic problem,

282
0:14:40.521,000 --> 0:14:41,000
but that's actually a misconception.

283
0:14:43.219,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Homicide has been falling for centuries.

284
0:14:45.822,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Battle deaths have been dropping for decades.

285
0:14:48.649,000 --> 0:14:5,000
In places where people have demanded change,

286
0:14:51.275,000 --> 0:14:54,000
violent death has fallen, from Colombia to New York City,

287
0:14:55.174,000 --> 0:14:58,000
where homicide is down 85 percent since 1990.

288
0:15:00.314,000 --> 0:15:02,000
The fact is, violence will always be with us,

289
0:15:03.069,000 --> 0:15:04,000
but it's not a constant.

290
0:15:05.235,000 --> 0:15:08,000
It has been falling for centuries, and it could fall further faster.

291
0:15:09.18,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Could it drop by 25 percent in the next quarter century, a third?

292
0:15:13.275,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Many of us actually think it could.

293
0:15:16.116,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I think of all the kids who'd grow up with their dads,

294
0:15:20.663,000 --> 0:15:22,000
all the families that get their sisters back,

295
0:15:23.555,000 --> 0:15:24,000
their brothers.

296
0:15:26.171,000 --> 0:15:28,000
All it needs is one small push.

297
0:15:29.797,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It needs us to care.

298
0:15:33.035,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you.

299
0:15:34.21,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Applause)

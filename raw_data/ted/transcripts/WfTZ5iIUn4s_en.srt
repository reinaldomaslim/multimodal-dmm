1
0:00:12.624,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It is said that the grass is always greener

2
0:00:16.672,000 --> 0:00:19,000
on the other side of the fence,

3
0:00:19.726,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and I believe this is true,

4
0:00:22.872,000 --> 0:00:24,000
especially when I hear President Obama

5
0:00:25.456,000 --> 0:00:27,000
often talk about the Korean education system

6
0:00:27.954,000 --> 0:00:3,000
as a benchmark of success.

7
0:00:31.465,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Well, I can tell you that,

8
0:00:33.862,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature

9
0:00:37.409,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of the Korean school system,

10
0:00:39.6,000 --> 0:00:41,000
also known as pressure cooker,

11
0:00:41.934,000 --> 0:00:46,000
not everyone can do well in that environment.

12
0:00:47.593,000 --> 0:00:49,000
While many people responded in different ways

13
0:00:50.218,000 --> 0:00:53,000
about our education system,

14
0:00:53.218,000 --> 0:00:56,000
my response to the high-pressure environment

15
0:00:56.594,000 --> 0:00:58,000
was making bows with pieces of wood

16
0:00:59.524,000 --> 0:01:01,000
found near my apartment building.

17
0:01:02.268,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Why bows?

18
0:01:04.788,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm not quite sure.

19
0:01:07.539,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure,

20
0:01:11.484,000 --> 0:01:13,000
my caveman instinct of survival

21
0:01:13.731,000 --> 0:01:17,000
has connected with the bows.

22
0:01:18.053,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If you think about it,

23
0:01:19.787,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the bow has really helped drive human survival

24
0:01:23.2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
since prehistoric times.

25
0:01:25.925,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The area within three kilometers of my home

26
0:01:29.192,000 --> 0:01:31,000
used to be a mulberry forest

27
0:01:31.375,000 --> 0:01:33,000
during the Joseon dynasty,

28
0:01:33.665,000 --> 0:01:37,000
where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves.

29
0:01:38.122,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact,

30
0:01:42.828,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the government has planted mulberry trees.

31
0:01:47.163,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The seeds from these trees

32
0:01:48.941,000 --> 0:01:5,000
also have spread by birds here and there

33
0:01:51.74,000 --> 0:01:54,000
nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway

34
0:01:55.218,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.

35
0:01:59.584,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The area near these walls,

36
0:02:02.085,000 --> 0:02:04,000
which nobody bothers to pay attention to,

37
0:02:05.065,000 --> 0:02:08,000
had been left free from major intervention,

38
0:02:08.259,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and this is where I first found my treasures.

39
0:02:14.159,000 --> 0:02:17,000
As I fell deeper into bow making,

40
0:02:17.36,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood.

41
0:02:21.571,000 --> 0:02:23,000
When I went on school field trips,

42
0:02:23.689,000 --> 0:02:26,000
family vacations, or simply on my way home

43
0:02:26.928,000 --> 0:02:28,000
from extracurricular classes,

44
0:02:29.763,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I wandered around wooded areas

45
0:02:31.862,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and gathered tree branches

46
0:02:33.601,000 --> 0:02:36,000
with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag.

47
0:02:37.572,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And they would be somethings like saws, knives,

48
0:02:41.273,000 --> 0:02:43,000
sickles and axes

49
0:02:43.519,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that I covered up with a piece of towel.

50
0:02:48.207,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I would bring the branches home,

51
0:02:50.088,000 --> 0:02:51,000
riding buses and subways,

52
0:02:52.077,000 --> 0:02:55,000
barely holding them in my hands.

53
0:02:55.466,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach.

54
0:02:59.342,000 --> 0:03:,000
Airport security.

55
0:03:00.898,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:02.978,000 --> 0:03:05,000
In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust,

57
0:03:06.697,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I would saw, trim and polish wood all night long

58
0:03:10.751,000 --> 0:03:12,000
until a bow took shape.

59
0:03:13.218,000 --> 0:03:17,000
One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece

60
0:03:17.713,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and ended up setting the place on fire.

61
0:03:22.468,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Where? The rooftop of my apartment building,

62
0:03:27.257,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a place where 96 families call home.

63
0:03:30.897,000 --> 0:03:32,000
A customer from a department store across from my building

64
0:03:33.488,000 --> 0:03:34,000
called 911,

65
0:03:34.978,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and I ran downstairs to tell my mom

66
0:03:37.025,000 --> 0:03:42,000
with half of my hair burned.

67
0:03:42.242,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I want to take this opportunity

68
0:03:44.37,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to tell my mom, in the audience today:

69
0:03:48.074,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Mom, I was really sorry,

70
0:03:50.415,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and I will be more careful with open fire from now on.

71
0:03:54.061,000 --> 0:03:56,000
My mother had to do a lot of explaining,

72
0:03:56.695,000 --> 0:03:58,000
telling people that her son did not commit

73
0:03:59.024,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a premeditated arson.

74
0:04:05.25,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I also researched extensively on bows around the world.

75
0:04:09.42,000 --> 0:04:11,000
In that process, I tried to combine

76
0:04:11.466,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the different bows from across time and places

77
0:04:13.907,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to create the most effective bow.

78
0:04:17.69,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I also worked with many different types of wood,

79
0:04:20.043,000 --> 0:04:23,000
such as maple, yew and mulberry,

80
0:04:23.231,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and did many shooting experiments

81
0:04:25.171,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in the wooded area near the urban expressway

82
0:04:27.67,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that I mentioned before.

83
0:04:30.505,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The most effective bow for me

84
0:04:32.53,000 --> 0:04:34,000
would be like this.

85
0:04:35.297,000 --> 0:04:39,000
One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness

86
0:04:39.51,000 --> 0:04:42,000
when you draw and shoot the arrow.

87
0:04:43.041,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight,

88
0:04:47.938,000 --> 0:04:5,000
which means more power.

89
0:04:51.599,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Three: Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb

90
0:04:55.911,000 --> 0:04:57,000
for maximum tension storage.

91
0:04:58.816,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And four: Horn used to store energy in compression.

92
0:05:07.055,000 --> 0:05:09,000
After fixing, breaking, redesigning,

93
0:05:10.053,000 --> 0:05:12,000
mending, bending and amending,

94
0:05:12.984,000 --> 0:05:15,000
my ideal bow began to take shape,

95
0:05:16.291,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and when it was finally done,

96
0:05:20.146,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it looked like this.

97
0:05:24.673,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I was so proud of myself

98
0:05:26.91,000 --> 0:05:32,000
for inventing a perfect bow on my own.

99
0:05:32.984,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows

100
0:05:36.416,000 --> 0:05:37,000
taken from a museum,

101
0:05:38.312,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and see how my bow resembles them.

102
0:05:43.796,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Thanks to my ancestors

103
0:05:45.362,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for robbing me of my invention. (Laughter)

104
0:05:51.542,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Through bowmaking,

105
0:05:53.394,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I came in contact with part of my heritage.

106
0:05:56.455,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Learning the information that has accumulated over time

107
0:06:00.018,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and reading the message left by my ancestors

108
0:06:02.856,000 --> 0:06:04,000
were better than any consolation therapy

109
0:06:05.455,000 --> 0:06:09,000
or piece of advice any living adults could give me.

110
0:06:10.404,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You see, I searched far and wide,

111
0:06:13.322,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but never bothered to look close and near.

112
0:06:16.798,000 --> 0:06:18,000
From this realization,

113
0:06:19.043,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I began to take interest in Korean history,

114
0:06:21.864,000 --> 0:06:24,000
which had never inspired me before.

115
0:06:25.261,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In the end, the grass is often greener

116
0:06:28.637,000 --> 0:06:29,000
on my side of the fence,

117
0:06:30.427,000 --> 0:06:33,000
although we don't realize it.

118
0:06:33.604,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, I am going to show you how my bow works.

119
0:06:38.355,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And let's see how this one works.

120
0:06:43.568,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is a bamboo bow,

121
0:06:45.705,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with 45-pound draw weights.

122
0:06:49.637,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Noise of shooting arrow)

123
0:06:51.821,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Applause)

124
0:07:00.285,000 --> 0:07:04,000
A bow may function in a simple mechanism,

125
0:07:04.694,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but in order to make a good bow,

126
0:07:07.245,000 --> 0:07:11,000
a great amount of sensitivity is required.

127
0:07:11.257,000 --> 0:07:13,000
You need to console and communicate

128
0:07:13.787,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with the wood material.

129
0:07:16.533,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Each fiber in the wood

130
0:07:18.225,000 --> 0:07:2,000
has its own reason and function for being,

131
0:07:21.051,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and only through cooperation and harmony among them

132
0:07:24.446,000 --> 0:07:27,000
comes a great bow.

133
0:07:28.043,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I may be an [odd] student

134
0:07:29.833,000 --> 0:07:31,000
with unconventional interests,

135
0:07:32.024,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but I hope I am making a contribution

136
0:07:34.966,000 --> 0:07:37,000
by sharing my story with all of you.

137
0:07:38.855,000 --> 0:07:4,000
My ideal world is a place

138
0:07:41.108,000 --> 0:07:43,000
where no one is left behind,

139
0:07:43.321,000 --> 0:07:46,000
where everyone is needed exactly where they are,

140
0:07:46.614,000 --> 0:07:49,000
like the fibers and the tendons in a bow,

141
0:07:50.21,000 --> 0:07:53,000
a place where the strong is flexible

142
0:07:53.479,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and the vulnerable is resilient.

143
0:07:57.272,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The bow resembles me,

144
0:07:58.923,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and I resemble the bow.

145
0:08:01.971,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you.

146
0:08:06.835,000 --> 0:08:08,000
No, better yet, a part of my mind

147
0:08:09.585,000 --> 0:08:11,000
has just been shot over to your mind.

148
0:08:12.424,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Did it strike you?

149
0:08:14.668,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Thank you.

150
0:08:16.208,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
There's something about caves --

2
0:00:16.56,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a shadowy opening in a limestone cliff that draws you in.

3
0:00:21.8,000 --> 0:00:24,000
As you pass through the portal between light and dark,

4
0:00:25.48,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you enter a subterranean world --

5
0:00:28.04,000 --> 0:00:33,000
a place of perpetual gloom, of earthy smells, of hushed silence.

6
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Long ago in Europe,

7
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
ancient people also entered these underground worlds.

8
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:4,000
As witness to their passage,

9
0:00:41.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
they left behind mysterious engravings and paintings,

10
0:00:44.759,000 --> 0:00:5,000
like this panel of humans, triangles and zigzags from Ojo Guareña in Spain.

11
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You now walk the same path as these early artists.

12
0:00:55.8,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And in this surreal, otherworldly place,

13
0:00:58.84,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it's almost possible to imagine

14
0:01:00.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that you hear the muffled footfall of skin boots on soft earth,

15
0:01:05.32,000 --> 0:01:08,000
or that you see the flickering of a torch around the next bend.

16
0:01:09.6,000 --> 0:01:1,000
When I'm in a cave,

17
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I often find myself wondering what drove these people to go so deep

18
0:01:17.12,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to brave dangerous and narrow passageways to leave their mark?

19
0:01:20.84,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In this video clip,

20
0:01:22.08,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that was shot half a kilometer, or about a third of a mile, underground,

21
0:01:25.48,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in the cave of Cudon in Spain,

22
0:01:27.64,000 --> 0:01:29,000
we found a series of red paintings on a ceiling

23
0:01:30.12,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in a previously unexplored section of the cave.

24
0:01:33.08,000 --> 0:01:37,000
As we crawled forward, military-style, with the ceiling getting ever lower,

25
0:01:37.76,000 --> 0:01:4,000
we finally got to a point where the ceiling was so low

26
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that my husband and project photographer, Dylan,

27
0:01:43.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
could no longer achieve focus on the ceiling with his DSLR camera.

28
0:01:47.44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So while he filmed me,

29
0:01:49.12,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I kept following the trail of red paint with a single light

30
0:01:52.44,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and a point-and-shoot camera that we kept for that type of occasion.

31
0:01:57.68,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Half a kilometer underground.

32
0:02:00.48,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Seriously.

33
0:02:01.84,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What was somebody doing down there with a torch or a stone lamp?

34
0:02:04.864,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:06.08,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I mean -- me, it makes sense, right?

36
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But you know,

37
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:12,000
this is the kind of question that I'm trying to answer with my research.

38
0:02:13.08,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I study some of the oldest art in the world.

39
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It was created by these early artists in Europe,

40
0:02:18.88,000 --> 0:02:21,000
between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago.

41
0:02:23.48,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the thing is

42
0:02:24.72,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that I'm not just studying it because it's beautiful,

43
0:02:27.24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
though some of it certainly is.

44
0:02:29.52,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But what I'm interested in is the development of the modern mind,

45
0:02:33.52,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of the evolution of creativity, of imagination, of abstract thought,

46
0:02:38.48,000 --> 0:02:4,000
about what it means to be human.

47
0:02:43.12,000 --> 0:02:46,000
While all species communicate in one way or another,

48
0:02:46.32,000 --> 0:02:49,000
only we humans have really taken it to another level.

49
0:02:49.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Our desire and ability to share and collaborate

50
0:02:52.52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
has been a huge part of our success story.

51
0:02:55.2,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Our modern world is based on a global network of information exchange

52
0:03:00.04,000 --> 0:03:04,000
made possible, in large part, by our ability to communicate --

53
0:03:04.08,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in particular, using graphic or written forms of communication.

54
0:03:08.52,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The thing is, though,

55
0:03:09.8,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that we've been building on the mental achievements

56
0:03:12.36,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of those that came before us for so long

57
0:03:15.44,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that it's easy to forget that certain abilities haven't already existed.

58
0:03:20.76,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's one of the things I find most fascinating

59
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
about studying our deep history.

60
0:03:25.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Those people didn't have the shoulders of any giants to stand on.

61
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They were the original shoulders.

62
0:03:32.36,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And while a surprising number of important inventions

63
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:36,000
come out of that distant time,

64
0:03:37.2,000 --> 0:03:41,000
what I want to talk to you about today is the invention of graphic communication.

65
0:03:42.68,000 --> 0:03:44,000
There are three main types of communication,

66
0:03:44.88,000 --> 0:03:47,000
spoken, gestural -- so things like sign language --

67
0:03:48.28,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and graphic communication.

68
0:03:50.6,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Spoken and gestural are by their very nature ephemeral.

69
0:03:54.28,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It requires close contact for a message to be sent and received.

70
0:03:58.24,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And after the moment of transmission, it's gone forever.

71
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Graphic communication, on the other hand, decouples that relationship.

72
0:04:06.2,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And with its invention, it became possible for the first time

73
0:04:10.2,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for a message to be transmitted and preserved

74
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:16,000
beyond a single moment in place and time.

75
0:04:16.8,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Europe is one of the first places

76
0:04:18.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that we start to see graphic marks regularly appearing

77
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in caves, rock shelters and even a few surviving open-air sites.

78
0:04:26.24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But this is not the Europe we know today.

79
0:04:28.8,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This was a world dominated by towering ice sheets,

80
0:04:31.8,000 --> 0:04:32,000
three to four kilometers high,

81
0:04:33.8,000 --> 0:04:36,000
with sweeping grass plains and frozen tundra.

82
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This was the Ice Age.

83
0:04:40.08,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Over the last century,

84
0:04:41.4,000 --> 0:04:46,000
more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites have been found across the continent,

85
0:04:46.72,000 --> 0:04:5,000
decorated with animals, abstract shapes and even the occasional human

86
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:54,000
like these engraved figures from Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily.

87
0:04:54.76,000 --> 0:04:56,000
They provide us with a rare glimpse

88
0:04:56.84,000 --> 0:05:,000
into the creative world and imagination of these early artists.

89
0:05:01.84,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Since their discovery,

90
0:05:03.24,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it's been the animals that have received the majority of the study

91
0:05:07.2,000 --> 0:05:09,000
like this black horse from Cullalvera in Spain,

92
0:05:10.4,000 --> 0:05:13,000
or this unusual purple bison from La Pasiega.

93
0:05:14.88,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But for me, it was the abstract shapes, what we call geometric signs,

94
0:05:20.28,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that drew me to study the art.

95
0:05:23.24,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The funny this is that at most sites

96
0:05:25.56,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the geometric signs far outnumber the animal and human images.

97
0:05:30.08,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But when I started on this back in 2007,

98
0:05:33.28,000 --> 0:05:36,000
there wasn't even a definitive list of how many shapes there were,

99
0:05:37.28,000 --> 0:05:38,000
nor was there a strong sense

100
0:05:38.64,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of whether the same ones appeared across space or time.

101
0:05:44.12,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Before I could even get started on my questions,

102
0:05:47.24,000 --> 0:05:49,000
my first step was to compile a database

103
0:05:49.36,000 --> 0:05:52,000
of all known geometric signs from all of the rock art sites.

104
0:05:53.28,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The problem was that while they were well documented at some sites,

105
0:05:56.88,000 --> 0:05:58,000
usually the ones with the very nice animals,

106
0:05:59.2,000 --> 0:06:02,000
there was also a large number of them where it was very vague --

107
0:06:02.88,000 --> 0:06:04,000
there wasn't a lot of description or detail.

108
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Some of them hadn't been visited in half a century or more.

109
0:06:08.52,000 --> 0:06:11,000
These were the ones that I targeted for my field work.

110
0:06:11.96,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Over the course of two years,

111
0:06:13.84,000 --> 0:06:18,000
my faithful husband Dylan and I each spent over 300 hours underground,

112
0:06:19.08,000 --> 0:06:22,000
hiking, crawling and wriggling around 52 sites

113
0:06:23.08,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily.

114
0:06:26.04,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And it was totally worth it.

115
0:06:27.92,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We found new, undocumented geometric signs at 75 percent of the sites we visited.

116
0:06:34.68,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is the level of accuracy I knew I was going to need

117
0:06:37.52,000 --> 0:06:4,000
if I wanted to start answering those larger questions.

118
0:06:40.72,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So let's get to those answers.

119
0:06:43.32,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Barring a handful of outliers, there are only 32 geometric signs.

120
0:06:47.96,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Only 32 signs

121
0:06:49.8,000 --> 0:06:54,000
across a 30,000-year time span and the entire continent of Europe.

122
0:06:55.72,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That is a very small number.

123
0:06:58.32,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now, if these were random doodles or decorations,

124
0:07:00.8,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we would expect to see a lot more variation,

125
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but instead what we find are the same signs

126
0:07:05.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
repeating across both space and time.

127
0:07:08.92,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Some signs start out strong, before losing popularity and vanishing,

128
0:07:12.84,000 --> 0:07:14,000
while other signs are later inventions.

129
0:07:15.2,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But 65 percent of those signs stayed in use during that entire time period --

130
0:07:20.84,000 --> 0:07:24,000
things like lines, rectangles triangles, ovals and circles

131
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
like we see here from the end of the Ice Age,

132
0:07:27.327,000 --> 0:07:3,000
at a 10,000-year-old site high in the Pyrenees Mountains.

133
0:07:31.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And while certain signs span thousands of kilometers,

134
0:07:34.52,000 --> 0:07:36,000
other signs had much more restricted distribution patterns,

135
0:07:37.52,000 --> 0:07:39,000
with some being limited to a single territory,

136
0:07:39.96,000 --> 0:07:41,000
like we see here with these divided rectangles

137
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that are only found in northern Spain,

138
0:07:44.4,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and which some researchers have speculated

139
0:07:46.48,000 --> 0:07:48,000
could be some sort of family or clan signs.

140
0:07:49.88,000 --> 0:07:5,000
On a side note,

141
0:07:51.28,000 --> 0:07:54,000
there is surprising degree of similarity in the earliest rock art

142
0:07:54.72,000 --> 0:07:58,000
found all the way from France and Spain to Indonesia and Australia.

143
0:07:59.32,000 --> 0:08:03,000
With many of the same signs appearing in such far-flung places,

144
0:08:03.64,000 --> 0:08:05,000
especially in that 30,000 to 40,000-year range,

145
0:08:06.64,000 --> 0:08:08,000
it's starting to seem increasingly likely

146
0:08:09.52,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that this invention actually traces back to a common point of origin in Africa.

147
0:08:14.4,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But that I'm afraid, is a subject for a future talk.

148
0:08:17.04,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So back to the matter at hand.

149
0:08:18.88,000 --> 0:08:21,000
There could be no doubt that these signs were meaningful to their creators,

150
0:08:22.88,000 --> 0:08:24,000
like these 25,000-year-old bas-relief sculptures

151
0:08:25.72,000 --> 0:08:27,000
from La Roque de Venasque in France.

152
0:08:28.36,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We might not know what they meant, but the people of the time certainly did.

153
0:08:33.76,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The repetition of the same signs, for so long, and at so many sites

154
0:08:39.84,000 --> 0:08:42,000
tells us that the artists were making intentional choices.

155
0:08:43.8,000 --> 0:08:45,000
If we're talking about geometric shapes,

156
0:08:46.2,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with specific, culturally recognized, agreed-upon meanings,

157
0:08:50.96,000 --> 0:08:51,000
than we could very well be looking

158
0:08:52.64,000 --> 0:08:56,000
at one of the oldest systems of graphic communication in the world.

159
0:08:57.2,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I'm not talking about writing yet.

160
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:01,000
There's just not enough characters at this point

161
0:09:01.48,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to have represented all of the words in the spoken language,

162
0:09:04.36,000 --> 0:09:06,000
something which is a requirement for a full writing system.

163
0:09:07.2,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Nor do we see the signs repeating regularly enough

164
0:09:09.6,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to suggest that they were some sort of alphabet.

165
0:09:12.28,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But what we do have are some intriguing one-offs,

166
0:09:15.12,000 --> 0:09:19,000
like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain, known as "The Inscription,"

167
0:09:19.72,000 --> 0:09:21,000
with its symmetrical markings on the left,

168
0:09:22.28,000 --> 0:09:25,000
possible stylized representations of hands in the middle,

169
0:09:25.52,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and what looks a bit like a bracket on the right.

170
0:09:29.08,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The oldest systems of graphic communication in the world --

171
0:09:31.96,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, the earliest Chinese script,

172
0:09:36.92,000 --> 0:09:39,000
all emerged between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago,

173
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with each coming into existence from an earlier protosystem

174
0:09:43.68,000 --> 0:09:46,000
made up of counting marks and pictographic representations,

175
0:09:47.24,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where the meaning and the image were the same.

176
0:09:49.64,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So a picture of a bird would really have represented that animal.

177
0:09:53.88,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's only later that we start to see these pictographs become more stylized,

178
0:09:58.64,000 --> 0:10:,000
until they almost become unrecognizable

179
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and that we also start to see more symbols being invented

180
0:10:04.04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to represent all those other missing words in language --

181
0:10:06.96,000 --> 0:10:08,000
things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives.

182
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So knowing all this,

183
0:10:11.72,000 --> 0:10:14,000
it seems highly unlikely that the geometric signs from Ice Age Europe

184
0:10:15.6,000 --> 0:10:17,000
were truly abstract written characters.

185
0:10:18.32,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Instead, what's much more likely

186
0:10:20.56,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is that these early artists were also making counting marks,

187
0:10:24.56,000 --> 0:10:28,000
maybe like this row of lines from Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily,

188
0:10:28.6,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as well as creating stylized representations

189
0:10:31.24,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of things from the world around them.

190
0:10:33.76,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Could some of the signs be weaponry or housing?

191
0:10:36.4,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Or what about celestial objects like star constellations?

192
0:10:40.56,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Or maybe even rivers, mountains, trees -- landscape features,

193
0:10:45.2,000 --> 0:10:49,000
possibly like this black penniform surrounded by strange bell-shaped signs

194
0:10:49.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
from the site of El Castillo in Spain.

195
0:10:52.2,000 --> 0:10:55,000
The term penniform means "feather-shaped" in Latin,

196
0:10:55.52,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but could this actually be a depiction of a plant or a tree?

197
0:10:59.72,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Some researchers have begun to ask these questions

198
0:11:02.72,000 --> 0:11:04,000
about certain signs at specific sites,

199
0:11:05.64,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but I believe the time has come to revisit this category as a whole.

200
0:11:10.56,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The irony in all of this, of course,

201
0:11:12.32,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is that having just carefully classified all of the signs into a single category,

202
0:11:16.64,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I have a feeling that my next step will involve breaking it back apart

203
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
as different types of imagery are identified and separated off.

204
0:11:24.44,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now don't get me wrong,

205
0:11:25.68,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the later creation of fully developed writing

206
0:11:28.32,000 --> 0:11:3,000
was an impressive feat in its own right.

207
0:11:30.96,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But it's important to remember

208
0:11:32.44,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that those early writing systems didn't come out of a vacuum.

209
0:11:35.76,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And that even 5,000 years ago,

210
0:11:37.76,000 --> 0:11:4,000
people were already building on something much older,

211
0:11:41.12,000 --> 0:11:44,000
with its origins stretching back tens of thousands of years --

212
0:11:44.88,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to the geometric signs of Ice Age Europe and far beyond,

213
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to that point, deep in our collective history,

214
0:11:52.32,000 --> 0:11:56,000
when someone first came up with the idea of making a graphic mark,

215
0:11:56.4,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and forever changed the nature of how we communicate.

216
0:11:59.36,000 --> 0:12:,000
Thank you.

217
0:12:00.6,000 --> 0:12:03,000

1
0:00:16.244,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Shall I ask for a show of hands or a clapping

2
0:00:21.404,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of people in different generations?

3
0:00:23.528,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm interested in how many are three to 12 years old.

4
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:32.534,000 --> 0:00:33,000
None, huh?

6
0:00:33.844,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:35.243,000 --> 0:00:36,000
All right.

8
0:00:37.069,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'm going to talk about dinosaurs.

9
0:00:38.851,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Do you remember dinosaurs when you were that age?

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Applause)

11
0:00:48.855,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know.

12
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:53.781,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We're going to kind of go in a different direction right now.

14
0:00:56.714,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I hope you all realize that.

15
0:00:58.814,000 --> 0:01:,000
So I'll just give you my message up front:

16
0:01:01.615,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Try not to go extinct.

17
0:01:03.254,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:04.616,000 --> 0:01:05,000
That's it.

19
0:01:05.826,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:11.179,000 --> 0:01:12,000
People ask me a lot --

21
0:01:13.274,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in fact, one of the most asked questions I get

22
0:01:15.95,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is, why do children like dinosaurs so much?

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
What's the fascination?

24
0:01:21.741,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I usually just say,

25
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Well, dinosaurs were big,

26
0:01:27.091,000 --> 0:01:29,000
different and gone."

27
0:01:30.456,000 --> 0:01:31,000
They're all gone.

28
0:01:31.778,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Well that's not true,

29
0:01:33.848,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but we'll get to the goose in a minute.

30
0:01:36.007,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So that's sort of the theme:

31
0:01:38.528,000 --> 0:01:4,000
big, different and gone.

32
0:01:42.404,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The title of my talk:

33
0:01:44.093,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Shape-shifting Dinosaurs:

34
0:01:46.159,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The cause of a premature extinction.

35
0:01:49.265,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs.

36
0:01:52.078,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And there's lots of different shapes.

37
0:01:55.005,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Lots of different kinds.

38
0:01:57.482,000 --> 0:01:58,000
A long time ago,

39
0:01:59.95,000 --> 0:02:04,000
back in the early 1900s, museums were out looking for dinosaurs.

40
0:02:05.122,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They went out and gathered them up.

41
0:02:07.861,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And this is an interesting story.

42
0:02:10.463,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Every museum wanted a little bigger or better one than anybody else had.

43
0:02:14.518,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So if the museum in Toronto went out and collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one,

44
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
then the museum in Ottawa wanted a bigger one, and a better one.

45
0:02:26.052,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And that happened for all museums.

46
0:02:27.904,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So everyone was out looking for all these bigger and better dinosaurs.

47
0:02:33.161,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And this was in the early 1900s.

48
0:02:36.406,000 --> 0:02:38,000
By about 1970,

49
0:02:40.121,000 --> 0:02:44,000
some scientists were sitting around and they thought, "What in the world --

50
0:02:44.975,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big.

51
0:02:49.012,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Where are all the little ones?"

52
0:02:51.006,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:53.834,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And they thought about it and they even wrote papers about it:

54
0:02:57.374,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Where are the little dinosaurs?"

55
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

56
0:03:08.159,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Well, go to a museum, you'll see,

57
0:03:11.8,000 --> 0:03:13,000
see how many baby dinosaurs there are.

58
0:03:14.922,000 --> 0:03:16,000
People assumed -- and this was actually a problem --

59
0:03:17.733,000 --> 0:03:21,000
people assumed that if they had little dinosaurs,

60
0:03:22.061,000 --> 0:03:25,000
if they had juvenile dinosaurs, they'd be easy to identify.

61
0:03:25.787,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You'd have a big dinosaur and a littler dinosaur.

62
0:03:29.684,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:31.126,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But all they had were big dinosaurs.

64
0:03:34.243,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And it comes down to a couple of things.

65
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
First off, scientists have egos,

66
0:03:41.038,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and scientists like to name dinosaurs.

67
0:03:44.915,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They like to name anything.

68
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Everybody likes to have their own animal that they named.

69
0:03:50.241,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:53.242,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And so every time they found something that looked a little different,

71
0:03:56.573,000 --> 0:03:57,000
they named it something different.

72
0:03:58.928,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And what happened, of course,

73
0:04:00.354,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is we ended up with a whole bunch of different dinosaurs.

74
0:04:05.902,000 --> 0:04:07,000
In 1975,

75
0:04:09.556,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a light went on in somebody's head.

76
0:04:12.089,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Dr. Peter Dodson at the University of Pennsylvania

77
0:04:16.338,000 --> 0:04:22,000
actually realized that dinosaurs grew kind of like birds do,

78
0:04:23.928,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which is different than the way reptiles grow.

79
0:04:27.506,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And in fact,

80
0:04:29.11,000 --> 0:04:32,000
he used the cassowary as an example.

81
0:04:32.65,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And it's kind of cool -- if you look at the cassowary,

82
0:04:35.725,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or any of the birds that have crests on their heads,

83
0:04:38.976,000 --> 0:04:44,000
they grow to about 80 percent adult size before the crest starts to grow.

84
0:04:46.694,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now think about that.

85
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They're basically retaining their juvenile characteristics

86
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
very late in what we call ontogeny.

87
0:04:54.804,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So allometric cranial ontogeny is relative skull growth.

88
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So you can see that if you actually found one that was 80 percent grown

89
0:05:08.721,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and you didn't know that it was going to grow up to a cassowary,

90
0:05:12.17,000 --> 0:05:14,000
you would think they were two different animals.

91
0:05:15.43,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So this was a problem,

92
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and Peter Dodson pointed this out using some duck-billed dinosaurs

93
0:05:24.322,000 --> 0:05:25,000
then called Hypacrosaurus.

94
0:05:25.847,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And he showed that if you were to take a baby and an adult

95
0:05:30.737,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and make an average of what it should look like,

96
0:05:34.062,000 --> 0:05:36,000
if it grew in sort of a linear fashion,

97
0:05:37.313,000 --> 0:05:4,000
it would have a crest about half the size of the adult.

98
0:05:41.496,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But the actual subadult at 65 percent had no crest at all.

99
0:05:47.581,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So this was interesting.

100
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So this is where people went astray again.

101
0:05:55.371,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I mean, if they'd have just taken that,

102
0:05:58.002,000 --> 0:06:01,000
taken Peter Dodson's work, and gone on with that,

103
0:06:01.044,000 --> 0:06:04,000
then we would have a lot less dinosaurs than we have.

104
0:06:04.918,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But scientists have egos; they like to name things.

105
0:06:09.38,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And so they went on naming dinosaurs because they were different.

106
0:06:15.405,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now we have a way of actually testing

107
0:06:18.082,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal, is a young one or an older one.

108
0:06:23.401,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And that's by actually cutting into their bones.

109
0:06:27.149,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur is hard to do, as you can imagine,

110
0:06:33.947,000 --> 0:06:38,000
because in museums, bones are precious.

111
0:06:41.102,000 --> 0:06:43,000
You go into a museum, and they take really good care of them.

112
0:06:43.984,000 --> 0:06:46,000
They put them in foam, little containers.

113
0:06:47.6,000 --> 0:06:48,000
They're very well taken care of.

114
0:06:51.432,000 --> 0:06:54,000
They don't like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside.

115
0:06:55.37,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:56.395,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So they don't normally let you do that.

117
0:06:59.828,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter)

118
0:07:00.853,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But I have a museum and I collect dinosaurs

119
0:07:05.387,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and I can saw mine open.

120
0:07:07.275,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So that's what I do.

121
0:07:09.276,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Applause)

122
0:07:15.965,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So if you cut open a little dinosaur,

123
0:07:18.646,000 --> 0:07:2,000
it's very spongy inside, like A.

124
0:07:21.36,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And if you cut into an older dinosaur, it's very massive.

125
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You can tell it's mature bone.

126
0:07:27.361,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So it's real easy to tell them apart.

127
0:07:29.864,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So what I want to do is show you these.

128
0:07:33.593,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In North America in the northern plains of the United States

129
0:07:37.518,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the southern plains of Alberta and Saskatchewan,

130
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
there's this unit of rock called the Hell Creek Formation

131
0:07:45.01,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that produces the last dinosaurs that lived on Earth.

132
0:07:48.485,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And there are 12 of them that everyone recognizes --

133
0:07:51.433,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs that went extinct.

134
0:07:55.873,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And so we will evaluate them.

135
0:07:59.399,000 --> 0:08:,000
And that's sort of what I've been doing.

136
0:08:01.379,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So my students, my staff, we've been cutting them open.

137
0:08:07.074,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Now as you can imagine, cutting open a leg bone is one thing,

138
0:08:10.941,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but when you go to a museum

139
0:08:14.024,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and say, "You don't mind if I cut open your dinosaur's skull, do you?"

140
0:08:18.714,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they say, "Go away."

141
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

142
0:08:28.808,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So here are 12 dinosaurs.

143
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And we want to look at these three first.

144
0:08:34.005,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So these are dinosaurs that are called Pachycephalosaurus.

145
0:08:37.403,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And everybody knows that these three animals are related.

146
0:08:41.057,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And the assumption is that they're related like cousins or whatever.

147
0:08:47.382,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But no one ever considered that they might be more closely related.

148
0:08:53.242,000 --> 0:08:54,000
In other words,

149
0:08:54.49,000 --> 0:08:56,000
people looked at them and they saw the differences.

150
0:08:57.845,000 --> 0:09:,000
And you all know that if you are going to determine

151
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
whether you're related to your brother or your sister,

152
0:09:04.19,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you can't do it by looking at differences.

153
0:09:07.95,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities.

154
0:09:11.475,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So people were looking at these

155
0:09:13.498,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and they were talking about how different they are.

156
0:09:15.955,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Pachycephalosaurus has a big, thick dome on its head,

157
0:09:19.403,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and it's got some little bumps on the back of its head,

158
0:09:22.124,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and it's got a bunch of gnarly things on the end of its nose.

159
0:09:26.05,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur from the same age, lived at the same time,

160
0:09:31.83,000 --> 0:09:33,000
has spikes sticking out the back of its head.

161
0:09:34.02,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's got a little, tiny dome,

162
0:09:36.016,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and it's got a bunch of gnarly stuff on its nose.

163
0:09:39.549,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And then there's this thing called Dracorex hogwartsia.

164
0:09:44.487,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Guess where that came from?

165
0:09:45.941,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Dragon.

166
0:09:47.129,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So here's a dinosaur that has spikes sticking out of its head,

167
0:09:50.905,000 --> 0:09:53,000
no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose.

168
0:09:54.744,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff sort of looked alike.

169
0:09:58.362,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But they did look at these three

170
0:09:59.985,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and they said, "These are three different dinosaurs,

171
0:10:02.464,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and Dracorex is probably the most primitive of them.

172
0:10:05.402,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And the other one is more primitive than the other."

173
0:10:09.416,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's unclear to me how they actually sorted these three of them out.

174
0:10:13.541,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But if you line them up,

175
0:10:15.458,000 --> 0:10:18,000
if you just take those three skulls and just line them up,

176
0:10:18.537,000 --> 0:10:19,000
they line up like this.

177
0:10:20.548,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Dracorex is the littlest one,

178
0:10:22.628,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Stygimoloch is the middle-size one,

179
0:10:25.261,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one.

180
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And one would think, that should give me a clue.

181
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

182
0:10:33.613,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But it didn't give them a clue.

183
0:10:35.167,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

184
0:10:36.365,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Because, well we know why.

185
0:10:39.464,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Scientists like to name things.

186
0:10:43.928,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So if we cut open Dracorex --

187
0:10:46.688,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I cut open our Dracorex --

188
0:10:48.637,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and look, it was spongy inside, really spongy inside.

189
0:10:52.885,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I mean, it is a juvenile and it's growing really fast.

190
0:10:57.164,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So it is going to get bigger.

191
0:10:59.175,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you cut open Stygimoloch, it is doing the same thing.

192
0:11:02.837,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The dome, that little dome, is growing really fast.

193
0:11:06.491,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It's inflating very fast.

194
0:11:08.824,000 --> 0:11:11,000
What's interesting is the spike on the back of the Dracorex

195
0:11:12.224,000 --> 0:11:14,000
was growing very fast as well.

196
0:11:14.327,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch are actually resorbing,

197
0:11:17.6,000 --> 0:11:21,000
which means they're getting smaller as that dome is getting bigger.

198
0:11:21.758,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus,

199
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome

200
0:11:27.535,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and its little bumps on the back of its head were also resorbing.

201
0:11:32.527,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So just with these three dinosaurs,

202
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize

203
0:11:38.98,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that it is just a growth series of the same animal.

204
0:11:44.459,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Which of course means

205
0:11:48.222,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct.

206
0:11:52.965,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

207
0:11:57.953,000 --> 0:11:58,000
OK.

208
0:11:59.314,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Laughter)

209
0:12:02.207,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Which of course means we have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with.

210
0:12:08.494,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So a colleague of mine at Berkeley -- he and I were looking at Triceratops.

211
0:12:13.455,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And before the year 2000 --

212
0:12:15.794,000 --> 0:12:18,000
now remember, Triceratops was first found in the 1800s --

213
0:12:19.49,000 --> 0:12:24,000
before 2000, no one had ever seen a juvenile Triceratops.

214
0:12:25.622,000 --> 0:12:28,000
There's a Triceratops in every museum in the world,

215
0:12:29.19,000 --> 0:12:32,000
but no one had ever collected a juvenile.

216
0:12:33.678,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And we know why, right?

217
0:12:35.104,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Because everybody wants to have a big one.

218
0:12:38.104,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So everyone had a big one.

219
0:12:40.162,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So we went out and collected a whole bunch of stuff

220
0:12:42.594,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and we found a whole bunch of little ones.

221
0:12:44.625,000 --> 0:12:46,000
They're everywhere, they're all over the place.

222
0:12:47.844,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So we have a whole bunch of them at our museum.

223
0:12:50.133,000 --> 0:12:54,000
(Laughter)

224
0:12:54.607,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And everybody says it's because I have a little museum.

225
0:12:57.295,000 --> 0:12:59,000
When you have a little museum, you have little dinosaurs.

226
0:13:00.039,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Laughter)

227
0:13:03.149,000 --> 0:13:04,000
If you look at the Triceratops,

228
0:13:04.915,000 --> 0:13:06,000
you can see it's changing, it's shape-shifting.

229
0:13:07.584,000 --> 0:13:1,000
As the juveniles are growing up, their horns actually curve backwards.

230
0:13:11.496,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And then as they get older, the horns grow forward.

231
0:13:15.185,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And that's pretty cool.

232
0:13:16.588,000 --> 0:13:18,000
If you look along the edge of the frill,

233
0:13:18.927,000 --> 0:13:23,000
they have these little triangular bones that actually grow big as triangles

234
0:13:24.117,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and then they flatten against the frill

235
0:13:26.845,000 --> 0:13:29,000
pretty much like the spikes do on the Pachycephalosaurs.

236
0:13:31.078,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And then, because the juveniles are in my collection,

237
0:13:35.583,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I cut them open ...

238
0:13:37.087,000 --> 0:13:38,000
(Laughter)

239
0:13:38.262,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and look inside.

240
0:13:39.46,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And the little one is really spongy.

241
0:13:42.629,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And the middle-size one is really spongy.

242
0:13:45.027,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But what was interesting was the adult Triceratops was also spongy.

243
0:13:49.926,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And this is a skull that is two meters long.

244
0:13:53.373,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It's a big skull.

245
0:13:56.088,000 --> 0:14:,000
But there's another dinosaur that is found in this formation

246
0:14:00.879,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that looks like a Triceratops, except it's bigger,

247
0:14:04.386,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and it's called Torosaurus.

248
0:14:07.215,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And Torosaurus, when we cut into it, has mature bone.

249
0:14:11.697,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But it's got these big holes in its shield.

250
0:14:13.763,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And everybody says,

251
0:14:14.94,000 --> 0:14:17,000
"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus can't possibly be the same animal

252
0:14:18.624,000 --> 0:14:2,000
because one of them's bigger than the other one."

253
0:14:21.14,000 --> 0:14:25,000
(Laughter)

254
0:14:25.799,000 --> 0:14:27,000
"And it has holes in its frill."

255
0:14:28.296,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And I said, "Well do we have any juvenile Torosauruses?"

256
0:14:31.279,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And they said, "Well, no, but it has holes in its frill."

257
0:14:36.723,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So one of my graduate students, John Scannella,

258
0:14:40.199,000 --> 0:14:41,000
looked through our whole collection

259
0:14:41.942,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops

260
0:14:48.082,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus --

261
0:14:51.241,000 --> 0:14:56,000
so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus,

262
0:14:56.403,000 --> 0:14:57,000
which was pretty cool.

263
0:14:57.659,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So now we know that Torosaurus is actually a grown-up Triceratops.

264
0:15:05.224,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Now when we name dinosaurs,

265
0:15:07.028,000 --> 0:15:1,000
when we name anything, the original name gets to stick

266
0:15:10.588,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and the second name is thrown out.

267
0:15:15.196,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So Torosaurus is extinct.

268
0:15:18.701,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Triceratops, if you've heard the news, a lot of the newscasters got it all wrong.

269
0:15:22.543,000 --> 0:15:25,000
They thought Torosaurus should be kept and Triceratops thrown out,

270
0:15:26.117,000 --> 0:15:27,000
but that's not going to happen.

271
0:15:27.925,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Laughter)

272
0:15:33.439,000 --> 0:15:36,000
All right, so we can do this with a bunch of dinosaurs.

273
0:15:36.746,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I mean, here's Edmontosaurus

274
0:15:38.816,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and Anatotitan.

275
0:15:40.683,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Anatotitan: giant duck.

276
0:15:43.892,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur.

277
0:15:46.067,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Here's another one.

278
0:15:47.819,000 --> 0:15:49,000
So we look at the bone histology.

279
0:15:50.316,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The bone histology tells us that Edmontosaurus is a juvenile,

280
0:15:55.223,000 --> 0:15:56,000
or at least a subadult,

281
0:15:56.875,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and the other one is an adult, and we have an ontogeny.

282
0:16:03.533,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And we get rid of Anatotitan.

283
0:16:06.66,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So we can just keep doing this.

284
0:16:08.505,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And the last one is T. Rex.

285
0:16:12.592,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So there's these two dinosaurs, T. Rex and Nanotyrannus.

286
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Laughter)

287
0:16:20.174,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Again, it makes you wonder.

288
0:16:22.914,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Laughter)

289
0:16:26.148,000 --> 0:16:28,000
But they had a good question.

290
0:16:28.507,000 --> 0:16:3,000
They were looking at them and they said, "One's got 17 teeth,

291
0:16:31.416,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and the biggest one's got 12 teeth.

292
0:16:33.304,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And that doesn't make any sense at all,

293
0:16:35.198,000 --> 0:16:38,000
because we don't know of any dinosaurs that gain teeth as they get older.

294
0:16:38.89,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So it must be true --

295
0:16:41.162,000 --> 0:16:42,000
they must be different."

296
0:16:43.903,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So we cut into them.

297
0:16:46.633,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And sure enough, Nanotyrannus has juvenile bone

298
0:16:50.534,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and the bigger one has more mature bone.

299
0:16:54.699,000 --> 0:16:56,000
It looks like it could still get bigger.

300
0:16:57.126,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And at the Museum of the Rockies where we work,

301
0:16:59.371,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I have four T. rexes, so I can cut a whole bunch of them.

302
0:17:03.034,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But I didn't have to cut any of them really,

303
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
because I just lined up their jaws

304
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and it turned out the biggest one had 12 teeth

305
0:17:11.594,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and the next smallest one had 13

306
0:17:13.793,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and the next smallest had 14.

307
0:17:16.047,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And of course, Nano has 17.

308
0:17:18.094,000 --> 0:17:2,000
And we just went out and looked at other people's collections

309
0:17:21.005,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and we found one that has sort of 15 teeth.

310
0:17:24.764,000 --> 0:17:26,000
So again, real easy to say

311
0:17:27.566,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny included Nanotyrannus,

312
0:17:32.946,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and therefore we can take out another dinosaur.

313
0:17:37.609,000 --> 0:17:38,000
(Laughter)

314
0:17:42.637,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So when it comes down to our end Cretaceous,

315
0:17:45.954,000 --> 0:17:46,000
we have seven left.

316
0:17:49.359,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And that's a good number.

317
0:17:51.016,000 --> 0:17:54,000
That's a good number to go extinct, I think.

318
0:17:54.864,000 --> 0:17:55,000
Now as you can imagine,

319
0:17:56.122,000 --> 0:17:58,000
this is not very popular with fourth-graders.

320
0:17:59.003,000 --> 0:18:,000
(Laughter)

321
0:18:00.028,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs, they memorize them.

322
0:18:08.373,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And they're not happy with this.

323
0:18:10.127,000 --> 0:18:12,000
(Laughter)

324
0:18:12.767,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Thank you very much.

325
0:18:13.982,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

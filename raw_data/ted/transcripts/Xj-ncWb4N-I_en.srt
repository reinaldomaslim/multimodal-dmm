1
0:00:13.292,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It’s 6:30 in the morning,

2
0:00:15.583,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and Kristen is wheeling her prostate patient into the OR.

3
0:00:21.5,000 --> 0:00:23,000
She's a resident, a surgeon in training.

4
0:00:24.333,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It’s her job to learn.

5
0:00:27.292,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Today, she’s really hoping to do some of the nerve-sparing,

6
0:00:30.667,000 --> 0:00:33,000
extremely delicate dissection that can preserve erectile function.

7
0:00:35.5,000 --> 0:00:38,000
That'll be up to the attending surgeon, though, but he's not there yet.

8
0:00:39.625,000 --> 0:00:41,000
She and the team put the patient under,

9
0:00:42.042,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and she leads the initial eight-inch incision in the lower abdomen.

10
0:00:47.042,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Once she’s got that clamped back, she tells the nurse to call the attending.

11
0:00:51.583,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He arrives, gowns up,

12
0:00:54.458,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And from there on in, their four hands are mostly in that patient --

13
0:01:00.708,000 --> 0:01:02,000
with him guiding but Kristin leading the way.

14
0:01:04.875,000 --> 0:01:08,000
When the prostates out (and, yes, he let Kristen do a little nerve sparing),

15
0:01:09.542,000 --> 0:01:1,000
he rips off his scrubs.

16
0:01:10.792,000 --> 0:01:11,000
He starts to do paperwork.

17
0:01:12.833,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Kristen closes the patient by 8:15,

18
0:01:18.583,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with a junior resident looking over her shoulder.

19
0:01:21.042,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And she lets him do the final line of sutures.

20
0:01:24.833,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Kristen feels great.

21
0:01:28.25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Patient’s going to be fine,

22
0:01:29.833,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and no doubt she’s a better surgeon than she was at 6:30.

23
0:01:34.208,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now this is extreme work.

24
0:01:37.417,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But Kristin’s learning to do her job the way that most of us do:

25
0:01:41.625,000 --> 0:01:42,000
watching an expert for a bit,

26
0:01:43.542,000 --> 0:01:46,000
getting involved in easy, safe parts of the work

27
0:01:46.708,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and progressing to riskier and harder tasks

28
0:01:48.917,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as they guide and decide she’s ready.

29
0:01:52.042,000 --> 0:01:54,000
My whole life I’ve been fascinated by this kind of learning.

30
0:01:54.958,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It feels elemental, part of what makes us human.

31
0:01:59.75,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It has different names: apprenticeship, coaching, mentorship, on the job training.

32
0:02:05.542,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In surgery, it’s called “see one, do one, teach one.”

33
0:02:09.625,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But the process is the same,

34
0:02:10.993,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and it’s been the main path to skill around the globe for thousands of years.

35
0:02:16.333,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Right now, we’re handling AI in a way that blocks that path.

36
0:02:21.625,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We’re sacrificing learning in our quest for productivity.

37
0:02:25.292,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I found this first in surgery while I was at MIT,

38
0:02:28.125,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but now I’ve got evidence it’s happening all over,

39
0:02:30.625,000 --> 0:02:33,000
in very different industries and with very different kinds of AI.

40
0:02:35.083,000 --> 0:02:4,000
If we do nothing, millions of us are going to hit a brick wall

41
0:02:40.958,000 --> 0:02:42,000
as we try to learn to deal with AI.

42
0:02:45.125,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Let’s go back to surgery to see how.

43
0:02:47.708,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Fast forward six months.

44
0:02:49.667,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It’s 6:30am again, and Kristen is wheeling another prostate patient in,

45
0:02:55.167,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but this time to the robotic OR.

46
0:02:59.667,000 --> 0:03:,000
The attending leads attaching

47
0:03:01.375,000 --> 0:03:03,000
a four-armed, thousand-pound robot to the patient.

48
0:03:04.75,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They both rip off their scrubs,

49
0:03:07.208,000 --> 0:03:1,000
head to control consoles 10 or 15 feet away,

50
0:03:11.167,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and Kristen just watches.

51
0:03:16.375,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The robot allows the attending to do the whole procedure himself,

52
0:03:19.452,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so he basically does.

53
0:03:21.917,000 --> 0:03:23,000
He knows she needs practice.

54
0:03:24.042,000 --> 0:03:25,000
He wants to give her control.

55
0:03:26.25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But he also knows she’d be slower and make more mistakes,

56
0:03:29.667,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and his patient comes first.

57
0:03:32.25,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So Kristin has no hope of getting anywhere near those nerves during this rotation.

58
0:03:37.417,000 --> 0:03:41,000
She’ll be lucky if she operates more than 15 minutes during a four-hour procedure.

59
0:03:42.25,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And she knows that when she slips up,

60
0:03:45.458,000 --> 0:03:48,000
he’ll tap a touch screen, and she’ll be watching again,

61
0:03:48.917,000 --> 0:03:5,000
feeling like a kid in the corner with a dunce cap.

62
0:03:53.583,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Like all the studies of robots and work I’ve done in the last eight years,

63
0:03:57.108,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I started this one with a big, open question:

64
0:03:59.25,000 --> 0:04:01,000
How do we learn to work with intelligent machines?

65
0:04:02.792,000 --> 0:04:07,000
To find out, I spent two and a half years observing dozens of residents and surgeons

66
0:04:08.625,000 --> 0:04:11,000
doing traditional and robotic surgery, interviewing them

67
0:04:12.125,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and in general hanging out with the residents as they tried to learn.

68
0:04:16.25,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I covered 18 of the top US teaching hospitals,

69
0:04:19.625,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and the story was the same.

70
0:04:21.875,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Most residents were in Kristen's shoes.

71
0:04:24.958,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They got to “see one” plenty,

72
0:04:27.583,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but the “do one” was barely available.

73
0:04:30.333,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So they couldn’t struggle, and they weren’t learning.

74
0:04:33.291,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This was important news for surgeons, but I needed to know how widespread it was:

75
0:04:37.125,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Where else was using AI blocking learning on the job?

76
0:04:42.208,000 --> 0:04:46,000
To find out, I’ve connected with a small but growing group of young researchers

77
0:04:46.542,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who’ve done boots-on-the-ground studies of work involving AI

78
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in very diverse settings like start-ups, policing,

79
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
investment banking and online education.

80
0:04:55.625,000 --> 0:05:,000
Like me, they spent at least a year and many hundreds of hours observing,

81
0:05:01.5,000 --> 0:05:04,000
interviewing and often working side-by-side with the people they studied.

82
0:05:06.458,000 --> 0:05:08,000
We shared data, and I looked for patterns.

83
0:05:09.917,000 --> 0:05:14,000
No matter the industry, the work, the AI, the story was the same.

84
0:05:16.042,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Organizations were trying harder and harder to get results from AI,

85
0:05:19.708,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and they were peeling learners away from expert work as they did it.

86
0:05:24.333,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Start-up managers were outsourcing their customer contact.

87
0:05:27.833,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Cops had to learn to deal with crime forecasts without experts support.

88
0:05:32.875,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Junior bankers were getting cut out of complex analysis,

89
0:05:36.5,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and professors had to build online courses without help.

90
0:05:41.125,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And the effect of all of this was the same as in surgery.

91
0:05:44.375,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Learning on the job was getting much harder.

92
0:05:48.958,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This can’t last.

93
0:05:51.542,000 --> 0:05:55,000
McKinsey estimates that between half a billion and a billion of us

94
0:05:55.833,000 --> 0:05:59,000
are going to have to adapt to AI in our daily work by 2030.

95
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And we’re assuming that on-the-job learning

96
0:06:03.035,000 --> 0:06:04,000
will be there for us as we try.

97
0:06:05.5,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Accenture’s latest workers survey showed that most workers learned key skills

98
0:06:09.792,000 --> 0:06:11,000
on the job, not in formal training.

99
0:06:13.292,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So while we talk a lot about its potential future impact,

100
0:06:16.833,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the aspect of AI that may matter most right now

101
0:06:20.542,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is that we’re handling it in a way that blocks learning on the job

102
0:06:24.375,000 --> 0:06:25,000
just when we need it most.

103
0:06:27.458,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now across all our sites, a small minority found a way to learn.

104
0:06:35.625,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They did it by breaking and bending rules.

105
0:06:39.083,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Approved methods weren’t working, so they bent and broke rules

106
0:06:43.75,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to get hands-on practice with experts.

107
0:06:45.75,000 --> 0:06:5,000
In my setting, residents got involved in robotic surgery in medical school

108
0:06:51.375,000 --> 0:06:54,000
at the expense of their generalist education.

109
0:06:56.417,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And they spent hundreds of extra hours with simulators and recordings of surgery,

110
0:07:02.292,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when you were supposed to learn in the OR.

111
0:07:05.375,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And maybe most importantly, they found ways to struggle

112
0:07:08.875,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in live procedures with limited expert supervision.

113
0:07:13.792,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I call all this “shadow learning,” because it bends the rules

114
0:07:18.125,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and learner’s do it out of the limelight.

115
0:07:21.542,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And everyone turns a blind eye because it gets results.

116
0:07:25.667,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Remember, these are the star pupils of the bunch.

117
0:07:29.792,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Now, obviously, this is not OK, and it’s not sustainable.

118
0:07:33.708,000 --> 0:07:35,000
No one should have to risk getting fired

119
0:07:35.917,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to learn the skills they need to do their job.

120
0:07:38.792,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But we do need to learn from these people.

121
0:07:41.917,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They took serious risks to learn.

122
0:07:44.792,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They understood they needed to protect struggle and challenge in their work

123
0:07:49.167,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so that they could push themselves to tackle hard problems

124
0:07:52.083,000 --> 0:07:53,000
right near the edge of their capacity.

125
0:07:54.458,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They also made sure there was an expert nearby

126
0:07:56.698,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to offer pointers and to backstop against catastrophe.

127
0:08:00.875,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Let’s build this combination of struggle and expert support

128
0:08:04.708,000 --> 0:08:06,000
into each AI implementation.

129
0:08:08.375,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Here’s one clear example I could get of this on the ground.

130
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Before robots,

131
0:08:13.375,000 --> 0:08:17,000
if you were a bomb disposal technician, you dealt with an IED by walking up to it.

132
0:08:19.333,000 --> 0:08:21,000
A junior officer was hundreds of feet away,

133
0:08:21.5,000 --> 0:08:24,000
so could only watch and help if you decided it was safe

134
0:08:24.833,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and invited them downrange.

135
0:08:27.208,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now you sit side-by-side in a bomb-proof truck.

136
0:08:31.125,000 --> 0:08:32,000
You both watched the video feed.

137
0:08:32.958,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They control a distant robot, and you guide the work out loud.

138
0:08:37.292,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Trainees learn better than they did before robots.

139
0:08:41.125,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We can scale this to surgery, start-ups, policing,

140
0:08:45.082,000 --> 0:08:47,000
investment banking, online education and beyond.

141
0:08:48.375,000 --> 0:08:5,000
The good news is we’ve got new tools to do it.

142
0:08:51.75,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The internet and the cloud mean we don’t always need one expert for every trainee,

143
0:08:56.167,000 --> 0:09:,000
for them to be physically near each other or even to be in the same organization.

144
0:09:01.292,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And we can build AI to help:

145
0:09:05.167,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to coach learners as they struggle, to coach experts as they coach

146
0:09:10.25,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and to connect those two groups in smart ways.

147
0:09:15.375,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There are people at work on systems like this,

148
0:09:18.333,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but they’ve been mostly focused on formal training.

149
0:09:21.458,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And the deeper crisis is in on-the-job learning.

150
0:09:24.417,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We must do better.

151
0:09:26.292,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Today’s problems demand we do better

152
0:09:29.375,000 --> 0:09:33,000
to create work that takes full advantage of AI’s amazing capabilities

153
0:09:35.042,000 --> 0:09:37,000
while enhancing our skills as we do it.

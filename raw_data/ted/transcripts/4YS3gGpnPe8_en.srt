0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The story I wanted to share with you today

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is my challenge as an Iranian artist,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
as an Iranian woman artist,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as an Iranian woman artist

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
living in exile.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Well, it has its pluses and minuses.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
On the dark side,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Every Iranian artist, in one form or another,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is political.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Politics have defined our lives.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
If you're living in Iran,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
you're facing censorship, harassment,

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
arrest, torture --

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
at times, execution.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If you're living outside like me,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
you're faced with life in exile --

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
the pain of the longing

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and the separation from your loved ones

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and your family.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Therefore, we don't find

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the moral, emotional,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
psychological and political space

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to distance ourselves from the reality

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of social responsibility.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Oddly enough,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
an artist such as myself

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
finds herself also in the position of being the voice,

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the speaker of my people,

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
even if I have, indeed,

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
no access to my own country.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Also, people like myself,

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we're fighting two battles on different grounds.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We're being critical of the West,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the perception of the West

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
about our identity --

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
about the image that is constructed about us,

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
about our women, about our politics,

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
about our religion.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We are there to take pride

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and insist on respect.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And at the same time,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
we're fighting another battle.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That is our regime,

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
our government --

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
our atrocious government,

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
[that] has done every crime

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in order to stay in power.

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Our artists are at risk.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We are in a position of danger.

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We pose a threat

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to the order of the government.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But ironically,

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
this situation

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
has empowered all of us,

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because we are considered, as artists,

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
central to the cultural, political,

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
social discourse in Iran.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We are there to inspire, to provoke,

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to mobilize,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to bring hope to our people.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We are the reporters of our people,

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and are communicators

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to the outside world.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Art is our weapon.

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Culture is a form of resistance.

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I envy sometimes the artists of the West

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
for their freedom of expression.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
For the fact that they can distance themselves

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
from the question of politics.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
From the fact that they are only serving one audience,

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
mainly the Western culture.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But also, I worry about the West,

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because often in this country,

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in this Western world that we have,

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
culture risks being a form of entertainment.

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Our people depend on our artists,

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and culture is beyond communication.

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
My journey as an artist

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
started from a very, very personal place.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I did not start

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to make social commentary

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
about my country.

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The first one that you see in front of you

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is actually when I first returned to Iran

86
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
after being separated for a good 12 years.

87
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It was after the Islamic Revolution

88
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of 1979.

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
While I was absent from Iran,

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and had entirely transformed the country

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
from Persian to the Islamic culture.

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I came mainly to be reunited with my family

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and to reconnect in a way

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that I found my place in the society.

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But instead, I found a country

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that was totally ideological

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and that I didn't recognize anymore.

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
More so, I became very interested,

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
as I was facing

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
my own personal dilemmas and questions,

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I became immersed in the study

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
of the Islamic Revolution --

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
how, indeed,

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
it had incredibly transformed

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the lives of Iranian women.

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I found the subject of Iranian women

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
immensely interesting,

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in the way the women of Iran, historically,

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
seemed to embody the political transformation.

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So in a way, by studying a woman,

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
you can read the structure and the ideology of the country.

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So I made a group of work

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that at once faced my own personal questions in life,

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse --

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the subject of martyrdom,

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of love of God, faith,

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but violence and crime and cruelty.

120
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
For me, this became incredibly important.

121
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.

122
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I was an outsider

123
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who had come back to Iran to find my place,

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but I was not in a position

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to be critical of the government

126
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.

127
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This changed slowly

128
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
as I found my voice

129
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I discovered things

130
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that I didn't know I would discover.

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So my art became slightly more critical.

132
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
My knife became a little sharper.

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I fell into a life in exile.

134
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I am a nomadic artist.

135
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.

136
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran.

137
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now I am making films.

138
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Last year, I finished a film

139
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
called "Women Without Men."

140
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
"Women Without Men" returns to history,

141
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but another part of our Iranian history.

142
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It goes to 1953

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
when American CIA exercised a coup

144
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and removed a democratically elected leader,

145
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Dr. Mossadegh.

146
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The book is written by an Iranian woman,

147
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Shahrnush Parsipur.

148
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's a magical realist novel.

149
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This book is banned,

150
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and she spent five years in prison.

151
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
My obsession with this book,

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and the reason I made this into a film,

153
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is because it at once was addressing

154
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the question of being a female --

155
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
traditionally, historically in Iran --

156
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and the question of four women

157
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
who are all looking for an idea

158
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
of change, freedom and democracy --

159
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,

160
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
also struggled for an idea

161
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
of freedom and democracy

162
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and independence from the foreign interventions.

163
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I made this film

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
because I felt it's important

165
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
for it to speak to the Westerners

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
about our history as a country.

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That all of you seem to remember Iran

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
after the Islamic Revolution.

169
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
That Iran was once a secular society,

170
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and we had democracy,

171
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and this democracy was stolen from us

172
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
by the American government,

173
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
by the British government.

174
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This film also speaks to the Iranian people

175
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in asking them to return to their history

176
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized --

177
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in the way we looked, in the way we played music,

178
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in the way we had intellectual life.

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And most of all,

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in the way that we fought for democracy.

181
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
These are some of the shots actually from my film.

182
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
These are some of the images of the coup.

183
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And we made this film in Casablanca,

184
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
recreating all the shots.

185
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This film tried to find a balance

186
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
between telling a political story,

187
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but also a feminine story.

188
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Being a visual artist, indeed,

189
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I am foremost interested to make art --

190
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to make art that transcends

191
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
politics, religion,

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the question of feminism,

193
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and become an important, timeless,

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
universal work of art.

195
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The challenge I have

196
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is how to do that.

197
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.

198
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
How to move you with your emotions,

199
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but also make your mind work.

200
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
These are some of the images

201
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the characters of the film.

202
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now comes the green movement --

203
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the summer of 2009,

204
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as my film is released --

205
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran.

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
What is unbelievably ironic

207
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is the period that we tried to depict in the film,

208
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the cry for democracy

209
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and social justice,

210
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
repeats itself now

211
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
again in Tehran.

212
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The green movement

213
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
significantly inspired the world.

214
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians

215
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
who stand for basic human rights

216
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and struggle for democracy.

217
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
What was most significant for me

218
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
was, once again,

219
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the presence of the women.

220
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They're absolutely inspirational for me.

221
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
If in the Islamic Revolution,

222
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the images of the woman portrayed

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
were submissive

224
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and didn't have a voice,

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
now we saw a new idea of feminism

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in the streets of Tehran --

227
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
women who were educated,

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
forward thinking, non-traditional,

229
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
sexually open, fearless

230
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and seriously feminist.

231
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
These women and those young men

232
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
united Iranians

233
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
across the world, inside and outside.

234
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I then discovered

235
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
why I take so much inspiration

236
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
from Iranian women.

237
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
That, under all circumstances,

238
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
they have pushed the boundary.

239
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They have confronted the authority.

240
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They have broken every rule

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
in the smallest and the biggest way.

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And once again, they proved themselves.

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I stand here to say

244
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that Iranian women have found a new voice,

245
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and their voice is giving me my voice.

246
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And it's a great honor

247
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,

248
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
even if I have to operate in the West only for now.

249
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Thank you so much.

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Applause)

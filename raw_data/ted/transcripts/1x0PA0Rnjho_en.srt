1
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm going to present three projects in rapid fire.

2
0:00:29.405,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I don't have much time to do it.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I want to reinforce three ideas with that rapid-fire presentation.

4
0:00:34.358,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The first is what I like to call a hyper-rational process.

5
0:00:37.358,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's a process that takes rationality almost to an absurd level,

6
0:00:41.279,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and it transcends all the baggage

7
0:00:43.208,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that normally comes with what people would call,

8
0:00:45.876,000 --> 0:00:47,000
sort of a rational conclusion to something.

9
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And it concludes in something that you see here,

10
0:00:50.31,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that you actually wouldn't expect as being the result of rationality.

11
0:00:55.07,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The second --

12
0:00:57.79,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the second is that this process does not have a signature.

13
0:01:02.804,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There is no authorship.

14
0:01:04.204,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Architects are obsessed with authorship.

15
0:01:06.24,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This is something that has editing and it has teams,

16
0:01:08.748,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but in fact, we no longer see within this process,

17
0:01:11.135,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the traditional master architect

18
0:01:12.689,000 --> 0:01:14,000
creating a sketch that his minions carry out.

19
0:01:16.739,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And the third is that it challenges --

20
0:01:18.599,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and this is, in the length of this, very hard to support why,

21
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:23,000
connect all these things --

22
0:01:23.326,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but it challenges the high modernist notion of flexibility.

23
0:01:26.553,000 --> 0:01:29,000
High modernists said we will create sort of singular spaces that are generic,

24
0:01:30.217,000 --> 0:01:31,000
almost anything can happen within them.

25
0:01:32.13,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I call it sort of "shotgun flexibility" --

26
0:01:34.18,000 --> 0:01:37,000
turn your head this way; shoot; and you're bound to kill something.

27
0:01:37.365,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So, this is the promise of high modernism:

28
0:01:39.464,000 --> 0:01:42,000
within a single space, actually, any kind of activity can happen.

29
0:01:42.711,000 --> 0:01:44,000
But as we're seeing,

30
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
operational costs are starting to dwarf capital costs

31
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in terms of design parameters.

32
0:01:50.063,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And so, with this sort of idea,

33
0:01:51.807,000 --> 0:01:54,000
what happens is, whatever actually is in the building on opening day,

34
0:01:55.089,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or whatever seems to be the most immediate need,

35
0:01:57.376,000 --> 0:02:,000
starts to dwarf the possibility and sort of subsume it,

36
0:02:00.672,000 --> 0:02:01,000
of anything else could ever happen.

37
0:02:02.624,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And so we're proposing a different kind of flexibility,

38
0:02:05.245,000 --> 0:02:09,000
something that we call "compartmentalized flexibility."

39
0:02:09.403,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And the idea is that you, within that continuum,

40
0:02:11.766,000 --> 0:02:14,000
identify a series of points, and you design specifically to them.

41
0:02:14.918,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They can be pushed off-center a little bit,

42
0:02:16.959,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but in the end you actually still get as much

43
0:02:19.096,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped.

44
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
With high modernist flexibility, that doesn't really work.

45
0:02:25.463,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now I'm going to talk about --

46
0:02:26.929,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I'm going to build up the Seattle Central Library

47
0:02:29.262,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in this way before your eyes in about five or six diagrams,

48
0:02:32.067,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I truly mean this is the design process that you'll see.

49
0:02:34.908,000 --> 0:02:36,000
With the library staff and the library board,

50
0:02:37.236,000 --> 0:02:38,000
we settled on two core positions.

51
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is the first one, and this is showing, over the last 900 years,

52
0:02:42.469,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the evolution of the book, and other technologies.

53
0:02:46.112,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This diagram was our sort of position piece about the book,

54
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and our position was, books are technology --

55
0:02:51.54,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that's something people forget --

56
0:02:53.152,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but it's a form of technology that will have to share its dominance

57
0:02:56.338,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with any other form of truly potent technology or media.

58
0:03:00.13,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The second premise --

59
0:03:01.306,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and this was something that was very difficult for us

60
0:03:03.821,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to convince the librarians of at first --

61
0:03:05.811,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is that libraries, since the inception of Carnegie Library tradition in America,

62
0:03:09.618,000 --> 0:03:11,000
had a second responsibility, and that was for social roles.

63
0:03:12.525,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Ok, now, this I'll come back to later, but something --

64
0:03:15.137,000 --> 0:03:18,000
actually, the librarians at first said, "No, this isn't our mandate.

65
0:03:18.368,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Our mandate is media, and particularly the book."

66
0:03:22.463,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So what you're seeing now is actually the design of the building.

67
0:03:25.557,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The upper diagram is what we had seen

68
0:03:28.033,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in a whole host of contemporary libraries that used high modernist flexibility.

69
0:03:32.598,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Sort of, any activity could happen anywhere.

70
0:03:35.679,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We don't know the future of the library; we don't know the future of the book;

71
0:03:39.405,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and so, we'll use this approach.

72
0:03:41.008,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And what we saw were buildings that were very generic, and worse --

73
0:03:44.212,000 --> 0:03:45,000
not only were they very generic --

74
0:03:45.934,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so, not only does the reading room look like the copy room

75
0:03:48.7,000 --> 0:03:49,000
look like the magazine area --

76
0:03:50.222,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but it meant that whatever issue was troubling the library at that moment

77
0:03:53.972,000 --> 0:03:56,000
was starting to engulf every other activity that was happening in it.

78
0:03:57.511,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And in this case, what was getting engulfed

79
0:03:59.784,000 --> 0:04:02,000
were these social responsibilities by the expansion of the book.

80
0:04:02.824,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And so we proposed what's at the lower diagram.

81
0:04:05.063,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Very dumb approach: simply compartmentalize.

82
0:04:08.174,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Put those things whose evolution we could predict --

83
0:04:10.651,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I don't mean that we could say what would actually happen in the future,

84
0:04:14.258,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but we have some certainty of the spectrum of what would happen in the future --

85
0:04:18.168,000 --> 0:04:2,000
put those in boxes designed specifically for it,

86
0:04:20.442,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and put the things that we can't predict on the rooftops.

87
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So that was the core idea.

88
0:04:24.431,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Now, we had to convince the library

89
0:04:26.149,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that social roles were equally important to media,

90
0:04:29.839,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in order to get them to accept this.

91
0:04:31.642,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What you're seeing here is actually their program on the left.

92
0:04:34.666,000 --> 0:04:38,000
That's as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory.

93
0:04:38.727,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Our first operation was to re-digest it back to them, show it to them and say,

94
0:04:43.039,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"You know what? We haven't touched it,

95
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books.

96
0:04:48.411,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Two-thirds of it is already dedicated --

97
0:04:50.384,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that's the white band below, the thing you said isn't important --

98
0:04:53.519,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is already dedicated to social functions."

99
0:04:55.552,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So once we had presented that back to them,

100
0:04:57.757,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they agreed that this sort of core concept could work.

101
0:05:00.352,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We got the right to go back to first principles --

102
0:05:02.73,000 --> 0:05:03,000
that's the third diagram.

103
0:05:03.964,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We recombined everything.

104
0:05:05.194,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And then we started making new decisions.

105
0:05:07.176,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What you're seeing on the right is the design of the library,

106
0:05:10.073,000 --> 0:05:11,000
specifically in terms of square footage.

107
0:05:12.018,000 --> 0:05:16,000
On the left of that diagram, here, you'll see a series of five platforms --

108
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
sort of combs, collective programs.

109
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And on the right are the more indeterminate spaces;

110
0:05:21.429,000 --> 0:05:22,000
things like reading rooms,

111
0:05:22.704,000 --> 0:05:24,000
whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 years we can't predict.

112
0:05:25.413,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So that literally was the design of the building.

113
0:05:27.746,000 --> 0:05:29,000
They signed it, and to their chagrin,

114
0:05:29.905,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we came back a week later, and we presented them this.

115
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And as you can see, it is literally the diagram on the right.

116
0:05:35.921,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:36.946,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We just sized -- no, really, I mean that, literally.

118
0:05:39.4,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The things on the left-hand side of the diagram,

119
0:05:41.786,000 --> 0:05:42,000
those are the boxes.

120
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We sized them into five compartments. They're super-efficient.

121
0:05:45.953,000 --> 0:05:46,000
We had a very low budget to work with.

122
0:05:47.849,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We pushed them around on the site

123
0:05:49.453,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to make very literal contextual relationships.

124
0:05:51.69,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The reading room should be able to see the water.

125
0:05:54.027,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The main entrance should have a public plaza in front of it

126
0:05:56.832,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to abide by the zoning code, and so forth.

127
0:05:59.397,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So, you see the five platforms, those are the boxes.

128
0:06:01.874,000 --> 0:06:03,000
within each one, a very discrete thing is happening.

129
0:06:04.327,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The area in between is sort of an urban continuum,

130
0:06:06.698,000 --> 0:06:09,000
these things that we can't predict their evolution to the same degree.

131
0:06:10.49,000 --> 0:06:12,000
To give you some sense of the power of this idea,

132
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the biggest block is what we call the book spiral.

133
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It's literally built in a very inexpensive way --

134
0:06:18.358,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it is a parking garage for books.

135
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building,

136
0:06:24.511,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but that is not necessarily an expensive approach.

137
0:06:27.81,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And it allows us to organize the entire Dewey Decimal System

138
0:06:30.66,000 --> 0:06:33,000
on one continuous run; no matter how it grows or contracts within the building,

139
0:06:34.555,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it will always have its clarity to end the sort of trail of tears

140
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that we've all experienced in public libraries.

141
0:06:41.753,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And so this was the final operation,

143
0:06:44.755,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which was to take these blocks as they were all pushed off kilter,

144
0:06:47.9,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and to hold onto them with a skin.

145
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That skin serves double duty, again, for economics.

146
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
One, it is the lateral stability for the entire building;

147
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
it's a structural element.

148
0:06:57.286,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But its dimensions were designed not only for structure,

149
0:06:59.937,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but also for holding on every piece of glass.

150
0:07:02.212,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The glass was then -- I'll use the word impregnated --

151
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but it had a layer of metal that was called "stretched metal."

152
0:07:08.436,000 --> 0:07:09,000
That metal acts as a microlouver,

153
0:07:10.298,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so from the exterior of the building, the sun sees it as totally opaque,

154
0:07:13.703,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but from the interior, it's entirely transparent.

155
0:07:16.401,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So now I'm going to take you on a tour of the building.

156
0:07:19.871,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Let me see if I can find it.

157
0:07:21.269,000 --> 0:07:24,000
For anyone who gets motion sickness, I apologize.

158
0:07:25.233,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So, this is the building.

159
0:07:29.029,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And I think what's important is, when we first unveiled the building,

160
0:07:32.91,000 --> 0:07:36,000
the public saw it as being totally about our whim and ego.

161
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And it was defended, believe it or not, by the librarians.

162
0:07:39.866,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They said, "Look, we don't know what it is,

163
0:07:41.914,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but we know it's everything that we need it to be,

164
0:07:44.303,000 --> 0:07:47,000
based on the observations that we've done about the program."

165
0:07:50.085,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This is going into one of the entries.

166
0:07:52.093,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So, it's an unusual building for a public library, obviously.

167
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So now we're going into what we call the living room.

168
0:08:02.625,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This is actually a program that we invented with the library.

169
0:08:05.521,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It was recognizing that public libraries

170
0:08:07.462,000 --> 0:08:09,000
are the last vestige of public free space.

171
0:08:10.271,000 --> 0:08:13,000
There are plenty of shopping malls that allow you to get out of the rain

172
0:08:13.723,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in downtown Seattle,

173
0:08:14.903,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but there are not so many free places

174
0:08:17.854,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that allow you to get out of the rain.

175
0:08:19.699,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So this was an unprogrammed area where people could pretty much do anything,

176
0:08:23.309,000 --> 0:08:25,000
including eat, yell, play chess and so forth.

177
0:08:25.442,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now we're moving up into what we call the mixing chamber.

178
0:08:29.472,000 --> 0:08:31,000
That was the main technology area in the building.

179
0:08:32.424,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You'll have to tell me if I'm going too fast for you.

180
0:08:39.201,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And now up.

181
0:08:45.566,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is actually the place that we put into the building

182
0:08:48.219,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so I could propose to my wife, right there.

183
0:08:50.276,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:54,000
She said yes.

185
0:08:54.183,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:57.593,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I'm running out of time, so I'm actually going to stop.

187
0:09:00.198,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I can show this to you later.

188
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But let's see if I can very quickly get into the book spiral,

189
0:09:05.307,000 --> 0:09:07,000
because I think it's, as I said, the most --

190
0:09:07.395,000 --> 0:09:1,000
this is the main reading room -- the most unique part of the building.

191
0:09:11.768,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You dizzy yet?

192
0:09:14.141,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Ok, so here, this is the book spiral.

193
0:09:21.395,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So, it's very indiscernible,

194
0:09:23.352,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but it's actually a continuous stair-stepping.

195
0:09:26.877,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It allows you to, on one city block,

196
0:09:28.893,000 --> 0:09:3,000
go up one full floor, so that it's on a continuum.

197
0:09:36.491,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Ok, now I'm going to go back, and I'm going to hit a second project.

198
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I'm going to go very, very quickly through this.

199
0:09:42.287,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now this is the Dallas Theater.

200
0:09:43.991,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It was an unusual client for us, because they came to us and they said,

201
0:09:47.363,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"We need you to do a new building.

202
0:09:49.093,000 --> 0:09:52,000
We've been working in a temporary space for 30 years,

203
0:09:52.543,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but because of that temporary space,

204
0:09:54.29,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we've become an infamous theater company.

205
0:09:57.177,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Theater is really focused in New York, Chicago and Seattle,

206
0:10:00.162,000 --> 0:10:03,000
with the exception of the Dallas Theater Company."

207
0:10:03.283,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And the very fact that they worked in a provisional space

208
0:10:06.003,000 --> 0:10:08,000
meant that for Beckett, they could blow out a wall;

209
0:10:08.47,000 --> 0:10:11,000
they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blow a hole through the floor, and so forth.

210
0:10:12.236,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So it was a very daunting task for us to do a brand-new building

211
0:10:15.292,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that could be a pristine building,

212
0:10:17.37,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but keep this kind of experimental nature.

213
0:10:19.413,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And the second is,

214
0:10:20.635,000 --> 0:10:22,000
they were what we call a multi-form theater,

215
0:10:23.537,000 --> 0:10:25,000
they do different kinds of performances in repertory.

216
0:10:26.167,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So they in the morning will do something in arena,

217
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:31,000
then they'll do something in proscenium and so forth.

218
0:10:31.517,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And so they needed to be able to quickly transform

219
0:10:33.89,000 --> 0:10:34,000
between different theater organizations,

220
0:10:35.84,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and for operational budget reasons,

221
0:10:37.549,000 --> 0:10:39,000
this actually no longer happens in pretty much

222
0:10:39.736,000 --> 0:10:41,000
any multi-form theater in the United States,

223
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
so we needed to figure out a way to overcome that.

224
0:10:44.499,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So our thought was to literally put the theater on its head:

225
0:10:47.346,000 --> 0:10:49,000
to take those things that were previously defined

226
0:10:49.68,000 --> 0:10:5,000
as front-of-house and back-of-house

227
0:10:51.379,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and stack them above house and below house,

228
0:10:53.411,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and to create what we called a theater machine.

229
0:10:55.634,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We invest the money in the operation of the building.

230
0:10:58.141,000 --> 0:11:,000
It's almost as though the building could be placed anywhere,

231
0:11:00.987,000 --> 0:11:01,000
wherever you place it,

232
0:11:02.163,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the area under it is charged for theatrical performances.

233
0:11:04.917,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And it allowed us to go back to first principles,

234
0:11:07.263,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and redefine fly tower, acoustic enclosure, light enclosure and so forth.

235
0:11:10.869,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And at the push of a button,

236
0:11:12.363,000 --> 0:11:15,000
it allows the artistic director to move between proscenium, thrust,

237
0:11:16.014,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and in fact, arena and traverse and flat floor,

238
0:11:19.829,000 --> 0:11:21,000
in a very quick transfiguration.

239
0:11:22.248,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So in fact, using operational budget, we can --

240
0:11:25.694,000 --> 0:11:27,000
sorry, capital cost -- we can actually achieve

241
0:11:27.91,000 --> 0:11:29,000
what was no longer achievable in operational cost.

242
0:11:30.898,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And that means that the artistic director

243
0:11:32.875,000 --> 0:11:34,000
now has a palette that he or she can choose from,

244
0:11:35.264,000 --> 0:11:38,000
between a series of forms and a series of processions,

245
0:11:38.786,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because that enclosure around the theater that is normally trapped

246
0:11:41.934,000 --> 0:11:44,000
with front-of-house and back-of-house spaces has been liberated.

247
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So an artistic director has the ability to have a performance

248
0:11:48.293,000 --> 0:11:5,000
that enters in a Wagnerian procession,

249
0:11:50.432,000 --> 0:11:52,000
shows the first act in thrust,

250
0:11:52.791,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the intermission in a Greek procession,

251
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:57,000
second act in arena, and so forth.

252
0:11:58.254,000 --> 0:12:,000
So I'm going to show you what this actually means.

253
0:12:00.629,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is the theater up close.

254
0:12:02.421,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Any portion around the theater actually can be opened discretely.

255
0:12:07.515,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The light enclosure can be lifted separate to the acoustic enclosure,

256
0:12:11.437,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so you can do Beckett with Dallas as the backdrop.

257
0:12:15.146,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Portions can be opened,

258
0:12:16.335,000 --> 0:12:19,000
so you can now actually have motorcycles drive directly into the performance,

259
0:12:20.002,000 --> 0:12:22,000
or you can even just have an open-air performance,

260
0:12:22.428,000 --> 0:12:23,000
or for intermissions.

261
0:12:24.094,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The balconies all move to go between those configurations,

262
0:12:26.851,000 --> 0:12:27,000
but they also disappear.

263
0:12:28.517,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The proscenium line can also disappear.

264
0:12:31.129,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You can bring enormous objects in,

265
0:12:32.994,000 --> 0:12:33,000
so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --

266
0:12:35.009,000 --> 0:12:37,000
their first show will be a play about Charles Lindbergh,

267
0:12:37.684,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and they'll want to bring in a real aircraft.

268
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And then it also provides them, in the off-season,

269
0:12:42.635,000 --> 0:12:47,000
the ability to actually rent out their space for entirely different things.

270
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This is it from a distance.

271
0:12:53.921,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Open up entire portions for different kinds of events.

272
0:12:56.933,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And at night.

273
0:13:00.092,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Again, remove the light enclosure; keep the acoustic enclosure.

274
0:13:04.676,000 --> 0:13:05,000
This is a monster truck show.

275
0:13:06.578,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I'm going to show now the last project.

276
0:13:08.493,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This also is an unusual client.

277
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:12,000
They inverted the whole idea of development.

278
0:13:12.497,000 --> 0:13:14,000
They came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers --

279
0:13:15.348,000 --> 0:13:16,000
they said, "We want to start out

280
0:13:16.909,000 --> 0:13:18,000
by providing a contemporary art museum in Louisville.

281
0:13:19.682,000 --> 0:13:2,000
That's our main goal."

282
0:13:20.91,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And so instead of being a developer that sees an opportunity to make money,

283
0:13:24.529,000 --> 0:13:27,000
they saw an ability to be a catalyst in their downtown.

284
0:13:27.574,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And the fact that they wanted to support the contemporary art museum

285
0:13:31.178,000 --> 0:13:32,000
actually built their pro forma,

286
0:13:32.759,000 --> 0:13:33,000
so they worked in reverse.

287
0:13:34.431,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And that pro forma led us

288
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to a mixed-use building that was very large,

289
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in order to support their aspirations of the art,

290
0:13:41.328,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but it also opened up opportunities for the art itself

291
0:13:43.899,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to collaborate, interact with commercial spaces

292
0:13:46.143,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that actually artists more and more want to work within.

293
0:13:49.356,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And it also charged us with thinking about how to have

294
0:13:52.405,000 --> 0:13:53,000
something that was both a single building

295
0:13:54.393,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and a credible sort of sub-building.

296
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So this is Louisville's skyline,

297
0:13:59.567,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and I'm going to take you through the various constraints

298
0:14:02.271,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that led to the project.

299
0:14:03.488,000 --> 0:14:04,000
First: the physical constraints.

300
0:14:05.051,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We actually had to operate on three discrete sites,

301
0:14:07.476,000 --> 0:14:09,000
all of them well smaller than the size of the building.

302
0:14:10.381,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We had to operate next to the new Muhammad Ali Center, and respect it.

303
0:14:14.088,000 --> 0:14:16,000
We had to operate within the 100-year floodplain.

304
0:14:16.41,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Now, this area floods three to four times a year,

305
0:14:18.749,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and there's a levee behind our site,

306
0:14:20.51,000 --> 0:14:22,000
similar to the ones that broke in New Orleans.

307
0:14:23.687,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor,

308
0:14:27.913,000 --> 0:14:29,000
a street that cuts through the middle of these separate sites.

309
0:14:30.853,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So we're starting to build a sort of nightmare of constraints in a bathtub.

310
0:14:35.443,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Underneath the bathtub are the city's main power lines.

311
0:14:39.699,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And there is a pedestrian corridor that they wanted to add,

312
0:14:42.524,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that would link a series of cultural buildings,

313
0:14:45.498,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and a view corridor -- because this is the historic district --

314
0:14:48.488,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that they didn't want to obstruct with a new building.

315
0:14:51.06,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Laughter)

316
0:14:52.124,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And now we're going to add 1.1 million square feet.

317
0:14:55.125,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And if we did the traditional thing, that 1.1 million square feet --

318
0:14:58.364,000 --> 0:14:59,000
these are the different programs --

319
0:15:00.06,000 --> 0:15:03,000
the traditional thing would be to identify the public elements, place them on sites,

320
0:15:04.048,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and now we'd have a really terrible situation:

321
0:15:06.247,000 --> 0:15:08,000
a public thing in the middle of a bathtub that floods.

322
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And then we would size all the other elements --

323
0:15:12.621,000 --> 0:15:13,000
the different commercial elements:

324
0:15:14.3,000 --> 0:15:16,000
hotel, luxury housing, offices and so forth --

325
0:15:16.467,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and dump it on top.

326
0:15:17.696,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And we would create something that was unviable.

327
0:15:20.684,000 --> 0:15:23,000
In fact -- and you know this -- this is called the Time Warner Building.

328
0:15:24.453,000 --> 0:15:25,000
(Laughter)

329
0:15:26.151,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So our strategy was very simple.

330
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Just lift the entire block,

331
0:15:31.135,000 --> 0:15:32,000
flip some of the elements over,

332
0:15:32.794,000 --> 0:15:34,000
reposition them so they have appropriate views

333
0:15:35.628,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and relationships to downtown,

334
0:15:37.288,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and make circulation connections and reroute the road.

335
0:15:40.765,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So that's the basic concept,

336
0:15:42.316,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and now I'm going to show you what it leads to.

337
0:15:45.916,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Ok, it seems a very formal, willful gesture,

338
0:15:48.495,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but something derived entirely out of the constraints.

339
0:15:51.067,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And again, when we unveiled it, there was a sort of nervousness

340
0:15:54.072,000 --> 0:15:56,000
that this was about an architect making a statement,

341
0:15:56.533,000 --> 0:15:59,000
not an architect who was attempting to solve a series of problems.

342
0:16:00.149,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Now, within that center zone, as I said,

343
0:16:02.467,000 --> 0:16:04,000
we have the ability to mix a series of things.

344
0:16:04.646,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So here, this is sort of an x-ray --

345
0:16:07.393,000 --> 0:16:08,000
the towers are totally developer-driven.

346
0:16:09.352,000 --> 0:16:11,000
They told us the dimensions, the sizes and so forth,

347
0:16:11.826,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and we focused on taking all the public components --

348
0:16:14.347,000 --> 0:16:15,000
the lobbies, the bars --

349
0:16:15.663,000 --> 0:16:18,000
everything that different commercial elements would have,

350
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and combined it in the center, in the sort of subway map,

351
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
in the transfer zone that would also include the contemporary art museum.

352
0:16:25.742,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So it creates a situation like this, where you have artists who can operate

353
0:16:29.831,000 --> 0:16:32,000
within an art space that also has an amazing view on the 22nd floor,

354
0:16:33.733,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but it also has proximity that the curator can either open or close.

355
0:16:37.214,000 --> 0:16:4,000
It allows people on exercise bicycles to be seen,

356
0:16:40.444,000 --> 0:16:41,000
or to see the art, and so forth.

357
0:16:42.143,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It also means that if an artist wants to invade something like a swimming pool,

358
0:16:45.887,000 --> 0:16:47,000
they can begin to do their exhibition in a swimming pool,

359
0:16:48.621,000 --> 0:16:5,000
so they're not forced to always work within the confines

360
0:16:51.282,000 --> 0:16:52,000
of a contemporary gallery space.

361
0:16:52.841,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So, how to build this.

362
0:16:54.032,000 --> 0:16:55,000
It's very simple: it's a chair.

363
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So, we begin by building the cores.

364
0:16:59.456,000 --> 0:17:02,000
As we're building the cores, we build the contemporary art museum at grade.

365
0:17:03.024,000 --> 0:17:06,000
That allows us to have incredible efficiency and cost efficiency.

366
0:17:06.114,000 --> 0:17:07,000
This is not a high-budget building.

367
0:17:07.839,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The moment the cores get to mid level,

368
0:17:09.712,000 --> 0:17:12,000
we finish the art museum; we put all the mechanical equipment in it;

369
0:17:12.931,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and then we jack it up into the air.

370
0:17:14.7,000 --> 0:17:16,000
This is how they build really large aircraft hangars,

371
0:17:17.213,000 --> 0:17:19,000
for instance, the ones that they did for the A380.

372
0:17:19.597,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Finish the cores, finish the meat

373
0:17:21.461,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and you get something that looks like this.

374
0:17:23.498,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Now I only have about 30 seconds,

375
0:17:25.1,000 --> 0:17:26,000
so I want to start an animation,

376
0:17:27.022,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and we'll conclude with that.

377
0:17:28.441,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Thank you.

378
0:17:29.853,000 --> 0:17:33,000
(Applause)

379
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Chris asked me to add --

380
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:37,000
the theater is under construction,

381
0:17:37.8,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and this project will start construction in about a year,

382
0:17:40.548,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and finish in 2010.

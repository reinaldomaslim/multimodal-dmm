1
0:00:12.904,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want you to, for a moment,

2
0:00:15.452,000 --> 0:00:18,000
think about playing a game of Monopoly.

3
0:00:19.087,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Except in this game, that combination of skill, talent and luck

4
0:00:24.532,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that helped earn you success in games, as in life,

5
0:00:27.311,000 --> 0:00:28,000
has been rendered irrelevant,

6
0:00:28.736,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because this game's been rigged,

7
0:00:30.916,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and you've got the upper hand.

8
0:00:32.795,000 --> 0:00:33,000
You've got more money,

9
0:00:34.603,000 --> 0:00:36,000
more opportunities to move around the board,

10
0:00:37.164,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and more access to resources.

11
0:00:39.398,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And as you think about that experience,

12
0:00:41.292,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I want you to ask yourself:

13
0:00:43.105,000 --> 0:00:48,000
How might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game

14
0:00:48.176,000 --> 0:00:5,000
change the way you think about yourself

15
0:00:51.168,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and regard that other player?

16
0:00:54.914,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So, we ran a study on the UC Berkeley campus

17
0:00:58.019,000 --> 0:01:,000
to look at exactly that question.

18
0:01:00.283,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We brought in more than 100 pairs of strangers into the lab,

19
0:01:04.857,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and with the flip of a coin,

20
0:01:06.595,000 --> 0:01:1,000
randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game.

21
0:01:10.66,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They got two times as much money;

22
0:01:13.509,000 --> 0:01:16,000
when they passed Go, they collected twice the salary;

23
0:01:17.339,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and they got to roll both dice instead of one,

24
0:01:19.644,000 --> 0:01:21,000
so they got to move around the board a lot more.

25
0:01:21.962,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:24.018,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And over the course of 15 minutes,

27
0:01:25.75,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we watched through hidden cameras what happened.

28
0:01:29.257,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What I want to do today, for the first time,

29
0:01:31.377,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is show you a little bit of what we saw.

30
0:01:33.549,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You'll to have to pardon the sound quality,

31
0:01:35.874,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because again, these were hidden cameras.

32
0:01:37.871,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So we've provided subtitles.

33
0:01:39.951,000 --> 0:01:41,000
[Video] Rich Player: How many 500s did you have?

34
0:01:42.29,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Poor Player: Just one.

35
0:01:43.465,000 --> 0:01:44,000
RP: Are you serious? PP: Yeah.

36
0:01:44.909,000 --> 0:01:47,000
RP: I have three. (Laughs) I don't know why they gave me so much.

37
0:01:48.064,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Paul Piff: So it was quickly apparent to players that something was up.

38
0:01:51.453,000 --> 0:01:54,000
One person clearly has a lot more money than the other person,

39
0:01:54.604,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and yet, as the game unfolded,

40
0:01:57.184,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we saw very notable differences, dramatic differences begin to emerge

41
0:02:01.738,000 --> 0:02:02,000
between the two players.

42
0:02:03.488,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The rich player started to move around the board louder,

43
0:02:07.831,000 --> 0:02:1,000
literally smacking the board with the piece as he went around.

44
0:02:10.879,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Game piece smacks board)

45
0:02:12.61,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We were more likely to see signs of dominance

46
0:02:15.583,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and nonverbal signs, displays of power

47
0:02:19.62,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and celebration among the rich players.

48
0:02:23.5,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We had a bowl of pretzels positioned off to the side.

49
0:02:26.209,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's on the bottom right corner.

50
0:02:27.775,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That allowed us to watch participants' consummatory behavior.

51
0:02:31.258,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So we're just tracking how many pretzels participants eat.

52
0:02:35.782,000 --> 0:02:36,000
[Video] RP: Are those pretzels a trick?

53
0:02:37.753,000 --> 0:02:38,000
PP: I don't know.

54
0:02:39.713,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Paul Piff: OK, so no surprises, people are on to us.

55
0:02:42.852,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They wonder what that bowl of pretzels is doing there in the first place.

56
0:02:46.368,000 --> 0:02:47,000
One even asks, like you just saw,

57
0:02:48.026,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"Is that bowl of pretzels there as a trick?"

58
0:02:51.035,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And yet, despite that, the power of the situation

59
0:02:54.103,000 --> 0:02:56,000
seems to inevitably dominate,

60
0:02:56.337,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and those rich players start to eat more pretzels.

61
0:02:59.396,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:04.29,000 --> 0:03:05,000
[Video] RP: I love pretzels.

63
0:03:05.726,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:10.314,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Paul Piff: And as the game went on,

65
0:03:12.448,000 --> 0:03:14,000
one of the really interesting and dramatic patterns

66
0:03:14.947,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that we observed begin to emerge

67
0:03:18.254,000 --> 0:03:2,000
was that the rich players actually started to become ruder

68
0:03:21.08,000 --> 0:03:22,000
toward the other person --

69
0:03:23.103,000 --> 0:03:26,000
less and less sensitive to the plight of those poor, poor players,

70
0:03:26.729,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and more and more demonstrative of their material success,

71
0:03:31.288,000 --> 0:03:33,000
more likely to showcase how well they're doing.

72
0:03:36.084,000 --> 0:03:37,000
[Video] RP: I have money ...

73
0:03:37.741,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughs) I have money for everything.

74
0:03:40.013,000 --> 0:03:41,000
PP: How much is that?

75
0:03:41.51,000 --> 0:03:43,000
RP: You owe me 24 dollars.

76
0:03:45.404,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You're going to lose all your money soon.

77
0:03:48.135,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'll buy it. I have so much money.

78
0:03:50.295,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I have so much money, it takes me forever.

79
0:03:52.345,000 --> 0:03:54,000
RP 2: I'm going to buy out this whole board.

80
0:03:54.458,000 --> 0:03:56,000
RP 3: You're going to run out of money soon.

81
0:03:56.563,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I'm pretty much untouchable at this point.

82
0:03:58.635,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:00.247,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Paul Piff: And here's what I think was really, really interesting:

84
0:04:03.456,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it's that, at the end of the 15 minutes,

85
0:04:06.298,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game.

86
0:04:10.647,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And when the rich players talked about why they had inevitably won

87
0:04:14.757,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in this rigged game of Monopoly ...

88
0:04:16.453,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:21.468,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties

90
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and earn their success in the game.

91
0:04:29.829,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:30.887,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And they became far less attuned

93
0:04:33.311,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to all those different features of the situation --

94
0:04:35.847,000 --> 0:04:37,000
including that flip of a coin --

95
0:04:38.503,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that had randomly gotten them into that privileged position

96
0:04:42.526,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in the first place.

97
0:04:43.853,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that's a really, really incredible insight

98
0:04:46.71,000 --> 0:04:49,000
into how the mind makes sense of advantage.

99
0:04:52.101,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, this game of Monopoly can be used

100
0:04:54.303,000 --> 0:04:58,000
as a metaphor for understanding society and its hierarchical structure,

101
0:04:59.286,000 --> 0:05:02,000
wherein some people have a lot of wealth and a lot of status,

102
0:05:02.927,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and a lot of people don't;

103
0:05:04.435,000 --> 0:05:06,000
they have a lot less wealth and a lot less status

104
0:05:07.348,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and a lot less access to valued resources.

105
0:05:10.42,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And what my colleagues and I for the last seven years have been doing

106
0:05:13.826,000 --> 0:05:15,000
is studying the effects of these kinds of hierarchies.

107
0:05:17.706,000 --> 0:05:2,000
What we've been finding across dozens of studies

108
0:05:21.109,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and thousands of participants across this country

109
0:05:24.485,000 --> 0:05:27,000
is that as a person's levels of wealth increase,

110
0:05:29.088,000 --> 0:05:32,000
their feelings of compassion and empathy go down,

111
0:05:35.038,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and their feelings of entitlement, of deservingness,

112
0:05:38.788,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and their ideology of self-interest increase.

113
0:05:43.284,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In surveys, we've found

114
0:05:44.901,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that it's actually wealthier individuals who are more likely to moralize

115
0:05:48.788,000 --> 0:05:49,000
greed being good,

116
0:05:50.519,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and that the pursuit of self-interest is favorable and moral.

117
0:05:55.063,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now, what I want to do today is talk about some of the implications

118
0:05:58.717,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of this ideology self-interest,

119
0:06:01.668,000 --> 0:06:03,000
talk about why we should care about those implications,

120
0:06:04.336,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and end with what might be done.

121
0:06:07.565,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Some of the first studies that we ran in this area

122
0:06:10.006,000 --> 0:06:11,000
looked at helping behavior,

123
0:06:11.366,000 --> 0:06:14,000
something social psychologists call "pro-social behavior."

124
0:06:15.453,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And we were really interested

125
0:06:16.926,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in who's more likely to offer help to another person:

126
0:06:20.444,000 --> 0:06:22,000
someone who's rich or someone who's poor.

127
0:06:23.555,000 --> 0:06:24,000
In one of the studies,

128
0:06:24.847,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we bring rich and poor members of the community into the lab,

129
0:06:30.389,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and give each of them the equivalent of 10 dollars.

130
0:06:33.785,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We told the participants they could keep these 10 dollars for themselves,

131
0:06:38.021,000 --> 0:06:4,000
or they could share a portion of it, if they wanted to,

132
0:06:40.933,000 --> 0:06:42,000
with a stranger, who's totally anonymous.

133
0:06:43.301,000 --> 0:06:46,000
They'll never meet that stranger; the stranger will never meet them.

134
0:06:46.582,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And we just monitor how much people give.

135
0:06:49.554,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Individuals who made 25,000, sometimes under 15,000 dollars a year,

136
0:06:54.227,000 --> 0:06:57,000
gave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger

137
0:06:57.568,000 --> 0:07:,000
than did individuals making 150,000, 200,000 dollars a year.

138
0:07:02.983,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We've had people play games

139
0:07:05.809,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to see who's more or less likely to cheat

140
0:07:08.499,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to increase their chances of winning a prize.

141
0:07:10.877,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In one of the games, we actually rigged a computer

142
0:07:13.65,000 --> 0:07:16,000
so that die rolls over a certain score were impossible --

143
0:07:17.354,000 --> 0:07:21,000
You couldn't get above 12 in this game, and yet ...

144
0:07:22.564,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the richer you were, the more likely you were to cheat in this game

145
0:07:25.777,000 --> 0:07:27,000
to earn credits toward a $50 cash prize --

146
0:07:29.146,000 --> 0:07:31,000
sometimes by three to four times as much.

147
0:07:33.106,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We ran another study

148
0:07:34.294,000 --> 0:07:37,000
where we looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy

149
0:07:38.474,000 --> 0:07:4,000
from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified

150
0:07:41.138,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as being reserved for children --

151
0:07:43.042,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:46.662,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I'm not kidding -- I know it sounds like I'm making a joke.

153
0:07:51.221,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We explicitly told participants:

154
0:07:53.475,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"This candy is for children participating in a developmental lab nearby.

155
0:07:57.832,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They're in studies. This is for them."

156
0:07:59.985,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And we just monitored how much candy participants took.

157
0:08:03.567,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Participants who felt rich took two times as much candy

158
0:08:06.506,000 --> 0:08:07,000
as participants who felt poor.

159
0:08:09.675,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We've even studied cars.

160
0:08:12.315,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Not just any cars,

161
0:08:14.008,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but whether drivers of different kinds of cars

162
0:08:17.296,000 --> 0:08:2,000
are more or less inclined to break the law.

163
0:08:20.338,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In one of these studies,

164
0:08:22.558,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we looked at whether drivers would stop for a pedestrian

165
0:08:27.309,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that we had posed waiting to cross at a crosswalk.

166
0:08:30.193,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now in California, as you all know,

167
0:08:32.065,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because I'm sure we all do this,

168
0:08:34.493,000 --> 0:08:37,000
it's the law to stop for a pedestrian who's waiting to cross.

169
0:08:38.434,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So here's an example of how we did it.

170
0:08:40.3,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That's our confederate off to the left, posing as a pedestrian.

171
0:08:43.867,000 --> 0:08:46,000
He approaches as the red truck successfully stops.

172
0:08:48.219,000 --> 0:08:49,000
In typical California fashion,

173
0:08:50.022,000 --> 0:08:52,000
it's overtaken by the bus who almost runs our pedestrian over.

174
0:08:53.015,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:54.392,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now here's an example of a more expensive car,

176
0:08:56.621,000 --> 0:09:,000
a Prius, driving through, and a BMW doing the same.

177
0:09:03.59,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So we did this for hundreds of vehicles

178
0:09:06.029,000 --> 0:09:08,000
on several days,

179
0:09:08.512,000 --> 0:09:1,000
just tracking who stops and who doesn't.

180
0:09:12.587,000 --> 0:09:16,000
What we found was as the expensiveness of a car increased ...

181
0:09:16.864,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:18.96,000 --> 0:09:21,000
the drivers' tendencies to break the law increased as well.

183
0:09:22.215,000 --> 0:09:24,000
None of the cars -- none of the cars --

184
0:09:25.04,000 --> 0:09:28,000
in our least expensive car category

185
0:09:28.135,000 --> 0:09:29,000
broke the law.

186
0:09:29.793,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Close to 50 percent of the cars in our most expensive vehicle category

187
0:09:34.66,000 --> 0:09:35,000
broke the law.

188
0:09:37.55,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We've run other studies,

189
0:09:38.822,000 --> 0:09:41,000
finding that wealthier individuals are more likely to lie in negotiations,

190
0:09:42.733,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to endorse unethical behavior at work,

191
0:09:44.948,000 --> 0:09:46,000
like stealing cash from the cash register,

192
0:09:47.662,000 --> 0:09:49,000
taking bribes, lying to customers.

193
0:09:52.697,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Now, I don't mean to suggest

194
0:09:54.314,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior.

195
0:09:57.912,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Not at all -- in fact, I think that we all,

196
0:10:00.742,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives,

197
0:10:03.685,000 --> 0:10:05,000
struggle with these competing motivations

198
0:10:06.558,000 --> 0:10:11,000
of when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people.

199
0:10:12.273,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And that's understandable,

200
0:10:14.573,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because the American dream is an idea

201
0:10:17.494,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper,

202
0:10:22.353,000 --> 0:10:24,000
as long as we apply ourselves and work hard.

203
0:10:24.933,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And a piece of that means that sometimes,

204
0:10:27.666,000 --> 0:10:29,000
you need to put your own interests

205
0:10:30.619,000 --> 0:10:33,000
above the interests and well-being of other people around you.

206
0:10:34.152,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But what we're finding is that the wealthier you are,

207
0:10:37.547,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the more likely you are to pursue a vision of personal success,

208
0:10:41.411,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of achievement and accomplishment,

209
0:10:43.76,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to the detriment of others around you.

210
0:10:46.927,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Here I've plotted for you the mean household income

211
0:10:50.224,000 --> 0:10:53,000
received by each fifth and top five percent of the population

212
0:10:53.484,000 --> 0:10:54,000
over the last 20 years.

213
0:10:55.579,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In 1993,

214
0:10:56.837,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the differences between the different quintiles of the population,

215
0:10:59.987,000 --> 0:11:,000
in terms of income,

216
0:11:01.199,000 --> 0:11:03,000
are fairly egregious.

217
0:11:03.732,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It's not difficult to discern that there are differences.

218
0:11:06.446,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But over the last 20 years, that significant difference

219
0:11:09.299,000 --> 0:11:11,000
has become a Grand Canyon of sorts

220
0:11:11.615,000 --> 0:11:14,000
between those at the top and everyone else.

221
0:11:14.663,000 --> 0:11:17,000
In fact, the top 20 percent of our population

222
0:11:18.321,000 --> 0:11:21,000
own close to 90 percent of the total wealth in this country.

223
0:11:21.444,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We're at unprecedented levels of economic inequality.

224
0:11:27.858,000 --> 0:11:3,000
What that means is that wealth is not only becoming increasingly concentrated

225
0:11:31.723,000 --> 0:11:33,000
in the hands of a select group of individuals,

226
0:11:34.681,000 --> 0:11:38,000
but the American dream is becoming increasingly unattainable

227
0:11:39.033,000 --> 0:11:41,000
for an increasing majority of us.

228
0:11:42.227,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And if it's the case, as we've been finding,

229
0:11:45.05,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that the wealthier you are,

230
0:11:46.523,000 --> 0:11:48,000
the more entitled you feel to that wealth,

231
0:11:49.066,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the more likely you are to prioritize your own interests

232
0:11:52.088,000 --> 0:11:53,000
above the interests of other people,

233
0:11:53.868,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and be willing to do things to serve that self-interest,

234
0:11:57.417,000 --> 0:12:,000
well, then, there's no reason to think that those patterns will change.

235
0:12:01.108,000 --> 0:12:04,000
In fact, there's every reason to think that they'll only get worse,

236
0:12:04.664,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and that's what it would look like if things just stayed the same,

237
0:12:07.874,000 --> 0:12:1,000
at the same linear rate, over the next 20 years.

238
0:12:12.162,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now inequality -- economic inequality --

239
0:12:14.926,000 --> 0:12:16,000
is something we should all be concerned about,

240
0:12:17.149,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and not just because of those at the bottom of the social hierarchy,

241
0:12:20.776,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but because individuals and groups

242
0:12:23.144,000 --> 0:12:27,000
with lots of economic inequality do worse ...

243
0:12:28.349,000 --> 0:12:3,000
not just the people at the bottom, everyone.

244
0:12:31.206,000 --> 0:12:33,000
There's a lot of really compelling research

245
0:12:33.297,000 --> 0:12:35,000
coming out from top labs all over the world,

246
0:12:35.981,000 --> 0:12:39,000
showcasing the range of things that are undermined

247
0:12:40.655,000 --> 0:12:42,000
as economic inequality gets worse.

248
0:12:43.195,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Social mobility, things we really care about,

249
0:12:46.048,000 --> 0:12:48,000
physical health, social trust,

250
0:12:48.53,000 --> 0:12:5,000
all go down as inequality goes up.

251
0:12:51.486,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Similarly, negative things in social collectives and societies,

252
0:12:56.035,000 --> 0:12:58,000
things like obesity, and violence,

253
0:12:58.139,000 --> 0:12:59,000
imprisonment, and punishment,

254
0:12:59.761,000 --> 0:13:03,000
are exacerbated as economic inequality increases.

255
0:13:03.911,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Again, these are outcomes not just experienced by a few,

256
0:13:07.478,000 --> 0:13:1,000
but that resound across all strata of society.

257
0:13:10.94,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Even people at the top experience these outcomes.

258
0:13:14.219,000 --> 0:13:15,000
So what do we do?

259
0:13:17.307,000 --> 0:13:2,000
This cascade of self-perpetuating,

260
0:13:20.913,000 --> 0:13:22,000
pernicious, negative effects

261
0:13:23.422,000 --> 0:13:26,000
could seem like something that's spun out of control,

262
0:13:26.842,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and there's nothing we can do about it,

263
0:13:28.754,000 --> 0:13:3,000
certainly nothing we as individuals could do.

264
0:13:31.558,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But in fact, we've been finding in our own laboratory research

265
0:13:38.52,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that small psychological interventions,

266
0:13:43.695,000 --> 0:13:46,000
small changes to people's values,

267
0:13:46.831,000 --> 0:13:49,000
small nudges in certain directions,

268
0:13:50.212,000 --> 0:13:53,000
can restore levels of egalitarianism and empathy.

269
0:13:53.759,000 --> 0:13:57,000
For instance, reminding people of the benefits of cooperation

270
0:13:58.056,000 --> 0:13:59,000
or the advantages of community,

271
0:14:00.961,000 --> 0:14:03,000
cause wealthier individuals to be just as egalitarian

272
0:14:04.797,000 --> 0:14:05,000
as poor people.

273
0:14:07.369,000 --> 0:14:12,000
In one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long,

274
0:14:12.918,000 --> 0:14:13,000
about childhood poverty

275
0:14:15.144,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that served as a reminder of the needs of others in the world around them.

276
0:14:20.257,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And after watching that,

277
0:14:22.176,000 --> 0:14:25,000
we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time

278
0:14:26.242,000 --> 0:14:3,000
to a stranger presented to them in the lab, who was in distress.

279
0:14:31.026,000 --> 0:14:34,000
After watching this video, an hour later,

280
0:14:34.27,000 --> 0:14:37,000
rich people became just as generous of their own time

281
0:14:37.674,000 --> 0:14:39,000
to help out this other person, a stranger,

282
0:14:39.844,000 --> 0:14:4,000
as someone who's poor,

283
0:14:41.313,000 --> 0:14:45,000
suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical,

284
0:14:45.595,000 --> 0:14:48,000
but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values,

285
0:14:49.375,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy.

286
0:14:53.172,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And beyond the walls of our lab,

287
0:14:54.773,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we're even beginning to see signs of change in society.

288
0:14:58.893,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Bill Gates, one of our nation's wealthiest individuals,

289
0:15:02.065,000 --> 0:15:03,000
in his Harvard commencement speech,

290
0:15:04.017,000 --> 0:15:06,000
talked about the problem of inequality facing society

291
0:15:06.902,000 --> 0:15:08,000
as being the most daunting challenge,

292
0:15:09.589,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and talked about what must be done to combat it,

293
0:15:12.447,000 --> 0:15:17,000
saying, "Humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries --

294
0:15:17.489,000 --> 0:15:2,000
but in how those discoveries are applied

295
0:15:20.545,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to reduce inequity."

296
0:15:23.356,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And there's the Giving Pledge,

297
0:15:25.309,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in which more than 100 of our nation's wealthiest individuals

298
0:15:30.077,000 --> 0:15:33,000
are pledging half of their fortunes to charity.

299
0:15:33.886,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And there's the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements,

300
0:15:39.136,000 --> 0:15:4,000
like "We are the 1 percent,"

301
0:15:41.508,000 --> 0:15:42,000
"Resource Generation,"

302
0:15:43.556,000 --> 0:15:44,000
or "Wealth for Common Good,"

303
0:15:45.469,000 --> 0:15:49,000
in which the most privileged members of the population,

304
0:15:49.832,000 --> 0:15:51,000
members of the one percent and elsewhere,

305
0:15:52.8,000 --> 0:15:53,000
people who are wealthy,

306
0:15:54.662,000 --> 0:15:57,000
are using their own economic resources,

307
0:15:58.139,000 --> 0:16:02,000
adults and youth alike -- that's what's most striking to me --

308
0:16:02.396,000 --> 0:16:05,000
leveraging their own privilege, their own economic resources,

309
0:16:05.981,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to combat inequality

310
0:16:08.846,000 --> 0:16:1,000
by advocating for social policies,

311
0:16:11.866,000 --> 0:16:12,000
changes in social values

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So I just want to tell you my story.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I spend a lot of time

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
teaching adults how to use visual language

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and doodling in the workplace.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And naturally, I encounter a lot of resistance,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because it's considered to be anti-intellectual

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and counter to serious learning.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But I have a problem with that belief,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because I know that doodling has a profound impact

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
on the way that we can process information

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and the way that we can solve problems.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I was curious about why there was a disconnect

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
between the way our society perceives doodling

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the way that the reality is.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So I discovered some very interesting things.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
For example, there's no such thing

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
as a flattering definition of a doodle.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In the 17th century, a doodle was a simpleton or a fool --

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
as in Yankee Doodle.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In the 18th century, it became a verb,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it meant to swindle or ridicule or to make fun of someone.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In the 19th century, it was a corrupt politician.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And today, we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition,

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
at least to me, which is the following:

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
To doodle officially means

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to dawdle,

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to dilly dally, to monkey around,

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to make meaningless marks,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to do something of little value, substance or import,

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and -- my personal favorite --

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to do nothing.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
No wonder people are averse to doodling at work.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Doing nothing at work is akin to masturbating at work;

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
it's totally inappropriate.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Additionally, I've heard horror stories

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
from people whose teachers scolded them, of course, for doodling in classrooms.

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And they have bosses who scold them for doodling in the boardroom.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There is a powerful cultural norm against doodling

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in settings in which we are supposed to learn something.

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And unfortunately,

42
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the press tends to reinforce this norm

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
when they're reporting on a doodling scene --

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
of an important person at a confirmation hearing and the like --

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
they typically use words like "discovered"

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or "caught" or "found out,"

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
as if there's some sort of criminal act being committed.

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And additionally, there is a psychological aversion to doodling --

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
thank you, Freud.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
In the 1930s, Freud told us all

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that you could analyze people's psyches

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
based on their doodles.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is not accurate, but it did happen to Tony Blair

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
at the Davos Forum in 2005,

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
when his doodles were, of course, "discovered"

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and he was labeled the following things.

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now it turned out to be Bill Gates' doodle.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And Bill, if you're here, nobody thinks you're megalomaniacal.

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But that does contribute

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to people not wanting to share their doodles.

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And here is the real deal. Here's what I believe.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I think that our culture

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is so intensely focused on verbal information

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that we're almost blinded to the value of doodling.

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I'm not comfortable with that.

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And so because of that belief that I think needs to be burst,

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
I'm here to send us all hurtling back to the truth.

69
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And here's the truth:

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
doodling is an incredibly powerful tool,

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and it is a tool that we need to remember and to re-learn.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So here's a new definition for doodling.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I hope there's someone in here from The Oxford English Dictionary,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because I want to talk to you later.

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Here's the real definition:

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Doodling is really to make spontaneous marks to help yourself think.

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That is why millions of people doodle.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Here's another interesting truth about the doodle:

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
People who doodle when they're exposed to verbal information

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
retain more of that information

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
than their non-doodling counterparts.

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We think doodling is something you do when you lose focus,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but in reality, it is a preemptive measure

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to stop you from losing focus.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Additionally, it has a profound effect

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
on creative problem-solving

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and deep information processing.

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
There are four ways that learners intake information

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
so that they can make decisions.

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
They are visual, auditory,

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
reading and writing and kinesthetic.

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now in order for us to really chew on information

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and do something with it,

94
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we have to engage at least two of those modalities,

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
or we have to engage one of those modalities

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
coupled with an emotional experience.

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The incredible contribution of the doodle

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
is that it engages all four learning modalities simultaneously

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with the possibility of an emotional experience.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That is a pretty solid contribution

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for a behavior equated with doing nothing.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This is so nerdy,

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but this made me cry when I discovered this.

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So they did anthropological research

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
into the unfolding of artistic activity in children,

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and they found that, across space and time,

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
all children exhibit the same evolution in visual logic

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as they grow.

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In other words, they have a shared and growing

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
complexity in visual language

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that happens in a predictable order.

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And I think that is incredible.

113
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I think that means doodling is native to us

114
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and we simply are denying ourselves that instinct.

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And finally, a lot a people aren't privy to this,

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but the doodle is a precursor

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to some of our greatest cultural assets.

118
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This is but one:

119
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
this is Frank Gehry the architect's precursor to the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi.

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So here is my point:

121
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Under no circumstances should doodling be eradicated

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
from a classroom or a boardroom

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or even the war room.

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
On the contrary,

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
doodling should be leveraged in precisely those situations

126
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
where information density is very high

127
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and the need for processing that information is very high.

128
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I will go you one further.

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Because doodling is so universally accessible

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and it is not intimidating as an art form,

131
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
it can be leveraged as a portal

132
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
through which we move people

133
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
into higher levels of visual literacy.

134
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
My friends, the doodle has never been

135
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the nemesis of intellectual thought.

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In reality, it is one of its greatest allies.

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Thank you.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Applause)

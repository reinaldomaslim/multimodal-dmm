1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So today, I'm going to tell you about some people

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The first one is happening right here in Chicago.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Brenda Palms-Farber was hired

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to help ex-convicts reenter society

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and keep them from going back into prison.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Currently, taxpayers spend

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
about 60,000 dollars per year

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
sending a person to jail.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I find it interesting that, for every one dollar

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we spend, however, on early childhood education,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
like Head Start,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we save 17 dollars

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
on stuff like incarceration in the future.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is more than what it costs

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to send one person to Harvard as well.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
took a look at her challenge

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and came up

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
with a not-so-obvious solution:

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
create a business

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that produces skin care products from honey.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that has real potential.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She hired seemingly unemployable men and women

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to care for the bees, harvest the honey

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and make value-added products

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that they marketed themselves,

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and that were later sold at Whole Foods.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
She combined employment experience and training

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
with life skills they needed,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like anger-management and teamwork,

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and also how to talk to future employers

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
about how their experiences

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and their eagerness to learn more.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Less than four percent

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of the folks that went through her program

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
actually go back to jail.

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So these young men and women learned job-readiness

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and life skills through bee keeping

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and became productive citizens in the process.

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Talk about a sweet beginning.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and lots of people know

49
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that L.A. has its issues.

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They have not enough water on most days

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and too much to handle when it rains.

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Currently, 20 percent

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
of California's energy consumption

55
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
is used to pump water

56
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
into mostly Southern California.

57
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Their spending loads, loads,

58
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to channel that rainwater out into the ocean

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
when it rains and floods as well.

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help

61
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
L.A. cut infrastructure costs

62
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
associated with water management and urban heat island --

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
linking trees, people and technology

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to create a more livable city.

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
also helps cool our cities.

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Because, come to think about it,

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
do you really want air-conditioning,

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or is it a cooler room that you want?

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So a few years ago,

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
L.A. County

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to repair the city schools.

75
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And Andy and his team discovered

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars

77
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.

78
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And by presenting a really strong economic case,

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
they convinced the L.A. government

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that replacing that asphalt

81
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
with trees and other greenery,

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
was replaced or avoided,

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
while employment

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
for people to maintain those grounds went up,

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
resulting in a net-savings to the system,

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now Judy Bonds

92
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is a coal miner's daughter.

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Her family has eight generations

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And if anyone should be clinging

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to the former glory of the coal mining history,

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and of the town,

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
it should be Judy.

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But the way coal is mined right now is different

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
from the deep mines that her father

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and her father's father would go down into

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now, two dozen men

104
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
can tear down a mountain in several months,

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and only for about a few years' worth of coal.

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It can make a mountain go from this to this

108
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in a few short months.

109
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places --

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.

111
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with

112
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
this strange little cough

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
after being only there for just a few hours or so --

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
not just miners, but everybody.

115
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and her water poisoned.

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And the coal companies just move on

118
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
after the mountain was emptied,

119
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
leaving even more unemployment in their wake.

120
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy

121
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
on an intact mountain,

122
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and one that was reduced in elevation

123
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
by over 2,000 feet.

124
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs,

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or centuries of clean energy

126
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency

127
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
based on technical skills,

128
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and developing local knowledge

129
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
about how to get the most out of that region's wind.

130
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
She calculated the up-front cost

131
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and the payback over time,

132
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and it's a net-plus on so many levels

133
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for the local, national and global economy.

134
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,

135
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but the wind energy actually pays back forever.

136
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it gives them a lot of misery.

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The water is turned into goo.

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Most people are still unemployed,

140
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
leading to most of the same kinds of social problems

141
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that unemployed people in inner cities also experience --

142
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
drug and alcohol abuse,

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.

144
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Now Judy and I -- I have to say --

145
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
totally related to each other.

146
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Not quite an obvious alliance.

147
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.

148
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
I mean, they are not --

149
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
or anything like that.

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,

152
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
says, "Save the endangered hillbillies."

153
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and totally understand that this is what it's all about.

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But just a few months ago,

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Judy was diagnosed

157
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with stage-three lung cancer.

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Yeah.

159
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.

160
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I just find it so bizarre

161
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that she's suffering from the same thing

162
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that she tried so hard to protect people from.

163
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But her dream

164
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of Coal River Mountain Wind

165
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is her legacy.

166
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And she might not

167
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
get to see that mountaintop.

168
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But rather than writing

169
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
yet some kind of manifesto or something,

170
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
she's leaving behind

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
a business plan to make it happen.

172
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
That's what my homegirl is doing.

173
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So I'm so proud of that.

174
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Applause)

175
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But these three people

176
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
don't know each other,

177
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but they do have an awful lot in common.

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They're all problem solvers,

179
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and they're just some of the many examples

180
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in the examples of the work that I do now.

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I was really lucky to have them all featured

183
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show

184
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
called ThePromisedLand.org.

185
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Now they're all very practical visionaries.

186
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
They take a look at the demands that are out there --

187
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
beauty products, healthy schools, electricity --

188
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.

189
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And when the cheapest solutions

190
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
involve reducing the number of jobs,

191
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
you're left with unemployed people,

192
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and those people aren't cheap.

193
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,

194
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and they include generationally impoverished,

195
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
traumatized vets returning from the Middle East,

196
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
people coming out of jail.

197
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And for the veterans in particular,

198
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase

199
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.

200
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I think that number's probably going to go up.

201
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
They're not the largest number of people,

202
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but they are some of the most expensive --

203
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,

204
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
poor performance by their kids in schools

205
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and also poor health as a result of stress.

206
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So these three guys all understand

207
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
how to productively channel dollars

208
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
through our local economies

209
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to meet existing market demands,

210
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
reduce the social problems that we have now

211
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and prevent new problems in the future.

212
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And there are plenty of other examples like that.

213
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
One problem: waste handling and unemployment.

214
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Even when we think or talk about recycling,

215
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills

216
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --

217
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
they leave much to be recycled.

218
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.

219
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --

220
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,

221
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,

222
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
or you use recycled materials

223
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to make goods that you can actually use and sell.

224
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We can create these local markets and incentives

225
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
for recycled materials

226
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to be used as raw materials for manufacturing.

227
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,

228
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but our mayor decided what he wanted to see

229
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
was a jail on that same spot.

230
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --

231
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
but after many years,

232
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the city wanted to build a jail.

233
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.

234
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.

235
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Working-class and poor urban Americans

236
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
are not benefiting economically

237
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
from our current food system.

238
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It relies too much on transportation,

239
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
chemical fertilization, big use of water

240
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and also refrigeration.

241
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Mega agricultural operations

242
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,

243
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product

244
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
that costs us billions in healthcare

245
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and lost productivity.

246
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And so we know "urban ag"

247
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is a big buzz topic this time of the year,

248
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
but it's mostly gardening,

249
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
which has some value in community building -- lots of it --

250
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but it's not in terms of creating jobs

251
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
or for food production.

252
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The numbers just aren't there.

253
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork

254
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to integrate urban ag and rural food systems

255
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad

256
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce

257
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in every city,

258
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that uses regional growing power

259
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and augments it with indoor growing facilities,

260
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
owned and operated by small growers,

261
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
where now there are only consumers.

262
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas

263
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
who are losing out because they really can't meet

264
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the year-round demand for produce.

265
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
It's not a competition with rural farm;

266
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
it's actually reinforcements.

267
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It allies in a really positive

268
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and economically viable food system.

269
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands

270
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
for hospitals,

271
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
senior centers, schools, daycare centers,

272
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.

273
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is smart infrastructure.

274
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And how we manage our built environment

275
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
affects the health and well-being of people every single day.

276
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Our municipalities, rural and urban,

277
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
play the operational course of infrastructure --

278
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
things like waste disposal, energy demand,

279
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates

280
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and the impacts of various public health costs.

281
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways

282
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
for municipalities to handle

283
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
both infrastructure and social needs.

284
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And we want to shift the systems

285
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens

286
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to become part of the tax base.

287
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And imagine a national business model

288
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure

289
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to improve local economic stability.

290
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.

291
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
These examples indicate a trend.

292
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.

293
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,

294
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the good news is that it's growing.

295
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And we all need to be invested in it.

296
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.

297
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And I call it "hometown security."

298
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The recession has us reeling and fearful,

299
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and there's something in the air these days

300
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that is also very empowering.

301
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It's a realization

302
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that we are the key

303
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to our own recovery.

304
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities

305
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
where we think local and we act local.

306
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And when we do that, our neighbors --

307
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
be they next-door, or in the next state,

308
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
or in the next country --

309
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
will be just fine.

310
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The sum of the local is the global.

311
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,

312
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
putting people to work,

313
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
restoring our natural systems.

314
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Hometown security means creating wealth here at home,

315
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
instead of destroying it overseas.

316
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Tackling social and environmental problems

317
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
at the same time with the same solution

318
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
yields great cost savings,

319
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
wealth generation and national security.

320
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Many great and inspiring solutions

321
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
have been generated across America.

322
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The challenge for us now

323
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is to identify and support countless more.

324
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own,

325
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but it's not like the old saying,

326
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
"charity begins at home."

327
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.

328
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And it's about leading in a world

329
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.

330
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And reading that book made me reexamine that theory

331
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
because I need to explain what I mean by that.

332
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
See, my dad

333
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
was a great, great man in many ways.

334
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
He grew up in the segregated South,

335
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
escaped lynching and all that

336
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
during some really hard times,

337
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings

338
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.

339
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
But, like all of us, he had some problems.

340
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Laughter)

341
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And his was gambling,

342
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
compulsively.

343
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"

344
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
meant that my payday -- or someone else's --

345
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.

346
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So you need to help him out.

347
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And sometimes I would loan him money

348
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
from my after-school or summer jobs,

349
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and he always had the great intention

350
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
of paying me back with interest,

351
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
of course, after he hit it big.

352
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And he did sometimes, believe it or not,

353
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
at a racetrack in Los Angeles --

354
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.

355
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
He made 15,000 dollars cash

356
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and bought the house that I grew up in.

357
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So I'm not that unhappy about that.

358
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But listen, I did feel obligated to him,

359
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and I grew up -- then I grew up.

360
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And I'm a grown woman now,

361
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and I have learned a few things along the way.

362
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
To me, charity

363
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
often is just about giving,

364
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
because you're supposed to,

365
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
or because it's what you've always done,

366
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
or it's about giving until it hurts.

367
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I'm about providing the means

368
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to build something that will grow

369
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and intensify its original investment

370
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and not just require greater giving next year --

371
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I'm not trying to feed the habit.

372
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I spent some years

373
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
watching how good intentions for community empowerment,

374
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that were supposed to be there

375
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
to support the community and empower it,

376
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
actually left people

377
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.

378
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And over the past 20 years,

379
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars

380
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
on social problems,

381
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
yet educational outcomes,

382
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
malnutrition, incarceration,

383
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
obesity, diabetes, income disparity,

384
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
they've all gone up with some exceptions --

385
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in particular, infant mortality

386
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
among people in poverty --

387
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.

388
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And I know a little bit about these issues,

389
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
because, for many years, I spent a long time

390
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
in the non-profit industrial complex,

391
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and I'm a recovering executive director,

392
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
two years clean.

393
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
(Laughter)

394
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But during that time, I realized that it was about projects

395
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and developing them on the local level

396
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
that really was going to do the right thing for our communities.

397
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But I really did struggle for financial support.

398
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
The greater our success,

399
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
the less money came in from foundations.

400
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
And I tell you, being on the TED stage

401
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year

402
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.

403
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And by the time I'd moved on,

404
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I was actually covering a third

405
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.

406
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And I think because early on, frankly,

407
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.

408
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
But since then,

409
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk

410
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
became this little thing.

411
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But I did in fact get married in it.

412
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Over here.

413
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.

414
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
The South Bronx Greenway

415
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.

416
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Since then, we got

417
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money

418
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to come and get here.

419
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And we love this, because I love construction now,

420
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
because we're watching these things actually happen.

421
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
So I want everyone to understand

422
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
the critical importance

423
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
of shifting charity into enterprise.

424
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I started my firm to help communities across the country

425
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
realize their own potential

426
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
to improve everything about the quality of life for their people.

427
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Hometown security

428
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
is next on my to-do list.

429
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
What we need are people who see the value

430
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
in investing in these types of local enterprises,

431
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
who will partner with folks like me

432
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation

433
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
as well as understand the growing social costs

434
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
of business as usual.

435
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
We need to work together

436
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
to embrace and repair our land,

437
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
repair our power systems

438
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and repair ourselves.

439
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
It's time to stop building

440
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
the shopping malls, the prisons,

441
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
the stadiums

442
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and other tributes to all of our collective failures.

443
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
It is time that we start building

444
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
living monuments to hope and possibility.

445
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Thank you very much.

446
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
(Applause)

0:00:52.555,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Hammer)

3
0:00:58.444,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

4
0:01:19.336,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Microwave beeps) (Laughter)

5
0:01:30.956,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You probably all agree with me

6
0:01:32.981,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that this is a very nice road.

7
0:01:35.756,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's made of asphalt,

8
0:01:37.915,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,

9
0:01:41.149,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but not always, especially not on these days as today,

10
0:01:45.283,000 --> 0:01:46,000
when it's raining a lot.

11
0:01:47.134,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.

12
0:01:50.082,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle,

13
0:01:52.376,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.

14
0:01:56.321,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise.

15
0:01:59.431,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's a noisy material,

16
0:02:01.045,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,

17
0:02:03.489,000 --> 0:02:07,000
very close to cities, then we would like a silent road.

18
0:02:07.621,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The solution for that is to make roads

19
0:02:10.89,000 --> 0:02:12,000
out of porous asphalt.

20
0:02:13.067,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Porous asphalt, a material that we use now

21
0:02:15.058,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in most of the highways in the Netherlands,

22
0:02:18.017,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it has pores and water can just rain through it,

23
0:02:21.461,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,

24
0:02:24.362,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and you have a road that's easy to drive on,

25
0:02:26.451,000 --> 0:02:27,000
so no splash water anymore.

26
0:02:28.381,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Also the noise will disappear in these pores.

27
0:02:31.543,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,

28
0:02:34.566,000 --> 0:02:36,000
so it's a very silent road.

29
0:02:37.154,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It also has disadvantages, of course,

30
0:02:40.699,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.

31
0:02:44.861,000 --> 0:02:46,000
What is raveling? You see that in this road

32
0:02:47.786,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that the stones at the surface come off.

33
0:02:50.407,000 --> 0:02:55,000
First you get one stone, then several more,

34
0:02:55.685,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and more and more and more and more,

35
0:02:57.427,000 --> 0:03:,000
and then they -- well, I will not do that. (Laughter)

36
0:03:00.994,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But they can damage your windshield,

37
0:03:03.908,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so you're not happy with that.

38
0:03:05.698,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.

39
0:03:09.688,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Sometimes you can create potholes with that.

40
0:03:12.304,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Ha. He's ready.

41
0:03:16.365,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,

42
0:03:19.55,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but we have a solution.

43
0:03:21.093,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.

44
0:03:24.351,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only

45
0:03:26.351,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a small amount of binder between the stones.

46
0:03:29.123,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,

47
0:03:32.442,000 --> 0:03:34,000
this binder, this bitumen,

48
0:03:35.17,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,

49
0:03:37.843,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,

50
0:03:39.788,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and it delaminates from the aggregates.

51
0:03:41.51,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --

52
0:03:44.07,000 --> 0:03:46,000
what we just saw here.

53
0:03:47.066,000 --> 0:03:5,000
To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.

54
0:03:50.88,000 --> 0:03:52,000
If we can make this material self-healing,

55
0:03:53.541,000 --> 0:03:56,000
then probably we have a solution.

56
0:03:56.734,000 --> 0:04:,000
So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,

57
0:04:01.328,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,

58
0:04:04.813,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.

59
0:04:08.717,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So then you have asphalt

60
0:04:10.462,000 --> 0:04:13,000
with very small pieces of steel wool in it.

61
0:04:13.529,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Then you need a machine, like you see here,

62
0:04:16.32,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine.

63
0:04:19.459,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.

64
0:04:23.508,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Then what you do is you heat up the steel,

65
0:04:26.19,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you melt the bitumen,

66
0:04:27.681,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,

67
0:04:30.247,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and the stones are again fixed to the surface.

68
0:04:33.454,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take

69
0:04:37.416,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the big induction machine here onstage.

70
0:04:39.653,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So a microwave is a similar system.

71
0:04:42.533,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out

72
0:04:46.178,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to see what happened.

73
0:04:49.43,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So this is the specimen coming out now.

74
0:04:51.923,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab

75
0:04:56.316,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to heat up the specimens.

76
0:04:58.588,000 --> 0:05:,000
We tested a lot of specimens there,

77
0:05:00.678,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and then the government, they actually saw our results,

78
0:05:03.853,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that."

79
0:05:07.803,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So they donated to us a piece of highway,

80
0:05:10.119,000 --> 0:05:13,000
400 meters of the A58, where we had to make

81
0:05:13.606,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a test track to test this material.

82
0:05:16.116,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,

83
0:05:19.648,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and then of course this road will last several years

84
0:05:24.146,000 --> 0:05:27,000
without any damage. That's what we know from practice.

85
0:05:27.434,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So we took a lot of samples from this road

86
0:05:30.213,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and we tested them in the lab.

87
0:05:32.482,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So we did aging on the samples,

88
0:05:35.399,000 --> 0:05:38,000
did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,

89
0:05:39.011,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and healed them and tested them again.

90
0:05:41.837,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Several times we can repeat that.

91
0:05:43.741,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So actually, the conclusion from this research is that

92
0:05:45.966,000 --> 0:05:48,000
if we go on the road every four years

93
0:05:49.284,000 --> 0:05:51,000
with our healing machine -- this is the big version

94
0:05:52.164,000 --> 0:05:53,000
we have made to go on the real road --

95
0:05:54.069,000 --> 0:05:55,000
if we go on the road every four years

96
0:05:55.939,000 --> 0:05:58,000
we can double the surface life of this road,

97
0:05:59.689,000 --> 0:06:01,000
which of course saves a lot of money.

98
0:06:01.866,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Well, to conclude, I can say

99
0:06:04.043,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that we made a material

100
0:06:06.799,000 --> 0:06:09,000
using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,

101
0:06:10.579,000 --> 0:06:12,000
using induction energy to really

102
0:06:13.088,000 --> 0:06:15,000
increase the surface life of the road,

103
0:06:15.755,000 --> 0:06:16,000
double the surface life you can even do,

104
0:06:17.505,000 --> 0:06:2,000
so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.

105
0:06:21.169,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And now you're of course curious if it also worked.

106
0:06:24.642,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.

107
0:06:27.745,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Actually, it still has to cool down first

108
0:06:30.324,000 --> 0:06:32,000
before I can show you that the healing works.

109
0:06:32.664,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But I will do a trial.

110
0:06:35.532,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.

111
0:06:38.291,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Thank you.

112
0:06:39.641,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Applause)

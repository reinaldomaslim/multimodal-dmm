1
0:00:13.04,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What do augmented reality

2
0:00:15.198,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and professional football

3
0:00:16.604,000 --> 0:00:18,000
have to do with empathy?

4
0:00:18.798,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And what is the air speed velocity

5
0:00:20.983,000 --> 0:00:22,000
of an unladen swallow?

6
0:00:23.158,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer

7
0:00:25.778,000 --> 0:00:26,000
one of those questions today,

8
0:00:26.895,000 --> 0:00:28,000
so please, try and contain your disappointment.

9
0:00:29.186,000 --> 0:00:31,000
When most people think about augmented reality,

10
0:00:31.658,000 --> 0:00:33,000
they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise

11
0:00:34.063,000 --> 0:00:35,000
waving his hands in the air,

12
0:00:35.973,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but augmented reality is not science fiction.

13
0:00:39.232,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Augmented reality is something that will happen

14
0:00:41.507,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in our lifetime, and it will happen

15
0:00:43.711,000 --> 0:00:44,000
because we have the tools to make it happen,

16
0:00:45.422,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and people need to be aware of that,

17
0:00:47.205,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because augmented reality will change our lives

18
0:00:49.686,000 --> 0:00:52,000
just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.

19
0:00:53.469,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now how do we get to augmented reality?

20
0:00:56.07,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Step one is the step I'm wearing right now,

21
0:00:58.126,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Google Glass.

22
0:00:59.53,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.

23
0:01:02.15,000 --> 0:01:03,000
What you may not be familiar with

24
0:01:03.597,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is that Google Glass is a device

25
0:01:06.037,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that will allow you to see what I see.

26
0:01:09.679,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It will allow you to experience what it is like

27
0:01:11.695,000 --> 0:01:13,000
to be a professional athlete on the field.

28
0:01:13.991,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Right now, the only way you can be on the field

29
0:01:17.512,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is for me to try and describe it to you.

30
0:01:19.288,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I have to use words.

31
0:01:20.799,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I have to create a framework that you then fill in

32
0:01:23.147,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with your imagination.

33
0:01:25.098,000 --> 0:01:29,000
With Google Glass, we can put that

34
0:01:29.275,000 --> 0:01:3,000
underneath a helmet,

35
0:01:30.885,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and we can get a sense of what it's like

36
0:01:33.031,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,

37
0:01:36.13,000 --> 0:01:38,000
your blood pounding in your ears.

38
0:01:38.203,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You can get a sense of what it's like

39
0:01:40.11,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to have a 250-pound man

40
0:01:42.997,000 --> 0:01:43,000
sprinting at you

41
0:01:44.658,000 --> 0:01:45,000
trying to decapitate you

42
0:01:46.634,000 --> 0:01:47,000
with every ounce of his being.

43
0:01:48.465,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I've been on the receiving end of that,

44
0:01:49.851,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and it doesn't feel very good.

45
0:01:51.408,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like

46
0:01:53.987,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet

47
0:01:55.914,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to give you a taste of that.

48
0:01:57.148,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage

49
0:02:00.059,000 --> 0:02:02,000
because the NFL thinks emergent technology

50
0:02:02.474,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is what happens when a submarine surfaces,

51
0:02:04.722,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but — (Laughter) — we do what we can.

52
0:02:08.685,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So let's pull up some video.

53
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Video) Chris Kluwe: Go.

54
0:02:19.292,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Ugh, getting tackled sucks.

55
0:02:21.429,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Hold on, let's get a little closer.

56
0:02:24.387,000 --> 0:02:25,000
All right, ready?

57
0:02:25.765,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Go!

58
0:02:29.881,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,

59
0:02:31.459,000 --> 0:02:33,000
small taste of what it's like to get tackled

60
0:02:33.726,000 --> 0:02:34,000
on the football field

61
0:02:34.848,000 --> 0:02:35,000
from the perspective of the tacklee.

62
0:02:36.727,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, you may have noticed there are

63
0:02:37.98,000 --> 0:02:38,000
some people missing there:

64
0:02:39.075,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the rest of the team.

65
0:02:40.901,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We have some video of that

66
0:02:42.641,000 --> 0:02:43,000
courtesy of the University of Washington.

67
0:02:44.145,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Video) Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!

68
0:02:48.501,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!

69
0:02:52.416,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Oh!

70
0:02:56.155,000 --> 0:02:57,000
CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer

71
0:02:58.076,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to what it's like to be on that field,

72
0:03:00.026,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but this is nowhere what it's like

73
0:03:01.999,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to be on the NFL.

74
0:03:04.437,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Fans want that experience.

75
0:03:06.198,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Fans want to be on that field.

76
0:03:07.442,000 --> 0:03:09,000
They want to be their favorite players,

77
0:03:09.606,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and they've already talked to me on YouTube,

78
0:03:12.338,000 --> 0:03:13,000
they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,

79
0:03:13.414,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?

80
0:03:15.362,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Can you get this on a running back?

81
0:03:16.554,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We want that experience."

82
0:03:18.147,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well, once we have that experience with GoPro

83
0:03:20.292,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and Google Glass,

84
0:03:21.615,000 --> 0:03:22,000
how do we make it more immersive?

85
0:03:23.006,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How do we take that next step?

86
0:03:24.201,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Well, we take that step

87
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by going to something called the Oculus Rift,

88
0:03:28.789,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.

89
0:03:30.896,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The Oculus Rift has been described as one of

90
0:03:32.883,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,

91
0:03:35.79,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and that is not empty hype.

92
0:03:37.273,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype

93
0:03:39.433,000 --> 0:03:41,000
with this video.

94
0:03:43.665,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Video) Man: Oh! Oh!

95
0:03:48.524,000 --> 0:03:52,000
No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!

96
0:03:53.391,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Oh my God! Aaaah!

97
0:03:57.952,000 --> 0:04:,000
CK: So that is the experience of a man

98
0:04:01.237,000 --> 0:04:03,000
on a roller coaster

99
0:04:03.251,000 --> 0:04:05,000
in fear of his life.

100
0:04:06.03,000 --> 0:04:08,000
What do you think that fan's experience

101
0:04:08.702,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is going to be when we take the video footage

102
0:04:10.663,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,

103
0:04:13.775,000 --> 0:04:14,000
shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm

104
0:04:15.513,000 --> 0:04:17,000
before sprinting in for a touchdown?

105
0:04:17.607,000 --> 0:04:18,000
What do you think that fan's experience

106
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is going to be when he's Messi

107
0:04:21.156,000 --> 0:04:22,000
sprinting down the pitch

108
0:04:22.376,000 --> 0:04:23,000
putting the ball in the back of the net,

109
0:04:23.878,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or Federer serving in Wimbledon?

110
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What do you think his experience is going to be

111
0:04:28.492,000 --> 0:04:29,000
when he is going down the side of a mountain

112
0:04:30.43,000 --> 0:04:31,000
at over 70 miles an hour

113
0:04:32.207,000 --> 0:04:35,000
as an Olympic downhill skier?

114
0:04:35.226,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I think adult diaper sales may surge.

115
0:04:37.551,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

116
0:04:38.46,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But this is not yet augmented reality.

117
0:04:41.391,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This is only virtual reality, V.R.

118
0:04:43.307,000 --> 0:04:45,000
How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?

119
0:04:45.721,000 --> 0:04:47,000
We get to augmented reality

120
0:04:47.83,000 --> 0:04:49,000
when coaches and managers and owners

121
0:04:50.403,000 --> 0:04:52,000
look at this information streaming in

122
0:04:52.557,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that people want to see, and they say,

123
0:04:53.943,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"How do we use this to make our teams better?

124
0:04:56.915,000 --> 0:04:58,000
How do we use this to win games?"

125
0:04:58.94,000 --> 0:05:,000
Because teams always use technology to win games.

126
0:05:01.402,000 --> 0:05:02,000
They like winning. It makes them money.

127
0:05:03.18,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So a brief history of technology in the NFL.

128
0:05:06.156,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In 1965, the Baltimore Colts

129
0:05:08.167,000 --> 0:05:09,000
put a wristband on their quarterback

130
0:05:09.82,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to allow him to call plays quicker.

131
0:05:12.114,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.

132
0:05:13.518,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Other teams followed suit.

133
0:05:15.113,000 --> 0:05:17,000
More people watched the game because it was more exciting.

134
0:05:17.276,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It was faster.

135
0:05:18.73,000 --> 0:05:21,000
In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios

136
0:05:22.13,000 --> 0:05:23,000
into the helmets of the quarterbacks,

137
0:05:24.057,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and later the defense.

138
0:05:25.301,000 --> 0:05:27,000
More people watched games because it was faster.

139
0:05:27.69,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It was more entertaining.

140
0:05:29.356,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In 2023, imagine you're a player

141
0:05:32.469,000 --> 0:05:33,000
walking back to the huddle,

142
0:05:33.92,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and you have your next play displayed

143
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor

144
0:05:39.226,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that you already wear right now.

145
0:05:41.468,000 --> 0:05:42,000
No more having to worry about forgetting plays.

146
0:05:43.335,000 --> 0:05:45,000
No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook.

147
0:05:45.996,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You just go out and react.

148
0:05:47.923,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And coaches really want this,

149
0:05:49.371,000 --> 0:05:51,000
because missed assignments lose you games,

150
0:05:51.924,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and coaches hate losing games.

151
0:05:53.98,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Losing games gets you fired as a coach.

152
0:05:56.237,000 --> 0:05:57,000
They don't want that.

153
0:05:58.024,000 --> 0:06:,000
But augmented reality is not just

154
0:06:00.667,000 --> 0:06:01,000
an enhanced playbook.

155
0:06:02.331,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data

156
0:06:05.635,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and use it in real time

157
0:06:07.18,000 --> 0:06:09,000
to enhance how you play the game.

158
0:06:09.773,000 --> 0:06:11,000
What would that be like?

159
0:06:11.83,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Well, a very simple setup would be a camera

160
0:06:14.385,000 --> 0:06:15,000
on each corner of the stadium looking down,

161
0:06:16.04,000 --> 0:06:17,000
giving you a bird's-eye view

162
0:06:17.304,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of all the people down there.

163
0:06:18.858,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You also have information from helmet sensors

164
0:06:21.432,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and accelerometers,

165
0:06:22.54,000 --> 0:06:24,000
technology that's being worked on right now.

166
0:06:25.473,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You take all that information, and you stream it to your players.

167
0:06:28.032,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.

168
0:06:30.226,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The bad ones have information overload.

169
0:06:32.208,000 --> 0:06:34,000
That determines good teams from bad.

170
0:06:34.264,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And now, your I.T. department

171
0:06:37.01,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is just as important as your scouting department,

172
0:06:39.582,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.

173
0:06:42.167,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It's also for jocks. Who knew?

174
0:06:44.598,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What would that look like on the field?

175
0:06:46.474,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Well, imagine you're the quarterback.

176
0:06:48.583,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You take the snap and you drop back.

177
0:06:50.077,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.

178
0:06:52.124,000 --> 0:06:54,000
All of a sudden, a bright flash

179
0:06:54.291,000 --> 0:06:55,000
on the left side of your visor lets you know,

180
0:06:55.975,000 --> 0:06:57,000
blind side linebacker is blitzing in.

181
0:06:58.246,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him,

182
0:06:59.722,000 --> 0:07:01,000
but the augmented reality system lets you know.

183
0:07:01.963,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You step up into the pocket.

184
0:07:03.132,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.

185
0:07:05.258,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.

186
0:07:07.556,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The ball comes off track.

187
0:07:09.325,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You don't know where it's going to land.

188
0:07:10.783,000 --> 0:07:11,000
However, on the receiver's visor,

189
0:07:12.361,000 --> 0:07:14,000
he sees a patch of grass light up,

190
0:07:14.494,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and he knows to readjust.

191
0:07:16.29,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He goes, catches the ball,

192
0:07:17.519,000 --> 0:07:18,000
sprints in, touchdown.

193
0:07:19.047,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him

194
0:07:20.973,000 --> 0:07:21,000
every step of the way,

195
0:07:22.314,000 --> 0:07:24,000
watching from every perspective.

196
0:07:24.498,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now this is something that will create

197
0:07:27.378,000 --> 0:07:28,000
massive excitement in the game.

198
0:07:29.184,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It will make tons of people watch,

199
0:07:31.452,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because people want this experience.

200
0:07:33.843,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Fans want to be on the field.

201
0:07:35.669,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They want to be their favorite player.

202
0:07:37.932,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Augmented reality will be a part of sports,

203
0:07:40.05,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because it's too profitable not to.

204
0:07:42.496,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But the question I ask you is,

205
0:07:45.395,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for?

206
0:07:48.746,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Are we going to use it solely for our panem,

207
0:07:51.454,000 --> 0:07:53,000
our circenses, our entertainment as normal?

208
0:07:53.902,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Because I believe that we can use augmented reality

209
0:07:56.718,000 --> 0:07:57,000
for something more.

210
0:07:58.119,000 --> 0:08:,000
I believe we can use augmented reality

211
0:08:00.286,000 --> 0:08:01,000
as a way to foster more empathy

212
0:08:02.279,000 --> 0:08:04,000
within the human species itself,

213
0:08:04.583,000 --> 0:08:05,000
by literally showing someone

214
0:08:06.245,000 --> 0:08:07,000
what it looks like

215
0:08:07.684,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to walk a mile in another person's shoes.

216
0:08:10.97,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We know what this technology is worth

217
0:08:12.712,000 --> 0:08:13,000
to sports leagues.

218
0:08:13.93,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.

219
0:08:17.158,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But what is this technology worth

220
0:08:19.208,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to a teacher in a classroom

221
0:08:21.08,000 --> 0:08:22,000
trying to show a bully

222
0:08:22.516,000 --> 0:08:23,000
just how harmful his actions are

223
0:08:24.232,000 --> 0:08:26,000
from the perspective of the victim?

224
0:08:26.839,000 --> 0:08:27,000
What is this technology worth

225
0:08:28.485,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to a gay Ugandan or Russian

226
0:08:30.417,000 --> 0:08:31,000
trying to show the world what it's like

227
0:08:32.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
living under persecution?

228
0:08:33.79,000 --> 0:08:34,000
What is this technology worth

229
0:08:35.723,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson

230
0:08:39.297,000 --> 0:08:41,000
trying to inspire a generation of children

231
0:08:42.04,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to think more about space and science

232
0:08:44.806,000 --> 0:08:47,000
instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?

233
0:08:48.511,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality

234
0:08:51.256,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is coming.

235
0:08:53.426,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The questions we ask, the choices we make,

236
0:08:57.264,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and the challenges we face

237
0:08:58.897,000 --> 0:09:,000
are, as always, up to us.

238
0:09:01.267,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Thank you.

239
0:09:03.02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

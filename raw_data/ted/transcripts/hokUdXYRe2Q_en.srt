1
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This is me at five years old,

2
0:00:19.44,000 --> 0:00:23,000
shortly before jumping into this beautifully still pool of water.

3
0:00:24.84,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I soon find out the hard way that this pool is completely empty

4
0:00:29.2,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because the ice-cold water is near freezing

5
0:00:31.92,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and literally takes my breath away.

6
0:00:35.36,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Even though I already know how to swim,

7
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I can't get up to the water's surface, no matter how hard I try.

8
0:00:42.04,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That's the last thing I remember trying to do before blacking out.

9
0:00:46.52,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Turns out, the lifeguard on duty had been chatting with two girls

10
0:00:49.8,000 --> 0:00:5,000
when I jumped in,

11
0:00:51.4,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I was soon underwater,

12
0:00:53.32,000 --> 0:00:56,000
so he couldn't actually see or hear me struggle.

13
0:00:57.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
I was eventually saved by a girl walking near the pool

14
0:01:00.88,000 --> 0:01:02,000
who happened to look down and see me.

15
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The next thing I know, I'm getting mouth-to-mouth

16
0:01:06.84,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and being rushed to the hospital to determine the extent of my brain loss.

17
0:01:11.88,000 --> 0:01:14,000
If I had been flailing at the water's surface,

18
0:01:15.4,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the lifeguard would have noticed and come to save me.

19
0:01:19.52,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I share this near-death experience because it illustrates

20
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:26,000
how dangerous things are when they're just beneath the surface.

21
0:01:27.8,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Today, I study implicit gender bias in start-ups,

22
0:01:31.64,000 --> 0:01:35,000
which I consider to be far more insidious than mere overt bias

23
0:01:36.2,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for this very same reason.

24
0:01:38.44,000 --> 0:01:4,000
When we see or hear an investor

25
0:01:40.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
behaving inappropriately towards an entrepreneur,

26
0:01:43.88,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we're aware of the problem

27
0:01:45.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and at least have a chance to do something about it.

28
0:01:49.48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But what if there are subtle differences

29
0:01:52.4,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in the interactions between investors and entrepreneurs

30
0:01:56.8,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that can affect their outcomes,

31
0:01:58.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
differences that we're not conscious of,

32
0:02:02.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that we can't directly see or hear?

33
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Before studying start-ups at Columbia Business School,

34
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I spent five years running and raising money for my own start-up.

35
0:02:13.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I remember constantly racing around to meet with prospective investors

36
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:2,000
while trying to manage my actual business.

37
0:02:20.759,000 --> 0:02:22,000
At one point I joked that I had reluctantly pitched

38
0:02:23.68,000 --> 0:02:26,000
each and every family member, friend, colleague, angel investor

39
0:02:27.48,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and VC this side of the Mississippi.

40
0:02:30.64,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Well, in the process of speaking to all these investors,

41
0:02:33.32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I noticed something interesting was happening.

42
0:02:35.56,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I was getting asked a very different set of questions than my male cofounder.

43
0:02:39.96,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I got asked just about everything that could go wrong with the venture

44
0:02:43.4,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to induce investor losses,

45
0:02:45.56,000 --> 0:02:48,000
while my male cofounder was asked about our venture's home run potential

46
0:02:49.4,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to maximize investor gains,

47
0:02:51.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
essentially everything that could go right with the venture.

48
0:02:54.68,000 --> 0:02:57,000
He got asked how many new customers we were going to bring on,

49
0:02:57.88,000 --> 0:03:,000
while I got asked how we were going to hang on to the ones we already had.

50
0:03:01.84,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Well, as the CEO of the company, I found this to be rather odd.

51
0:03:05.24,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In fact, I felt like I was taking crazy pills.

52
0:03:09.24,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But I eventually rationalized it by thinking,

53
0:03:11.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
maybe this has to do with how I'm presenting myself,

54
0:03:13.92,000 --> 0:03:15,000
or it's something simply unique to my start-up.

55
0:03:17.52,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Well, years later I made the difficult decision to leave my start-up

56
0:03:21.28,000 --> 0:03:24,000
so I could pursue a lifelong dream of getting my PhD.

57
0:03:25.2,000 --> 0:03:29,000
It was at Columbia that I learned about a social psychological theory

58
0:03:29.52,000 --> 0:03:33,000
originated by Professor Tory Higgins called "regulatory focus,"

59
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which differentiates between two distinct motivational orientations

60
0:03:37.92,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of promotion and prevention.

61
0:03:40.4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
A promotion focus is concerned with gains

62
0:03:42.96,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and emphasizes hopes, accomplishments and advancement needs,

63
0:03:47.12,000 --> 0:03:49,000
while a prevention focus is concerned with losses

64
0:03:49.8,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and emphasizes safety, responsibility and security needs.

65
0:03:54.2,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Since the best-case scenario for a prevention focus

66
0:03:57.28,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is to simply maintain the status quo,

67
0:04:00.12,000 --> 0:04:03,000
this has us treading water just to stay afloat,

68
0:04:03.8,000 --> 0:04:07,000
while a promotion focus instead has us swimming in the right direction.

69
0:04:08.64,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's just a matter of how far we can advance.

70
0:04:13.28,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Well, I had my very own eureka moment when it dawned on me

71
0:04:16.92,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that this concept of promotion

72
0:04:18.4,000 --> 0:04:21,000
sounded a lot like the questions posed to my male cofounder,

73
0:04:21.96,000 --> 0:04:23,000
while prevention resembled those questions asked of me.

74
0:04:26.2,000 --> 0:04:27,000
As an entrepreneurship scholar,

75
0:04:27.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I started digging into the research on start-up financing

76
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and discovered there's an enormous gap

77
0:04:33.36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
between the amount of funds that male and female founders raise.

78
0:04:38.36,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Although women found 38 percent of US companies,

79
0:04:43.64,000 --> 0:04:46,000
they only get two percent of the venture funding.

80
0:04:47.68,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I got to thinking:

81
0:04:49.68,000 --> 0:04:52,000
what if this funding gap is not due to any fundamental difference

82
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:55,000
in the businesses started by men and women?

83
0:04:56.68,000 --> 0:04:59,000
What if women get less funding than men

84
0:04:59.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
due to a simple difference in the questions that they get asked?

85
0:05:04.08,000 --> 0:05:06,000
After all, when it comes to venture funding,

86
0:05:06.76,000 --> 0:05:1,000
entrepreneurs need to convince investors of their start-up's home run potential.

87
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's not enough to merely demonstrate

88
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you're not going to lose your investors' money.

89
0:05:15.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So it makes sense that women would be getting less funding than men

90
0:05:19.68,000 --> 0:05:2,000
if they're engaging

91
0:05:20.96,000 --> 0:05:23,000
in prevention as opposed to promotion-oriented dialogues.

92
0:05:24.8,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Well, I got the chance to test this hypothesis

93
0:05:27.36,000 --> 0:05:32,000
on companies with similar quality and funding needs across all years

94
0:05:32.44,000 --> 0:05:35,000
at the funding competition known as TechCrunch Disrupt

95
0:05:35.88,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Startup Battlefield has run in New York City

96
0:05:38.6,000 --> 0:05:4,000
since its inception in 2010.

97
0:05:42.2,000 --> 0:05:45,000
TechCrunch is widely regarded as the ideal place for start-ups to launch,

98
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:5,000
with participants including start-ups that have since become household names,

99
0:05:50.56,000 --> 0:05:51,000
like Dropbox, Fitbit and Mint,

100
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
presenting to some of the world's most prominent VCs.

101
0:05:56.24,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Well, despite the comparability of companies in my sample,

102
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
male-led start-ups went on to raise five times as much funding

103
0:06:03.88,000 --> 0:06:04,000
as the female-led ones.

104
0:06:06.24,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This made me especially curious to see what's driving this gender disparity.

105
0:06:11.4,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well, it took a while,

106
0:06:12.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but I got my hands on all the videos of both the pitches and the Q and A sessions

107
0:06:17.24,000 --> 0:06:19,000
from TechCrunch, and I had them transcribed.

108
0:06:20.52,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I first analyzed the transcripts

109
0:06:22.48,000 --> 0:06:25,000
by loading a dictionary of regulatory-focused terms

110
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
into the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software called LIWC.

111
0:06:30.24,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This LIWC software generated the frequencies

112
0:06:32.88,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of promotion and prevention words in the transcribed text.

113
0:06:36.92,000 --> 0:06:37,000
As a second method,

114
0:06:38.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I had each of the questions and answers manually coded

115
0:06:42.4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
by the Tory Higgins Research Lab at Columbia.

116
0:06:46.68,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Regardless of the topic at hand,

117
0:06:48.96,000 --> 0:06:51,000
an intention can be framed in promotion or prevention.

118
0:06:52.84,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Let's take that topic of customers I mentioned briefly earlier.

119
0:06:57.2,000 --> 0:06:59,000
A promotion-coded question sounds like,

120
0:06:59.44,000 --> 0:07:02,000
"How many new customers do you plan to acquire this year?"

121
0:07:02.8,000 --> 0:07:04,000
while a prevention-coded one sounds like,

122
0:07:05.04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
"How do you plan to retain your existing customers?"

123
0:07:09.24,000 --> 0:07:1,000
During the same time,

124
0:07:10.6,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I also gathered background information

125
0:07:13.04,000 --> 0:07:17,000
on the start-ups and entrepreneurs that can affect their funding outcomes,

126
0:07:17.12,000 --> 0:07:2,000
like the start-up's age, quality and funding needs

127
0:07:20.2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and the entrepreneur's past experience,

128
0:07:22.4,000 --> 0:07:25,000
so I could use these data points as controls in my analysis.

129
0:07:26.84,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Well, the very first thing that I found

130
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is that there's no difference in the way entrepreneurs present their companies.

131
0:07:33.64,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In other words, both male and female entrepreneurs

132
0:07:36.76,000 --> 0:07:39,000
use similar degrees of promotion and prevention language

133
0:07:40.08,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in their actual pitches.

134
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So having ruled out this difference on the entrepreneur's side,

135
0:07:45.04,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I then moved on to the investor's side,

136
0:07:47.36,000 --> 0:07:49,000
analyzing the six minutes of Q&A sessions

137
0:07:50.08,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that entrepreneurs engaged in with the VCs after pitching.

138
0:07:54.44,000 --> 0:07:56,000
When examining the nearly 2,000 questions

139
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and corresponding answers in these exchanges,

140
0:08:01.32,000 --> 0:08:04,000
both of my methods showed significant support

141
0:08:04.48,000 --> 0:08:07,000
for the fact that male entrepreneurs get asked promotion questions

142
0:08:08.28,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and female entrepreneurs get asked prevention questions.

143
0:08:12.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
In fact, a whopping 67 percent of the questions posed

144
0:08:17.2,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to male entrepreneurs were promotion-focused,

145
0:08:19.72,000 --> 0:08:23,000
while 66 percent of those posed to female entrepreneurs were prevention-focused.

146
0:08:25.44,000 --> 0:08:26,000
What's especially interesting

147
0:08:27.2,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is that I expected female VCs

148
0:08:30.64,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to behave similarly to male VCs.

149
0:08:35.52,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Given its prevalence in the popular media and the venture-funding literature,

150
0:08:39.76,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I expected the birds-of-a-feather theory of homophily to hold here,

151
0:08:44.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
meaning that male VCs would favor male entrepreneurs

152
0:08:47.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
with promotion questions

153
0:08:49.24,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and female VCs would do the same for female entrepreneurs.

154
0:08:53.64,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But instead, all VCs displayed the same implicit gender bias

155
0:08:59.08,000 --> 0:09:02,000
manifested in the regulatory focus of the questions they posed

156
0:09:02.68,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to male versus female candidates.

157
0:09:05.4,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So female VCs asked male entrepreneurs promotion questions

158
0:09:09.52,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and then turned around and asked female entrepreneurs prevention questions

159
0:09:13.2,000 --> 0:09:14,000
just like the male VCs did.

160
0:09:16.36,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So given the fact that both male and female VCs

161
0:09:19.52,000 --> 0:09:22,000
are displaying this implicit gender bias,

162
0:09:22.6,000 --> 0:09:25,000
what effect, if any, does this have on start-up funding outcomes?

163
0:09:27.08,000 --> 0:09:3,000
My research shows it has a significant effect.

164
0:09:31.32,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The regulatory focus of investor questions

165
0:09:33.84,000 --> 0:09:36,000
not only predicted how well the start-ups would perform

166
0:09:37.52,000 --> 0:09:39,000
at the TechCrunch Disrupt competitions

167
0:09:40.2,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but also how much funding the start-ups went on to raise in the open market.

168
0:09:45.84,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Those start-ups who were asked predominantly promotion questions

169
0:09:48.96,000 --> 0:09:51,000
went on to raise seven times as much funding

170
0:09:52.08,000 --> 0:09:53,000
as those asked prevention questions.

171
0:09:55.44,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But I didn't stop there.

172
0:09:57.08,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I then moved on to analyze entrepreneurs' responses to those questions,

173
0:10:01.76,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and I found that entrepreneurs are apt to respond in kind

174
0:10:05.72,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to the questions they get,

175
0:10:07.32,000 --> 0:10:1,000
meaning a promotion question begets a promotion response

176
0:10:10.48,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and a prevention question begets a prevention response.

177
0:10:13.64,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now, this might make intuitive sense to all of us here,

178
0:10:17.48,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but it has some unfortunate consequences in this context of venture funding.

179
0:10:22.52,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So what ends up happening

180
0:10:24.08,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is that a male entrepreneur gets asked a promotion question,

181
0:10:27.44,000 --> 0:10:3,000
granting him the luxury to reinforce his association

182
0:10:31.12,000 --> 0:10:35,000
with the favorable domain of gains by responding in kind,

183
0:10:35.24,000 --> 0:10:38,000
while a female entrepreneur gets asked a prevention question

184
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and inadvertently aggravates her association

185
0:10:41.4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with the unfavorable domain of losses by doing so.

186
0:10:45.52,000 --> 0:10:49,000
These responses then trigger venture capitalists' subsequent biased questions,

187
0:10:50.12,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and the questions and answers collectively fuel a cycle of bias

188
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that merely perpetuates the gender disparity.

189
0:10:57.2,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Pretty depressing stuff, right?

190
0:10:59.96,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Well, fortunately, there's a silver lining to my findings.

191
0:11:03.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Those plucky entrepreneurs who managed to switch focus

192
0:11:07.6,000 --> 0:11:11,000
by responding to prevention questions with promotion answers

193
0:11:11.72,000 --> 0:11:14,000
went on to raise 14 times more funding

194
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:17,000
than those who responded to prevention questions

195
0:11:17.28,000 --> 0:11:18,000
with prevention answers.

196
0:11:19.36,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So what this means is that if you're asked a question

197
0:11:22.36,000 --> 0:11:24,000
about defending your start-up's market share,

198
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
you'd be better served to frame your response

199
0:11:27.84,000 --> 0:11:3,000
around the size and growth potential of the overall pie

200
0:11:31.76,000 --> 0:11:35,000
as opposed to how you merely plan to protect your sliver of that pie.

201
0:11:36.04,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So if I get asked this question,

202
0:11:37.96,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I would say,

203
0:11:39.24,000 --> 0:11:41,000
"We're playing in such a large and fast-growing market

204
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that's bound to attract new entrants.

205
0:11:44.44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
We plan to take increasing share in this market

206
0:11:47.64,000 --> 0:11:49,000
by leveraging our start-up's unique assets."

207
0:11:50.24,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I've thus subtly redirected this dialogue into the favorable domain of gains.

208
0:11:56.52,000 --> 0:12:,000
Now, these results are quite compelling among start-ups that launched at TechCrunch

209
0:12:00.6,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but field data can merely tell us that there's a correlational relationship

210
0:12:04.6,000 --> 0:12:06,000
between regulatory focus and funding.

211
0:12:07.04,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So I sought to see whether this difference in regulatory focus

212
0:12:10.92,000 --> 0:12:12,000
can actually cause funding outcomes

213
0:12:13.56,000 --> 0:12:15,000
by running a controlled experiment

214
0:12:15.8,000 --> 0:12:17,000
on both angel investors and ordinary people.

215
0:12:18.76,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Simulating the TechCrunch Disrupt environment,

216
0:12:21.56,000 --> 0:12:25,000
I had participants listen to four six-minute audio files

217
0:12:25.84,000 --> 0:12:27,000
of 10 question-and-answer exchanges

218
0:12:28.56,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that were manipulated for promotion and prevention language,

219
0:12:31.84,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and then asked them to allocate a sum of funding

220
0:12:34.103,000 --> 0:12:35,000
to each venture as they saw fit.

221
0:12:36.36,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Well, my experimental results reinforced my findings from the field.

222
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Those scenarios where entrepreneurs were asked promotion questions

223
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:47,000
received twice the funding allocations

224
0:12:47.56,000 --> 0:12:49,000
of those where entrepreneurs were asked prevention questions.

225
0:12:51.48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
What's especially promising

226
0:12:53.48,000 --> 0:12:56,000
is the fact that those scenarios where entrepreneurs switched

227
0:12:56.92,000 --> 0:12:59,000
as opposed to matched focus when they received prevention questions

228
0:13:00.6,000 --> 0:13:04,000
received significantly more funding from both sets of participants.

229
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So to my female entrepreneurs out there,

230
0:13:08.88,000 --> 0:13:1,000
here are a couple simple things you could do.

231
0:13:11.6,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The first is to recognize the question you're being asked.

232
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Are you getting a prevention question?

233
0:13:17.8,000 --> 0:13:21,000
If this is the case, answer the question at hand by all means,

234
0:13:21.92,000 --> 0:13:23,000
but merely frame your response in promotion

235
0:13:24.68,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in an effort to garner higher amounts of funding for your start-ups.

236
0:13:29.88,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The unfortunate reality, though,

237
0:13:32.36,000 --> 0:13:34,000
is that both men and women evaluating start-ups

238
0:13:35.28,000 --> 0:13:38,000
display the same implicit gender bias in their questioning,

239
0:13:38.88,000 --> 0:13:41,000
inadvertently favoring male entrepreneurs over female ones.

240
0:13:43.36,000 --> 0:13:45,000
So to my investors out there,

241
0:13:45.48,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I would offer that you have an opportunity here

242
0:13:49.32,000 --> 0:13:52,000
to approach Q&A sessions more even-handedly,

243
0:13:52.84,000 --> 0:13:54,000
not just so that you could do the right thing,

244
0:13:55.32,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but so that you can improve the quality of your decision making.

245
0:14:00.48,000 --> 0:14:03,000
By flashing the same light on every start-up's potential

246
0:14:04.2,000 --> 0:14:05,000
for gains and losses,

247
0:14:06.08,000 --> 0:14:08,000
you enable all deserving start-ups to shine

248
0:14:09.04,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and you maximize returns in the process.

249
0:14:12.8,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Today, I get to be that girl

250
0:14:15.96,000 --> 0:14:16,000
walking by the pool,

251
0:14:17.96,000 --> 0:14:18,000
sounding the alarm

252
0:14:19.52,000 --> 0:14:21,000
that something is going on beneath the surface.

253
0:14:23.04,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Together, we have the power to break this cycle

254
0:14:26.8,000 --> 0:14:28,000
of implicit gender bias in start-up funding.

255
0:14:30.2,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Let's give the most promising start-ups,

256
0:14:33.04,000 --> 0:14:36,000
regardless of whether they're led by men or women,

257
0:14:36.4,000 --> 0:14:39,000
a fighting chance to grow and thrive.

258
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Thank you.

259
0:14:41.48,000 --> 0:14:46,000
(Applause)

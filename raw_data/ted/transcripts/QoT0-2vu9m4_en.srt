Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.404,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I've noticed something interesting about society and culture.

3
0:00:15.31,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Everything risky requires a license.

4
0:00:17.892,000 --> 0:00:21,000
So, learning to drive, owning a gun, getting married.

5
0:00:23.177,000 --> 0:00:24,000
There's a certain --

6
0:00:24.535,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:26.859,000 --> 0:00:29,000
That's true in everything risky, except technology.

8
0:00:30.604,000 --> 0:00:32,000
For some reason, there's no standard syllabus,

9
0:00:32.963,000 --> 0:00:33,000
there's no basic course.

10
0:00:34.953,000 --> 0:00:37,000
They just sort of give you your computer and then kick you out of the nest.

11
0:00:38.596,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You're supposed to learn this stuff -- how?

12
0:00:40.897,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Just by osmosis.

13
0:00:42.148,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Nobody ever sits down and tells you, "This is how it works."

14
0:00:45.064,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So today I'm going to tell you ten things

15
0:00:48.041,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that you thought everybody knew, but it turns out they don't.

16
0:00:51.431,000 --> 0:00:53,000
First of all, on the web, if you want to scroll down,

17
0:00:54.241,000 --> 0:00:56,000
don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar.

18
0:00:56.506,000 --> 0:00:57,000
That's a terrible waste of time.

19
0:00:58.057,000 --> 0:01:,000
Do that only if you're paid by the hour.

20
0:01:00.121,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Instead, hit the space bar.

21
0:01:02.022,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The space bar scrolls down one page.

22
0:01:05.885,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again.

23
0:01:08.79,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, space bar to scroll down one page; works in every browser,

24
0:01:11.726,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in every kind of computer.

25
0:01:13.003,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Also on the web, when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses,

26
0:01:16.749,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I assume you know that you can hit the Tab key

27
0:01:18.982,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to jump from box to box to box.

28
0:01:20.585,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But what about the pop-up menu where you put in your state?

29
0:01:23.755,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Don't open the pop-up menu.

30
0:01:25.684,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That's a terrible waste of calories.

31
0:01:27.572,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Type the first letter of your state over and over and over.

32
0:01:31.166,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C.

33
0:01:33.418,000 --> 0:01:36,000
If you want Texas, go T, T, and you jump right to that thing

34
0:01:36.854,000 --> 0:01:38,000
without even opening the pop-up menu.

35
0:01:39.278,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Also on the web, when the text is too small,

36
0:01:42.186,000 --> 0:01:45,000
what you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus, plus, plus.

37
0:01:45.71,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You make the text larger with each tap.

38
0:01:48.917,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Works on every computer, every web browser,

39
0:01:51.009,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or minus, minus, to get smaller again.

40
0:01:53.003,000 --> 0:01:55,000
If you're on the Mac, it might be Command instead.

41
0:01:55.593,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When you're typing on your Blackberry, Android, iPhone,

42
0:01:59.457,000 --> 0:02:02,000
don't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout

43
0:02:02.743,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to hit the period and then a space,

44
0:02:04.601,000 --> 0:02:05,000
then try to capitalize the next letter.

45
0:02:06.53,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Just hit the space bar twice.

46
0:02:08.557,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The phone puts the period, the space, and the capital for you.

47
0:02:12.531,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Go space, space.

48
0:02:13.75,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It is totally amazing.

49
0:02:15.938,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Also when it comes to cell phones, on all phones,

50
0:02:18.976,000 --> 0:02:21,000
if you want to redial somebody that you've dialed before,

51
0:02:22.586,000 --> 0:02:24,000
all you have to do is hit the call button,

52
0:02:25.131,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and it puts the last phone number into the box for you,

53
0:02:28.726,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and at that point you can hit call again to actually dial it.

54
0:02:31.881,000 --> 0:02:34,000
No need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call somebody

55
0:02:35.429,000 --> 0:02:36,000
just hit the call button again.

56
0:02:36.944,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Something that drives me crazy:

57
0:02:38.451,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When I call you and leave a message on your voice mail,

58
0:02:41.07,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I hear you saying, "Leave a message,"

59
0:02:42.864,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and then I get these 15 seconds of freaking instructions,

60
0:02:46.245,000 --> 0:02:49,000
like we haven't had answering machines for 45 years!

61
0:02:49.933,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:53.621,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I'm not bitter.

63
0:02:55.098,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:56.129,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So it turns out there's a keyboard shortcut

65
0:02:58.365,000 --> 0:03:,000
that lets you jump directly to the beep like this.

66
0:03:00.747,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Phone: At the tone, please...

67
0:03:02.358,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Beep)

68
0:03:03.383,000 --> 0:03:05,000
David Pogue: Unfortunately, the carriers didn't adopt

69
0:03:05.897,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the same keystroke, so it's different by carrier,

70
0:03:08.362,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke

71
0:03:11.427,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for the person you're calling.

72
0:03:14.058,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I didn't say these were going to be perfect.

73
0:03:16.656,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So most of you think of Google

74
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as something that lets you look up a web page,

75
0:03:20.606,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but it is also a dictionary.

76
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Type the word "define" and the word you want to know.

77
0:03:24.616,000 --> 0:03:25,000
You don't even have to click anything.

78
0:03:26.465,000 --> 0:03:28,000
There's the definition as you type.

79
0:03:28.545,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's also a complete FAA database.

80
0:03:30.6,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Type the name of the airline and the flight.

81
0:03:32.708,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It shows you where the flight is, the gate, the terminal,

82
0:03:35.431,000 --> 0:03:36,000
how long until it lands.

83
0:03:36.741,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You don't need an app.

84
0:03:38.176,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's also unit and currency conversion.

85
0:03:40.167,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Again, you don't have to click one of the results.

86
0:03:42.814,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Just type it into the box, and there's your answer.

87
0:03:45.443,000 --> 0:03:46,000
While we're talking about text --

88
0:03:47.945,000 --> 0:03:49,000
When you want to highlight --

89
0:03:50.712,000 --> 0:03:51,000
this is just an example --

90
0:03:52.102,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

91
0:03:53.99,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When you want to highlight a word,

92
0:03:56.273,000 --> 0:03:58,000
please don't waste your life dragging across it

93
0:03:59.267,000 --> 0:04:,000
with the mouse like a newbie.

94
0:04:00.701,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Double click the word.

95
0:04:02.359,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Watch "200" -- I go double-click,

96
0:04:04.044,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it neatly selects just that word.

97
0:04:05.777,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Also, don't delete what you've highlighted.

98
0:04:08.518,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You can just type over it.

99
0:04:09.915,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This is in every program.

100
0:04:11.469,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Also, you can go double-click, drag,

101
0:04:13.484,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to highlight in one-word increments as you drag.

102
0:04:16.39,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Much more precise.

103
0:04:17.654,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Again, don't bother deleting.

104
0:04:19.513,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Just type over it.

105
0:04:20.843,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:24.575,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button

107
0:04:28.08,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and the moment the camera actually snaps.

108
0:04:30.438,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's extremely frustrating on any camera under $1,000.

109
0:04:33.406,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Camera click)

110
0:04:35.04,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:38.383,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So, that's because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and exposure,

112
0:04:42.381,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but if you pre-focus with a half-press,

113
0:04:45.266,000 --> 0:04:46,000
leave your finger down --

114
0:04:47.056,000 --> 0:04:48,000
no shutter lag!

115
0:04:49.309,000 --> 0:04:51,000
You get it every time.

116
0:04:51.438,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I've just turned your $50 camera into a $1,000 camera with that trick.

117
0:04:55.646,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And finally, it often happens that you're giving a talk,

118
0:04:58.979,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and for some reason, the audience is looking at the slide

119
0:05:02.035,000 --> 0:05:03,000
instead of at you!

120
0:05:03.317,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

121
0:05:05.715,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So when that happens -- this works in Keynote, PowerPoint,

122
0:05:08.642,000 --> 0:05:11,000
it works in every program -- all you do is hit the letter B key,

123
0:05:11.677,000 --> 0:05:14,000
B for blackout, to black out the slide, make everybody look at you,

124
0:05:15.254,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and then when you're ready to go on, you hit B again,

125
0:05:17.757,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and if you're really on a roll, you can hit the W key for "whiteout,"

126
0:05:22.244,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and you white out the slide,

127
0:05:23.979,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and then you can hit W again to un-blank it.

128
0:05:26.644,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So I know I went super fast.

129
0:05:28.278,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If you missed anything, I'll be happy to send you the list of these tips.

130
0:05:31.746,000 --> 0:05:32,000
In the meantime, congratulations.

131
0:05:33.345,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You all get your California Technology License.

132
0:05:35.802,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Have a great day.

133
0:05:37.038,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.659,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Spoons.

2
0:00:16.944,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Cardboard boxes.

3
0:00:19.302,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Toddler-size electric trains.

4
0:00:22.522,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Holiday ornaments.

5
0:00:24.442,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Bounce houses.

6
0:00:26.292,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Blankets.

7
0:00:27.601,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Baskets.

8
0:00:29.228,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Carpets.

9
0:00:30.498,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Tray tables.

10
0:00:31.673,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Smartphones.

0:00:33.101,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Pianos.

12
0:00:35.284,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Robes.

13
0:00:36.622,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Photographs.

14
0:00:38.415,000 --> 0:00:4,000
What do all of these things have in common,

15
0:00:40.471,000 --> 0:00:43,000
aside from the fact they're photos that I took in the last three months,

16
0:00:43.928,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and therefore, own the copyright to?

17
0:00:45.794,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:47.323,000 --> 0:00:48,000
They're all inventions

19
0:00:48.879,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that were created with the benefit of language.

20
0:00:52.553,000 --> 0:00:54,000
None of these things would have existed without language.

21
0:00:55.273,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Imagine creating any one of those things

22
0:00:57.257,000 --> 0:00:59,000
or, like, building an entire building like this,

23
0:01:00.027,000 --> 0:01:02,000
without being able to use language

24
0:01:02.407,000 --> 0:01:06,000
or without benefiting from any knowledge that was got by the use of language.

25
0:01:06.973,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Basically, language is the most important thing

26
0:01:11.045,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in the entire world.

27
0:01:12.243,000 --> 0:01:15,000
All of our civilization rests upon it.

28
0:01:15.308,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And those who devote their lives to studying it --

29
0:01:17.784,000 --> 0:01:21,000
both how language emerged, how human languages differ,

30
0:01:22.8,000 --> 0:01:24,000
how they differ from animal communication systems --

31
0:01:25.334,000 --> 0:01:26,000
are linguists.

32
0:01:27.141,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Formal linguistics is a relatively young field, more or less.

33
0:01:33.099,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And it's uncovered a lot of really important stuff.

34
0:01:35.52,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Like, for example, that human communication systems

35
0:01:38.076,000 --> 0:01:4,000
differ crucially from animal communication systems,

36
0:01:40.861,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that all languages are equally expressive,

37
0:01:43.546,000 --> 0:01:45,000
even if they do it in different ways.

38
0:01:45.998,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And yet, despite this,

39
0:01:49.296,000 --> 0:01:53,000
there are a lot of people who just love to pop off about language

40
0:01:53.942,000 --> 0:01:56,000
like they have an equal understanding of it as a linguist,

41
0:01:57.585,000 --> 0:01:59,000
because, of course, they speak a language.

42
0:01:59.641,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And if you speak a language, that means you have just as much right

43
0:02:02.837,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to talk about its function as anybody else.

44
0:02:04.954,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Imagine if you were talking to a surgeon,

45
0:02:06.97,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and you say, "Listen, buddy.

46
0:02:08.498,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I've had a heart for, like, 40 years now.

47
0:02:10.49,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I think I know a thing or two about aortic valve replacements.

48
0:02:13.464,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I think my opinion is just as valid as yours."

49
0:02:15.703,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And yet, that's exactly what happens.

50
0:02:17.522,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is Neil deGrasse Tyson, saying that in the film "Arrival,"

51
0:02:21.973,000 --> 0:02:23,000
he would have brought a cryptographer --

52
0:02:24.148,000 --> 0:02:27,000
somebody who can unscramble a message in a language they already know --

53
0:02:27.99,000 --> 0:02:28,000
rather than a linguist,

54
0:02:29.292,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to communicate with the aliens,

55
0:02:30.95,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because what would a linguist --

56
0:02:33.085,000 --> 0:02:35,000
why would that be useful in talking to somebody

57
0:02:35.323,000 --> 0:02:36,000
speaking a language we don't even know?

58
0:02:37.253,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Though, of course, the "Arrival" film is not off the hook.

59
0:02:40.014,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I mean, come on -- listen, film. Hey, buddy:

60
0:02:42.101,000 --> 0:02:45,000
there are aliens that come down to our planet in gigantic ships,

61
0:02:45.165,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and they want to do nothing except for communicate with us,

62
0:02:48.975,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and you hire one linguist?

63
0:02:51.274,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:52.308,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What's the US government on a budget or something?

65
0:02:55.029,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

66
0:02:56.641,000 --> 0:02:58,000
A lot of these things can be chalked up to misunderstandings,

67
0:02:59.569,000 --> 0:03:02,000
both about what language is and about the formal study of language,

68
0:03:03.069,000 --> 0:03:04,000
about linguistics.

69
0:03:05.568,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And I think there's something that underlies a lot of these misunderstandings

70
0:03:10.02,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that can be summed up by this delightful article in "Forbes,"

71
0:03:14.583,000 --> 0:03:17,000
about why high school students shouldn't learn foreign languages.

72
0:03:18.302,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I'm going to pull out some quotes from this,

73
0:03:20.459,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I want you to see if you can figure out

74
0:03:22.541,000 --> 0:03:25,000
what underlies some of these opinions and ideas.

75
0:03:26.929,000 --> 0:03:3,000
"Americans rarely read the classics, even in translation."

76
0:03:31.036,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So in other words, why bother learning a foreign language

77
0:03:33.761,000 --> 0:03:36,000
when they're not even going to read the classic in the original anyway?

78
0:03:37.227,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What's the point?

79
0:03:38.435,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"Studying foreign languages in school is a waste of time,

80
0:03:41.237,000 --> 0:03:44,000
compared to other things that you could be doing in school."

81
0:03:45.887,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"Europe has a lot of language groups clustered in a relatively small space."

82
0:03:49.823,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So for Americans, ah, what's the point of learning another language?

83
0:03:53.356,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You're not really going to get a lot of bang for your buck out of that.

84
0:03:56.736,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This is my favorite,

85
0:03:57.919,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"A student in Birmingham would have to travel

86
0:04:00.086,000 --> 0:04:02,000
about a thousand miles to get to the Mexican border,

87
0:04:02.596,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and even then, there would be enough people who speak English to get around."

88
0:04:06.628,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In other words, if you can kind of wave your arms around,

89
0:04:09.351,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and you can get to where you're going,

90
0:04:11.195,000 --> 0:04:14,000
then there's really no point in learning another language anyway.

91
0:04:14.275,000 --> 0:04:19,000
What underlies a lot of these attitudes is the conceptual metaphor,

92
0:04:19.331,000 --> 0:04:2,000
language is a tool.

93
0:04:20.918,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And there's something that rings very true about this metaphor.

94
0:04:23.902,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Language is kind of a tool

95
0:04:25.173,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in that, if you know the local language, you can do more than if you didn't.

96
0:04:28.801,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But the implication is that language is only a tool,

97
0:04:31.825,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and this is absolutely false.

98
0:04:33.841,000 --> 0:04:36,000
If language was a tool, it would honestly be a pretty poor tool.

99
0:04:37.166,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And we would have abandoned it long ago for something that was a lot better.

100
0:04:40.8,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Think about just any sentence.

101
0:04:42.356,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Here's a sentence that I'm sure I've said in my life: "Yesterday I saw Kyn."

102
0:04:46.019,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I have a friend named Kyn.

103
0:04:47.292,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And when I say this sentence, "Yesterday I saw Kyn,"

104
0:04:50.1,000 --> 0:04:51,000
do you think it's really the case

105
0:04:51.85,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that everything in my mind is now implanted in your mind

106
0:04:55.096,000 --> 0:04:56,000
via this sentence?

107
0:04:56.302,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Hardly, because there's a lot of other stuff going on.

108
0:04:58.863,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Like, when I say "yesterday,"

109
0:05:00.275,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I might think what the weather was like yesterday because I was there.

110
0:05:03.608,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And if I'm remembering,

111
0:05:04.782,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I'll probably remember there was something I forgot to mail, which I did.

112
0:05:08.25,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This was a preplanned joke, but I really did forget to mail something.

113
0:05:11.59,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And so that means I'm going to have to do it Monday,

114
0:05:14.464,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because that's when I'm going to get back home.

115
0:05:16.681,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And of course, when I think of Monday,

116
0:05:18.525,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I'll think of "Manic Monday" by the Bangles. It's a good song.

117
0:05:21.495,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And when I say the word "saw," I think of this phrase:

118
0:05:24.776,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"'I see!' said the blind man as he picked up his hammer and saw."

119
0:05:27.887,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I always do.

120
0:05:29.062,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Anytime I hear the word "saw" or say it, I always think of that,

121
0:05:32.157,000 --> 0:05:34,000
because my grandfather always used to say it,

122
0:05:34.278,000 --> 0:05:35,000
so it makes me think of my grandfather.

123
0:05:36.173,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And we're back to "Manic Monday" again, for some reason.

124
0:05:38.838,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And with Kyn, when I'm saying something like, "Yesterday I saw Kyn,"

125
0:05:42.124,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I'll think of the circumstances under which I saw him.

126
0:05:45.251,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And this happened to be that day. Here he is with my cat.

127
0:05:48.054,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And of course, if I'm thinking of Kyn,

128
0:05:49.903,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'll think he's going to Long Beach State right now,

129
0:05:52.395,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I'll remember that my good friend John and my mother

130
0:05:55.056,000 --> 0:05:56,000
both graduated from Long Beach State,

131
0:05:56.854,000 --> 0:05:58,000
my cousin Katie is going to Long Beach State right now.

132
0:05:59.722,000 --> 0:06:,000
And it's "Manic Monday" again.

133
0:06:01.18,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But this is just a fraction of what's going on in your head

134
0:06:03.986,000 --> 0:06:05,000
at any given time while you are speaking.

135
0:06:06.302,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And all we have to represent the entire mess

136
0:06:08.921,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that is going on in our head, is this.

137
0:06:11.839,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I mean, that's all we got.

138
0:06:13.165,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:14.353,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Is it any wonder that our system is so poor?

140
0:06:16.982,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So imagine, if I can give you an analogy,

141
0:06:19.484,000 --> 0:06:22,000
imagine if you wanted to know what is it like to eat a cake,

142
0:06:22.65,000 --> 0:06:24,000
if instead of just eating the cake,

143
0:06:25.03,000 --> 0:06:28,000
you instead had to ingest the ingredients of a cake,

144
0:06:28.276,000 --> 0:06:29,000
one by one,

145
0:06:29.831,000 --> 0:06:3,000
along with instructions

146
0:06:31.367,000 --> 0:06:34,000
about how these ingredients can be combined to form a cake.

147
0:06:34.776,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You had to eat the instructions, too.

148
0:06:36.704,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:37.792,000 --> 0:06:39,000
If that was how we had to experience cake,

150
0:06:39.875,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we would never eat cake.

151
0:06:42.485,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And yet, language is the only way -- the only way --

152
0:06:46.069,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that we can figure out what is going on here, in our minds.

153
0:06:50.287,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is our interiority,

154
0:06:52.165,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the thing that makes us human,

155
0:06:53.633,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the thing that makes us different from other animals,

156
0:06:56.895,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is all inside here somewhere,

157
0:06:58.752,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and all we have to do to represent it is our own languages.

158
0:07:02.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
A language is our best way of showing what's going on in our head.

159
0:07:05.859,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Imagine if I wanted to ask a big question, like:

160
0:07:08.134,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"What is the nature of human thought and emotion?"

161
0:07:10.491,000 --> 0:07:11,000
What you'd want to do

162
0:07:11.605,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is you'd want to examine as many different languages

163
0:07:14.792,000 --> 0:07:15,000
as possible.

164
0:07:16.411,000 --> 0:07:18,000
One isn't just going to do it.

165
0:07:18.45,000 --> 0:07:19,000
To give you an example,

166
0:07:19.836,000 --> 0:07:21,000
here's a picture I took of little Roman,

167
0:07:22.709,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that I took with a 12-megapixel camera.

168
0:07:25.712,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, here's that same picture with a lot fewer pixels.

169
0:07:29.168,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Obviously, neither of these pictures is a real cat.

170
0:07:33.075,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But one gives you a lot better sense of what a cat is than the other.

171
0:07:38.649,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Language is not merely a tool.

172
0:07:40.657,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It is our legacy,

173
0:07:41.84,000 --> 0:07:43,000
it's our way of conveying what it means to be human.

174
0:07:44.306,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And of course, by "our" legacy, I mean all humans everywhere.

175
0:07:48.721,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And losing even one language makes that picture a lot less clear.

176
0:07:53.81,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So as a job for the past 10 years

177
0:07:57.879,000 --> 0:08:,000
and also as recreation, just for fun,

178
0:08:01.188,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I create languages.

179
0:08:02.923,000 --> 0:08:03,000
These are called "conlangs,"

180
0:08:04.807,000 --> 0:08:06,000
short for "constructed languages."

181
0:08:06.966,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Now, presenting these facts back to back,

182
0:08:09.069,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that we're losing languages on our planet

183
0:08:11.071,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and that I create brand-new languages,

184
0:08:12.914,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you might think that there's some nonsuperficial connection

185
0:08:15.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
between these two.

186
0:08:16.91,000 --> 0:08:18,000
In fact, a lot of people have drawn a line between those dots.

187
0:08:19.85,000 --> 0:08:21,000
This is a guy who got all bent out of shape

188
0:08:21.901,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that there was a conlang in James Cameron's "Avatar."

189
0:08:24.739,000 --> 0:08:25,000
He says,

190
0:08:26.47,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"But in the three years it took James Cameron

191
0:08:28.716,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to get Avatar to the screen, a language died."

192
0:08:30.993,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Probably a lot more than that, actually.

193
0:08:32.945,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"Na'vi, alas, won't fill the hole where it used to be ..."

194
0:08:36.413,000 --> 0:08:38,000
A truly profound and poignant statement --

195
0:08:38.749,000 --> 0:08:4,000
if you don't think about it at all.

196
0:08:41.39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:42.569,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But when I was here at Cal,

198
0:08:44.636,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I completed two majors.

199
0:08:46.039,000 --> 0:08:48,000
One of them was linguistics, but the other one was English.

200
0:08:48.864,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And of course, the English major, the study of English,

201
0:08:51.476,000 --> 0:08:53,000
is not actually the study of the English language, as we know,

202
0:08:54.462,000 --> 0:08:55,000
it's the study of literature.

203
0:08:55.881,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Literature is just a wonderful thing,

204
0:08:57.702,000 --> 0:09:,000
because basically, literature, more broadly, is kind of like art;

205
0:09:01.517,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it falls under the rubric of art.

206
0:09:03.204,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And what we do with literature,

207
0:09:04.776,000 --> 0:09:09,000
authors create new, entire beings and histories.

208
0:09:09.879,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And it's interesting to us to see

209
0:09:12.919,000 --> 0:09:17,000
what kind of depth and emotion and just unique spirit

210
0:09:18.03,000 --> 0:09:2,000
authors can invest into these fictional beings.

211
0:09:20.662,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So much so, that, I mean -- take a look at this.

212
0:09:23.307,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There's an entire series of books

213
0:09:25.585,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that are written about fictional characters.

214
0:09:27.848,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Like, the entire book is just about one fictional, fake human being.

215
0:09:31.839,000 --> 0:09:33,000
There's an entire book on George F. Babbitt

216
0:09:34.034,000 --> 0:09:35,000
from Sinclair Lewis's "Babbitt,"

217
0:09:35.895,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and I guarantee you, that book is longer than "Babbitt,"

218
0:09:38.586,000 --> 0:09:39,000
which is a short book.

219
0:09:39.808,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Does anybody even remember that one?

220
0:09:41.571,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It's pretty good, I actually think it's better than "Main Street."

221
0:09:44.786,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That's my hot take.

222
0:09:46.18,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So we've never questioned the fact that literature is interesting.

223
0:09:50.434,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But despite the fact,

224
0:09:52.013,000 --> 0:09:56,000
not even linguists are actually interested in what created languages can tell us

225
0:09:56.101,000 --> 0:09:59,000
about the depth of the human spirit just as an artistic endeavor.

226
0:10:00.52,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I'll give you a nice little example here.

227
0:10:03.421,000 --> 0:10:05,000
There was an article written about me

228
0:10:06.168,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in the California alumni magazine a while back.

229
0:10:09.032,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And when they wrote this article,

230
0:10:10.657,000 --> 0:10:12,000
they wanted to get somebody from the opposing side,

231
0:10:13.101,000 --> 0:10:15,000
which, in hindsight, seems like a weird thing to do.

232
0:10:15.585,000 --> 0:10:16,000
You're just talking about a person,

233
0:10:17.299,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and you want to get somebody from the opposing side of that person.

234
0:10:20.466,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

235
0:10:21.766,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Essentially, this is just a puff piece, but whatever.

236
0:10:24.449,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So, they happened to get

237
0:10:26.996,000 --> 0:10:28,000
one of the most brilliant linguists of our time,

238
0:10:29.345,000 --> 0:10:32,000
George Lakoff, who's a linguist here at Berkeley.

239
0:10:32.395,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And his work has basically forever changed the fields of linguistics

240
0:10:35.981,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and cognitive science.

241
0:10:37.482,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And when asked about my work and about language creation in general,

242
0:10:40.781,000 --> 0:10:43,000
he said, "But there's a lot of things to be done in the study of language.

243
0:10:44.45,000 --> 0:10:46,000
You should spend the time on something real."

244
0:10:47.23,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Yeah.

245
0:10:48.405,000 --> 0:10:5,000
"Something real." Does this remind you of anything?

246
0:10:50.888,000 --> 0:10:53,000
To use the very framework that he himself invented,

247
0:10:54.651,000 --> 0:10:56,000
let me refer back to this conceptual metaphor:

248
0:10:57.37,000 --> 0:10:58,000
language is a tool.

249
0:10:58.662,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And he appears to be laboring under this conceptual metaphor;

250
0:11:02.117,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that is, language is useful when it can be used for communication.

251
0:11:06.208,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Language is useless when it can't be used for communication.

252
0:11:09.53,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It might make you wonder: What do we do with dead languages?

253
0:11:12.396,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But anyway.

254
0:11:13.636,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So, because of this idea,

255
0:11:15.067,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it might seem like the very height of absurdity

256
0:11:18.953,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to have a Duolingo course on the High Valyrian language

257
0:11:22.39,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that I created for HBO's "Game of Thrones."

258
0:11:24.962,000 --> 0:11:27,000
You might wonder what, exactly, are 740,000 people learning?

259
0:11:29.368,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Laughter)

260
0:11:31.654,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Well, let's take a look at it.

261
0:11:33.741,000 --> 0:11:34,000
What are they learning?

262
0:11:35.4,000 --> 0:11:37,000
What could they possibly be learning?

263
0:11:37.784,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Well, bearing in mind that the other language for this --

264
0:11:40.607,000 --> 0:11:42,000
it's for people that speak English --

265
0:11:43.165,000 --> 0:11:45,000
English speakers are learning quite a bit.

266
0:11:45.244,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Here's a sentence that they will probably never use for communication

267
0:11:48.582,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in their entire lives:

268
0:11:49.77,000 --> 0:11:5,000

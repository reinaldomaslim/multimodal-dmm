1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I met 273 start-up founders last year.

2
0:00:16.689,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And each one was looking for money.

3
0:00:18.976,000 --> 0:00:19,000
As a tech investor,

4
0:00:20.437,000 --> 0:00:22,000
my goal was to sort through everyone that I met

5
0:00:23.125,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and make a quick determination

6
0:00:24.784,000 --> 0:00:27,000
about which ones had the potential to make something really big.

7
0:00:28.887,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But what makes a great founder?

8
0:00:30.615,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This is a question I ask myself daily.

9
0:00:33.186,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Some venture capitalists place bets

10
0:00:35.067,000 --> 0:00:37,000
based on a founder's previous background.

11
0:00:37.496,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Did they go to an Ivy League school?

12
0:00:39.472,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Have they worked at a blue-chip company?

13
0:00:41.419,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Have they built out a big vision before?

14
0:00:43.387,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Effectively, how smart is this person?

15
0:00:46.522,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Other VCs asses a founder's emotional quotient, or EQ.

16
0:00:50.869,000 --> 0:00:51,000
How well will this person build teams

17
0:00:52.766,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and build rapport across customers and clients?

18
0:00:56.496,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I have a different methodology to assess start-up founders, though,

19
0:00:59.663,000 --> 0:01:,000
and it's not complicated.

20
0:01:01.252,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I look for signs of one specific trait.

21
0:01:04.204,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Not IQ, not EQ.

22
0:01:06.688,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's adaptability:

23
0:01:08.339,000 --> 0:01:11,000
how well a person reacts to the inevitability of change,

24
0:01:12.338,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and lots of it.

25
0:01:13.538,000 --> 0:01:15,000
That's the single most important determinant for me.

26
0:01:16.378,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I subscribe to the belief

27
0:01:17.927,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that adaptability itself is a form of intelligence,

28
0:01:21.118,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and our adaptability quotient, or AQ,

29
0:01:24.078,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is something that can be measured, tested and improved.

30
0:01:28.301,000 --> 0:01:3,000
AQ isn't just useful for start-up founders, however.

31
0:01:31.447,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I think it's increasingly important for all of us.

32
0:01:33.923,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Because the world is speeding up.

33
0:01:35.773,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We know that the rate of technological change is accelerating,

34
0:01:38.987,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which is forcing our brains to react.

35
0:01:41.244,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Whether you're navigating changing job conditions

36
0:01:43.61,000 --> 0:01:44,000
brought on by automation,

37
0:01:45.053,000 --> 0:01:48,000
shifting geopolitics in a more globalized world,

38
0:01:48.229,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or simply changing family dynamics and personal relationships.

39
0:01:51.934,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Each of us, as individuals, groups,

40
0:01:54.561,000 --> 0:01:56,000
corporations and even governments

41
0:01:56.831,000 --> 0:01:58,000
are being forced to grapple with more change

42
0:01:59.236,000 --> 0:02:01,000
than ever before in human history.

43
0:02:02.014,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So, how do we assess our adaptability?

44
0:02:05.419,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I use three tricks when meeting with founders.

45
0:02:08.067,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Here's the first.

46
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Think back to your most recent job interview.

47
0:02:12.178,000 --> 0:02:14,000
What kind of questions were you asked?

48
0:02:14.44,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Probably some variation of, "Tell me about a time when," right?

49
0:02:19.125,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Instead, to interview for adaptability,

50
0:02:22.061,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I like to ask "what if" questions.

51
0:02:24.585,000 --> 0:02:26,000
What if your main revenue stream were to dry up overnight?

52
0:02:27.387,000 --> 0:02:29,000
What if a heat wave prevented every single customer

53
0:02:29.8,000 --> 0:02:3,000
from being able to visit your store?

54
0:02:31.776,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Asking "what if," instead of asking about the past,

55
0:02:35.011,000 --> 0:02:36,000
forces the brain to simulate.

56
0:02:36.853,000 --> 0:02:38,000
To picture multiple possible versions of the future.

57
0:02:39.718,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The strength of that vision,

58
0:02:41.146,000 --> 0:02:44,000
as well as how many distinct scenarios someone can conjure, tells me a lot.

59
0:02:46.175,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Practicing simulations is a sort of safe testing ground

60
0:02:49.778,000 --> 0:02:51,000
for improving adaptability.

61
0:02:51.842,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Instead of testing how you take in and retain information,

62
0:02:55.842,000 --> 0:02:56,000
like an IQ test might,

63
0:02:57.628,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it tests how you manipulate information,

64
0:03:00.017,000 --> 0:03:01,000
given a constraint,

65
0:03:01.224,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in order to achieve a specific goal.

66
0:03:04.85,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The second trick that I use to assess adaptability in founders

67
0:03:08.696,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is to look for signs of unlearning.

68
0:03:11.538,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Active unlearners seek to challenge what they presume to already know,

69
0:03:15.863,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and instead, override that data with new information.

70
0:03:19.72,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Kind of like a computer running a disk cleanup.

71
0:03:23.053,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Take the example of Destin Sandlin,

72
0:03:25.18,000 --> 0:03:28,000
who programed his bicycle to turn left when he steered it right

73
0:03:28.712,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and vice versa.

74
0:03:30.101,000 --> 0:03:31,000
He called this his Backwards Brain Bike,

75
0:03:32.061,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and it took him nearly eight months

76
0:03:34.03,000 --> 0:03:37,000
just to learn how to ride it kind of, sort of normally.

77
0:03:37.759,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The fact that Destin was able to unlearn his regular bike

78
0:03:40.934,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in favor of a new one, though,

79
0:03:42.68,000 --> 0:03:44,000
signals something awesome about our adaptability.

80
0:03:45.656,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's not fixed.

81
0:03:47.085,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Instead, each of us has the capacity to improve it,

82
0:03:50.276,000 --> 0:03:52,000
through dedication and hard work.

83
0:03:52.712,000 --> 0:03:55,000
On the last page of Gandhi's autobiography, he wrote,

84
0:03:56.627,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"I must reduce myself to zero."

85
0:03:59.903,000 --> 0:04:01,000
At many points in his very full life,

86
0:04:02.53,000 --> 0:04:06,000
he was still seeking to return to a beginner's mindset, to zero.

87
0:04:06.831,000 --> 0:04:07,000
To unlearn.

88
0:04:08.244,000 --> 0:04:1,000
In this way, I think it's pretty safe to say

89
0:04:11.101,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Gandhi had a high AQ score.

90
0:04:12.973,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:14.149,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The third and final trick

92
0:04:15.482,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that I use to assess a founder's adaptability

93
0:04:18.173,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is to look for people who infuse exploration

94
0:04:21.077,000 --> 0:04:23,000
into their life and their business.

95
0:04:23.638,000 --> 0:04:27,000
There's a sort of natural tension between exploration and exploitation.

96
0:04:28.106,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And collectively,

97
0:04:29.384,000 --> 0:04:31,000
all of us tend to overvalue exploitation.

98
0:04:32.185,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Here's what I mean.

99
0:04:33.815,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In the year 2000,

100
0:04:35.387,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a man finagled his way into a meeting with John Antioco,

101
0:04:38.641,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the CEO of Blockbuster,

102
0:04:40.379,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and proposed a partnership

103
0:04:41.974,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to manage Blockbuster's fledgling online business.

104
0:04:45.133,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The CEO John laughed him out of the room, saying,

105
0:04:48.522,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"I have millions of existing customers

106
0:04:50.603,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and thousands of successful retail stores.

107
0:04:53.008,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I really need to focus on the money."

108
0:04:55.373,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The other man in the meeting, however,

109
0:04:57.215,000 --> 0:04:59,000
turned out to be Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix.

110
0:05:00.683,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In 2018, Netflix brought in 15.8 billion dollars,

111
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:08,000
while Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010,

112
0:05:09.085,000 --> 0:05:11,000
directly 10 years after that meeting.

113
0:05:11.736,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The Blockbuster CEO

114
0:05:13.196,000 --> 0:05:16,000
was too focused on exploiting his already successful business model,

115
0:05:17.003,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so much so that he couldn't see around the next corner.

116
0:05:20.169,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In that way, his previous success

117
0:05:22.423,000 --> 0:05:24,000
became the enemy of his adaptability potential.

118
0:05:25.717,000 --> 0:05:26,000
For the founders that I work with,

119
0:05:27.49,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I frame exploration as a state of constant seeking.

120
0:05:30.879,000 --> 0:05:32,000
To never fall too far in love with your wins

121
0:05:33.047,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but rather continue to proactively seek out what might kill you next.

122
0:05:38.192,000 --> 0:05:4,000
When I first started exploring adaptability,

123
0:05:40.653,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the thing I found most exciting is that we can improve it.

124
0:05:43.811,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Each of us has the capacity to become more adaptable.

125
0:05:47.109,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But think of it like a muscle:

126
0:05:48.609,000 --> 0:05:49,000
it's got to be exercised.

127
0:05:50.546,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And don't get discouraged if it takes a while.

128
0:05:53.141,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Remember Destin Sandlin?

129
0:05:54.758,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It took him eight months just to learn how to ride a bike.

130
0:05:57.798,000 --> 0:06:,000
Over time, using the tricks that I use on founders --

131
0:06:01.155,000 --> 0:06:04,000
asking "what if" questions, actively unlearning

132
0:06:04.403,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and prioritizing exploration over exploitation

133
0:06:08.395,000 --> 0:06:09,000
can put you in the driver's seat --

134
0:06:10.109,000 --> 0:06:12,000
so that the next time something big changes,

135
0:06:12.585,000 --> 0:06:13,000
you're already prepared.

136
0:06:14.569,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We're entering a future where IQ and EQ

137
0:06:17.783,000 --> 0:06:2,000
both matter way less than how fast you're able to adapt.

138
0:06:21.442,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So I hope that these tools help you to raise your own AQ.

139
0:06:24.982,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Thank you.

140
0:06:26.157,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Applause)

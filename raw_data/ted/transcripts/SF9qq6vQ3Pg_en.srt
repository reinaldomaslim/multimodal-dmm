1
0:00:12.951,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'm sitting in a bar with a couple of friends --

2
0:00:15.222,000 --> 0:00:16,000
literally, a couple, married couple.

3
0:00:16.986,000 --> 0:00:18,000
They're the parents of two young children,

4
0:00:19.434,000 --> 0:00:2,000
seven academic degrees between them,

5
0:00:21.446,000 --> 0:00:25,000
big nerds, really nice people but very sleep-deprived.

6
0:00:25.663,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And they ask me the question I get asked more than any other question.

7
0:00:31.206,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They go, "So, Emily,

8
0:00:33.851,000 --> 0:00:38,000
how do couples, you know, sustain a strong sexual connection

9
0:00:39.372,000 --> 0:00:4,000
over multiple decades?"

10
0:00:42.162,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I'm a sex educator, which is why my friends ask me questions like this,

11
0:00:45.599,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I am also a big nerd like my friends.

12
0:00:48.027,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I love science, which is why I can give them something like an answer.

13
0:00:52.083,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Research actually has pretty solid evidence

14
0:00:54.533,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that couples who sustain strong sexual connections

15
0:00:57.083,000 --> 0:00:58,000
over multiple decades

16
0:00:58.844,000 --> 0:00:59,000
have two things in common.

17
0:01:01.414,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Before I can tell my friends what those two things are,

18
0:01:04.054,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I have to tell them a few things that they are not.

19
0:01:06.514,000 --> 0:01:09,000
These are not couples who have sex very often.

20
0:01:10.56,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Almost none of us have sex very often.

21
0:01:14.322,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We are busy.

22
0:01:16.318,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They are also not couples who necessarily have wild, adventurous sex.

23
0:01:19.93,000 --> 0:01:2,000
One recent study actually found

24
0:01:21.544,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that the couples who are most strongly predicted

25
0:01:25.121,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to have strong sexual and relationship satisfaction,

26
0:01:29.262,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the best predictor of that

27
0:01:30.648,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is not what kind of sex they have

28
0:01:32.645,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or how often or where they have it

29
0:01:34.319,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but whether they cuddle after sex.

30
0:01:37.906,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And they are not necessarily couples

31
0:01:39.726,000 --> 0:01:41,000
who constantly can't wait to keep their hands off each other.

32
0:01:42.666,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Some of them are.

33
0:01:43.903,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They experience what the researchers call "spontaneous desire,"

34
0:01:47.3,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that just sort of seems to appear out of the blue.

35
0:01:49.758,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Erika Moen, the cartoonist who illustrated my book,

36
0:01:52.258,000 --> 0:01:56,000
draws spontaneous desire as a lightning bolt to the genitals --

37
0:01:56.847,000 --> 0:01:58,000
kaboom! -- you just want it out of the blue.

38
0:01:59.656,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That is absolutely one normal, healthy way to experience sexual desire.

39
0:02:03.878,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But there's another healthy way to experience sexual desire.

40
0:02:06.94,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's called "responsive desire."

41
0:02:09.232,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Where spontaneous desire seems to emerge in anticipation of pleasure,

42
0:02:14.235,000 --> 0:02:18,000
responsive desire emerges in response to pleasure.

43
0:02:18.467,000 --> 0:02:2,000
There's a sex therapist in New Jersey named Christine Hyde,

44
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
who taught me this great metaphor she uses with her clients.

45
0:02:24.179,000 --> 0:02:27,000
She says, imagine that your best friend invites you to a party.

46
0:02:27.577,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You say yes because it's your best friend and a party.

47
0:02:31.704,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But then, as the date approaches, you start thinking,

48
0:02:34.319,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Aw, there's going to be all this traffic.

49
0:02:36.764,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We have to find child care.

50
0:02:38.578,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Am I really going to want to put my party clothes on

51
0:02:41.087,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and get there at the end of the week?"

52
0:02:42.94,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But you put on your party clothes and you show up to the party,

53
0:02:46.399,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and what happens?

54
0:02:47.959,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You have a good time at the party.

55
0:02:49.862,000 --> 0:02:51,000
If you are having fun at the party,

56
0:02:52.09,000 --> 0:02:53,000
you are doing it right.

57
0:02:54.147,000 --> 0:02:56,000
When it comes to a sexual connection, it's the same thing.

58
0:02:57.033,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You put on your party clothes,

59
0:02:58.693,000 --> 0:02:59,000
you set up the child care,

60
0:03:00.289,000 --> 0:03:02,000
you put your body in the bed,

61
0:03:02.332,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you let your skin touch your partner's skin

62
0:03:04.903,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and allow your body to wake up and remember,

63
0:03:07.304,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"Oh, right! I like this.

64
0:03:09.79,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I like this person!"

65
0:03:11.949,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That's responsive desire,

66
0:03:13.996,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and it is key to understanding the couples who sustain a strong sexual connection

67
0:03:18.617,000 --> 0:03:19,000
over the long term,

68
0:03:19.991,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because -- and this is the part where I tell my friends

69
0:03:22.668,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the two characteristics of the couples who do sustain a strong sexual connection --

70
0:03:26.815,000 --> 0:03:3,000
one, they have a strong friendship at the foundation of their relationship.

71
0:03:31.498,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Specifically, they have strong trust.

72
0:03:34.58,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Relationship researcher and therapist,

73
0:03:36.475,000 --> 0:03:37,000
developer of emotionally focused therapy,

74
0:03:38.482,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Sue Johnson,

75
0:03:39.665,000 --> 0:03:41,000
boils trust down to this question:

76
0:03:41.964,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Are you there for me?

77
0:03:44.863,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Especially, are you emotionally present and available for me?

78
0:03:48.611,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Friends are there for each other.

79
0:03:51.231,000 --> 0:03:52,000
One.

80
0:03:52.427,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The second characteristic is that they prioritize sex.

81
0:03:57.647,000 --> 0:04:,000
They decide that it matters for their relationship.

82
0:04:01.601,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They choose to set aside all the other things that they could be doing --

83
0:04:06.122,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the children they could be raising and the jobs they could be going to,

84
0:04:09.993,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the other family members to pay attention to,

85
0:04:12.176,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the other friends they might want to hang out with.

86
0:04:14.618,000 --> 0:04:17,000
God forbid they just want to watch some television or go to sleep.

87
0:04:17.881,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Stop doing all that stuff and create a protected space

88
0:04:21.436,000 --> 0:04:24,000
where all you're going to do is put your body in the bed

89
0:04:24.818,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and let your skin touch your partner's skin.

90
0:04:28.202,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So that's it:

91
0:04:29.38,000 --> 0:04:3,000
best friends,

92
0:04:30.986,000 --> 0:04:31,000
prioritize sex.

93
0:04:33.201,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So I said this to my friends in the bar.

94
0:04:35.2,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I was like, best friends, prioritize sex, I told them about the party,

95
0:04:38.618,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I said you put your skin next to your partner's skin.

96
0:04:41.154,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And one of the partners I was talking to goes, "Aaagh."

97
0:04:46.373,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:47.545,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And I was like, "OK, so, there's your problem."

99
0:04:49.767,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:50.837,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The difficulty was not that they did not want to go to the party, necessarily.

101
0:04:54.784,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If the difficulty is just a lack of spontaneous desire for party,

102
0:04:58.008,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you know what to do:

103
0:04:59.184,000 --> 0:05:01,000
you put on your party clothes and show up for the party.

104
0:05:01.842,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If you're having fun at the party, you're doing it right.

105
0:05:04.563,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Their difficulty was that this was a party

106
0:05:06.652,000 --> 0:05:09,000
where she didn't love what there was available to eat,

107
0:05:10.542,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the music was not her favorite music,

108
0:05:12.486,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and she wasn't totally sure she felt great about her relationships with people

109
0:05:16.215,000 --> 0:05:17,000
who were at the party.

110
0:05:17.579,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And this happens all the time:

111
0:05:19.548,000 --> 0:05:24,000
nice people who love each other come to dread sex.

112
0:05:25.073,000 --> 0:05:27,000
These couples, if they seek sex therapy,

113
0:05:27.158,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the therapist might have them stand up

114
0:05:29.384,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and put as much distance between their bodies as they need

115
0:05:32.618,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in order to feel comfortable,

116
0:05:34.197,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and the less interested partner will make 20 feet of space.

117
0:05:39.881,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And the really difficult part is that space is not empty.

118
0:05:43.743,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It is crowded with weeks or months or more

119
0:05:48.406,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of the, "You're not listening to me,"

120
0:05:50.25,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and "I don't know what's wrong with me but your criticism isn't helping,"

121
0:05:53.744,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and, "If you loved me, you would," and, "You're not there for me."

122
0:05:56.978,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Years, maybe, of all these difficult feelings.

123
0:06:00.771,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In the book, I use this really silly metaphor

124
0:06:03.079,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of difficult feelings as sleepy hedgehogs

125
0:06:06.05,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that you are fostering until you can find a way to set them free

126
0:06:10.283,000 --> 0:06:13,000
by turning toward them with kindness and compassion.

127
0:06:14.079,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And the couples who struggle to maintain a strong sexual connection,

128
0:06:17.654,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the distance between them is crowded with these sleepy hedgehogs.

129
0:06:21.691,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And it happens in any relationship that lasts long enough.

130
0:06:24.471,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You, too, are fostering a prickle of sleepy hedgehogs

131
0:06:28.136,000 --> 0:06:3,000
between you and your certain special someone.

132
0:06:30.851,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The difference between couples who sustain a strong sexual connection

133
0:06:34.162,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the ones who don't

134
0:06:35.34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is not that they don't experience these difficult hurt feelings,

135
0:06:39.115,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it's that they turn towards those difficult feelings

136
0:06:41.897,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with kindness and compassion

137
0:06:44.221,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so that they can set them free

138
0:06:46.232,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and find their way back to each other.

139
0:06:49.019,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So my friends in the bar are faced with the question under the question,

140
0:06:53.569,000 --> 0:06:55,000
not, "How do we sustain a strong connection?"

141
0:06:56.398,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but, "How do we find our way back to it?"

142
0:06:59.65,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And, yes, there is science to answer this question,

143
0:07:02.264,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but in 25 years as a sex educator,

144
0:07:04.499,000 --> 0:07:06,000
one thing I have learned is sometimes, Emily,

145
0:07:06.829,000 --> 0:07:07,000
less science,

146
0:07:09.127,000 --> 0:07:1,000
more hedgehogs.

147
0:07:10.627,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So I told them about me.

148
0:07:12.774,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I spent many months writing a book about the science of women's sexual well-being.

149
0:07:18.241,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I was thinking about sex all day, every day,

150
0:07:21.293,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and I was so stressed by the project that I had zero -- zero! -- interest

151
0:07:25.865,000 --> 0:07:26,000
in actually having any sex.

152
0:07:28.167,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And then I spent months traveling all over,

153
0:07:30.801,000 --> 0:07:31,000
talking with anyone who would listen

154
0:07:32.626,000 --> 0:07:34,000
about the science of women's sexual well-being.

155
0:07:34.944,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And by the time I got home, you know,

156
0:07:36.983,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I'd show up for the party, put my body in the bed,

157
0:07:39.378,000 --> 0:07:41,000
let my skin touch my partner's skin,

158
0:07:41.429,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and I was so exhausted and overwhelmed I would just cry and fall asleep.

159
0:07:46.463,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the months of isolation fostered fear and loneliness

160
0:07:52.351,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and frustration.

161
0:07:54.535,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So many hedgehogs.

162
0:07:57.173,000 --> 0:08:01,000
My best friend, this person I love and admire,

163
0:08:01.397,000 --> 0:08:03,000
felt a million miles away.

164
0:08:05.081,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But ...

165
0:08:07.155,000 --> 0:08:08,000
he was still there for me.

166
0:08:08.963,000 --> 0:08:11,000
No matter how many difficult feelings there were,

167
0:08:12.289,000 --> 0:08:14,000
he turned toward them with kindness and compassion.

168
0:08:14.971,000 --> 0:08:15,000
He never turned away.

169
0:08:17.65,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And what was the second characteristic

170
0:08:19.527,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of couples who sustain a strong sexual connection?

171
0:08:22.972,000 --> 0:08:23,000
They prioritize sex.

172
0:08:24.328,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They decide that it matters for their relationship,

173
0:08:27.906,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that they do what it takes to find their way back to the connection.

174
0:08:31.23,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I told my friends what sex therapist and researcher Peggy Kleinplatz says.

175
0:08:34.951,000 --> 0:08:38,000
She asks: What kind of sex is worth wanting?

176
0:08:39.993,000 --> 0:08:42,000
My partner and I looked at the quality of our connection

177
0:08:43.279,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and what it brought to our lives,

178
0:08:45.162,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and we looked at the family of sleepy hedgehogs

179
0:08:48.03,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I had introduced into our home.

180
0:08:53.016,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And we decided it was worth it.

181
0:08:55.268,000 --> 0:09:,000
We decided -- we chose -- to do what it took to find our way,

182
0:09:00.448,000 --> 0:09:02,000
turning towards each of those sleepy hedgehogs,

183
0:09:02.675,000 --> 0:09:03,000
those difficult hurt feelings,

184
0:09:04.34,000 --> 0:09:05,000
with kindness and compassion

185
0:09:05.732,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and setting them free so that we could find our way back

186
0:09:08.504,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to the connection that mattered for our relationship.

187
0:09:13.095,000 --> 0:09:14,000
This is not the story we are usually told

188
0:09:15.089,000 --> 0:09:18,000
about how sexual desire works in long-term relationships.

189
0:09:19.318,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But I can think of nothing more romantic,

190
0:09:23.102,000 --> 0:09:24,000
nothing sexier,

191
0:09:24.992,000 --> 0:09:28,000
than being chosen as a priority

192
0:09:29.108,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because that connection matters enough,

193
0:09:32.697,000 --> 0:09:36,000
even after I introduced all of these difficult feelings into our relationship.

194
0:09:38.568,000 --> 0:09:42,000
How do you sustain a strong sexual connection over the long term?

195
0:09:44.254,000 --> 0:09:47,000
You look into the eyes of your best friend,

196
0:09:47.404,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and you keep choosing to find your way back.

197
0:09:51.833,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Thank you.

198
0:09:53.032,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement:

3
0:00:18.313,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to resonate other people's feelings, thoughts, intentions, motivations,

4
0:00:23.707,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the act of being with them.

5
0:00:26.999,000 --> 0:00:3,000
As a scientist, I always wanted to measure that resonance,

6
0:00:32.776,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that sense of the other that happens so quickly,

7
0:00:35.418,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the blink of an eye.

8
0:00:37.682,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We intuit other people's feelings;

9
0:00:40.032,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we know the meaning of their actions even before they happen.

10
0:00:43.959,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We're always in this stance

11
0:00:45.729,000 --> 0:00:48,000
of being the object of somebody else's subjectivity.

12
0:00:48.835,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We do that all the time. We just can't shake it off.

13
0:00:52.025,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's so important that the very tools we use to understand ourselves,

14
0:00:55.748,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to understand the world around us,

15
0:00:57.599,000 --> 0:00:58,000
are shaped by that stance.

16
0:01:00.226,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We are social to the core.

17
0:01:03.572,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So my journey in autism really started

18
0:01:06.047,000 --> 0:01:09,000
when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism.

19
0:01:10.068,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives

20
0:01:13.183,000 --> 0:01:14,000
in long-stay hospitals.

21
0:01:14.692,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is a long time ago.

22
0:01:17.021,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And for them, autism was devastating.

23
0:01:21.395,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They had profound intellectual disabilities.

24
0:01:24.558,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They didn't talk.

25
0:01:26.31,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But most of all,

26
0:01:28.217,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them,

27
0:01:33.17,000 --> 0:01:34,000
from their environment

28
0:01:35.031,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and from the people.

29
0:01:37.392,000 --> 0:01:39,000
In fact, at the time, if you walked into a school

30
0:01:40.243,000 --> 0:01:41,000
for individuals with autism,

31
0:01:42.055,000 --> 0:01:44,000
you'd hear a lot of noise,

32
0:01:44.392,000 --> 0:01:48,000
plenty of commotion, actions, people doing things.

33
0:01:49.73,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But they're always doing things by themselves.

34
0:01:53.405,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling,

35
0:01:57.527,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or they may be isolated in the corner,

36
0:02:00.936,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements,

37
0:02:04.495,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere.

38
0:02:08.558,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Extremely, extremely isolated.

39
0:02:12.625,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Well, now we know that autism is this disruption,

40
0:02:18.229,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you about.

41
0:02:21.77,000 --> 0:02:22,000
These are survival skills.

42
0:02:23.728,000 --> 0:02:25,000
These are survival skills that we inherited

43
0:02:26.638,000 --> 0:02:29,000
over many, many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution.

44
0:02:30.845,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You see, babies are born in a state of utter fragility.

45
0:02:36.032,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Without the caregiver, they wouldn't survive,

46
0:02:38.185,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so it stands to reason that nature would endow them

47
0:02:40.715,000 --> 0:02:41,000
with these mechanisms of survival.

48
0:02:44.169,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They orient to the caregiver.

49
0:02:46.525,000 --> 0:02:48,000
From the first days and weeks of life,

50
0:02:49.94,000 --> 0:02:51,000
babies prefer to hear human sounds,

51
0:02:52.698,000 --> 0:02:54,000
rather than just sounds in the environment.

52
0:02:54.846,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They prefer to look at people rather than at things,

53
0:02:57.347,000 --> 0:03:,000
and even as they're looking at people, they look at people's eyes,

54
0:03:01.747,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because the eye is the window to the other person's experiences,

55
0:03:05.979,000 --> 0:03:07,000
so much so that they even prefer to look at people

56
0:03:08.461,000 --> 0:03:11,000
who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away.

57
0:03:12.525,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Well, they orient to the caregiver.

58
0:03:15.131,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The caregiver seeks the baby.

59
0:03:17.272,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And it's out of this mutually reinforcing choreography

60
0:03:21.085,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind --

61
0:03:24.904,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the social mind, the social brain -- depends on.

62
0:03:29.587,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We always think about autism

63
0:03:32.683,000 --> 0:03:36,000
as something that happens later on in life.

64
0:03:37.347,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It doesn't; it begins with the beginning of life.

65
0:03:42.901,000 --> 0:03:47,000
As babies engage with caregivers, they soon realize that, well,

66
0:03:48.52,000 --> 0:03:52,000
there is something between the ears that is very important --

67
0:03:52.666,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it's invisible, you can't see it, but it's really critical.

68
0:03:56.849,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And that thing is called attention.

69
0:03:58.8,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And they learn soon enough,

70
0:04:00.157,000 --> 0:04:02,000
even before they can utter one word,

71
0:04:02.769,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that they can take that attention and move somewhere

72
0:04:06.273,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in order to get things they want.

73
0:04:09.555,000 --> 0:04:12,000
They also learn to follow other people's gazes,

74
0:04:12.679,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about.

75
0:04:18.704,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And soon enough, they start to learn about the meaning of things,

76
0:04:22.374,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because when somebody is looking at something

77
0:04:24.771,000 --> 0:04:26,000
or somebody is pointing at something,

78
0:04:27.013,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they're not just getting a directional cue.

79
0:04:29.752,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They are getting the other person's meaning of that thing,

80
0:04:33.459,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the attitude.

81
0:04:34.693,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And soon enough, they start building this body of meanings,

82
0:04:39.488,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction.

83
0:04:44.11,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Those are meanings that are acquired

84
0:04:46.049,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as part of their shared experiences with others.

85
0:04:50.086,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl,

86
0:04:57.512,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and she has autism.

87
0:05:00.594,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face,

88
0:05:06.406,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and she's quite oblivious to me.

89
0:05:08.265,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Imagine if I did that to you, came two inches from your face.

90
0:05:11.717,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?

91
0:05:13.946,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You would recoil. You would call the police.

92
0:05:16.568,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:17.766,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You would do something,

94
0:05:18.943,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space

95
0:05:23.025,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and not get that reaction.

96
0:05:24.452,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly.

97
0:05:27.931,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is our body wisdom;

98
0:05:29.12,000 --> 0:05:31,000
it's not something mediated by our language.

99
0:05:31.342,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Our body just knows that.

100
0:05:34.269,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And we've known that for a long time.

101
0:05:36.661,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And this is not something that happens to humans only.

102
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It happens to some of our phyletic cousins,

103
0:05:42.824,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey,

104
0:05:46.914,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you,

105
0:05:50.932,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and that is considered to be a signal or threat,

106
0:05:54.485,000 --> 0:05:56,000
well, you are not going to be alive for long.

107
0:05:57.365,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So something that in other species are survival mechanisms,

108
0:06:02.221,000 --> 0:06:05,000
without which they wouldn't basically live,

109
0:06:05.352,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we bring into the context of human beings,

110
0:06:07.907,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and this is what we need to simply act, socially.

111
0:06:12.18,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her,

112
0:06:14.973,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and you think, maybe she can see you,

113
0:06:16.971,000 --> 0:06:17,000
maybe she can hear you.

114
0:06:18.506,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Well, a few minutes later,

115
0:06:20.152,000 --> 0:06:21,000
she goes to the corner of the room,

116
0:06:22.117,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&M.

117
0:06:26.859,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So I could not attract her attention,

118
0:06:31.4,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but something -- a thing -- did.

119
0:06:33.93,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Now, most of us make a big dichotomy

120
0:06:36.471,000 --> 0:06:38,000
between the world of things and the world of people.

121
0:06:40.882,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear,

122
0:06:45.397,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the world of people is not attracting her

123
0:06:48.527,000 --> 0:06:49,000
as much as we would like.

124
0:06:50.01,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences.

125
0:06:54.445,000 --> 0:06:59,000
What she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging,

126
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
moment by moment,

127
0:07:02.095,000 --> 0:07:05,000
as she is isolating herself further and further.

128
0:07:05.913,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic,

129
0:07:08.879,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the brain determines who we're going to be.

130
0:07:11.429,000 --> 0:07:13,000
But, in fact, the brain also becomes who we are,

131
0:07:14.241,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away

132
0:07:18.254,000 --> 0:07:2,000
from the realm of social interaction,

133
0:07:20.44,000 --> 0:07:22,000
this is what's happening with her mind,

134
0:07:22.489,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and this is what's happening with her brain.

135
0:07:27.143,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition

136
0:07:32.367,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of all developmental disorders.

137
0:07:36.461,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And it's a brain disorder.

138
0:07:38.695,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time

139
0:07:41.948,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that the child is born.

140
0:07:44.217,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.

141
0:07:48.222,000 --> 0:07:51,000
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled

142
0:07:51.715,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but there are those that are gifted.

143
0:07:53.696,000 --> 0:07:55,000
There are those individuals who don't talk at all;

144
0:07:56.114,000 --> 0:07:58,000
there are those individuals who talk too much.

145
0:07:58.526,000 --> 0:08:01,000
There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school,

146
0:08:02.047,000 --> 0:08:05,000
you see them running the periphery fence all the school day if you let them,

147
0:08:05.741,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you

148
0:08:08.126,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and trying to engage you repeatedly, relentlessly,

149
0:08:11.091,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but often in an awkward fashion,

150
0:08:14.232,000 --> 0:08:16,000
without that immediate resonance.

151
0:08:17.812,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Well, this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time.

152
0:08:21.582,000 --> 0:08:22,000
When I started in this field,

153
0:08:23.017,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we thought there were four individuals with autism per 10,000 --

154
0:08:26.129,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a very rare condition.

155
0:08:27.861,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Well, now we know it's more like one in 100.

156
0:08:31.957,000 --> 0:08:34,000
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us.

157
0:08:37.216,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The societal cost of this condition is huge,

158
0:08:40.585,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in the US alone, maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars.

159
0:08:43.557,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And you know what?

160
0:08:44.769,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults

161
0:08:49.43,000 --> 0:08:5,000
who are severely disabled,

162
0:08:51.205,000 --> 0:08:53,000
individuals who need wraparound services --

163
0:08:53.39,000 --> 0:08:55,000
services that are very, very intensive.

164
0:08:55.67,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And those services can cost in excess of 60,000 to 80,000 dollars a year.

165
0:09:00.536,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment,

166
0:09:04.474,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because now we know that autism creates itself

167
0:09:08.636,000 --> 0:09:12,000
as individuals diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you.

168
0:09:13.2,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Were we to be able to identify this condition

169
0:09:15.797,000 --> 0:09:17,000
at an earlier point, and intervene and treat --

170
0:09:19.812,000 --> 0:09:23,000
I can tell you, this has been probably something that has changed my life

171
0:09:23.89,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in the past 10 years,

172
0:09:25.21,000 --> 0:09:29,000
this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition.

173
0:09:30.922,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Also, we have a window of opportunity,

174
0:09:33.301,000 --> 0:09:35,000
because the brain is malleable for just so long,

175
0:09:36.437,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life.

176
0:09:39.974,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's not that that window closes; it doesn't.

177
0:09:43.621,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But it diminishes considerably.

178
0:09:46.899,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And yet, the median age of diagnosis in this country

179
0:09:50.021,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is still about five years,

180
0:09:51.957,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and in disadvantaged populations,

181
0:09:54.076,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the populations that don't have access to clinical services,

182
0:09:57.229,000 --> 0:09:59,000
rural populations, minorities,

183
0:10:00.338,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the age of diagnosis is later still,

184
0:10:03.071,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which is almost as if I were to tell you

185
0:10:05.12,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism

186
0:10:08.911,000 --> 0:10:1,000
whose condition is going to be more severe.

187
0:10:12.162,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So I feel that we have a bioethical imperative.

188
0:10:15.168,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The science is there.

189
0:10:18.025,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But no science is of relevance

190
0:10:20.169,000 --> 0:10:22,000
if it doesn't have an impact on the community.

191
0:10:23.727,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And we just can't afford that missed opportunity,

192
0:10:26.705,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because children with autism become adults with autism.

193
0:10:30.412,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we feel that those things we can do

194
0:10:34.44,000 --> 0:10:36,000
for these children, for those families, early on,

195
0:10:36.842,000 --> 0:10:38,000
will have lifetime consequences --

196
0:10:39.043,000 --> 0:10:43,000
for the child, for the family, and for the community at large.

197
0:10:43.075,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So this is our view of autism.

198
0:10:46.145,000 --> 0:10:49,000
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism.

199
0:10:49.491,000 --> 0:10:5,000
In fact, we believe there are going to be

200
0:10:51.474,000 --> 0:10:54,000
something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism,

201
0:10:55.303,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and genetic anomalies, much more than just genes.

202
0:10:59.46,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And we actually have a bit of a question here,

203
0:11:03.644,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because if there are so many different causes of autism,

204
0:11:06.953,000 --> 0:11:1,000
how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome?

205
0:11:11.245,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Because people like myself,

206
0:11:13.53,000 --> 0:11:15,000
when we walk into a playroom,

207
0:11:15.791,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we recognize a child as having autism.

208
0:11:18.835,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So how do you go from multiple causes

209
0:11:21.087,000 --> 0:11:23,000
to a syndrome that has some homogeneity?

210
0:11:24.491,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And the answer is what lies in between,

211
0:11:27.753,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which is development.

212
0:11:29.66,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And in fact, we are very interested in those first two years of life,

213
0:11:34.457,000 --> 0:11:37,000
because those liabilities don't necessarily convert into autism.

214
0:11:38.269,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Autism creates itself.

215
0:11:40.812,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life,

216
0:11:45.569,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we might attenuate for some, and God knows, maybe even prevent for others.

217
0:11:51.975,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So how do we do that?

218
0:11:53.837,000 --> 0:11:55,000
How do we enter that feeling of resonance,

219
0:11:56.753,000 --> 0:11:58,000
how do we enter another person's being?

220
0:12:01.137,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-old,

221
0:12:04.276,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the thing that came to my mind was,

222
0:12:06.438,000 --> 0:12:08,000
"How do you come into her world?

223
0:12:09.41,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Is she thinking about me? Is she thinking about others?"

224
0:12:13.91,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Well, it's hard to do that,

225
0:12:16.784,000 --> 0:12:18,000
so we had to create the technologies.

226
0:12:18.986,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We had to basically step inside a body.

227
0:12:21.479,000 --> 0:12:23,000
We had to see the world through her eyes.

228
0:12:25.192,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And so in the past many years,

229
0:12:27.528,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we've been building these new technologies

230
0:12:29.948,000 --> 0:12:3,000
that are based on eye tracking.

231
0:12:31.553,000 --> 0:12:35,000
We can see, moment by moment, what children are engaging with.

232
0:12:38.046,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is my colleague, Warren Jones,

233
0:12:39.834,000 --> 0:12:42,000
with whom we've been building these methods, these studies,

234
0:12:43.152,000 --> 0:12:44,000
for the past 12 years.

235
0:12:44.879,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And you see there a happy five-month-old,

236
0:12:48.789,000 --> 0:12:53,000
a five-month little boy who is going to watch things

237
0:12:53.88,000 --> 0:12:54,000
that are brought from his world:

238
0:12:56.596,000 --> 0:12:58,000
his mom, the caregiver,

239
0:12:58.853,000 --> 0:13:02,000
but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare.

240
0:13:03.884,000 --> 0:13:06,000
What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory,

241
0:13:07.748,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but in order for us to do that,

242
0:13:09.806,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we had to create these very sophisticated measures,

243
0:13:14.085,000 --> 0:13:17,000
measures of how people, how little babies,

244
0:13:17.59,000 --> 0:13:21,000
how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment.

245
0:13:22.128,000 --> 0:13:24,000
What is important and what is not.

246
0:13:25.163,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Well, we created those measures,

247
0:13:27.798,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention.

248
0:13:31.826,000 --> 0:13:32,000
You're watching a video --

249
0:13:33.739,000 --> 0:13:35,000
those frames are separated by about a second --

250
0:13:36.494,000 --> 0:13:39,000
through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds.

251
0:13:40.837,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And we freeze one frame,

252
0:13:43.908,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and this is what the typical children are doing.

253
0:13:47.02,000 --> 0:13:51,000
In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism.

254
0:13:51.461,000 --> 0:13:56,000
So on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this,

255
0:13:58.039,000 --> 0:14:,000
the emotion of expression of that little boy

256
0:14:00.588,000 --> 0:14:02,000
as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl.

257
0:14:03.338,000 --> 0:14:05,000
What are the children with autism doing?

258
0:14:05.399,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They are focusing on the revolving door,

259
0:14:09.304,000 --> 0:14:1,000
opening and shutting.

260
0:14:11.542,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here

261
0:14:14.915,000 --> 0:14:16,000
doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment.

262
0:14:17.751,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It happens moment by moment in their real lives,

263
0:14:21.82,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized

264
0:14:26.077,000 --> 0:14:3,000
in something other than what is happening with their typical peers.

265
0:14:30.807,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends,

266
0:14:37.35,000 --> 0:14:38,000
the concept of growth charts --

267
0:14:38.893,000 --> 0:14:4,000
you know, when you take a child to the pediatrician,

268
0:14:41.394,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and you have physical height and weight.

269
0:14:45.066,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Well, we decided we were going to create growth charts

270
0:14:48.024,000 --> 0:14:49,000
of social engagement.

271
0:14:50.354,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We sought children from the time they're born.

272
0:14:53.574,000 --> 0:14:56,000
What you see here on the x-axis

273
0:14:56.973,000 --> 0:15:,000
is two, three, four, five, six months and nine,

274
0:15:01.182,000 --> 0:15:02,000
until about the age of 24 months.

275
0:15:02.969,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This is the percent of their viewing time

276
0:15:05.764,000 --> 0:15:06,000
that they're focusing on people's eyes,

277
0:15:07.699,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and this is their growth chart.

278
0:15:10.144,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They start over here -- they love people's eyes --

279
0:15:12.641,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and it remains quite stable.

280
0:15:15.35,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.

281
0:15:19.319,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Now, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic.

282
0:15:23.771,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It's something very different.

283
0:15:26.004,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It starts way up here, but then it's a free fall.

284
0:15:29.799,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It's very much like they brought into this world the reflex

285
0:15:33.694,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that orients them to people, but it has no traction.

286
0:15:37.511,000 --> 0:15:39,000
It's almost as if that stimulus -- you --

287
0:15:40.54,000 --> 0:15:42,000
you're not exerting influence on what happens

288
0:15:43.554,000 --> 0:15:45,000
as they navigate their daily lives.

289
0:15:47.236,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Now, we thought those data were so powerful, in a way,

290
0:15:54.686,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life,

291
0:15:57.96,000 --> 0:16:,000
because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-old,

292
0:16:01.192,000 --> 0:16:04,000
you'd be surprised by how social those babies are.

293
0:16:05.513,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And what we see in the first six months of life

294
0:16:08.394,000 --> 0:16:12,000
is that those two groups can be segregated very easily.

295
0:16:14.159,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And using these kinds of measures and many others,

296
0:16:17.3,000 --> 0:16:2,000
what we found out is that our science could, in fact,

297
0:16:20.977,000 --> 0:16:22,000
identify this condition early on.

298
0:16:23.749,000 --> 0:16:26,000
We didn't have to wait for the behaviors of autism

299
0:16:26.934,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to emerge in the second year of life.

300
0:16:30.156,000 --> 0:16:34,000
If we measured things that are, evolutionarily, highly conserved,

301
0:16:34.707,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and developmentally very early-emerging --

302
0:16:37.054,000 --> 0:16:39,000
things that are online from the first weeks of life --

303
0:16:39.755,000 --> 0:16:4,000
we could push the detection of autism

304
0:16:41.741,000 --> 0:16:43,000
all the way to those first months,

305
0:16:44.293,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and that's what we are doing now.

306
0:16:48.618,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Now, we can create the very best technologies

307
0:16:51.799,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and the very best methods to identify the children,

308
0:16:55.591,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but this would be for naught if we didn't have an impact

309
0:16:58.529,000 --> 0:17:,000
on what happens in their reality in the community.

310
0:17:01.68,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Now we want those devices, of course,

311
0:17:03.986,000 --> 0:17:05,000
to be deployed by those who are in the trenches --

312
0:17:06.839,000 --> 0:17:1,000
our colleagues, the primary care physicians, who see every child --

313
0:17:12.067,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and we need to transform those technologies

314
0:17:14.454,000 --> 0:17:17,000
into something that is going to add value to their practice,

315
0:17:17.48,000 --> 0:17:19,000
because they have to see so many children.

316
0:17:19.69,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And we want to do that universally so that we don't miss any child.

317
0:17:23.791,000 --> 0:17:24,000
But this would be immoral

318
0:17:26.529,000 --> 0:17:31,000
if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention, for treatment.

319
0:17:32.487,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We need to be able to work with the families, support the families,

320
0:17:36.403,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to manage those first years with them.

321
0:17:40.384,000 --> 0:17:42,000
We need to be able to really go

322
0:17:42.806,000 --> 0:17:45,000
from universal screening to universal access to treatment,

323
0:17:46.752,000 --> 0:17:48,000
because those treatments are going to change

324
0:17:49.765,000 --> 0:17:51,000
these children's and those families' lives.

325
0:17:54.45,000 --> 0:18:,000
Now, when we think about what we [can] do in those first years,

326
0:18:00.912,000 --> 0:18:04,000
I can tell you, having been in this field for so long,

327
0:18:06.077,000 --> 0:18:08,000
one feels really rejuvenated.

328
0:18:08.832,000 --> 0:18:12,000
There is a sense that the science that one worked on

329
0:18:13.578,000 --> 0:18:15,000
can actually have an impact on realities,

330
0:18:16.371,000 --> 0:18:18,000
preventing, in fact, those experiences

331
0:18:19.972,000 --> 0:18:21,000
that I really started in my journey in this field.

332
0:18:23.343,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition.

333
0:18:26.777,000 --> 0:18:29,000
No longer. We can do a great deal of things.

334
0:18:30.707,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And the idea is not to cure autism.

335
0:18:33.14,000 --> 0:18:34,000
That's not the idea.

336
0:18:35.791,000 --> 0:18:37,000
What we want is to make sure

337
0:18:37.889,000 --> 0:18:39,000
that those individuals with autism can be free

338
0:18:40.465,000 --> 0:18:43,000
from the devastating consequences that come with it at times,

339
0:18:44.876,000 --> 0:18:47,000
the profound intellectual disabilities, the lack of language,

340
0:18:47.961,000 --> 0:18:49,000
the profound, profound isolation.

341
0:18:51.563,000 --> 0:18:53,000
We feel that individuals with autism, in fact,

342
0:18:53.833,000 --> 0:18:55,000
have a very special perspective on the world,

343
0:18:56.323,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and we need diversity.

344
0:18:58.44,000 --> 0:19:01,000
And they can work extremely well in some areas of strength:

345
0:19:02.09,000 --> 0:19:05,000
predictable situations, situations that can be defined.

346
0:19:05.493,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Because after all, they learn about the world

347
0:19:08.475,000 --> 0:19:09,000
almost, like, about it,

348
0:19:10.381,000 --> 0:19:12,000
rather than learning how to function in it.

349
0:19:13.202,000 --> 0:19:16,000
But this is a strength if you're working, for example, in technology.

350
0:19:18.081,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities.

351
0:19:21.936,000 --> 0:19:23,000
We want them to be free to do that.

352
0:19:24.293,000 --> 0:19:27,000
We want that the next generations of individuals with autism

353
0:19:27.436,000 --> 0:19:3,000
will be able not only to express their strengths,

354
0:19:30.538,000 --> 0:19:31,000
but to fulfill their promise.

355
0:19:32.952,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Well, thank you for listening to me.

356
0:19:34.723,000 --> 0:19:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Twelve years ago, I picked up a camera for the first time

2
0:00:17.08,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to film the olive harvest in a Palestinian village in the West Bank.

3
0:00:21.88,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I thought I was there to make a single documentary

4
0:00:24.32,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and would then move on to some other part of the world.

5
0:00:27.2,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But something kept bringing me back.

6
0:00:30.32,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, usually, when international audiences hear about that part of the world,

7
0:00:34.32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
they often just want that conflict to go away.

8
0:00:37.88,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is bad, and we wish it could just disappear.

9
0:00:42.28,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We feel much the same way about other conflicts around the world.

10
0:00:46.36,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But every time we turn our attention to the news,

11
0:00:49.32,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it seems like one more country has gone up in flames.

12
0:00:53.8,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I've been wondering

13
0:00:55.04,000 --> 0:00:58,000
whether we should not start looking at conflict in a different way --

14
0:00:59.2,000 --> 0:01:02,000
whether instead of simply wishing to end conflict,

15
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we focus instead on how to wage conflict.

16
0:01:07.2,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This has been a big question for me,

17
0:01:09.28,000 --> 0:01:12,000
one I've pursued together with my team at the nonprofit Just Vision.

18
0:01:14.32,000 --> 0:01:18,000
After witnessing several different kinds of struggles in the Middle East,

19
0:01:18.44,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I started noticing some patterns on the more successful ones.

20
0:01:22.68,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I wondered whether these variables held across cases, and if they did,

21
0:01:26.84,000 --> 0:01:3,000
what lessons we could glean for waging constructive conflict,

22
0:01:31.76,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in Palestine, Israel and elsewhere.

23
0:01:36.2,000 --> 0:01:37,000
There is some science about this.

24
0:01:38.76,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In a study of 323 major political conflicts

25
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:44,000
from 1900 to 2006,

26
0:01:45.96,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Maria Stephan and Erica Chenoweth found that nonviolent campaigns

27
0:01:51.28,000 --> 0:01:57,000
were almost 100 percent more likely to lead to success than violent campaigns.

28
0:01:58.08,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Nonviolent campaigns are also less likely to cause physical harm

29
0:02:02.4,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to those waging the campaign,

30
0:02:04.36,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as well as their opponents.

31
0:02:06.52,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And, critically, they typically lead to more peaceful and democratic societies.

32
0:02:13.32,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In other words, nonviolent resistance is a more effective and constructive way

33
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of waging conflict.

34
0:02:20.72,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But if that's such an easy choice, why don't more groups use it?

35
0:02:25.24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Political scientist Victor Asal and colleagues

36
0:02:27.92,000 --> 0:02:28,000
have looked at several factors

37
0:02:29.72,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that shape a political group's choice of tactics.

38
0:02:33.2,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And it turns out that the greatest predictor

39
0:02:37.04,000 --> 0:02:41,000
of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence or violence

40
0:02:41.36,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is not whether that group is more left-wing or right-wing,

41
0:02:45.72,000 --> 0:02:5,000
not whether the group is more or less influenced by religious beliefs,

42
0:02:50.84,000 --> 0:02:53,000
not whether it's up against a democracy or a dictatorship,

43
0:02:53.92,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and not even the levels of repression that that group is facing.

44
0:02:58.64,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The greatest predictor of a movement's decision to adopt nonviolence

45
0:03:04.12,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is its ideology regarding the role of women in public life.

46
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

47
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
When a movement includes in its discourse

48
0:03:18.12,000 --> 0:03:19,000
language around gender equality,

49
0:03:19.88,000 --> 0:03:22,000
it increases dramatically the chances it will adopt nonviolence,

50
0:03:23.24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and thus, the likelihood it will succeed.

51
0:03:26.28,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The research squared up with my own documentation

52
0:03:29.08,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of political organizing in Israel and Palestine.

53
0:03:32.44,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I've noticed that movements which welcome women into leadership positions,

54
0:03:36.88,000 --> 0:03:39,000
such as the one I documented in a village called Budrus,

55
0:03:40.2,000 --> 0:03:42,000
were much more likely to achieve their goals.

56
0:03:43.92,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This village was under a real threat of being wiped off the map

57
0:03:47.96,000 --> 0:03:49,000
when Israel started building the separation barrier.

58
0:03:51.56,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The proposed route would require

59
0:03:53.44,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the destruction of this community's olive groves, their cemeteries

60
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and would ultimately enclose the village from all sides.

61
0:04:01.88,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Through inspired local leadership,

62
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:06,000
they launched a nonviolent resistance campaign to stop that from happening.

63
0:04:08.4,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The odds were massively stacked against them.

64
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But they had a secret weapon:

65
0:04:17.88,000 --> 0:04:18,000
a 15-year-old girl

66
0:04:19.68,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who courageously jumped in front of a bulldozer

67
0:04:22.44,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which was about to uproot an olive tree, stopping it.

68
0:04:26.64,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In that moment, the community of Budrus realized what was possible

69
0:04:30.24,000 --> 0:04:34,000
if they welcomed and encouraged women to participate in public life.

70
0:04:35.56,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And so it was that the women of Budrus went to the front lines day after day,

71
0:04:39.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
using their creativity and acumen to overcome multiple obstacles they faced

72
0:04:43.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in a 10-month unarmed struggle.

73
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And as you can probably tell at this point,

74
0:04:49.024,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they win at the end.

75
0:04:51.76,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The separation barrier was changed completely

76
0:04:54.72,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to the internationally recognized green line,

77
0:04:57.48,000 --> 0:05:,000
and the women of Budrus came to be known across the West Bank

78
0:05:01.24,000 --> 0:05:03,000
for their indomitable energy.

79
0:05:04.56,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Applause)

80
0:05:07.32,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Thank you.

81
0:05:12.56,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I want to pause for a second, which you helped me do,

82
0:05:15.28,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because I do want to tackle two very serious misunderstandings

83
0:05:19.24,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that could happen at this point.

84
0:05:21.84,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The first one is that I don't believe

85
0:05:25.28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
women are inherently or essentially more peaceful than men.

86
0:05:31.8,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But I do believe that in today's world,

87
0:05:35.2,000 --> 0:05:37,000
women experience power differently.

88
0:05:39.28,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Having had to navigate being in the less powerful position

89
0:05:42.48,000 --> 0:05:44,000
in multiple aspects of their lives,

90
0:05:45.24,000 --> 0:05:47,000
women are often more adept

91
0:05:47.6,000 --> 0:05:5,000
at how to surreptitiously pressure for change

92
0:05:50.88,000 --> 0:05:52,000
against large, powerful actors.

93
0:05:53.64,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The term "manipulative," often charged against women in a derogatory way,

94
0:05:57.84,000 --> 0:06:,000
reflects a reality in which women have often had to find ways

95
0:06:01.84,000 --> 0:06:04,000
other than direct confrontation to achieve their goals.

96
0:06:06.44,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And finding alternatives to direct confrontation

97
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:13,000
is at the core of nonviolent resistance.

98
0:06:14.36,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now to the second potential misunderstanding.

99
0:06:16.88,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I've been talking a lot about my experiences in the Middle East,

100
0:06:19.92,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and some of you might be thinking now

101
0:06:21.76,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that the solution then is for us to educate Muslim and Arab societies

102
0:06:25.56,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to be more inclusive of their women.

103
0:06:27.96,000 --> 0:06:29,000
If we were to do that, they would be more successful.

104
0:06:33.2,000 --> 0:06:35,000
They do not need this kind of help.

105
0:06:36.88,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Women have been part of the most influential movements

106
0:06:40.32,000 --> 0:06:41,000
coming out of the Middle East,

107
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but they tend to be invisible to the international community.

108
0:06:48.08,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Our cameras are largely focused on the men

109
0:06:50.84,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who often end up involved in the more confrontational scenes

110
0:06:53.92,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that we find so irresistible in our news cycle.

111
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And we end up with a narrative that not only erases women

112
0:07:01.96,000 --> 0:07:02,000
from the struggles in the region

113
0:07:03.92,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but often misrepresents the struggles themselves.

114
0:07:10.12,000 --> 0:07:15,000
In the late 1980s, an uprising started in Gaza,

115
0:07:15.28,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and quickly spread to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

116
0:07:19.56,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It came to be known as the First Intifada,

117
0:07:23.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and people who have any visual memory of it

118
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
generally conjure up something like this:

119
0:07:29.68,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Palestinian men throwing rocks at Israeli tanks.

120
0:07:34.8,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The news coverage at the time

121
0:07:36.32,000 --> 0:07:4,000
made it seem like stones, Molotov cocktails and burning tires

122
0:07:41.08,000 --> 0:07:44,000
were the only activities taking place in the Intifada.

123
0:07:45.96,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This period, though, was also marked by widespread nonviolent organizing

124
0:07:52.36,000 --> 0:07:56,000
in the forms of strikes, sit-ins and the creation of parallel institutions.

125
0:07:57.88,000 --> 0:07:58,000
During the First Intifada,

126
0:07:59.28,000 --> 0:08:02,000
whole sectors of the Palestinian civilian population mobilized,

127
0:08:02.64,000 --> 0:08:05,000
cutting across generations, factions and class lines.

128
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They did this through networks of popular committees,

129
0:08:09.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and their use of direct action and communal self-help projects

130
0:08:13.44,000 --> 0:08:15,000
challenged Israel's very ability

131
0:08:15.88,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to continue ruling the West Bank and Gaza.

132
0:08:19.6,000 --> 0:08:21,000
According to the Israeli Army itself,

133
0:08:21.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
97 percent of activities during the First Intifada were unarmed.

134
0:08:28.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And here's another thing that is not part of our narrative about that time.

135
0:08:33.32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
For 18 months in the Intifada,

136
0:08:35.8,000 --> 0:08:38,000
women were the ones calling the shots behind the scenes:

137
0:08:39.64,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Palestinian women from all walks of life

138
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in charge of mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people

139
0:08:45.6,000 --> 0:08:48,000
in a concerted effort to withdraw consent from the occupation.

140
0:08:50.76,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Naela Ayesh, who strived to build a self-sufficient Palestinian economy

141
0:08:56.08,000 --> 0:09:01,000
by encouraging women in Gaza to grow vegetables in their backyards,

142
0:09:01.32,000 --> 0:09:04,000
an activity deemed illegal by the Israeli authorities at that time;

143
0:09:06.32,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Rabeha Diab, who took over decision-making authority

144
0:09:09.8,000 --> 0:09:1,000
for the entire uprising

145
0:09:11.24,000 --> 0:09:12,000
when the men who had been running it

146
0:09:13.04,000 --> 0:09:14,000
were deported;

147
0:09:15.44,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Fatima Al Jaafari, who swallowed leaflets containing the uprising's directives

148
0:09:20.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in order to spread them across the territories

149
0:09:23.76,000 --> 0:09:24,000
without getting caught;

150
0:09:26.72,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and Zahira Kamal,

151
0:09:28.4,000 --> 0:09:31,000
who ensured the longevity of the uprising

152
0:09:31.72,000 --> 0:09:32,000
by leading an organization

153
0:09:33.28,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that went from 25 women to 3,000 in a single year.

154
0:09:40.84,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Despite their extraordinary achievements,

155
0:09:43.2,000 --> 0:09:48,000
none of these women have made it into our narrative of the First Intifada.

156
0:09:49.88,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We do this in other parts of the globe, too.

157
0:09:52.8,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In our history books, for instance, and in our collective consciousness,

158
0:09:57.04,000 --> 0:10:,000
men are the public faces and spokespersons

159
0:10:00.12,000 --> 0:10:04,000
for the 1960s struggle for racial justice in the United States.

160
0:10:05.44,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But women were also a critical driving force,

161
0:10:08.88,000 --> 0:10:11,000
mobilizing, organizing, taking to the streets.

162
0:10:12.8,000 --> 0:10:14,000
How many of us think of Septima Clark

163
0:10:15.36,000 --> 0:10:17,000
when we think of the United States Civil Rights era?

164
0:10:20.08,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Remarkably few.

165
0:10:22.8,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But she played a crucial role in every phase of the struggle,

166
0:10:27.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
particularly by emphasizing literacy and education.

167
0:10:30.92,000 --> 0:10:32,000
She's been omitted, ignored,

168
0:10:33.44,000 --> 0:10:36,000
like so many other women who played critical roles

169
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in the United States Civil Rights Movement.

170
0:10:41.92,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This is not about getting credit.

171
0:10:45.36,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's more profound than that.

172
0:10:48.4,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The stories we tell matter deeply to how we see ourselves,

173
0:10:52.56,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and to how we believe movements are run

174
0:10:55.28,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and how movements are won.

175
0:10:57.96,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The stories we tell about a movement like the First Intifada

176
0:11:00.84,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or the United States Civil Rights era

177
0:11:02.8,000 --> 0:11:06,000
matter deeply and have a critical influence

178
0:11:06.92,000 --> 0:11:08,000
in the choices Palestinians,

179
0:11:09.6,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Americans

180
0:11:10.92,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and people around the world will make

181
0:11:13.04,000 --> 0:11:15,000
next time they encounter an injustice

182
0:11:15.36,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and develop the courage to confront it.

183
0:11:18.56,000 --> 0:11:22,000
If we do not lift up the women who played critical roles in these struggles,

184
0:11:22.84,000 --> 0:11:25,000
we fail to offer up role models to future generations.

185
0:11:28.2,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Without role models, it becomes harder

186
0:11:31.28,000 --> 0:11:34,000
for women to take up their rightful space

187
0:11:34.32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in public life.

188
0:11:37.32,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And as we saw earlier,

189
0:11:39.48,000 --> 0:11:4,000
one of the most critical variables

190
0:11:41.32,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in determining whether a movement will be successful or not

191
0:11:45.52,000 --> 0:11:49,000
is a movement's ideology regarding the role of women

192
0:11:49.56,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in public life.

193
0:11:52.32,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This is a question of whether we're moving

194
0:11:54.4,000 --> 0:11:56,000
towards more democratic and peaceful societies.

195
0:11:59.24,000 --> 0:12:01,000
In a world where so much change is happening,

196
0:12:01.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and where change is bound to continue at an increasingly faster pace,

197
0:12:06.88,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it is not a question of whether we will face conflict,

198
0:12:11.68,000 --> 0:12:12,000
but rather a question

199
0:12:13.24,000 --> 0:12:16,000
of which stories will shape

200
0:12:16.64,000 --> 0:12:18,000
how we choose to wage conflict.

201
0:12:20.56,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Thank you.

202
0:12:22.04,000 --> 0:12:26,000

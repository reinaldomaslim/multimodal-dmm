1
0:00:12.73,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I have a pretty fun job,

2
0:00:15.753,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which is to figure out what makes people happy.

3
0:00:19.561,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's so fun, it might almost seen a little frivolous,

4
0:00:24.335,000 --> 0:00:26,000
especially at a time where we're being confronted

5
0:00:26.794,000 --> 0:00:28,000
with some pretty depressing headlines.

6
0:00:30.087,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But it turns out that studying happiness might provide a key

7
0:00:34.473,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to solving some of the toughest problems we're facing.

8
0:00:39.242,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's taken me almost a decade to figure this out.

9
0:00:43.567,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Pretty early on in my career,

10
0:00:45.24,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I published a paper in "Science" with my collaborators,

11
0:00:48.56,000 --> 0:00:51,000
entitled, "Spending Money on Others Promotes Happiness."

12
0:00:52.377,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was very confident in this conclusion,

13
0:00:55.339,000 --> 0:00:57,000
except for one thing:

14
0:00:57.399,000 --> 0:01:,000
it didn't seem to apply to me.

15
0:01:00.538,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:01.79,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I hardly ever gave money to charity,

17
0:01:04.116,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and when I did,

18
0:01:05.332,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I didn't feel that warm glow I was expecting.

19
0:01:08.723,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So I started to wonder if maybe there was something wrong with my research

20
0:01:14.9,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or something wrong with me.

21
0:01:19.45,000 --> 0:01:24,000
My own lackluster emotional response to giving was especially puzzling

22
0:01:25.318,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because my follow-up studies revealed that even toddlers exhibited joy

23
0:01:30.596,000 --> 0:01:31,000
from giving to others.

24
0:01:32.803,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In one experiment, my colleagues Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I

25
0:01:36.619,000 --> 0:01:39,000
brought kids just under the age of two into the lab.

26
0:01:40.246,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, as you might imagine,

27
0:01:41.533,000 --> 0:01:45,000
we had to work with a resource that toddlers really care about,

28
0:01:45.833,000 --> 0:01:48,000
so we used the toddler equivalent of gold,

29
0:01:49.542,000 --> 0:01:51,000
namely, Goldfish crackers.

30
0:01:51.931,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:53.264,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We gave kids this windfall of Goldfish for themselves

32
0:01:56.925,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and a chance to give some of their Goldfish away

33
0:01:59.966,000 --> 0:02:,000
to a puppet named Monkey.

34
0:02:02.495,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Video) Researcher: I found even more treats,

35
0:02:04.649,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and I'm going to give them all to you.

36
0:02:06.958,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Toddler: Ooh. Thank you.

37
0:02:10.712,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Researcher: But, you know, I don't see any more treats.

38
0:02:13.462,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Will you give one to Monkey?

39
0:02:16.278,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Toddler: Yeah. Researcher: Yeah?

40
0:02:18.72,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Toddler: Yeah.

41
0:02:24.852,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Here.

42
0:02:26.032,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm.

43
0:02:30.862,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Toddler: All gone, he ate it.

44
0:02:34.186,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained research assistants to watch these videos

45
0:02:37.88,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and code toddlers' emotional reactions.

46
0:02:40.459,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Of course, we didn't tell them our hypotheses.

47
0:02:43.357,000 --> 0:02:45,000
The data revealed that toddlers were pretty happy

48
0:02:46.193,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when they got this pile of Goldfish for themselves,

49
0:02:49.075,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but they were actually even happier

50
0:02:50.933,000 --> 0:02:52,000
when they got to give some of their Goldfish away.

51
0:02:54.423,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And this warm glow of giving persists into adulthood.

52
0:02:58.865,000 --> 0:03:02,000
When we analyzed surveys from more than 200,000 adults

53
0:03:03.134,000 --> 0:03:04,000
across the globe,

54
0:03:04.711,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we saw that nearly a third of the world's population

55
0:03:07.947,000 --> 0:03:1,000
reported giving at least some money to charity in the past month.

56
0:03:12.535,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Remarkably, in every major region of the world,

57
0:03:16.612,000 --> 0:03:2,000
people who gave money to charity were happier than those who did not,

58
0:03:21.185,000 --> 0:03:24,000
even after taking into account their own personal financial situation.

59
0:03:25.769,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And this correlation wasn't trivial.

60
0:03:28.908,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It looked like giving to charity

61
0:03:31.034,000 --> 0:03:33,000
made about the same difference for happiness

62
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:35,000
as having twice as much income.

63
0:03:37.857,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, as a researcher,

64
0:03:39.968,000 --> 0:03:41,000
if you're lucky enough to stumble on an effect

65
0:03:42.525,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that replicates around the world in children and adults alike,

66
0:03:46.661,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you start to wonder:

67
0:03:48.534,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Could this be part of human nature?

68
0:03:51.848,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We know that pleasure reinforces adaptive behaviors

69
0:03:56.425,000 --> 0:03:57,000
like eating and sex

70
0:03:58.341,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that help perpetuate our species,

71
0:04:01.416,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it looked to me like giving might be one of those behaviors.

72
0:04:06.639,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I was really excited about these ideas,

73
0:04:09.465,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and I wrote about them in the "New York Times."

74
0:04:12.457,000 --> 0:04:14,000
One of the people who read this article

75
0:04:14.596,000 --> 0:04:15,000
was my accountant.

76
0:04:16.222,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:19.291,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Yeah.

78
0:04:20.477,000 --> 0:04:24,000
At tax time, I found myself seated across from him,

79
0:04:24.551,000 --> 0:04:26,000
watching as he slowly tapped his pen

80
0:04:27.535,000 --> 0:04:29,000
on the charitable giving line of my tax return

81
0:04:30.439,000 --> 0:04:32,000
with this look of, like,

82
0:04:32.48,000 --> 0:04:34,000
poorly concealed disapproval.

83
0:04:34.901,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:36.976,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Despite building my career by showing how great giving can feel,

85
0:04:41.876,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I actually wasn't doing very much of it.

86
0:04:45.434,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So I resolved to give more.

87
0:04:48.944,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Around that time,

88
0:04:50.802,000 --> 0:04:53,000
devastating stories about the Syrian refugee crisis

89
0:04:54.56,000 --> 0:04:55,000
were everywhere.

90
0:04:56.826,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I really wanted to help,

91
0:04:58.38,000 --> 0:05:,000
so I pulled out my credit card.

92
0:05:01.202,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I knew my donations would probably make a difference for someone somewhere,

93
0:05:06.494,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but going to the website of an effective charity

94
0:05:09.448,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and entering my Visa number

95
0:05:11.566,000 --> 0:05:13,000
still just didn't feel like enough.

96
0:05:15.091,000 --> 0:05:18,000
That's when I learned about the Group of Five.

97
0:05:19.717,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The Canadian government allows any five Canadians

98
0:05:23.328,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to privately sponsor a family of refugees.

99
0:05:27.166,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You have to raise enough money to support the family

100
0:05:29.957,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for their first year in Canada,

101
0:05:31.914,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and then they literally get on a plane to your city.

102
0:05:36.608,000 --> 0:05:39,000
One of the things that I think is so cool about this program

103
0:05:40.382,000 --> 0:05:42,000
is that no one is allowed to do it alone.

104
0:05:42.867,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And instead of a Group of Five,

105
0:05:45.102,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we ended up partnering with a community organization

106
0:05:47.639,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and forming a group of 25.

107
0:05:51.716,000 --> 0:05:54,000
After almost two years of paperwork and waiting,

108
0:05:55.511,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we learned that our family would be arriving in Vancouver

109
0:05:58.229,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in less than six weeks.

110
0:06:00.795,000 --> 0:06:02,000
They had four sons and a daughter,

111
0:06:03.341,000 --> 0:06:05,000
so we raced to find them a place to live.

112
0:06:06.786,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We were very lucky to find them a house,

113
0:06:09.295,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but it needed quite a bit of work.

114
0:06:11.008,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So my friends came out on evenings and weekends

115
0:06:13.98,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and painted and cleaned and assembled furniture.

116
0:06:17.807,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When the big day came,

117
0:06:19.489,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we filled their fridge with milk and fresh fruit

118
0:06:22.919,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and headed to the airport to meet our family.

119
0:06:26.423,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It was a little overwhelming for everyone,

120
0:06:30.212,000 --> 0:06:31,000
especially the four-year-old.

121
0:06:32.646,000 --> 0:06:34,000
His mother was reunited with her sister

122
0:06:35.597,000 --> 0:06:38,000
who had come to Canada earlier through the same program.

123
0:06:39.074,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They hadn't seen each other in 15 years.

124
0:06:43.952,000 --> 0:06:49,000
When you hear that more than 5.6 million refugees have fled Syria,

125
0:06:50.394,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you're faced with this tragedy

126
0:06:52.431,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that the human brain hasn't really evolved to comprehend.

127
0:06:57.165,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's so abstract.

128
0:07:00.746,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Before, if any of us had been asked to donate 15 hours a month

129
0:07:03.959,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to help out with the refugee crisis,

130
0:07:06.558,000 --> 0:07:08,000
we probably would have said no.

131
0:07:09.545,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But as soon as we took our family to their new home in Vancouver,

132
0:07:13.07,000 --> 0:07:15,000
we all had the same realization:

133
0:07:15.465,000 --> 0:07:18,000
we were just going to do whatever it took to help them be happy.

134
0:07:19.743,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This experience made me think a little more deeply about my research.

135
0:07:25.972,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Back in my lab,

136
0:07:27.296,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we'd seen the benefits of giving spike

137
0:07:30.112,000 --> 0:07:33,000
when people felt a real sense of connection with those they were helping

138
0:07:34.112,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and could easily envision the difference they were making

139
0:07:36.851,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in those individuals' lives.

140
0:07:39.333,000 --> 0:07:4,000
For example, in one experiment,

141
0:07:41.228,000 --> 0:07:43,000
we gave participants an opportunity to donate a bit of money

142
0:07:44.163,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to either UNICEF or Spread the Net.

143
0:07:46.775,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We chose these charities intentionally,

144
0:07:49.071,000 --> 0:07:52,000
because they were partners and shared the same critically important goal

145
0:07:52.946,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of promoting children's health.

146
0:07:55.798,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But I think UNICEF is just such a big, broad charity

147
0:08:00.464,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that it can be a little hard to envision

148
0:08:02.471,000 --> 0:08:05,000
how your own small donation will make a difference.

149
0:08:06.245,000 --> 0:08:11,000
In contrast, Spread the Net offers donors a concrete promise:

150
0:08:11.291,000 --> 0:08:12,000
for every 10 dollars donated,

151
0:08:12.92,000 --> 0:08:15,000
they provide one bed net to protect a child from malaria.

152
0:08:17.368,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We saw that the more money people gave to Spread the Net,

153
0:08:20.873,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the happier they reported feeling afterward.

154
0:08:24.74,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In contrast, this emotional return on investment

155
0:08:28.894,000 --> 0:08:32,000
was completely eliminated when people gave money to UNICEF.

156
0:08:33.994,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So this suggests that just giving money to a worthwhile charity

157
0:08:38.105,000 --> 0:08:39,000
isn't always enough.

158
0:08:39.997,000 --> 0:08:41,000
You need to be able to envision

159
0:08:42.15,000 --> 0:08:45,000
how, exactly, your dollars are going to make a difference.

160
0:08:46.524,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Of course, the Group of Five program takes this idea to a whole new level.

161
0:08:51.678,000 --> 0:08:52,000
When we first took on this project,

162
0:08:53.425,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we would talk about when the refugees would arrive.

163
0:08:57.158,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now, we just refer to them as our family.

164
0:09:00.63,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Recently, we took the kids ice skating,

165
0:09:03.246,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and later that day, my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me,

166
0:09:07.491,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"Mommy, who is the oldest kid in our family?"

167
0:09:10.908,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I assumed he was talking about his plethora of cousins,

168
0:09:14.556,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and he was talking about them,

169
0:09:16.58,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but also about our Syrian family.

170
0:09:19.832,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Since our family arrived,

171
0:09:21.697,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so many people and organizations have offered to help,

172
0:09:25.881,000 --> 0:09:28,000
providing everything from free dental fillings

173
0:09:29.45,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to summer camps.

174
0:09:32.125,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's made me see the goodness that exists in our community.

175
0:09:36.99,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Thanks to one donation,

176
0:09:38.601,000 --> 0:09:4,000
the kids got to go to bike camp,

177
0:09:41.413,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and every day of the week,

178
0:09:42.935,000 --> 0:09:45,000
some member of our group tried to be there to cheer for them.

179
0:09:46.591,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I happened to be there

180
0:09:47.792,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the day the training wheels were supposed to come off,

181
0:09:50.37,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and let me tell you, the four-year-old did not think this was a good idea.

182
0:09:55.483,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So I went over and talked to him

183
0:09:57.601,000 --> 0:10:,000
about the long-term benefits of riding without training wheels.

184
0:10:01.252,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Laughter)

185
0:10:03.714,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Then I remembered that he was four and barely spoke English.

186
0:10:07.641,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So I reverted to two words he definitely knew:

187
0:10:11.682,000 --> 0:10:12,000
ice cream.

188
0:10:13.535,000 --> 0:10:16,000
You try without training wheels, I'll buy you ice cream.

189
0:10:17.046,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Here's what happened next.

190
0:10:19.565,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Video) ED: Yes. Yeah!

191
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Kid: I'm gonna try.

192
0:10:23.505,000 --> 0:10:24,000
ED: Oh my God! Look at you go!

193
0:10:25.406,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Squealing) Look at you go! You're doing it all by yourself!

194
0:10:28.321,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Audience) (Laughter)

195
0:10:29.55,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Video) ED: Good job!

196
0:10:32.142,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Audience) (Laughter)

197
0:10:33.703,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Applause)

198
0:10:38.186,000 --> 0:10:43,000
ED: So this is the kind of helping that human beings evolved to enjoy,

199
0:10:44.111,000 --> 0:10:45,000
but for 40 years,

200
0:10:46.046,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Canada was the only country in the world

201
0:10:48.517,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that allowed private citizens to sponsor refugees.

202
0:10:52.565,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Now -- Canada!

203
0:10:54.773,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Applause)

204
0:10:56.957,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It's pretty great.

205
0:10:59.354,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Now Australia and the UK are starting up similar programs.

206
0:11:03.613,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Just imagine how different the refugee crisis could look

207
0:11:07.14,000 --> 0:11:09,000
if more countries made this possible.

208
0:11:10.647,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Creating these kinds of meaningful connections between individuals

209
0:11:14.652,000 --> 0:11:16,000
provides an opportunity to deal with challenges

210
0:11:17.543,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that feel overwhelming.

211
0:11:20.429,000 --> 0:11:24,000
One of those challenges lies just blocks from where I'm standing right now,

212
0:11:25.382,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver.

213
0:11:28.01,000 --> 0:11:32,000
By some measures, it's the poorest urban postal code in Canada.

214
0:11:32.854,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We actually debated whether to bring over a family of refugees,

215
0:11:35.963,000 --> 0:11:38,000
because there are so many people right here already struggling.

216
0:11:39.639,000 --> 0:11:41,000
My friend Evan told me that when he was a kid

217
0:11:42.347,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and his parents drove through this neighborhood,

218
0:11:44.64,000 --> 0:11:46,000
he would duck down in the back seat.

219
0:11:48.077,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But Evan's parents never would have guessed

220
0:11:50.638,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that when he grew up,

221
0:11:52.279,000 --> 0:11:54,000
he would open up the doors of a local restaurant

222
0:11:55.004,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and invite this community inside to enjoy three-course dinners.

223
0:11:59.997,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The program that Evan helped build is called "Plenty of Plates,"

224
0:12:03.892,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and the goal is not just to provide free meals

225
0:12:06.333,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but to create moments of connection

226
0:12:08.383,000 --> 0:12:11,000
between people who otherwise might never make eye contact.

227
0:12:12.216,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Each night, a local business sponsors the dinner

228
0:12:15.32,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and sends a team of volunteers

229
0:12:17.272,000 --> 0:12:18,000
who help make and serve the meal.

230
0:12:19.732,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Afterward, the leftovers get distributed to people who are out on the street,

231
0:12:24.642,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and importantly, there's enough money left

232
0:12:26.685,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to provide a thousand free lunches for this community

233
0:12:29.229,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in the days that follow.

234
0:12:31.494,000 --> 0:12:34,000
But the benefits of this program extend beyond food.

235
0:12:35.666,000 --> 0:12:39,000
For the volunteers, it provides an opportunity to engage with people,

236
0:12:40.347,000 --> 0:12:42,000
to sit down and hear their stories.

237
0:12:43.733,000 --> 0:12:47,000
After this experience, one volunteer changed his commute

238
0:12:47.91,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so that instead of avoiding this neighborhood,

239
0:12:50.813,000 --> 0:12:51,000
he walks through it,

240
0:12:52.339,000 --> 0:12:56,000
smiling or making eye contact as he passes familiar faces.

241
0:12:57.27,000 --> 0:13:,000
All of us are capable of finding joy in giving.

242
0:13:01.551,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But we shouldn't expect this to happen automatically.

243
0:13:05.359,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Spending money helping others doesn't necessarily promote happiness.

244
0:13:09.675,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Instead, it matters how we do it.

245
0:13:13.223,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And if we want people to give more,

246
0:13:15.936,000 --> 0:13:19,000
we need to subvert the way we think about charitable giving.

247
0:13:20.086,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We need to create opportunities to give

248
0:13:22.645,000 --> 0:13:25,000
that enable us to appreciate our shared humanity.

249
0:13:26.737,000 --> 0:13:28,000
If any of you work for a charity,

250
0:13:29.197,000 --> 0:13:32,000
don't reward your donors with pens or calendars.

251
0:13:33.959,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Applause)

252
0:13:37.802,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Reward them with the opportunity

253
0:13:39.703,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to see the specific impact that their generosity is having

254
0:13:43.987,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and to connect with the individuals and communities they're helping.

255
0:13:49.519,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We're used to thinking about giving as something we should do.

256
0:13:54.48,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And it is.

257
0:13:56.551,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But in thinking about it this way,

258
0:13:59.133,000 --> 0:14:03,000
we're missing out on one of the best parts of being human:

259
0:14:03.916,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that we have evolved to find joy in helping others.

260
0:14:09.041,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Let's stop thinking about giving as just this moral obligation

261
0:14:14.311,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and start thinking of it as a source of pleasure.

262
0:14:18.782,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Thank you.

263
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

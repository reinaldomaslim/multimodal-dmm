1
0:00:12.904,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hello, everybody.

2
0:00:14.333,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I brought with me today a baby diaper.

3
0:00:18.793,000 --> 0:00:19,000
You'll see why in a second.

4
0:00:20.539,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Baby diapers have interesting properties.

5
0:00:22.573,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They can swell enormously when you add water to them,

6
0:00:25.288,000 --> 0:00:27,000
an experiment done by millions of kids every day.

7
0:00:28.296,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:29.47,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But the reason why

9
0:00:30.988,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is that they're designed in a very clever way.

10
0:00:33.202,000 --> 0:00:35,000
They're made out of a thing called a swellable material.

11
0:00:35.861,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's a special kind of material that, when you add water,

12
0:00:38.622,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it will swell up enormously,

13
0:00:40.076,000 --> 0:00:42,000
maybe a thousand times in volume.

14
0:00:42.266,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And this is a very useful, industrial kind of polymer.

15
0:00:45.819,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But what we're trying to do in my group at MIT

16
0:00:48.369,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is to figure out if we can do something similar to the brain.

17
0:00:51.606,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Can we make it bigger,

18
0:00:52.789,000 --> 0:00:53,000
big enough that you can peer inside

19
0:00:54.481,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and see all the tiny building blocks, the biomolecules,

20
0:00:57.133,000 --> 0:00:59,000
how they're organized in three dimensions,

21
0:00:59.308,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the structure, the ground truth structure of the brain, if you will?

22
0:01:02.817,000 --> 0:01:03,000
If we could get that,

23
0:01:03.999,000 --> 0:01:06,000
maybe we could have a better understanding of how the brain is organized

24
0:01:07.532,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to yield thoughts and emotions

25
0:01:09.215,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and actions and sensations.

26
0:01:10.958,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Maybe we could try to pinpoint the exact changes in the brain

27
0:01:14.397,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that result in diseases,

28
0:01:16.197,000 --> 0:01:19,000
diseases like Alzheimer's and epilepsy and Parkinson's,

29
0:01:19.433,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for which there are few treatments, much less cures,

30
0:01:22.035,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and for which, very often, we don't know the cause or the origins

31
0:01:25.676,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and what's really causing them to occur.

32
0:01:28.613,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, our group at MIT

33
0:01:30.377,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is trying to take a different point of view

34
0:01:33.087,000 --> 0:01:36,000
from the way neuroscience has been done over the last hundred years.

35
0:01:36.341,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We're designers. We're inventors.

36
0:01:37.944,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We're trying to figure out how to build technologies

37
0:01:40.512,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that let us look at and repair the brain.

38
0:01:42.992,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And the reason is,

39
0:01:44.167,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the brain is incredibly, incredibly complicated.

40
0:01:47.484,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So what we've learned over the first century of neuroscience

41
0:01:50.395,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is that the brain is a very complicated network,

42
0:01:52.722,000 --> 0:01:54,000
made out of very specialized cells called neurons

43
0:01:55.226,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with very complex geometries,

44
0:01:56.917,000 --> 0:02:,000
and electrical currents will flow through these complexly shaped neurons.

45
0:02:01.653,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Furthermore, neurons are connected in networks.

46
0:02:04.461,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They're connected by little junctions called synapses that exchange chemicals

47
0:02:08.32,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and allow the neurons to talk to each other.

48
0:02:10.562,000 --> 0:02:11,000
The density of the brain is incredible.

49
0:02:12.526,000 --> 0:02:14,000
In a cubic millimeter of your brain,

50
0:02:14.857,000 --> 0:02:16,000
there are about 100,000 of these neurons

51
0:02:17.338,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and maybe a billion of those connections.

52
0:02:20.887,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But it's worse.

53
0:02:22.293,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So, if you could zoom in to a neuron,

54
0:02:24.622,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and, of course, this is just our artist's rendition of it.

55
0:02:27.396,000 --> 0:02:31,000
What you would see are thousands and thousands of kinds of biomolecules,

56
0:02:31.627,000 --> 0:02:35,000
little nanoscale machines organized in complex, 3D patterns,

57
0:02:36.051,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and together they mediate those electrical pulses,

58
0:02:38.703,000 --> 0:02:41,000
those chemical exchanges that allow neurons to work together

59
0:02:42.664,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to generate things like thoughts and feelings and so forth.

60
0:02:46.357,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now, we don't know how the neurons in the brain are organized

61
0:02:50.145,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to form networks,

62
0:02:51.343,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and we don't know how the biomolecules are organized

63
0:02:53.867,000 --> 0:02:54,000
within neurons

64
0:02:55.065,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to form these complex, organized machines.

65
0:02:57.918,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If we really want to understand this,

66
0:02:59.762,000 --> 0:03:,000
we're going to need new technologies.

67
0:03:01.603,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But if we could get such maps,

68
0:03:03.411,000 --> 0:03:05,000
if we could look at the organization of molecules and neurons

69
0:03:06.378,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and neurons and networks,

70
0:03:07.968,000 --> 0:03:1,000
maybe we could really understand how the brain conducts information

71
0:03:11.429,000 --> 0:03:12,000
from sensory regions,

72
0:03:12.62,000 --> 0:03:13,000
mixes it with emotion and feeling,

73
0:03:14.38,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and generates our decisions and actions.

74
0:03:17.131,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Maybe we could pinpoint the exact set of molecular changes that occur

75
0:03:20.944,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in a brain disorder.

76
0:03:22.17,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And once we know how those molecules have changed,

77
0:03:25.016,000 --> 0:03:27,000
whether they've increased in number or changed in pattern,

78
0:03:27.82,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we could use those as targets for new drugs,

79
0:03:30.783,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for new ways of delivering energy into the brain

80
0:03:33.078,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in order to repair the brain computations that are afflicted

81
0:03:36.982,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in patients who suffer from brain disorders.

82
0:03:39.793,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We've all seen lots of different technologies over the last century

83
0:03:43.06,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to try to confront this.

84
0:03:44.25,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I think we've all seen brain scans

85
0:03:46.154,000 --> 0:03:48,000
taken using MRI machines.

86
0:03:48.212,000 --> 0:03:51,000
These, of course, have the great power that they are noninvasive,

87
0:03:51.583,000 --> 0:03:53,000
they can be used on living human subjects.

88
0:03:54.407,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But also, they're spatially crude.

89
0:03:56.662,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Each of these blobs that you see, or voxels, as they're called,

90
0:03:59.676,000 --> 0:04:01,000
can contain millions and millions of neurons.

91
0:04:02.389,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So it's not at the level of resolution

92
0:04:04.263,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where it can pinpoint the molecular changes that occur

93
0:04:06.825,000 --> 0:04:08,000
or the changes in the wiring of these networks

94
0:04:09.135,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that contributes to our ability to be conscious and powerful beings.

95
0:04:13.797,000 --> 0:04:16,000
At the other extreme, you have microscopes.

96
0:04:17.002,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Microscopes, of course, will use light to look at little tiny things.

97
0:04:20.321,000 --> 0:04:23,000
For centuries, they've been used to look at things like bacteria.

98
0:04:23.42,000 --> 0:04:24,000
For neuroscience,

99
0:04:24.595,000 --> 0:04:27,000
microscopes are actually how neurons were discovered in the first place,

100
0:04:28.031,000 --> 0:04:29,000
about 130 years ago.

101
0:04:29.347,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But light is fundamentally limited.

102
0:04:31.689,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You can't see individual molecules with a regular old microscope.

103
0:04:35.011,000 --> 0:04:37,000
You can't look at these tiny connections.

104
0:04:37.187,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful,

105
0:04:41.153,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to get down to the ground truth structure,

106
0:04:43.345,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we're going to need to have even better technologies.

107
0:04:47.611,000 --> 0:04:49,000
My group, a couple years ago, started thinking:

108
0:04:49.859,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Why don't we do the opposite?

109
0:04:51.295,000 --> 0:04:53,000
If it's so darn complicated to zoom in to the brain,

110
0:04:53.78,000 --> 0:04:54,000
why can't we make the brain bigger?

111
0:04:56.166,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It initially started

112
0:04:57.345,000 --> 0:04:59,000
with two grad students in my group, Fei Chen and Paul Tillberg.

113
0:05:00.365,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now many others in my group are helping with this process.

114
0:05:03.109,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We decided to try to figure out if we could take polymers,

115
0:05:05.895,000 --> 0:05:06,000
like the stuff in the baby diaper,

116
0:05:07.548,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and install it physically within the brain.

117
0:05:09.578,000 --> 0:05:11,000
If we could do it just right, and you add water,

118
0:05:11.843,000 --> 0:05:12,000
you can potentially blow the brain up

119
0:05:13.702,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to where you could distinguish those tiny biomolecules from each other.

120
0:05:17.103,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You would see those connections and get maps of the brain.

121
0:05:19.997,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This could potentially be quite dramatic.

122
0:05:22.009,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We brought a little demo here.

123
0:05:25.538,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We got some purified baby diaper material.

124
0:05:28.137,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's much easier just to buy it off the Internet

125
0:05:30.435,000 --> 0:05:33,000
than to extract the few grains that actually occur in these diapers.

126
0:05:33.934,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I'm going to put just one teaspoon here

127
0:05:36.706,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of this purified polymer.

128
0:05:39.27,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And here we have some water.

129
0:05:41.446,000 --> 0:05:42,000
What we're going to do

130
0:05:42.632,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is see if this teaspoon of the baby diaper material

131
0:05:45.667,000 --> 0:05:46,000
can increase in size.

132
0:05:48.687,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You're going to see it increase in volume by about a thousandfold

133
0:05:52.407,000 --> 0:05:53,000
before your very eyes.

134
0:06:01.597,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I could pour much more of this in there,

135
0:06:03.593,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but I think you've got the idea

136
0:06:05.175,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that this is a very, very interesting molecule,

137
0:06:07.701,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and if can use it in the right way,

138
0:06:09.637,000 --> 0:06:11,000
we might be able to really zoom in on the brain

139
0:06:11.982,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in a way that you can't do with past technologies.

140
0:06:15.227,000 --> 0:06:17,000
OK. So a little bit of chemistry now.

141
0:06:17.305,000 --> 0:06:19,000
What's going on in the baby diaper polymer?

142
0:06:19.771,000 --> 0:06:2,000
If you could zoom in,

143
0:06:21.471,000 --> 0:06:23,000
it might look something like what you see on the screen.

144
0:06:24.168,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Polymers are chains of atoms arranged in long, thin lines.

145
0:06:28.684,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The chains are very tiny,

146
0:06:30.075,000 --> 0:06:31,000
about the width of a biomolecule,

147
0:06:31.963,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and these polymers are really dense.

148
0:06:33.734,000 --> 0:06:34,000
They're separated by distances

149
0:06:35.258,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that are around the size of a biomolecule.

150
0:06:37.534,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This is very good

151
0:06:38.723,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain.

152
0:06:41.788,000 --> 0:06:42,000
If we add water, what will happen is,

153
0:06:43.66,000 --> 0:06:45,000
this swellable material is going to absorb the water,

154
0:06:46.199,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the polymer chains will move apart from each other,

155
0:06:48.623,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the entire material is going to become bigger.

156
0:06:51.615,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And because these chains are so tiny

157
0:06:53.453,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and spaced by biomolecular distances,

158
0:06:55.682,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we could potentially blow up the brain

159
0:06:57.745,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and make it big enough to see.

160
0:07:00.02,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Here's the mystery, then:

161
0:07:01.284,000 --> 0:07:04,000
How do we actually make these polymer chains inside the brain

162
0:07:04.918,000 --> 0:07:06,000
so we can move all the biomolecules apart?

163
0:07:07.181,000 --> 0:07:08,000
If we could do that,

164
0:07:08.356,000 --> 0:07:1,000
maybe we could get ground truth maps of the brain.

165
0:07:10.777,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We could look at the wiring.

166
0:07:12.19,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We can peer inside and see the molecules within.

167
0:07:15.925,000 --> 0:07:17,000
To explain this, we made some animations

168
0:07:18.43,000 --> 0:07:2,000
where we actually look at, in these artist renderings,

169
0:07:21.057,000 --> 0:07:24,000
what biomolecules might look like and how we might separate them.

170
0:07:24.622,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Step one: what we'd have to do, first of all,

171
0:07:27.195,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is attach every biomolecule, shown in brown here,

172
0:07:30.608,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to a little anchor, a little handle.

173
0:07:32.791,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We need to pull the molecules of the brain apart from each other,

174
0:07:35.91,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and to do that, we need to have a little handle

175
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that allows those polymers to bind to them

176
0:07:40.569,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and to exert their force.

177
0:07:43.278,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now, if you just take baby diaper polymer and dump it on the brain,

178
0:07:46.463,000 --> 0:07:48,000
obviously, it's going to sit there on top.

179
0:07:48.524,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So we need to find a way to make the polymers inside.

180
0:07:51.076,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And this is where we're really lucky.

181
0:07:52.888,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It turns out, you can get the building blocks,

182
0:07:55.1,000 --> 0:07:56,000
monomers, as they're called,

183
0:07:56.496,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and if you let them go into the brain

184
0:07:58.304,000 --> 0:08:,000
and then trigger the chemical reactions,

185
0:08:00.364,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you can get them to form those long chains,

186
0:08:03.09,000 --> 0:08:04,000
right there inside the brain tissue.

187
0:08:05.325,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They're going to wind their way around biomolecules

188
0:08:07.746,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and between biomolecules,

189
0:08:08.991,000 --> 0:08:09,000
forming those complex webs

190
0:08:10.64,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that will allow you, eventually, to pull apart the molecules

191
0:08:13.526,000 --> 0:08:14,000
from each other.

192
0:08:14.725,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And every time one of those little handles is around,

193
0:08:17.803,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the polymer will bind to the handle, and that's exactly what we need

194
0:08:21.177,000 --> 0:08:23,000
in order to pull the molecules apart from each other.

195
0:08:23.732,000 --> 0:08:24,000
All right, the moment of truth.

196
0:08:25.449,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We have to treat this specimen

197
0:08:27.621,000 --> 0:08:3,000
with a chemical to kind of loosen up all the molecules from each other,

198
0:08:31.091,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and then, when we add water,

199
0:08:32.951,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that swellable material is going to start absorbing the water,

200
0:08:35.928,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the polymer chains will move apart,

201
0:08:37.655,000 --> 0:08:39,000
but now, the biomolecules will come along for the ride.

202
0:08:40.401,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And much like drawing a picture on a balloon,

203
0:08:42.589,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and then you blow up the balloon,

204
0:08:44.2,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the image is the same,

205
0:08:45.514,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but the ink particles have moved away from each other.

206
0:08:48.086,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And that's what we've been able to do now, but in three dimensions.

207
0:08:51.577,000 --> 0:08:52,000
There's one last trick.

208
0:08:53.6,000 --> 0:08:54,000
As you can see here,

209
0:08:54.842,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we've color-coded all the biomolecules brown.

210
0:08:56.975,000 --> 0:08:58,000
That's because they all kind of look the same.

211
0:08:59.169,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Biomolecules are made out of the same atoms,

212
0:09:01.298,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but just in different orders.

213
0:09:03.562,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So we need one last thing

214
0:09:05.086,000 --> 0:09:06,000
in order to make them visible.

215
0:09:06.805,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We have to bring in little tags,

216
0:09:08.408,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with glowing dyes that will distinguish them.

217
0:09:11.451,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color.

218
0:09:14.148,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Another kind of biomolecule might get a red color.

219
0:09:16.523,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And so forth.

220
0:09:17.823,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And that's the final step.

221
0:09:19.399,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Now we can look at something like a brain

222
0:09:21.701,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and look at the individual molecules,

223
0:09:23.521,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because we've moved them far apart enough from each other

224
0:09:26.252,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that we can tell them apart.

225
0:09:27.974,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So the hope here is that we can make the invisible visible.

226
0:09:30.832,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We can turn things that might seem small and obscure

227
0:09:33.422,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and blow them up

228
0:09:34.597,000 --> 0:09:37,000
until they're like constellations of information about life.

229
0:09:37.798,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Here's an actual video of what it might look like.

230
0:09:40.197,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We have here a little brain in a dish --

231
0:09:42.592,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a little piece of a brain, actually.

232
0:09:44.363,000 --> 0:09:45,000
We've infused the polymer in,

233
0:09:45.983,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and now we're adding water.

234
0:09:47.474,000 --> 0:09:49,000
What you'll see is that, right before your eyes --

235
0:09:49.856,000 --> 0:09:5,000
this video is sped up about sixtyfold --

236
0:09:51.803,000 --> 0:09:53,000
this little piece of brain tissue is going to grow.

237
0:09:54.552,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It can increase by a hundredfold or even more in volume.

238
0:09:57.756,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And the cool part is, because those polymers are so tiny,

239
0:10:00.729,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we're separating biomolecules evenly from each other.

240
0:10:03.312,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's a smooth expansion.

241
0:10:04.994,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We're not losing the configuration of the information.

242
0:10:07.705,000 --> 0:10:09,000
We're just making it easier to see.

243
0:10:11.333,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So now we can take actual brain circuitry --

244
0:10:13.533,000 --> 0:10:16,000
here's a piece of the brain involved with, for example, memory --

245
0:10:16.691,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and we can zoom in.

246
0:10:17.978,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We can start to actually look at how circuits are configured.

247
0:10:20.892,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Maybe someday we could read out a memory.

248
0:10:22.884,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Maybe we could actually look at how circuits are configured

249
0:10:25.687,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to process emotions,

250
0:10:26.863,000 --> 0:10:28,000
how the actual wiring of our brain is organized

251
0:10:29.809,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in order to make us who we are.

252
0:10:32.4,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And of course, we can pinpoint, hopefully,

253
0:10:34.471,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the actual problems in the brain at a molecular level.

254
0:10:37.654,000 --> 0:10:39,000
What if we could actually look into cells in the brain

255
0:10:40.247,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and figure out, wow, here are the 17 molecules that have altered

256
0:10:43.354,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in this brain tissue that has been undergoing epilepsy

257
0:10:46.833,000 --> 0:10:47,000
or changing in Parkinson's disease

258
0:10:48.507,000 --> 0:10:49,000
or otherwise being altered?

259
0:10:50.048,000 --> 0:10:53,000
If we get that systematic list of things that are going wrong,

260
0:10:53.115,000 --> 0:10:55,000
those become our therapeutic targets.

261
0:10:55.338,000 --> 0:10:56,000
We can build drugs that bind those.

262
0:10:57.039,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We can maybe aim energy at different parts of the brain

263
0:10:59.69,000 --> 0:11:01,000
in order to help people with Parkinson's or epilepsy

264
0:11:02.401,000 --> 0:11:04,000
or other conditions that affect over a billion people

265
0:11:04.976,000 --> 0:11:05,000
around the world.

266
0:11:07.246,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Now, something interesting has been happening.

267
0:11:09.476,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It turns out that throughout biomedicine,

268
0:11:12.205,000 --> 0:11:14,000
there are other problems that expansion might help with.

269
0:11:14.895,000 --> 0:11:17,000
This is an actual biopsy from a human breast cancer patient.

270
0:11:18.505,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It turns out that if you look at cancers,

271
0:11:20.717,000 --> 0:11:21,000
if you look at the immune system,

272
0:11:22.352,000 --> 0:11:24,000
if you look at aging, if you look at development --

273
0:11:24.889,000 --> 0:11:28,000
all these processes are involving large-scale biological systems.

274
0:11:29.41,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But of course, the problems begin with those little nanoscale molecules,

275
0:11:33.458,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the machines that make the cells and the organs in our body tick.

276
0:11:37.351,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So what we're trying to do now is to figure out

277
0:11:39.597,000 --> 0:11:42,000
if we can actually use this technology to map the building blocks of life

278
0:11:43.087,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in a wide variety of diseases.

279
0:11:44.856,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Can we actually pinpoint the molecular changes in a tumor

280
0:11:47.776,000 --> 0:11:49,000
so that we can actually go after it in a smart way

281
0:11:50.169,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and deliver drugs that might wipe out exactly the cells that we want to?

282
0:11:54.137,000 --> 0:11:56,000
You know, a lot of medicine is very high risk.

283
0:11:56.496,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Sometimes, it's even guesswork.

284
0:11:58.626,000 --> 0:12:01,000
My hope is we can actually turn what might be a high-risk moon shot

285
0:12:02.525,000 --> 0:12:03,000
into something that's more reliable.

286
0:12:04.318,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If you think about the original moon shot,

287
0:12:06.397,000 --> 0:12:07,000
where they actually landed on the moon,

288
0:12:08.319,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it was based on solid science.

289
0:12:09.787,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We understood gravity;

290
0:12:11.414,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we understood aerodynamics.

291
0:12:12.779,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We knew how to build rockets.

292
0:12:14.198,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The science risk was under control.

293
0:12:16.69,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It was still a great, great feat of engineering.

294
0:12:19.467,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But in medicine, we don't necessarily have all the laws.

295
0:12:22.136,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Do we have all the laws that are analogous to gravity,

296
0:12:25.269,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that are analogous to aerodynamics?

297
0:12:27.637,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I would argue that with technologies

298
0:12:29.391,000 --> 0:12:3,000
like the kinds I'm talking about today,

299
0:12:31.287,000 --> 0:12:32,000
maybe we can actually derive those.

300
0:12:33.004,000 --> 0:12:35,000
We can map the patterns that occur in living systems,

301
0:12:35.885,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and figure out how to overcome the diseases that plague us.

302
0:12:41.499,000 --> 0:12:43,000
You know, my wife and I have two young kids,

303
0:12:43.602,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and one of my hopes as a bioengineer is to make life better for them

304
0:12:46.86,000 --> 0:12:47,000
than it currently is for us.

305
0:12:48.613,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And my hope is, if we can turn biology and medicine

306
0:12:52.367,000 --> 0:12:56,000
from these high-risk endeavors that are governed by chance and luck,

307
0:12:56.748,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and make them things that we win by skill and hard work,

308
0:13:00.699,000 --> 0:13:01,000
then that would be a great advance.

309
0:13:02.621,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Thank you very much.

310
0:13:03.851,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Applause)

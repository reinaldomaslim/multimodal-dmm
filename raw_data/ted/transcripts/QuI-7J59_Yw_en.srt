1
0:00:16.323,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I am a PhD student.

2
0:00:19.054,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And that means I have a question:

3
0:00:21.181,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How can we make digital content graspable?

4
0:00:24.892,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Because you see, on the one hand, there is the digital world

5
0:00:28.469,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and no question, many things are happening there right now.

6
0:00:31.929,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And for us humans, it's not quite material, it's not really there --

7
0:00:35.379,000 --> 0:00:36,000
it's virtual.

8
0:00:37.014,000 --> 0:00:38,000
On the other hand,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we're humans, we live in a physical world.

10
0:00:40.37,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.

11
0:00:43.719,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So the question is:

12
0:00:44.904,000 --> 0:00:47,000
How do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical?

13
0:00:47.98,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That's my question.

14
0:00:49.57,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If you look at the iPhone with its touch

15
0:00:51.72,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and the Wii with its bodily activity,

16
0:00:53.721,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you can see the tendency; it's getting physical.

17
0:00:56.722,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The question is: What's next?

18
0:00:59.229,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, I have three options that I would like to show you.

19
0:01:02.276,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The first one is mass.

20
0:01:04.909,000 --> 0:01:07,000
As humans, we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy.

21
0:01:08.524,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So could we use that in mobile phones?

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile.

23
0:01:13.769,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It is a mobile phone-shaped box

24
0:01:15.502,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around,

25
0:01:18.641,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and you can feel where it's heavy.

26
0:01:20.458,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We shift the gravitational center of it.

27
0:01:23.937,000 --> 0:01:27,000
For example, we can augment digital content with physical mass.

28
0:01:28.033,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So you move around the content on the display,

29
0:01:30.233,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.

30
0:01:34.748,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Another thing it's good for is navigation.

31
0:01:37.954,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It can guide you around in a city.

32
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It can tell you by its weight,

33
0:01:41.651,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"OK, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."

34
0:01:44.652,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And the good thing about that is,

35
0:01:46.293,000 --> 0:01:48,000
you don't have to look at the device all the time;

36
0:01:48.695,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you have your eyes free to see the city.

37
0:01:50.667,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, mass is the first thing --

38
0:01:52.227,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the second thing, that's shape.

39
0:01:54.701,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in our hands.

40
0:01:58.079,000 --> 0:02:,000
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages --

41
0:02:00.639,000 --> 0:02:01,000
well, they could be thin, right?

42
0:02:02.21,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --

43
0:02:05.192,000 --> 0:02:06,000
it's thick.

44
0:02:06.378,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:07.408,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So let me show you the shape-changing mobile.

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and this one can change its shape.

48
0:02:16.892,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We can play with the shape itself.

49
0:02:18.616,000 --> 0:02:2,000
For example, it can be thin in your pocket,

50
0:02:20.689,000 --> 0:02:21,000
which we of course want it to be.

51
0:02:22.356,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But then if you hold it in your hand, it can lean towards you, be thick.

52
0:02:25.806,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's like tapered to the downside.

53
0:02:27.807,000 --> 0:02:29,000
If you change the grasp, it can adjust to that.

54
0:02:31.496,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand

55
0:02:34.542,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock.

56
0:02:36.61,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It stands.

57
0:02:37.795,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's fairly simple.

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Another thing is,

59
0:02:40.975,000 --> 0:02:42,000
sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone

60
0:02:43.096,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that are bigger than the phone itself.

61
0:02:45.108,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In that case -- like here, there's an app

62
0:02:47.142,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that's bigger than the phone's screen --

63
0:02:49.079,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the shape of the phone could tell you,

64
0:02:50.978,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"OK, off the screen, right here, there is more content.

65
0:02:53.6,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You can't see it, but it's there."

66
0:02:55.255,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And you can feel it, because it's thicker at that edge.

67
0:02:58.077,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The shape is the second thing.

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The third thing operates on a different level.

69
0:03:03.626,000 --> 0:03:05,000
As humans, we are social, we are empathic,

70
0:03:06.647,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and that's great.

71
0:03:08.374,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?

72
0:03:11.467,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Think of a hamster in the pocket.

73
0:03:13.348,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right. I don't have to check it.

74
0:03:16.664,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:17.714,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Let me show you the living mobile phone.

76
0:03:20.003,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box.

77
0:03:22.555,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But this one, it has a breath and a heartbeat,

78
0:03:25.883,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it feels very organic.

79
0:03:27.729,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:30.045,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.

81
0:03:32.366,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Oh, now -- missed call, a new call,

82
0:03:34.721,000 --> 0:03:36,000
new girlfriend, maybe -- very exciting.

83
0:03:36.762,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:38.531,000 --> 0:03:4,000
How do we calm it down?

85
0:03:40.577,000 --> 0:03:42,000
You give it a pat behind the ears,

86
0:03:43.313,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and everything is all right again.

87
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
That's very intuitive, and that's what we want.

88
0:03:47.957,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us.

89
0:03:52.076,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that.

90
0:03:55.261,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What's behind that is a postulation,

91
0:03:57.793,000 --> 0:04:01,000
namely, not that humans should get much more technical in the future;

92
0:04:02.053,000 --> 0:04:05,000
rather than that, technology, a bit more human.

93
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

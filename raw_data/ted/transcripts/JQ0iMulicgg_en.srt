1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
ages six to eight, at a children's museum,

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I brought with me a bag full of legs,

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
similar to the kinds of things you see up here,

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and had them laid out on a table for the kids.

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
about what they don't know, or don't understand,

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
or is foreign to them.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
They only learn to be frightened of those differences

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
when an adult influences them to behave that way,

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and maybe censors that natural curiosity,

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or you know, reins in the question-asking

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in the hopes of them being polite little kids.

14
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
don't stare at her legs."

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But, of course, that's the point.

18
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.

19
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So I made a deal with the adults

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
on their own.

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,

23
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,

24
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg

25
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to see what happens with that.

26
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I said, "Kids, really quickly --

27
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --

28
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
nothing too big, two or three stories --

29
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
anything you can dream up right now,

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
what kind of legs would you build me?"

32
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!"

33
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"

34
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"

35
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."

36
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.

37
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And then, one eight-year-old said,

38
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"

39
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."

40
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And just like that, I went from being a woman

42
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"

43
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.

44
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Somebody that might even be super-abled.

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Interesting.

46
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.

47
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is

48
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.

49
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.

50
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.

51
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs

52
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,

53
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
which you may have seen on stage yesterday.

54
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.

55
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out

56
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community

57
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to come bring their talent to the science and to the art

58
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of building legs.

59
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,

60
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and assigning them different values.

61
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.

62
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --

63
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.

64
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,

65
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and she gave me a cover story.

66
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This started an incredible journey.

67
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;

68
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak

69
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.

70
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,

71
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
men and women.

72
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And the conversation would go something like this,

73
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.

74
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You don't look disabled."

75
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I thought, "Well, that's amazing,

77
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because I don't feel disabled."

78
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation

79
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that could be explored, about beauty.

80
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
What does a beautiful woman have to look like?

81
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
What is a sexy body?

82
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,

83
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
what does it mean to have a disability?

84
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.

85
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Nobody calls her disabled.

86
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,

88
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,

89
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
who were also interested in exploring that conversation.

90
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane

91
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to London, doing my first fashion shoot,

92
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which resulted in this cover --

93
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"Fashion-able"?

94
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen

95
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.

96
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.

97
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Actually, I have them on stage with me:

98
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.

99
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Poetry matters.

100
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object

101
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to a realm of art.

102
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful

103
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
into something that invites them to look,

104
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and look a little longer,

105
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and maybe even understand.

106
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.

107
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."

108
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
This is where it really hit home for me --

109
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that my legs could be wearable sculpture.

110
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness

111
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
as the only aesthetic ideal.

112
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs

113
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,

114
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
a.k.a. bowling ball material.

115
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Heavy!

116
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil

117
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,

118
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and a very lovely brass toe.

119
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's a good close-up of that one.

120
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --

121
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
a little homage to my life as an athlete.

122
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
14 hours of prosthetic make-up

123
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to get into a creature that had articulated paws,

124
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
claws and a tail that whipped around,

125
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
like a gecko.

126
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --

128
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
look like jellyfish legs,

129
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
also polyurethane.

130
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And the only purpose that these legs can serve,

131
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
outside the context of the film,

132
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.

133
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So whimsy matters.

134
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs

135
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that various people have made for me,

136
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,

137
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and I can change my height --

138
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I have a variable of five different heights.

139
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Today, I'm 6'1".

141
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago

142
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
at Dorset Orthopedic in England

143
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and when I brought them home to Manhattan,

144
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.

145
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And a girl was there who has known me for years

146
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
at my normal 5'8".

147
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,

148
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and she went, "But you're so tall!"

149
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"

150
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,

151
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams

152
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that I never expected I would ever have.

153
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And I was having fun with it.

154
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And she looked at me,

155
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."

156
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

158
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And the incredible thing was she really meant it.

159
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
It's not fair that you can change your height,

160
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
as you want it.

161
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And that's when I knew --

162
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that's when I knew that the conversation with society

163
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
has changed profoundly

164
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in this last decade.

165
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.

166
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's a conversation about augmentation.

167
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
It's a conversation about potential.

168
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.

169
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer

170
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create

171
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in that space.

172
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So people that society once considered to be disabled

173
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
can now become the architects of their own identities

174
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and indeed continue to change those identities

175
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
by designing their bodies

176
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
from a place of empowerment.

177
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And what is exciting to me so much right now

178
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is that by combining cutting-edge technology --

179
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
robotics, bionics --

180
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
with the age-old poetry,

181
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.

182
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I think that if we want to discover the full potential

183
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in our humanity,

184
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths

185
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and those glorious disabilities that we all have.

186
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock:

187
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
"If you prick us, do we not bleed,

188
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"

189
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It is our humanity,

190
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and all the potential within it,

191
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that makes us beautiful.

192
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Thank you.

193
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Applause)

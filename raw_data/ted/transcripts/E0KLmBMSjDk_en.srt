1
0:00:12.395,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello, my name is Dessa,

2
0:00:14.792,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I'm a member of a hip-hop collective called Doomtree.

3
0:00:18.728,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm the one in the tank top.

4
0:00:20.53,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:22.212,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I make my living as a performing, touring rapper and singer.

6
0:00:27.278,000 --> 0:00:3,000
When we perform as a collective, this is what our shows look like.

7
0:00:30.875,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm the one in the boots.

8
0:00:32.578,000 --> 0:00:34,000
There's a lot of jumping. There's a lot of sweating.

9
0:00:35.032,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's loud. It's very high-energy.

10
0:00:37.083,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Sometimes there are unintentional body checks onstage.

11
0:00:40.938,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Sometimes there are completely intentional body checks onstage.

12
0:00:44.401,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's kind of a hybrid between an intramural hockey game and a concert.

13
0:00:50.364,000 --> 0:00:53,000
However, when I perform my own music as a solo artist,

14
0:00:53.502,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I tend to gravitate towards more melancholy sounds.

15
0:00:56.685,000 --> 0:01:,000
A few years ago, I gave my mom the rough mixes of a new album,

16
0:01:00.95,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and she said, "Baby, it's beautiful, but why is it always so sad?"

17
0:01:05.498,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:06.665,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"You always make music to bleed out to."

19
0:01:09.022,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I thought, "Who are you hanging out with that you know that phrase?"

20
0:01:12.555,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:14.505,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But over the course of my career, I've written so many sad love songs

22
0:01:18.004,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that I got messages like this from fans:

23
0:01:19.98,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"Release new music or a book. I need help with my breakup."

24
0:01:22.856,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:26.346,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And after performing and recording and touring those songs for a long time,

26
0:01:30.559,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I found myself in a position

27
0:01:33.064,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in which my professional niche was essentially romantic devastation.

28
0:01:39.335,000 --> 0:01:41,000
What I hadn't been public about, however,

29
0:01:41.682,000 --> 0:01:44,000
was the fact that most of these songs had been written about the same guy.

30
0:01:45.962,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And for two years, we tried to sort ourselves out,

31
0:01:49.029,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and then for five

32
0:01:51.029,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and on and off for 10.

33
0:01:53.389,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I was not only heartbroken,

34
0:01:56.104,000 --> 0:02:,000
but I was kind of embarrassed that I couldn't rebound

35
0:02:00.61,000 --> 0:02:03,000
from what other people seemed to recover from so regularly.

36
0:02:06.474,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And even though I knew it wasn't doing either of us any good,

37
0:02:09.419,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I just couldn't figure out how to put the love down.

38
0:02:15.494,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Then, drinking white wine one night,

39
0:02:17.283,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I saw a TED Talk by a woman named Dr. Helen Fisher,

40
0:02:20.754,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and she said that in her work, she'd been able to map the coordinates of love

41
0:02:25.696,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the human brain.

42
0:02:26.912,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I thought, well, if I could find my love in my brain,

43
0:02:30.677,000 --> 0:02:31,000
maybe I could get it out.

44
0:02:32.148,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So I went to Twitter.

45
0:02:34.231,000 --> 0:02:36,000
"Anybody got access to an fMRI lab,

46
0:02:36.375,000 --> 0:02:37,000
like at midnight or something?

47
0:02:37.878,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'll trade for backstage passes and whiskey."

48
0:02:40.418,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:42.035,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And that's Dr. Cheryl Olman,

50
0:02:43.711,000 --> 0:02:47,000
who works at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research.

51
0:02:47.832,000 --> 0:02:48,000
She took me up on it.

52
0:02:49.371,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I explained Dr. Fisher's protocol,

53
0:02:52.852,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and we decided to recreate it with a sample size of one, me.

54
0:02:56.427,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:57.581,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So I got decked out in a pair of forest green scrubs,

56
0:03:03.455,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I was laid on a gurney

57
0:03:05.442,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and wheeled into an fMRI machine.

58
0:03:07.324,000 --> 0:03:09,000
If you're unfamiliar with that technology,

59
0:03:09.388,000 --> 0:03:12,000
essentially, an fMRI machine is a big, tubular magnet

60
0:03:12.705,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that tracks the progress of deoxygenated iron in your blood.

61
0:03:17.196,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So it's essentially figuring out what parts of your brain

62
0:03:19.928,000 --> 0:03:21,000
are making the biggest metabolic demand at any given moment.

63
0:03:22.812,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And in that way, it can figure out

64
0:03:24.502,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which structures are associated with a task,

65
0:03:26.623,000 --> 0:03:29,000
like tapping your finger, for example, will always light up the same region,

66
0:03:30.266,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or in my case,

67
0:03:31.77,000 --> 0:03:33,000
looking at pictures of your ex-boyfriend

68
0:03:34.742,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and then looking at pictures of a dude who just sort of resembled my ex-boyfriend

69
0:03:38.598,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but for whom I had no strong feelings.

70
0:03:40.466,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He was the control.

71
0:03:41.816,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:43.841,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And when I left the machine,

73
0:03:45.227,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we had these really high-resolution images of my brain.

74
0:03:50.359,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We could cleave the two halves apart.

75
0:03:53.265,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We could inflate the cortex to see inside all of the wrinkles, essentially,

76
0:03:59.112,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in a view that Dr. Cheryl Olman called the "brain skin rug."

77
0:04:02.723,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:04.752,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And we could see how my brain had behaved when I looked at images of both men.

79
0:04:11.105,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And this was important.

80
0:04:12.646,000 --> 0:04:14,000
We could track all of the activity

81
0:04:15.157,000 --> 0:04:18,000
when I looked at the control and when I looked at my ex,

82
0:04:18.383,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and it was in comparing these data sets that we'd be able to find the love alone,

83
0:04:22.696,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in the same way that, if I were to step on a scale fully dressed

84
0:04:26.696,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and then step on it again naked,

85
0:04:29.063,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the difference between those numbers would be the weight of my clothing.

86
0:04:32.53,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So when we did that data comparison, we subtracted one from the other,

87
0:04:36.245,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we found activity in exactly the regions that Dr. Fisher would have predicted.

88
0:04:42.17,000 --> 0:04:43,000
That's me.

89
0:04:44.343,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And that's my brain in love.

90
0:04:47.35,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There was activity in that little orange dot, the ventral tegmental area,

91
0:04:50.945,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that kind of loop of red is the anterior cingulate

92
0:04:54.374,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and that golden set of horns is the caudates.

93
0:04:59.214,000 --> 0:05:01,000
After she had had time to analyze the data with her team

94
0:05:02.073,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and a couple of partners, Andrea and Phil,

95
0:05:04.127,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Cheryl sent me an image, a single slide.

96
0:05:08.018,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It was my brain in cross section,

97
0:05:11.622,000 --> 0:05:12,000
with one bright dot of activity

98
0:05:13.346,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that represented my feelings for this dude.

99
0:05:18.354,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And I'd known I was in love,

100
0:05:20.344,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and that's the whole reason I was going to these outrageous lengths.

101
0:05:23.986,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But having an image that proved it felt like such a vindication,

102
0:05:28.089,000 --> 0:05:31,000
like, "Yeah, it's all in my head, but now I know exactly where."

103
0:05:31.887,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:35.971,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I also felt like an assassin who had her mark.

105
0:05:39.164,000 --> 0:05:41,000
That was what I had to annihilate.

106
0:05:42.299,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So I decided to embark on a course of treatment

107
0:05:46.795,000 --> 0:05:48,000
called "neurofeedback."

108
0:05:49.154,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I worked with a woman named Penijean Gracefire,

109
0:05:52.816,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and she explained that what we'd be doing was training my brain.

110
0:05:56.805,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We're not lobotomizing anything.

111
0:05:58.446,000 --> 0:06:,000
We're training it in the way that we would train a muscle,

112
0:06:01.219,000 --> 0:06:03,000
so that it would be flexible enough and resilient enough

113
0:06:04.033,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to respond appropriately to my circumstances.

114
0:06:07.164,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So when we're on the treadmill, we would anticipate

115
0:06:10.78,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that our heart would beat and pound,

116
0:06:13.292,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and when we're asleep, we would ask that that muscle slow.

117
0:06:17.195,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Similarly, when I'm in a long-term, viable, loving romantic relationship,

118
0:06:21.9,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the emotional centers of my brain should engage,

119
0:06:24.648,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and when I'm not in a long-term, viable, emotional, loving relationship,

120
0:06:28.23,000 --> 0:06:31,000
they should eventually chill out.

121
0:06:32.579,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So she came over with a set of electrodes just smaller than a dime

122
0:06:37.195,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that were sensitive enough to detect my brainwaves

123
0:06:39.611,000 --> 0:06:41,000
through my bone and hair and scalp.

124
0:06:42.627,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And when she rigged me up, I could see my brain working in real time.

125
0:06:49.299,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And in another view that she showed me,

126
0:06:51.273,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I could see exactly which parts of my brain were hyperactive,

127
0:06:55.262,000 --> 0:06:56,000
here displayed in red;

128
0:06:56.449,000 --> 0:06:58,000
hypoactive, here displayed in blue;

129
0:06:58.73,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and the healthy threshold of behavior,

130
0:07:01.968,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the green zone, the Goldilocks zone,

131
0:07:04.406,000 --> 0:07:05,000
which is where I wanted to go.

132
0:07:05.954,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And we can, in fact, isolate just those parts of my brain

133
0:07:08.934,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that were associated with the romantic regulation

134
0:07:11.66,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that we'd identified in the Fisher study.

135
0:07:14.686,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So Penijean, several times,

136
0:07:19.795,000 --> 0:07:2,000
hooked me up with all her electrodes,

137
0:07:22.573,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and she explained that I didn't have to do or think anything.

138
0:07:25.823,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I just essentially had to hold pretty still

139
0:07:28.414,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and stay awake

140
0:07:30.297,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and watch.

141
0:07:33.791,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Harp and vibraphone sounds play)

142
0:07:37.638,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So I did.

143
0:07:39.303,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And every time my brain operated in that healthy threshold,

144
0:07:42.286,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I got a little run of harp or vibraphone music.

145
0:07:48.145,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And I just watched my brain rotate at roughly the speed of a gyro machine

146
0:07:52.574,000 --> 0:07:53,000
on my dad's flat-screen TV.

147
0:07:55.219,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And that was counterintuitive.

148
0:07:57.34,000 --> 0:07:59,000
She said the learning would be essentially unconscious.

149
0:07:59.994,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But then I thought about the other things I had learned

150
0:08:02.724,000 --> 0:08:04,000
without actively engaging my conscious mind.

151
0:08:04.847,000 --> 0:08:05,000
When you ride a bike,

152
0:08:06.339,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I don't really know what, like, my left calf muscle is doing,

153
0:08:10.317,000 --> 0:08:13,000
or how my latissimus dorsi knows to engage when I wobble to the right.

154
0:08:13.892,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The body just learns.

155
0:08:15.116,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And similarly, Pavlov's dogs probably don't know a lot about, like,

156
0:08:19.257,000 --> 0:08:22,000
protein structures or the waveform of a ringing bell,

157
0:08:23.15,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but they salivate nonetheless because the body paired the stimuli.

158
0:08:27.713,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Finished the sessions,

159
0:08:29.878,000 --> 0:08:32,000
went back to Dr. Cheryl Olman's fMRI machine,

160
0:08:33.269,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and we repeated the protocol,

161
0:08:34.969,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the same images --

162
0:08:36.186,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of the ex, of the control and, in the interest of scientific rigor,

163
0:08:40.773,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Cheryl and her team didn't know who was who,

164
0:08:43.028,000 --> 0:08:45,000
so that they couldn't influence the results.

165
0:08:47.17,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And after she had time to analyze that second set of data,

166
0:08:51.644,000 --> 0:08:52,000
she sent me that image.

167
0:08:53.968,000 --> 0:08:54,000
She said,

168
0:08:55.552,000 --> 0:08:57,000
"Dude A's dominance of your brain

169
0:08:58.388,000 --> 0:09:,000
seems to essentially have been eradicated.

170
0:09:00.582,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I think this is the desired result," comma, yes, question mark.

171
0:09:04.788,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:07.984,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And that was the exactly the desired result.

173
0:09:10.14,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And finally, I allowed myself a moment to introspect,

174
0:09:13.713,000 --> 0:09:15,000
like, how did I feel?

175
0:09:17.316,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And in one way, it felt like

176
0:09:20.452,000 --> 0:09:23,000
it was the same inventory of feelings that I'd had at the outset.

177
0:09:24.168,000 --> 0:09:26,000
This isn't "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."

178
0:09:26.716,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The dude wasn't a stranger.

179
0:09:28.614,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But I'd had love and jealousy and amity and attraction and respect

180
0:09:35.553,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and all those complicated feelings that you amass after long-term love.

181
0:09:40.396,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But it felt like the benevolent feelings had risen to the surface,

182
0:09:46.651,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and the feelings of fixation and the less-generous feelings

183
0:09:52.31,000 --> 0:09:53,000
weren't quite so present.

184
0:09:54.602,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And that sounds like a small thing in some way,

185
0:09:56.874,000 --> 0:09:57,000
this resequencing of feelings,

186
0:09:58.409,000 --> 0:10:,000
but to me it felt like the biggest thing.

187
0:10:00.684,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Like, if I told you,

188
0:10:02.486,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"I'm going to anesthetize you,

189
0:10:04.51,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and I'm also going to take out your wisdom teeth,"

190
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
it would really matter to you the sequence in which I did those two things.

191
0:10:10.742,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

192
0:10:14.266,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I also felt like

193
0:10:16.168,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I'd had this really unusual philosophical privilege

194
0:10:20.617,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to understand love.

195
0:10:24.94,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The lab offered to 3D-print my caudate.

196
0:10:29.358,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I got to hold love in my hand.

197
0:10:31.455,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:33.201,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And then I bronzed it,

199
0:10:34.392,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and I made it into a necklace and sold it at the merch table at my shows.

200
0:10:37.887,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

201
0:10:40.693,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

202
0:10:47.819,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And then, with the help of a couple of friends back in Minneapolis,

203
0:10:51.507,000 --> 0:10:52,000
one of them Becky,

204
0:10:53.188,000 --> 0:10:55,000
we made an enormous disco ball of it --

205
0:10:55.783,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:57.271,000 --> 0:11:,000
that could descend from the ceiling at my big shows.

207
0:11:01.057,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And I felt like I'd had the opportunity to better understand love,

208
0:11:05.029,000 --> 0:11:09,000
even the compulsive parts.

209
0:11:09.24,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It isn't a neat, symmetrical Valentine's heart.

210
0:11:12.96,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's bodily, it's systemic,

211
0:11:15.118,000 --> 0:11:19,000
it is a hideous pair of ram's horns buried somewhere deep within your skull,

212
0:11:20.138,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and when that special boy walks by,

213
0:11:22.482,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it lights up,

214
0:11:23.935,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and if he likes you back and you make each other happy,

215
0:11:26.885,000 --> 0:11:27,000
then you fan the flames.

216
0:11:28.528,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And if he doesn't,

217
0:11:29.974,000 --> 0:11:31,000
then you assemble a team of neuroscientists

218
0:11:32.049,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to snuff them out by force.

219
0:11:33.707,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:35.641,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Thanks.

221
0:11:36.9,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

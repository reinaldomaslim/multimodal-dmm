1
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Thank you very much.

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, I've got a story for you.

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
When I arrived off the plane,

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
after a very long journey from the West of England,

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
my computer, my beloved laptop,

6
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
had gone mad,

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! --

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and the display on it --

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
anyway, the whole thing had burst.

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And I went to the IT guys here

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and a gentleman mended my computer,

12
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and then he said, "What are you doing here?"

13
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"

14
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."

15
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I said, "Do you really?"

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Anyway, so you're in for a treat,

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.

18
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Applause)

19
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.

20
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This song is called "Farther than the Sun."

22
0:01:35,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Music)

23
0:02:04,000 --> 0:02:08,000

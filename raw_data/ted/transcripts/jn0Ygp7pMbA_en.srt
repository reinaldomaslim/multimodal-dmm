1
0:00:12.478,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Three and a half years ago,

2
0:00:14.213,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I made one of the best decisions of my life.

3
0:00:17.463,000 --> 0:00:19,000
As my New Year's resolution,

4
0:00:19.526,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I gave up dieting, stopped worrying about my weight,

5
0:00:23.765,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and learned to eat mindfully.

6
0:00:26.79,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Now I eat whenever I'm hungry,

7
0:00:30.673,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I've lost 10 pounds.

8
0:00:33.736,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This was me at age 13,

9
0:00:36.273,000 --> 0:00:38,000
when I started my first diet.

10
0:00:38.813,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I look at that picture now, and I think,

11
0:00:41.825,000 --> 0:00:42,000
you did not need a diet,

12
0:00:43.659,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you needed a fashion consult.

13
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:48.737,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But I thought I needed to lose weight,

15
0:00:51.806,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and when I gained it back,

16
0:00:53.268,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of course I blamed myself.

17
0:00:57.196,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And for the next three decades,

18
0:00:59.703,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I was on and off various diets.

19
0:01:02.458,000 --> 0:01:04,000
No matter what I tried,

20
0:01:04.53,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the weight I'd lost always came back.

21
0:01:07.361,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I'm sure many of you know the feeling.

22
0:01:10.962,000 --> 0:01:11,000
As a neuroscientist,

23
0:01:12.523,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I wondered, why is this so hard?

24
0:01:15.337,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Obviously, how much you weigh depends on

25
0:01:17.897,000 --> 0:01:19,000
how much you eat and how much energy you burn.

26
0:01:20.487,000 --> 0:01:22,000
What most people don't realize

27
0:01:22.703,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is that hunger and energy use

28
0:01:24.516,000 --> 0:01:26,000
are controlled by the brain,

29
0:01:26.62,000 --> 0:01:29,000
mostly without your awareness.

30
0:01:30.135,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes,

31
0:01:33.695,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and that is a good thing,

32
0:01:35.911,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because your conscious mind --

33
0:01:38.097,000 --> 0:01:39,000
how do we put this politely? --

34
0:01:39.964,000 --> 0:01:42,000
it's easily distracted.

35
0:01:43.239,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's good that you don't have to remember to breathe

36
0:01:45.944,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when you get caught up in a movie.

37
0:01:48.584,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You don't forget how to walk

38
0:01:50.601,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because you're thinking about what to have for dinner.

39
0:01:53.516,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Your brain also has its own sense

40
0:01:55.5,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of what you should weigh,

41
0:01:57.265,000 --> 0:02:,000
no matter what you consciously believe.

42
0:02:00.327,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is called your set point,

43
0:02:02.367,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but that's a misleading term,

44
0:02:04.033,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because it's actually a range

45
0:02:05.743,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of about 10 or 15 pounds.

46
0:02:08.307,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight

47
0:02:11.53,000 --> 0:02:13,000
up and down within that range,

48
0:02:13.598,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but it's much, much harder to stay outside of it.

49
0:02:18.003,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The hypothalamus, the part of the brain

50
0:02:20.03,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that regulates body weight,

51
0:02:21.943,000 --> 0:02:23,000
there are more than a dozen chemical signals

52
0:02:24.366,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the brain that tell your body to gain weight,

53
0:02:26.982,000 --> 0:02:29,000
more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it,

54
0:02:30.666,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and the system works like a thermostat,

55
0:02:33.976,000 --> 0:02:35,000
responding to signals from the body

56
0:02:36.323,000 --> 0:02:39,000
by adjusting hunger, activity and metabolism,

57
0:02:39.931,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to keep your weight stable as conditions change.

58
0:02:43.657,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That's what a thermostat does, right?

59
0:02:45.759,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It keeps the temperature in your house the same

60
0:02:49.191,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as the weather changes outside.

61
0:02:51.951,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now you can try to change the temperature

62
0:02:54.773,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in your house by opening a window in the winter,

63
0:02:58.269,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but that's not going to change the setting on the thermostat,

64
0:03:02.035,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which will respond by kicking on the furnace

65
0:03:04.234,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to warm the place back up.

66
0:03:06.671,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Your brain works exactly the same way,

67
0:03:09.993,000 --> 0:03:12,000
responding to weight loss by using powerful tools

68
0:03:13.136,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to push your body back

69
0:03:14.29,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to what it considers normal.

70
0:03:18.32,000 --> 0:03:19,000
If you lose a lot of weight,

71
0:03:20.295,000 --> 0:03:24,000
your brain reacts as if you were starving,

72
0:03:24.62,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and whether you started out fat or thin,

73
0:03:27.252,000 --> 0:03:29,000
your brain's response is exactly the same.

74
0:03:30.217,000 --> 0:03:32,000
We would love to think that your brain could tell

75
0:03:32.49,000 --> 0:03:33,000
whether you need to lose weight or not,

76
0:03:33.956,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but it can't.

77
0:03:36.091,000 --> 0:03:38,000
If you do lose a lot of weight,

78
0:03:38.984,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you become hungry,

79
0:03:41.283,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and your muscles burn less energy.

80
0:03:44.169,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University

81
0:03:46.818,000 --> 0:03:47,000
has found that people who have lost

82
0:03:48.527,000 --> 0:03:5,000
10 percent of their body weight

83
0:03:50.726,000 --> 0:03:52,000
burn 250 to 400 calories less

84
0:03:53.549,000 --> 0:03:55,000
because their metabolism is suppressed.

85
0:03:56.057,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That's a lot of food.

86
0:03:58.487,000 --> 0:04:,000
This means that a successful dieter

87
0:04:00.711,000 --> 0:04:03,000
must eat this much less forever

88
0:04:03.879,000 --> 0:04:04,000
than someone of the same weight

89
0:04:05.171,000 --> 0:04:07,000
who has always been thin.

90
0:04:07.474,000 --> 0:04:08,000
From an evolutionary perspective,

91
0:04:09.264,000 --> 0:04:11,000
your body's resistance to weight loss makes sense.

92
0:04:11.808,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When food was scarce, our ancestors' survival

93
0:04:14.944,000 --> 0:04:16,000
depended on conserving energy,

94
0:04:17.438,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and regaining the weight when food was available

95
0:04:19.691,000 --> 0:04:22,000
would have protected them against the next shortage.

96
0:04:22.798,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Over the course of human history,

97
0:04:25.325,000 --> 0:04:28,000
starvation has been a much bigger problem

98
0:04:28.327,000 --> 0:04:29,000
than overeating.

99
0:04:30.011,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This may explain a very sad fact:

100
0:04:34.242,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Set points can go up,

101
0:04:37.071,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but they rarely go down.

102
0:04:39.943,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, if your mother ever mentioned

103
0:04:42.132,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that life is not fair,

104
0:04:44.428,000 --> 0:04:46,000
this is the kind of thing she was talking about.

105
0:04:47.221,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:50.259,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Successful dieting doesn't lower your set point.

107
0:04:53.444,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Even after you've kept the weight off

108
0:04:54.988,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for as long as seven years,

109
0:04:56.817,000 --> 0:04:59,000
your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back.

110
0:05:00.79,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If that weight loss had been due to a long famine,

111
0:05:04.08,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that would be a sensible response.

112
0:05:06.409,000 --> 0:05:08,000
In our modern world of drive-thru burgers,

113
0:05:09.09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
it's not working out so well for many of us.

114
0:05:12.547,000 --> 0:05:15,000
That difference between our ancestral past

115
0:05:16.29,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and our abundant present

116
0:05:18.693,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff

117
0:05:20.982,000 --> 0:05:22,000
of the University of Ottawa

118
0:05:23.042,000 --> 0:05:25,000
would like to take some of his patients back to a time

119
0:05:25.743,000 --> 0:05:27,000
when food was less available,

120
0:05:27.842,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and it's also the reason

121
0:05:29.543,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that changing the food environment

122
0:05:31.927,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is really going to be the most effective solution

123
0:05:36.043,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to obesity.

124
0:05:38.153,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Sadly, a temporary weight gain

125
0:05:41.43,000 --> 0:05:43,000
can become permanent.

126
0:05:43.475,000 --> 0:05:45,000
If you stay at a high weight for too long,

127
0:05:46.109,000 --> 0:05:48,000
probably a matter of years for most of us,

128
0:05:48.583,000 --> 0:05:52,000
your brain may decide that that's the new normal.

129
0:05:53.021,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Psychologists classify eaters into two groups,

130
0:05:57.081,000 --> 0:05:58,000
those who rely on their hunger

131
0:05:58.699,000 --> 0:06:,000
and those who try to control their eating

132
0:06:01.268,000 --> 0:06:07,000
through willpower, like most dieters.

133
0:06:07.331,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Let's call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters.

134
0:06:13.842,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters

135
0:06:16.025,000 --> 0:06:18,000
are less likely to be overweight,

136
0:06:18.656,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and they spend less time thinking about food.

137
0:06:22.358,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Controlled eaters are more vulnerable

138
0:06:26.002,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to overeating in response to advertising,

139
0:06:28.865,000 --> 0:06:31,000
super-sizing, and the all-you-can-eat buffet.

140
0:06:32.728,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And a small indulgence,

141
0:06:34.473,000 --> 0:06:37,000
like eating one scoop of ice cream,

142
0:06:37.679,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is more likely to lead to a food binge

143
0:06:43.289,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in controlled eaters.

144
0:06:45.186,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Children are especially vulnerable

145
0:06:47.113,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to this cycle of dieting and then binging.

146
0:06:50.242,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Several long-term studies have shown

147
0:06:53.071,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that girls who diet in their early teenage years

148
0:06:57.223,000 --> 0:07:,000
are three times more likely to become overweight

149
0:07:00.548,000 --> 0:07:01,000
five years later,

150
0:07:02.085,000 --> 0:07:04,000
even if they started at a normal weight,

151
0:07:04.904,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and all of these studies found

152
0:07:07.553,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that the same factors

153
0:07:09.86,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that predicted weight gain

154
0:07:13.254,000 --> 0:07:16,000
also predicted the development of eating disorders.

155
0:07:16.254,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The other factor, by the way,

156
0:07:17.822,000 --> 0:07:18,000
those of you who are parents,

157
0:07:19.251,000 --> 0:07:22,000
was being teased by family members

158
0:07:22.48,000 --> 0:07:23,000
about their weight.

159
0:07:23.991,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So don't do that.

160
0:07:25.827,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:27.565,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I left almost all my graphs at home,

162
0:07:30.201,000 --> 0:07:32,000
but I couldn't resist throwing in just this one,

163
0:07:32.494,000 --> 0:07:34,000
because I'm a geek, and that's how I roll.

164
0:07:34.907,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:37.386,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This is a study that looked at the risk of death

166
0:07:39.734,000 --> 0:07:4,000
over a 14-year period

167
0:07:41.6,000 --> 0:07:43,000
based on four healthy habits:

168
0:07:44.102,000 --> 0:07:46,000
eating enough fruits and vegetables,

169
0:07:46.222,000 --> 0:07:48,000
exercise three times a week,

170
0:07:48.448,000 --> 0:07:49,000
not smoking,

171
0:07:49.824,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and drinking in moderation.

172
0:07:51.794,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Let's start by looking at the normal weight

173
0:07:53.723,000 --> 0:07:54,000
people in the study.

174
0:07:55.311,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The height of the bars is the risk of death,

175
0:07:57.198,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and those zero, one, two, three, four numbers

176
0:07:59.579,000 --> 0:08:,000
on the horizontal axis

177
0:08:00.825,000 --> 0:08:02,000
are the number of those healthy habits

178
0:08:02.858,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that a given person had.

179
0:08:04.418,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And as you'd expect, the healthier the lifestyle,

180
0:08:07.407,000 --> 0:08:09,000
the less likely people were to die during the study.

181
0:08:10.319,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now let's look at what happens

182
0:08:11.641,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in overweight people.

183
0:08:13.487,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The ones that had no healthy habits

184
0:08:15.559,000 --> 0:08:16,000
had a higher risk of death.

185
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Adding just one healthy habit

186
0:08:19.094,000 --> 0:08:22,000
pulls overweight people back into the normal range.

187
0:08:22.556,000 --> 0:08:24,000
For obese people with no healthy habits,

188
0:08:25.298,000 --> 0:08:27,000
the risk is very high, seven times higher

189
0:08:28.008,000 --> 0:08:3,000
than the healthiest groups in the study.

190
0:08:30.144,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too.

191
0:08:34.084,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In fact, if you look only at the group

192
0:08:36.602,000 --> 0:08:38,000
with all four healthy habits,

193
0:08:38.876,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you can see that weight makes very little difference.

194
0:08:41.488,000 --> 0:08:43,000
You can take control of your health

195
0:08:43.544,000 --> 0:08:44,000
by taking control of your lifestyle,

196
0:08:45.418,000 --> 0:08:46,000
even If you can't lose weight

197
0:08:46.899,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and keep it off.

198
0:08:48.635,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Diets don't have very much reliability.

199
0:08:52.745,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Five years after a diet,

200
0:08:54.522,000 --> 0:08:56,000
most people have regained the weight.

201
0:08:57.31,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Forty percent of them have gained even more.

202
0:08:59.792,000 --> 0:09:,000
If you think about this,

203
0:09:01.217,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the typical outcome of dieting

204
0:09:03.564,000 --> 0:09:04,000
is that you're more likely to gain weight

205
0:09:05.452,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in the long run than to lose it.

206
0:09:08.221,000 --> 0:09:1,000
If I've convinced you that dieting

207
0:09:11.075,000 --> 0:09:13,000
might be a problem,

208
0:09:13.104,000 --> 0:09:15,000
the next question is, what do you do about it?

209
0:09:15.742,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And my answer, in a word, is mindfulness.

210
0:09:20.198,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm not saying you need to learn to meditate

211
0:09:22.733,000 --> 0:09:23,000
or take up yoga.

212
0:09:24.725,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'm talking about mindful eating:

213
0:09:27.277,000 --> 0:09:3,000
learning to understand your body's signals

214
0:09:30.785,000 --> 0:09:32,000
so that you eat when you're hungry

215
0:09:33.174,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and stop when you're full,

216
0:09:35.516,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because a lot of weight gain boils down

217
0:09:37.694,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to eating when you're not hungry.

218
0:09:40.76,000 --> 0:09:41,000
How do you do it?

219
0:09:42.244,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Give yourself permission to eat

220
0:09:44.078,000 --> 0:09:46,000
as much as you want, and then work on figuring out

221
0:09:46.283,000 --> 0:09:47,000
what makes your body feel good.

222
0:09:48.035,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Sit down to regular meals without distractions.

223
0:09:51.764,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Think about how your body feels

224
0:09:53.563,000 --> 0:09:55,000
when you start to eat and when you stop,

225
0:09:55.617,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and let your hunger decide

226
0:09:58.104,000 --> 0:09:59,000
when you should be done.

227
0:09:59.572,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It took about a year for me to learn this,

228
0:10:01.993,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but it's really been worth it.

229
0:10:03.764,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I am so much more relaxed around food

230
0:10:06.849,000 --> 0:10:08,000
than I have ever been in my life.

231
0:10:09.712,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I often don't think about it.

232
0:10:12.277,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I forget we have chocolate in the house.

233
0:10:15.01,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's like aliens have taken over my brain.

234
0:10:17.954,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It's just completely different.

235
0:10:20.712,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I should say that

236
0:10:23.378,000 --> 0:10:25,000
this approach to eating probably won't make you lose weight

237
0:10:26.171,000 --> 0:10:28,000
unless you often eat when you're not hungry,

238
0:10:29.088,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but doctors don't know of any approach

239
0:10:32.986,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people,

240
0:10:37.461,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on

241
0:10:40.831,000 --> 0:10:42,000
preventing weight gain

242
0:10:42.99,000 --> 0:10:45,000
instead of promoting weight loss.

243
0:10:46.213,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Let's face it:

244
0:10:47.749,000 --> 0:10:51,000
If diets worked, we'd all be thin already.

245
0:10:51.96,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

246
0:10:53.86,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Why do we keep doing the same thing

247
0:10:55.497,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and expecting different results?

248
0:10:58.38,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Diets may seem harmless,

249
0:11:00.063,000 --> 0:11:03,000
but they actually do a lot of collateral damage.

250
0:11:03.781,000 --> 0:11:05,000
At worst, they ruin lives:

251
0:11:06.216,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Weight obsession leads to eating disorders,

252
0:11:08.532,000 --> 0:11:1,000
especially in young kids.

253
0:11:11.475,000 --> 0:11:15,000
In the U.S., we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls

254
0:11:16.353,000 --> 0:11:17,000
say they've been on a diet.

255
0:11:18.13,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Our daughters have learned to measure their worth

256
0:11:20.391,000 --> 0:11:23,000
by the wrong scale.

257
0:11:23.494,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Even at its best,

258
0:11:25.519,000 --> 0:11:27,000
dieting is a waste of time and energy.

259
0:11:28.247,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It takes willpower which you could be using

260
0:11:32.469,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to help your kids with their homework

261
0:11:35.091,000 --> 0:11:38,000
or to finish that important work project,

262
0:11:38.707,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and because willpower is limited,

263
0:11:42.194,000 --> 0:11:46,000
any strategy that relies on its consistent application

264
0:11:46.817,000 --> 0:11:48,000
is pretty much guaranteed

265
0:11:49.6,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to eventually fail you

266
0:11:51.693,000 --> 0:11:54,000
when your attention moves on to something else.

267
0:11:55.542,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Let me leave you with one last thought.

268
0:11:59.474,000 --> 0:12:01,000
What if we told all those dieting girls

269
0:12:02.377,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that it's okay to eat when they're hungry?

270
0:12:05.378,000 --> 0:12:07,000
What if we taught them to work with their appetite

271
0:12:07.628,000 --> 0:12:09,000
instead of fearing it?

272
0:12:09.753,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I think most of them would be happier and healthier,

273
0:12:13.18,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and as adults,

274
0:12:15.195,000 --> 0:12:18,000
many of them would probably be thinner.

275
0:12:18.968,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I wish someone had told me that

276
0:12:21.081,000 --> 0:12:24,000
back when I was 13.

277
0:12:24.502,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Thanks.

278
0:12:26.508,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.36,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When we think of Nepal,

2
0:00:15.292,000 --> 0:00:17,000
we tend to think of the snow-capped mountains

3
0:00:17.747,000 --> 0:00:18,000
of the Himalayas,

4
0:00:19.019,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the crystal-clear still waters of its alpine lakes,

5
0:00:22.468,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or the huge expanse of its grasslands.

6
0:00:25.514,000 --> 0:00:27,000
What some of us may not realize

7
0:00:27.721,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is that in the Himalayan foothills,

8
0:00:30.045,000 --> 0:00:32,000
where the climate is much warmer

9
0:00:32.219,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and the landscape much greener,

10
0:00:34.307,000 --> 0:00:36,000
there lives a great diversity of wildlife,

11
0:00:36.733,000 --> 0:00:38,000
including the one-horned rhinoceros,

12
0:00:39.469,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the Asian elephant

13
0:00:41.143,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and the Bengal tiger.

14
0:00:43.218,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But unfortunately, these animals

15
0:00:45.07,000 --> 0:00:47,000
are under constant threat from poachers

16
0:00:47.733,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who hunt and kill them for their body parts.

17
0:00:51.045,000 --> 0:00:53,000
To stop the killing of these animals,

18
0:00:53.254,000 --> 0:00:55,000
battalions of soldiers and rangers

19
0:00:55.852,000 --> 0:00:58,000
are sent to protect Nepal's national parks,

20
0:00:59.101,000 --> 0:01:,000
but that is not an easy task,

21
0:01:00.726,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because these soldiers have to patrol

22
0:01:03.397,000 --> 0:01:05,000
thousands of hectares of forests on foot

23
0:01:06.388,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or elephant backs.

24
0:01:08.029,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It is also risky for these soldiers

25
0:01:10.514,000 --> 0:01:12,000
when they get into gunfights with poachers,

26
0:01:12.895,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and therefore Nepal is always looking

27
0:01:14.911,000 --> 0:01:17,000
for new ways to help with protecting the forests

28
0:01:18.207,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and wildlife.

29
0:01:20.184,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Well recently, Nepal acquired a new tool

30
0:01:22.693,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in the fight against wildlife crime,

31
0:01:25.406,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and these are drones,

32
0:01:27.112,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or more specifically, conservation drones.

33
0:01:30.386,000 --> 0:01:32,000
For about a year now, my colleagues and I

34
0:01:32.9,000 --> 0:01:34,000
have been building drones for Nepal

35
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and training the park protection personnel

36
0:01:37.658,000 --> 0:01:38,000
on the use of these drones.

37
0:01:39.636,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Not only does a drone give you

38
0:01:41.268,000 --> 0:01:43,000
a bird's-eye view of the landscape,

39
0:01:43.742,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but it also allows you to capture detailed,

40
0:01:46.777,000 --> 0:01:49,000
high-resolution images of objects on the ground.

41
0:01:50.759,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This, for example, is a pair of rhinoceros

42
0:01:54.268,000 --> 0:01:56,000
taking a cooling bath on a hot summer day

43
0:01:57.205,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in the lowlands of Nepal.

44
0:01:59.168,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Now we believe that drones have

45
0:02:01.399,000 --> 0:02:02,000
tremendous potential,

46
0:02:03.207,000 --> 0:02:05,000
not only for combating wildlife crime,

47
0:02:05.985,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but also for monitoring the health

48
0:02:07.948,000 --> 0:02:09,000
of these wildlife populations.

49
0:02:10.487,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So what is a drone?

50
0:02:12.337,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, the kind of drone I'm talking about

51
0:02:14.846,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is simply a model aircraft

52
0:02:16.947,000 --> 0:02:18,000
fitted with an autopilot system,

53
0:02:19.392,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and this autopilot unit contains a tiny computer,

54
0:02:23.661,000 --> 0:02:27,000
a GPS, a compass, a barometric altimeter

55
0:02:27.715,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and a few other sensors.

56
0:02:29.974,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now a drone like this

57
0:02:31.393,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is meant to carry a useful payload,

58
0:02:33.599,000 --> 0:02:34,000
such as a video camera

59
0:02:35.382,000 --> 0:02:36,000
or a photographic camera.

60
0:02:37.37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It also requires a software that allows the user

61
0:02:40.719,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to program a mission,

62
0:02:42.42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to tell the drone where to go.

63
0:02:44.826,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Now people I talk to are often surprised

64
0:02:46.903,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when they hear that these are the only

65
0:02:49.234,000 --> 0:02:52,000
four components that make a conservation drone,

66
0:02:52.341,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but they are even more surprised

67
0:02:53.845,000 --> 0:02:56,000
when I tell them how affordable these components are.

68
0:02:57.345,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The facts is, a conservation drone

69
0:02:59.631,000 --> 0:03:01,000
doesn't cost very much more than

70
0:03:01.89,000 --> 0:03:02,000
a good laptop computer

71
0:03:03.867,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or a decent pair of binoculars.

72
0:03:07.126,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So now that you've built your own conservation drone,

73
0:03:10.098,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you probably want to go fly it,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but how does one fly a drone?

75
0:03:14.193,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Well, actually, you don't,

76
0:03:15.785,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because the drone flies itself.

77
0:03:18.275,000 --> 0:03:21,000
All you have to do is to program a mission

78
0:03:21.405,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to tell the drone where to fly.

79
0:03:23.665,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But you simply do that by clicking on

80
0:03:25.984,000 --> 0:03:28,000
a few way points on the Google Maps interface

81
0:03:29.233,000 --> 0:03:31,000
using the open-source software.

82
0:03:31.483,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Those missions could be as simple

83
0:03:33.43,000 --> 0:03:35,000
as just a few way points,

84
0:03:35.456,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or they could be slightly longer and more complicated,

85
0:03:38.833,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to fly along a river system.

86
0:03:41.254,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Sometimes, we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern

87
0:03:45.103,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and take pictures of that area,

88
0:03:47.223,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and those pictures can be processed

89
0:03:49.194,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to produce a map of that forest.

90
0:03:51.933,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Other researchers might want to fly the drone

91
0:03:54.536,000 --> 0:03:56,000
along the boundaries of a forest

92
0:03:56.678,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to watch out for poachers or people

93
0:03:58.849,000 --> 0:04:,000
who might be trying to enter the forest illegally.

94
0:04:01.767,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now whatever your mission is,

95
0:04:03.647,000 --> 0:04:04,000
once you've programmed it,

96
0:04:05.12,000 --> 0:04:07,000
you simply upload it to the autopilot system,

97
0:04:08.103,000 --> 0:04:09,000
bring your drone to the field,

98
0:04:09.743,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and launch it simply by tossing it in the air.

99
0:04:12.958,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And often we'll go about this mission

100
0:04:15.3,000 --> 0:04:18,000
taking pictures or videos along the way,

101
0:04:18.36,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and usually at that point,

102
0:04:20.294,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we will go grab ourselves a cup of coffee,

103
0:04:22.511,000 --> 0:04:24,000
sit back, and relax for the next few minutes,

104
0:04:25.441,000 --> 0:04:28,000
although some of us sit back and panic for the next few minutes

105
0:04:28.952,000 --> 0:04:3,000
worrying that the drone will not return.

106
0:04:31.17,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Usually it does, and when it does,

107
0:04:33.443,000 --> 0:04:36,000
it even lands automatically.

108
0:04:36.849,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So what can we do with a conservation drone?

109
0:04:39.756,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Well, when we built our first prototype drone,

110
0:04:43.149,000 --> 0:04:45,000
our main objective was to fly it over

111
0:04:45.667,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a remote rainforest in North Sumatra, Indonesia,

112
0:04:49.556,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to look for the nest of a species of great ape

113
0:04:52.605,000 --> 0:04:54,000
known as the orangutan.

114
0:04:54.761,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The reason we wanted to do that was because

115
0:04:57.417,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we needed to know how many individuals

116
0:04:59.446,000 --> 0:05:02,000
of this species are still left in that forest.

117
0:05:02.833,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now the traditional method of surveying

118
0:05:05.019,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for orangutans is to walk the forest on foot

119
0:05:08.621,000 --> 0:05:09,000
carrying heavy equipment

120
0:05:10.508,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and to use a pair of binoculars to look up in the treetops

121
0:05:14.158,000 --> 0:05:17,000
where you might find an orangutan or its nest.

122
0:05:17.576,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now as you can imagine,

123
0:05:19.302,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that is a very time-consuming, labor-intensive,

124
0:05:22.272,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and costly process,

125
0:05:23.99,000 --> 0:05:24,000
so we were hoping that drones

126
0:05:25.786,000 --> 0:05:28,000
could significantly reduce the cost of surveying

127
0:05:29.111,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for orangutan populations in Indonesia

128
0:05:31.678,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

129
0:05:34.145,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So we were very excited when we captured

130
0:05:36.5,000 --> 0:05:39,000
our first pair of orangutan nests on camera.

131
0:05:39.67,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And this is it; this is the first ever picture

132
0:05:42.834,000 --> 0:05:45,000
of orangutan nests taken with a drone.

133
0:05:45.874,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Since then we have taken pictures

134
0:05:47.898,000 --> 0:05:48,000
of dozens of these nests

135
0:05:49.516,000 --> 0:05:51,000
from around various parts of Southeast Asia,

136
0:05:52.285,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and we're now working with computer scientists

137
0:05:54.528,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to develop algorithms that can automatically count

138
0:05:58.447,000 --> 0:06:,000
the number of nests from the thousands

139
0:06:00.464,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of photos we've collected so far.

140
0:06:03.583,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But nests are not the only objects

141
0:06:05.541,000 --> 0:06:06,000
these drones can detect.

142
0:06:07.331,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is a wild orangutan

143
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:11,000
happily feeding on top of a palm tree,

144
0:06:12.161,000 --> 0:06:15,000
seemingly oblivious to our drone that was flying overhead,

145
0:06:15.713,000 --> 0:06:17,000
not once but several times.

146
0:06:18.097,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We've also taken pictures of other animals

147
0:06:21.115,000 --> 0:06:24,000
including forest buffalos in Gabon,

148
0:06:24.236,000 --> 0:06:27,000
elephants, and even turtle nests.

149
0:06:27.451,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But besides taking pictures of just the animals themselves,

150
0:06:30.991,000 --> 0:06:34,000
we also take pictures of the habitats these animals live in,

151
0:06:34.992,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because we want to keep track

152
0:06:36.606,000 --> 0:06:38,000
of the health of these habitats.

153
0:06:39.56,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Sometimes, we zoom out a little

154
0:06:41.779,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and look at other things that might be happening

155
0:06:44.032,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the landscape.

156
0:06:45.496,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is an oil palm plantation in Sumatra.

157
0:06:48.796,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now oil palm is a major driver of deforestation

158
0:06:52.038,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in that part of the world,

159
0:06:53.56,000 --> 0:06:56,000
so we wanted to use this new drone technology

160
0:06:56.617,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to keep track of the spread of these plantations

161
0:06:59.732,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in Southeast Asia.

162
0:07:01.742,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But drones could also be used to keep track of

163
0:07:04.105,000 --> 0:07:06,000
illegal logging activities.

164
0:07:06.589,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is a recently logged forest,

165
0:07:09.03,000 --> 0:07:1,000
again in Sumatra.

166
0:07:10.385,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You could even still see the processed

167
0:07:12.544,000 --> 0:07:15,000
wooden planks left on the ground.

168
0:07:16.172,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But perhaps the most exciting part

169
0:07:18.461,000 --> 0:07:2,000
about taking pictures from the air is

170
0:07:21.027,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we could later stitch these pictures together

171
0:07:23.453,000 --> 0:07:25,000
using special software to create a map

172
0:07:26.316,000 --> 0:07:28,000
of the entire landscape, and this map

173
0:07:29.083,000 --> 0:07:31,000
gives us crucial information

174
0:07:31.098,000 --> 0:07:33,000
for monitoring land use change,

175
0:07:33.366,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to let us know where and when plantations might be expanding,

176
0:07:37.113,000 --> 0:07:39,000
where forests might be contracting,

177
0:07:39.39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
or where fires might be breaking out.

178
0:07:42.772,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Aerial images could also be processed

179
0:07:45.004,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to produce three-dimensional

180
0:07:47.313,000 --> 0:07:48,000
computer models of forests.

181
0:07:49.31,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now these models are not just visually appealing,

182
0:07:52.263,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but they are also geometrically accurate,

183
0:07:54.764,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which means researchers can now measure

184
0:07:57.541,000 --> 0:07:59,000
the distance between trees,

185
0:07:59.666,000 --> 0:08:02,000
calculate surface area, the volume of vegetation,

186
0:08:02.961,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and so on, all of which are important information

187
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
for monitoring the health of these forests.

188
0:08:09.473,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Recently, we've also begun experimenting

189
0:08:11.926,000 --> 0:08:13,000
with thermal imaging cameras.

190
0:08:13.99,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now these cameras can detect

191
0:08:15.879,000 --> 0:08:16,000
heat-emitting objects from the ground,

192
0:08:17.864,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and therefore they are very useful for detecting poachers or their campfires at night.

193
0:08:25.236,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So I've told you quite a lot about

194
0:08:27.12,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what conservation drones are,

195
0:08:29.336,000 --> 0:08:31,000
how you might operate one of these drones,

196
0:08:31.653,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and what a drone could do for you.

197
0:08:33.662,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I will now tell you where conservation drones

198
0:08:35.898,000 --> 0:08:37,000
are being used around the world.

199
0:08:38.353,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We built our first prototype drones in Switzerland.

200
0:08:41.406,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We brought a few of these to Indonesia

201
0:08:43.547,000 --> 0:08:45,000
for the first few test flights.

202
0:08:45.69,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Since then, we've been building drones

203
0:08:47.505,000 --> 0:08:49,000
for our collaborators from around the world,

204
0:08:50.187,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and these include fellow biologists

205
0:08:52.367,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and partners from major conservation organizations.

206
0:08:56.295,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Perhaps the best and most rewarding part

207
0:08:58.585,000 --> 0:09:,000
about working with these collaborators

208
0:09:00.711,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is the feedback they give us

209
0:09:02.191,000 --> 0:09:04,000
on how to improve our drones.

210
0:09:04.834,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Building drones for us is

211
0:09:06.965,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a constant work in progress.

212
0:09:09.129,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We are constantly trying to improve them in terms of

213
0:09:12.206,000 --> 0:09:14,000
their range, their ruggedness,

214
0:09:14.82,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and the amount of payload they can carry.

215
0:09:17.498,000 --> 0:09:19,000
We also work with collaborators

216
0:09:19.54,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to discover new ways of using these drones.

217
0:09:22.827,000 --> 0:09:25,000
For example, camera traps are a common tool

218
0:09:26.107,000 --> 0:09:29,000
used by biologists to take pictures of shy animals

219
0:09:30.002,000 --> 0:09:31,000
hiding in the forests,

220
0:09:31.563,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but these are motion-activated cameras,

221
0:09:33.897,000 --> 0:09:35,000
so they snap a picture every time an animal

222
0:09:36.538,000 --> 0:09:37,000
crosses their path.

223
0:09:38.21,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But the problem with camera traps

224
0:09:39.762,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is that the researcher has to go back to the forest

225
0:09:43.505,000 --> 0:09:46,000
every so often to retrieve those images,

226
0:09:46.958,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and that takes a lot of time,

227
0:09:48.61,000 --> 0:09:49,000
especially if there are dozens

228
0:09:50.444,000 --> 0:09:53,000
or hundreds of these cameras placed in the forest.

229
0:09:53.572,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Now a drone could be designed to perform the task

230
0:09:56.383,000 --> 0:09:57,000
much more efficiently.

231
0:09:58.107,000 --> 0:10:,000
This drone, carrying a special sensor,

232
0:10:00.777,000 --> 0:10:02,000
could be flown over the forest

233
0:10:03.118,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and remotely download these images

234
0:10:05.865,000 --> 0:10:09,000
from wi-fi–enabled cameras.

235
0:10:10.002,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Radio collars are another tool

236
0:10:12.139,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that's commonly used by biologists.

237
0:10:14.387,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Now these collars are put onto animals.

238
0:10:17.054,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They transmit a radio signal which allows

239
0:10:19.855,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the researcher to track the movements of these animals across the landscape.

240
0:10:25.002,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But the traditional way of tracking animals

241
0:10:27.659,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is pretty ridiculous,

242
0:10:29.881,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because it requires the researcher to be walking

243
0:10:32.825,000 --> 0:10:36,000
on the ground carrying a huge and cumbersome radio antenna,

244
0:10:36.939,000 --> 0:10:38,000
not unlike those old TV antennae we used to have

245
0:10:39.812,000 --> 0:10:41,000
on our rooftops. Some of us still do.

246
0:10:42.78,000 --> 0:10:44,000
A drone could be used to do the same job

247
0:10:45.045,000 --> 0:10:46,000
much more efficiently.

248
0:10:46.704,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Why not equip a drone

249
0:10:48.41,000 --> 0:10:5,000
with a scanning radio receiver,

250
0:10:50.413,000 --> 0:10:51,000
fly that over the forest canopy

251
0:10:52.407,000 --> 0:10:53,000
in a certain pattern

252
0:10:53.945,000 --> 0:10:55,000
which would allow the user or the operator

253
0:10:56.737,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to triangulate the location

254
0:10:59.319,000 --> 0:11:01,000
of these radio-collared animals remotely

255
0:11:02.306,000 --> 0:11:04,000
without having to step foot in the forest.

256
0:11:05.279,000 --> 0:11:07,000
A third and perhaps most exciting way

257
0:11:07.782,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of using these drones

258
0:11:09.312,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is to fly them to a really remote,

259
0:11:12.262,000 --> 0:11:14,000
never-explored-before rainforest

260
0:11:14.538,000 --> 0:11:15,000
somewhere hidden in the tropics,

261
0:11:16.362,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and parachute down a tiny spy microphone

262
0:11:20.295,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that would allow us to eavesdrop on the calls

263
0:11:22.741,000 --> 0:11:25,000
of mammals, birds, amphibians,

264
0:11:26.063,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the Yeti, the Sasquatch, Bigfoot, whatever.

265
0:11:30.34,000 --> 0:11:31,000
That would give us biologists

266
0:11:32.079,000 --> 0:11:33,000
a pretty good idea of what animals

267
0:11:33.965,000 --> 0:11:35,000
might be living in those forests.

268
0:11:36.515,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And finally, I would like to show you

269
0:11:38.564,000 --> 0:11:41,000
the latest version of our conservation drone.

270
0:11:41.665,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The MAJA drone has a wingspan

271
0:11:43.804,000 --> 0:11:44,000
of about two meters.

272
0:11:45.478,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It weighs only about two kilograms,

273
0:11:47.428,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but it can carry half its weight.

274
0:11:49.889,000 --> 0:11:51,000
It is a fully autonomous system.

275
0:11:52.484,000 --> 0:11:54,000
During its mission, it can even transmit

276
0:11:54.871,000 --> 0:11:57,000
a live video feed back to a ground station laptop,

277
0:11:58.834,000 --> 0:11:59,000
which allows the user

278
0:12:00.377,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to see what the drone is seeing in real time.

279
0:12:03.307,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It carries a variety of sensors,

280
0:12:05.729,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and the photo quality of some of these sensors

281
0:12:08.067,000 --> 0:12:12,000
can be as high as one to two centimeters per pixel.

282
0:12:12.277,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes,

283
0:12:15.958,000 --> 0:12:18,000
which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers.

284
0:12:19.082,000 --> 0:12:2,000
That is quite sufficient for most

285
0:12:20.997,000 --> 0:12:22,000
of our conservation applications.

286
0:12:23.996,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Now, conservation drones began as

287
0:12:26.066,000 --> 0:12:28,000
a crazy idea from two biologists

288
0:12:28.257,000 --> 0:12:31,000
who are just deeply passionate about this technology.

289
0:12:31.542,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And we believe, strongly believe,

290
0:12:33.692,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that drones can and will be a game changer

291
0:12:37.039,000 --> 0:12:4,000
for conservation research and applications.

292
0:12:40.073,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We've had our fair share of skeptics and critics

293
0:12:43.248,000 --> 0:12:46,000
who thought that we were just fooling around with toy planes.

294
0:12:46.769,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And in a way, they are right.

295
0:12:48.195,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I mean, let's be honest,

296
0:12:49.824,000 --> 0:12:52,000
drones are the ultimate toys for boys.

297
0:12:53.512,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But at the same time, we've also gotten to know

298
0:12:55.918,000 --> 0:12:57,000
many wonderful colleagues and collaborators

299
0:12:58.167,000 --> 0:12:59,000
who share our vision

300
0:12:59.715,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and see the potential of conservation drones.

301
0:13:02.571,000 --> 0:13:05,000
To us, it is obvious that conservation biologists

302
0:13:06.17,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and practitioners should make full use

303
0:13:08.428,000 --> 0:13:11,000
of every available tool, including drones,

304
0:13:11.962,000 --> 0:13:13,000
in our fight to save the last remaining forests

305
0:13:14.603,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and wildlife of this planet.

306
0:13:16.39,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Thank you.

307
0:13:18.388,000 --> 0:13:23,000
(Applause)

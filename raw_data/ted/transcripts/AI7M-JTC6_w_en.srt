1
0:00:13.531,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, robots.

2
0:00:15.392,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Robots can be programmed

3
0:00:16.83,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to do the same task millions of times with minimal error,

4
0:00:20.545,000 --> 0:00:22,000
something very difficult for us, right?

5
0:00:23.083,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And it can be very impressive to watch them at work.

6
0:00:26.268,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Look at them.

7
0:00:27.548,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I could watch them for hours.

8
0:00:30.108,000 --> 0:00:31,000
No?

9
0:00:31.431,000 --> 0:00:33,000
What is less impressive

10
0:00:33.662,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is that if you take these robots out of the factories,

11
0:00:36.619,000 --> 0:00:4,000
where the environments are not perfectly known and measured like here,

12
0:00:41.023,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to do even a simple task which doesn't require much precision,

13
0:00:45.325,000 --> 0:00:46,000
this is what can happen.

14
0:00:46.96,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I mean, opening a door, you don't require much precision.

15
0:00:49.713,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:50.767,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Or a small error in the measurements,

17
0:00:53.245,000 --> 0:00:54,000
he misses the valve, and that's it --

18
0:00:55.095,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

19
0:00:56.389,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with no way of recovering, most of the time.

20
0:00:59.561,000 --> 0:01:,000
So why is that?

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Well, for many years,

22
0:01:03.158,000 --> 0:01:06,000
robots have been designed to emphasize speed and precision,

23
0:01:06.482,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and this translates into a very specific architecture.

24
0:01:09.468,000 --> 0:01:1,000
If you take a robot arm,

25
0:01:10.643,000 --> 0:01:12,000
it's a very well-defined set of rigid links

26
0:01:13.426,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and motors, what we call actuators,

27
0:01:15.509,000 --> 0:01:16,000
they move the links about the joints.

28
0:01:17.303,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In this robotic structure,

29
0:01:18.624,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you have to perfectly measure your environment,

30
0:01:20.865,000 --> 0:01:21,000
so what is around,

31
0:01:22.786,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and you have to perfectly program every movement

32
0:01:25.449,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of the robot joints,

33
0:01:27.608,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because a small error can generate a very large fault,

34
0:01:30.894,000 --> 0:01:33,000
so you can damage something or you can get your robot damaged

35
0:01:33.931,000 --> 0:01:34,000
if something is harder.

36
0:01:36.107,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So let's talk about them a moment.

37
0:01:38.336,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And don't think about the brains of these robots

38
0:01:41.583,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or how carefully we program them,

39
0:01:44.352,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but rather look at their bodies.

40
0:01:46.606,000 --> 0:01:48,000
There is obviously something wrong with it,

41
0:01:49.509,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because what makes a robot precise and strong

42
0:01:52.66,000 --> 0:01:56,000
also makes them ridiculously dangerous and ineffective in the real world,

43
0:01:57.073,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because their body cannot deform

44
0:01:59.082,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or better adjust to the interaction with the real world.

45
0:02:03.226,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So think about the opposite approach,

46
0:02:06.368,000 --> 0:02:08,000
being softer than anything else around you.

47
0:02:09.827,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, maybe you think that you're not really able to do anything if you're soft,

48
0:02:14.936,000 --> 0:02:15,000
probably.

49
0:02:16.127,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, nature teaches us the opposite.

50
0:02:19.001,000 --> 0:02:21,000
For example, at the bottom of the ocean,

51
0:02:21.056,000 --> 0:02:23,000
under thousands of pounds of hydrostatic pressure,

52
0:02:23.516,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a completely soft animal

53
0:02:25.968,000 --> 0:02:28,000
can move and interact with a much stiffer object than him.

54
0:02:29.878,000 --> 0:02:31,000
He walks by carrying around this coconut shell

55
0:02:32.749,000 --> 0:02:34,000
thanks to the flexibility of his tentacles,

56
0:02:35.157,000 --> 0:02:37,000
which serve as both his feet and hands.

57
0:02:38.241,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And apparently, an octopus can also open a jar.

58
0:02:43.883,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's pretty impressive, right?

59
0:02:47.918,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But clearly, this is not enabled just by the brain of this animal,

60
0:02:52.442,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but also by his body,

61
0:02:54.48,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and it's a clear example, maybe the clearest example,

62
0:02:58.536,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of embodied intelligence,

63
0:03:00.36,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which is a kind of intelligence that all living organisms have.

64
0:03:03.67,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We all have that.

65
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Our body, its shape, material and structure,

66
0:03:09.126,000 --> 0:03:12,000
plays a fundamental role during a physical task,

67
0:03:12.332,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because we can conform to our environment

68
0:03:17.969,000 --> 0:03:19,000
so we can succeed in a large variety of situations

69
0:03:20.397,000 --> 0:03:22,000
without much planning or calculations ahead.

70
0:03:23.414,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So why don't we put some of this embodied intelligence

71
0:03:26.153,000 --> 0:03:27,000
into our robotic machines,

72
0:03:27.732,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to release them from relying on excessive work

73
0:03:30.105,000 --> 0:03:32,000
on computation and sensing?

74
0:03:33.097,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Well, to do that, we can follow the strategy of nature,

75
0:03:35.771,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because with evolution, she's done a pretty good job

76
0:03:38.407,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in designing machines for environment interaction.

77
0:03:42.927,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And it's easy to notice that nature uses soft material frequently

78
0:03:47.445,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and stiff material sparingly.

79
0:03:49.764,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this is what is done in this new field of robotics,

80
0:03:53.58,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which is called "soft robotics,"

81
0:03:55.904,000 --> 0:03:58,000
in which the main objective is not to make super-precise machines,

82
0:03:59.664,000 --> 0:04:,000
because we've already got them,

83
0:04:01.625,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but to make robots able to face unexpected situations in the real world,

84
0:04:06.569,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so able to go out there.

85
0:04:08.15,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And what makes a robot soft is first of all its compliant body,

86
0:04:11.698,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which is made of materials or structures that can undergo very large deformations,

87
0:04:17.253,000 --> 0:04:18,000
so no more rigid links,

88
0:04:19.108,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and secondly, to move them, we use what we call distributed actuation,

89
0:04:22.68,000 --> 0:04:27,000
so we have to control continuously the shape of this very deformable body,

90
0:04:27.736,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which has the effect of having a lot of links and joints,

91
0:04:31.058,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but we don't have any stiff structure at all.

92
0:04:33.705,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So you can imagine that building a soft robot is a very different process

93
0:04:37.159,000 --> 0:04:39,000
than stiff robotics, where you have links, gears, screws

94
0:04:40.063,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that you must combine in a very defined way.

95
0:04:42.948,000 --> 0:04:45,000
In soft robots, you just build your actuator from scratch

96
0:04:46.497,000 --> 0:04:47,000
most of the time,

97
0:04:47.672,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but you shape your flexible material

98
0:04:50.078,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to the form that responds to a certain input.

99
0:04:53.054,000 --> 0:04:55,000
For example, here, you can just deform a structure

100
0:04:55.536,000 --> 0:04:57,000
doing a fairly complex shape

101
0:04:58.031,000 --> 0:05:01,000
if you think about doing the same with rigid links and joints,

102
0:05:01.333,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and here, what you use is just one input,

103
0:05:03.69,000 --> 0:05:04,000
such as air pressure.

104
0:05:05.869,000 --> 0:05:08,000
OK, but let's see some cool examples of soft robots.

105
0:05:09.765,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Here is a little cute guy developed at Harvard University,

106
0:05:14.336,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and he walks thanks to waves of pressure applied along its body,

107
0:05:18.853,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and thanks to the flexibility, he can also sneak under a low bridge,

108
0:05:22.163,000 --> 0:05:23,000
keep walking,

109
0:05:23.338,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and then keep walking a little bit different afterwards.

110
0:05:27.345,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And it's a very preliminary prototype,

111
0:05:29.6,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but they also built a more robust version with power on board

112
0:05:33.3,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that can actually be sent out in the world and face real-world interactions

113
0:05:38.771,000 --> 0:05:39,000
like a car passing it over it ...

114
0:05:42.09,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and keep working.

115
0:05:44.056,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's cute.

116
0:05:45.231,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:46.676,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Or a robotic fish, which swims like a real fish does in water

118
0:05:50.564,000 --> 0:05:53,000
simply because it has a soft tail with distributed actuation

119
0:05:53.772,000 --> 0:05:54,000
using still air pressure.

120
0:05:55.954,000 --> 0:05:56,000
That was from MIT,

121
0:05:57.336,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and of course, we have a robotic octopus.

122
0:06:00.165,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This was actually one of the first projects

123
0:06:02.268,000 --> 0:06:04,000
developed in this new field of soft robots.

124
0:06:04.418,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Here, you see the artificial tentacle,

125
0:06:06.328,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but they actually built an entire machine with several tentacles

126
0:06:11.031,000 --> 0:06:13,000
they could just throw in the water,

127
0:06:13.666,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and you see that it can kind of go around and do submarine exploration

128
0:06:17.983,000 --> 0:06:2,000
in a different way than rigid robots would do.

129
0:06:21.31,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But this is very important for delicate environments, such as coral reefs.

130
0:06:24.994,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Let's go back to the ground.

131
0:06:26.414,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Here, you see the view

132
0:06:27.628,000 --> 0:06:31,000
from a growing robot developed by my colleagues in Stanford.

133
0:06:31.8,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You see the camera fixed on top.

134
0:06:33.674,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And this robot is particular,

135
0:06:35.136,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because using air pressure, it grows from the tip,

136
0:06:37.576,000 --> 0:06:4,000
while the rest of the body stays in firm contact with the environment.

137
0:06:41.316,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And this is inspired by plants, not animals,

138
0:06:44.058,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which grows via the material in a similar manner

139
0:06:47.397,000 --> 0:06:49,000
so it can face a pretty large variety of situations.

140
0:06:51.043,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But I'm a biomedical engineer,

141
0:06:52.735,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and perhaps the application I like the most

142
0:06:55.028,000 --> 0:06:56,000
is in the medical field,

143
0:06:56.505,000 --> 0:07:,000
and it's very difficult to imagine a closer interaction with the human body

144
0:07:01.37,000 --> 0:07:02,000
than actually going inside the body,

145
0:07:03.313,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for example, to perform a minimally invasive procedure.

146
0:07:06.958,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And here, robots can be very helpful with the surgeon,

147
0:07:10.384,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because they must enter the body

148
0:07:12.157,000 --> 0:07:14,000
using small holes and straight instruments,

149
0:07:14.808,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and these instruments must interact with very delicate structures

150
0:07:18.342,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in a very uncertain environment,

151
0:07:20.414,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and this must be done safely.

152
0:07:22.113,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Also bringing the camera inside the body,

153
0:07:24.249,000 --> 0:07:27,000
so bringing the eyes of the surgeon inside the surgical field

154
0:07:27.891,000 --> 0:07:29,000
can be very challenging if you use a rigid stick,

155
0:07:30.266,000 --> 0:07:31,000
like a classic endoscope.

156
0:07:32.517,000 --> 0:07:34,000
With my previous research group in Europe,

157
0:07:35.13,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we developed this soft camera robot for surgery,

158
0:07:37.75,000 --> 0:07:4,000
which is very different from a classic endoscope,

159
0:07:41.542,000 --> 0:07:44,000
which can move thanks to the flexibility of the module

160
0:07:44.67,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that can bend in every direction and also elongate.

161
0:07:49.582,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And this was actually used by surgeons to see what they were doing

162
0:07:52.716,000 --> 0:07:54,000
with other instruments from different points of view,

163
0:07:55.478,000 --> 0:07:58,000
without caring that much about what was touched around.

164
0:07:59.247,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And here you see the soft robot in action,

165
0:08:03.014,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and it just goes inside.

166
0:08:05.856,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is a body simulator, not a real human body.

167
0:08:09.149,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It goes around.

168
0:08:10.324,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You have a light, because usually,

169
0:08:12.022,000 --> 0:08:15,000
you don't have too many lights inside your body.

170
0:08:15.167,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We hope.

171
0:08:16.364,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Laughter)

172
0:08:19.39,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But sometimes, a surgical procedure can even be done using a single needle,

173
0:08:24.112,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and in Stanford now, we are working on a very flexible needle,

174
0:08:28.183,000 --> 0:08:3,000
kind of a very tiny soft robot

175
0:08:30.859,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which is mechanically designed to use the interaction with the tissues

176
0:08:34.177,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and steer around inside a solid organ.

177
0:08:36.431,000 --> 0:08:4,000
This makes it possible to reach many different targets, such as tumors,

178
0:08:40.535,000 --> 0:08:41,000
deep inside a solid organ

179
0:08:42.257,000 --> 0:08:44,000
by using one single insertion point.

180
0:08:44.606,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And you can even steer around the structure that you want to avoid

181
0:08:48.669,000 --> 0:08:49,000
on the way to the target.

182
0:08:51.377,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So clearly, this is a pretty exciting time for robotics.

183
0:08:54.706,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We have robots that have to deal with soft structures,

184
0:08:57.883,000 --> 0:08:59,000
so this poses new and very challenging questions

185
0:09:00.492,000 --> 0:09:01,000
for the robotics community,

186
0:09:01.873,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and indeed, we are just starting to learn how to control,

187
0:09:04.572,000 --> 0:09:07,000
how to put sensors on these very flexible structures.

188
0:09:07.6,000 --> 0:09:09,000
But of course, we are not even close to what nature figured out

189
0:09:10.584,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in millions of years of evolution.

190
0:09:12.802,000 --> 0:09:14,000
But one thing I know for sure:

191
0:09:14.93,000 --> 0:09:16,000
robots will be softer and safer,

192
0:09:17.47,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and they will be out there helping people.

193
0:09:20.809,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Thank you.

194
0:09:21.984,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.952,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'm a meteorologist by degree,

2
0:00:14.738,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have a bachelor's, master's and PhD in physical meteorology,

3
0:00:17.905,000 --> 0:00:19,000
so I'm a meteorologist, card carrying.

4
0:00:20.444,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And so with that comes four questions, always.

5
0:00:25.167,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This is one prediction I will always get right.

6
0:00:27.747,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.627,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And those questions are,

8
0:00:31.699,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Marshall, what channel are you on?"

9
0:00:34.207,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:36.048,000 --> 0:00:38,000
"Dr. Shepherd, what's the weather going to be tomorrow?"

11
0:00:38.913,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:39.937,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And oh, I love this one:

13
0:00:41.548,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"My daughter is getting married next September, it's an outdoor wedding.

14
0:00:45.017,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Is it going to rain?"

15
0:00:46.251,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:47.657,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Not kidding, I get those, and I don't know the answer to that,

17
0:00:50.586,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the science isn't there.

18
0:00:53.185,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But the one I get a lot these days is,

19
0:00:56.112,000 --> 0:01:,000
"Dr. Shepherd, do you believe in climate change?"

20
0:01:01.331,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"Do you believe in global warming?"

21
0:01:04.807,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, I have to gather myself every time I get that question.

22
0:01:08.53,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Because it's an ill-posed question --

23
0:01:10.316,000 --> 0:01:12,000
science isn't a belief system.

24
0:01:12.911,000 --> 0:01:15,000
My son, he's 10 -- he believes in the tooth fairy.

25
0:01:16.998,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And he needs to get over that, because I'm losing dollars, fast.

26
0:01:20.411,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:22.752,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But he believes in the tooth fairy.

28
0:01:24.601,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But consider this.

29
0:01:27.361,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Bank of America building, there, in Atlanta.

30
0:01:29.933,000 --> 0:01:31,000
You never hear anyone say,

31
0:01:32.512,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"Do you believe, if you go to the top of that building

32
0:01:35.115,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and throw a ball off, it's going to fall?"

33
0:01:37.807,000 --> 0:01:4,000
You never hear that, because gravity is a thing.

34
0:01:42.427,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So why don't we hear the question,

35
0:01:44.736,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"Do you believe in gravity?"

36
0:01:46.565,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But of course, we hear the question,

37
0:01:48.447,000 --> 0:01:5,000
"Do you believe in global warming?"

38
0:01:52.161,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Well, consider these facts.

39
0:01:55.799,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The American Association for the Advancement of Science, AAAS,

40
0:01:58.919,000 --> 0:02:,000
one of the leading organizations in science,

41
0:02:01.792,000 --> 0:02:04,000
queried scientists and the public on different science topics.

42
0:02:05.736,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Here are some of them:

43
0:02:06.959,000 --> 0:02:09,000
genetically modified food, animal research, human evolution.

44
0:02:11.709,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And look at what the scientists say about those,

45
0:02:14.233,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the people that actually study those topics, in red,

46
0:02:16.971,000 --> 0:02:18,000
versus the gray, what the public thinks.

47
0:02:19.622,000 --> 0:02:2,000
How did we get there?

48
0:02:21.982,000 --> 0:02:22,000
How did we get there?

49
0:02:24.743,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That scientists and the public are so far apart on these science issues.

50
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well, I'll come a little bit closer to home for me,

51
0:02:31.68,000 --> 0:02:32,000
climate change.

52
0:02:33.339,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Eighty-seven percent of scientists

53
0:02:36.255,000 --> 0:02:4,000
believe that humans are contributing to climate change.

54
0:02:41.45,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But only 50 percent of the public?

55
0:02:45.323,000 --> 0:02:46,000
How did we get there?

56
0:02:46.728,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So it begs the question,

57
0:02:48.055,000 --> 0:02:52,000
what shapes perceptions about science?

58
0:02:54.655,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It's an interesting question

59
0:02:56.069,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and one that I've been thinking about quite a bit.

60
0:03:00.434,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I think that one thing that shapes perceptions in the public, about science,

61
0:03:05.124,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is belief systems and biases.

62
0:03:08.339,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Belief systems and biases.

63
0:03:09.799,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Go with me for a moment.

64
0:03:12.005,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Because I want to talk about three elements of that:

65
0:03:14.482,000 --> 0:03:17,000
confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger effect

66
0:03:18.179,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and cognitive dissonance.

67
0:03:20.068,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now, these sound like big, fancy, academic terms, and they are.

68
0:03:24.585,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But when I describe them, you're going to be like, "Oh!

69
0:03:28.236,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I recognize that; I even know somebody that does that."

70
0:03:33.355,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Confirmation bias.

71
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Finding evidence that supports what we already believe.

72
0:03:40.756,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Now, we're probably all a little bit guilty of that at times.

73
0:03:45.427,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Take a look at this.

74
0:03:46.99,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I'm on Twitter.

75
0:03:48.331,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And often, when it snows,

76
0:03:50.759,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'll get this tweet back to me.

77
0:03:52.672,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:55.172,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"Hey, Dr. Shepherd, I have 20 inches of global warming in my yard,

79
0:03:58.925,000 --> 0:04:,000
what are you guys talking about, climate change?"

80
0:04:01.933,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I get that tweet a lot, actually.

81
0:04:04.909,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's a cute tweet, it makes me chuckle as well.

82
0:04:07.87,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But it's oh, so fundamentally scientifically flawed.

83
0:04:12.292,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Because it illustrates

84
0:04:13.874,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that the person tweeting doesn't understand

85
0:04:15.919,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the difference between weather and climate.

86
0:04:19.466,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I often say, weather is your mood

87
0:04:23.038,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and climate is your personality.

88
0:04:26.981,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Think about that.

89
0:04:28.156,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Weather is your mood, climate is your personality.

90
0:04:30.624,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Your mood today doesn't necessarily tell me anything about your personality,

91
0:04:34.633,000 --> 0:04:36,000
nor does a cold day tell me anything about climate change,

92
0:04:37.427,000 --> 0:04:39,000
or a hot day, for that matter.

93
0:04:41.974,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Dunning-Kruger.

94
0:04:43.616,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Two scholars from Cornell came up with the Dunning-Kruger effect.

95
0:04:46.695,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If you go look up the peer-reviewed paper for this,

96
0:04:49.1,000 --> 0:04:51,000
you will see all kinds of fancy terminology:

97
0:04:51.593,000 --> 0:04:54,000
it's an illusory superiority complex, thinking we know things.

98
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In other words, people think they know more than they do.

99
0:04:59.553,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Or they underestimate what they don't know.

100
0:05:02.847,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And then, there's cognitive dissonance.

101
0:05:06.831,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Cognitive dissonance is interesting.

102
0:05:09.538,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We just recently had Groundhog Day, right?

103
0:05:13.132,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Now, there's no better definition of cognitive dissonance

104
0:05:15.877,000 --> 0:05:18,000
than intelligent people asking me if a rodent's forecast is accurate.

105
0:05:19.419,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:22.174,000 --> 0:05:24,000
But I get that, all of the time.

107
0:05:24.745,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:26.023,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But I also hear about the Farmer's Almanac.

109
0:05:29.65,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We grew up on the Farmer's Almanac, people are familiar with it.

110
0:05:34.259,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The problem is, it's only about 37 percent accurate,

111
0:05:37.695,000 --> 0:05:4,000
according to studies at Penn State University.

112
0:05:43.458,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But we're in an era of science

113
0:05:47.053,000 --> 0:05:49,000
where we actually can forecast the weather.

114
0:05:49.141,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And believe it or not, and I know some of you are like, "Yeah, right,"

115
0:05:52.586,000 --> 0:05:55,000
we're about 90 percent accurate, or more, with weather forecast.

116
0:05:55.633,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You just tend to remember the occasional miss, you do.

117
0:05:58.281,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:02.263,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger and cognitive dissonance.

119
0:06:05.692,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I think those shape biases and perceptions that people have about science.

120
0:06:11.625,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But then, there's literacy and misinformation

121
0:06:13.798,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that keep us boxed in, as well.

122
0:06:17.911,000 --> 0:06:19,000
During the hurricane season of 2017,

123
0:06:20.419,000 --> 0:06:24,000
media outlets had to actually assign reporters

124
0:06:24.656,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to dismiss fake information about the weather forecast.

125
0:06:30.204,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's the era that we're in.

126
0:06:32.644,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I deal with this all the time in social media.

127
0:06:35.105,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Someone will tweet a forecast --

128
0:06:36.716,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that's a forecast for Hurricane Irma, but here's the problem:

129
0:06:39.676,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it didn't come from the Hurricane Center.

130
0:06:42.608,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But people were tweeting and sharing this; it went viral.

131
0:06:45.419,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It didn't come from the National Hurricane Center at all.

132
0:06:50.363,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So I spent 12 years of my career at NASA

133
0:06:52.871,000 --> 0:06:54,000
before coming to the University of Georgia,

134
0:06:54.927,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and I chair their Earth Science Advisory Committee,

135
0:06:57.466,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I was just up there last week in DC.

136
0:06:59.307,000 --> 0:07:,000
And I saw some really interesting things.

137
0:07:01.318,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Here's a NASA model and science data from satellite

138
0:07:04.58,000 --> 0:07:06,000
showing the 2017 hurricane season.

139
0:07:06.887,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You see Hurricane Harvey there?

140
0:07:09.649,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Look at all the dust coming off of Africa.

141
0:07:12.617,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Look at the wildfires up in northwest US and in western Canada.

142
0:07:17.628,000 --> 0:07:18,000
There comes Hurricane Irma.

143
0:07:20.923,000 --> 0:07:22,000
This is fascinating to me.

144
0:07:23.688,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But admittedly, I'm a weather geek.

145
0:07:26.982,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But more importantly, it illustrates that we have the technology

146
0:07:30.482,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to not only observe the weather and climate system,

147
0:07:33.085,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but predict it.

148
0:07:34.625,000 --> 0:07:35,000
There's scientific understanding,

149
0:07:36.411,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so there's no need for some of those perceptions and biases

150
0:07:39.522,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that we've been talking about.

151
0:07:41.116,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We have knowledge.

152
0:07:42.339,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But think about this ...

153
0:07:43.601,000 --> 0:07:46,000
This is Houston, Texas, after Hurricane Harvey.

154
0:07:47.736,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, I write a contribution for "Forbes" magazine periodically,

155
0:07:50.733,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and I wrote an article a week before Hurricane Harvey made landfall, saying,

156
0:07:55.288,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"There's probably going to be 40 to 50 inches of rainfall."

157
0:07:58.776,000 --> 0:08:,000
I wrote that a week before it happened.

158
0:08:01.284,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But yet, when you talk to people in Houston,

159
0:08:03.434,000 --> 0:08:06,000
people are saying, "We had no idea it was going to be this bad."

160
0:08:07.093,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I'm just...

161
0:08:08.292,000 --> 0:08:09,000
(Sigh)

162
0:08:09.497,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:10.657,000 --> 0:08:11,000
A week before.

164
0:08:11.855,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But --

165
0:08:13.069,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I know, it's amusing, but the reality is,

166
0:08:15.591,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we all struggle with perceiving something outside of our experience level.

167
0:08:21.759,000 --> 0:08:23,000
People in Houston get rain all of the time,

168
0:08:24.053,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they flood all of the time.

169
0:08:26.513,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But they've never experienced that.

170
0:08:29.561,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Houston gets about 34 inches of rainfall for the entire year.

171
0:08:33.974,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They got 50 inches in three days.

172
0:08:37.3,000 --> 0:08:4,000
That's an anomaly event, that's outside of the normal.

173
0:08:42.188,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So belief systems and biases, literacy and misinformation.

174
0:08:45.053,000 --> 0:08:48,000
How do we step out of the boxes that are cornering our perceptions?

175
0:08:50.633,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well we don't even have to go to Houston, we can come very close to home.

176
0:08:54.39,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

177
0:08:55.595,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Remember "Snowpocalypse?"

178
0:08:57.532,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

179
0:08:59.357,000 --> 0:09:,000
Snowmageddon?

180
0:09:00.881,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Snowzilla?

181
0:09:02.056,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Whatever you want to call it.

182
0:09:04.109,000 --> 0:09:06,000
All two inches of it.

183
0:09:06.45,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:09.077,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Two inches of snow shut the city of Atlanta down.

185
0:09:11.966,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:14.982,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But the reality is, we were in a winter storm watch,

187
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we went to a winter weather advisory,

188
0:09:21.919,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and a lot of people perceived that as being a downgrade,

189
0:09:24.593,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"Oh, it's not going to be as bad."

190
0:09:26.284,000 --> 0:09:29,000
When in fact, the perception was that it was not going to be as bad,

191
0:09:29.538,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but it was actually an upgrade.

192
0:09:31.196,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Things were getting worse as the models were coming in.

193
0:09:33.807,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So that's an example of how we get boxed in by our perceptions.

194
0:09:38.165,000 --> 0:09:39,000
So, the question becomes,

195
0:09:40.165,000 --> 0:09:43,000
how do we expand our radius?

196
0:09:45.823,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The area of a circle is "pi r squared".

197
0:09:47.757,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We increase the radius, we increase the area.

198
0:09:50.024,000 --> 0:09:53,000
How do we expand our radius of understanding about science?

199
0:09:54.593,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Here are my thoughts.

200
0:09:56.72,000 --> 0:09:59,000
You take inventory of your own biases.

201
0:09:59.815,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I'm challenging you all to do that.

202
0:10:01.855,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Take an inventory of your own biases.

203
0:10:04.903,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Where do they come from?

204
0:10:06.212,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Your upbringing, your political perspective, your faith --

205
0:10:09.61,000 --> 0:10:11,000
what shapes your own biases?

206
0:10:13.982,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Then, evaluate your sources --

207
0:10:15.443,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where do you get your information on science?

208
0:10:18.553,000 --> 0:10:19,000
What do you read, what do you listen to,

209
0:10:20.553,000 --> 0:10:22,000
to consume your information on science?

210
0:10:23.022,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And then, it's important to speak out.

211
0:10:25.792,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Talk about how you evaluated your biases and evaluated your sources.

212
0:10:29.934,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I want you to listen to this little 40-second clip

213
0:10:32.728,000 --> 0:10:36,000
from one of the top TV meteorologists in the US, Greg Fishel,

214
0:10:37.53,000 --> 0:10:38,000
in the Raleigh, Durham area.

215
0:10:39.077,000 --> 0:10:4,000
He's revered in that region.

216
0:10:40.776,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But he was a climate skeptic.

217
0:10:42.205,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But listen to what he says about speaking out.

218
0:10:44.466,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Greg Fishel: The mistake I was making

219
0:10:46.226,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and didn't realize until very recently,

220
0:10:48.204,000 --> 0:10:5,000
was that I was only looking for information

221
0:10:50.821,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to support what I already thought,

222
0:10:53.706,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and was not interested in listening to anything contrary.

223
0:10:58.559,000 --> 0:11:,000
And so I woke up one morning,

224
0:11:00.654,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and there was this question in my mind,

225
0:11:04.918,000 --> 0:11:06,000
"Greg, are you engaging in confirmation bias?

226
0:11:07.546,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Are you only looking for information to support what you already think?"

227
0:11:12.069,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And if I was honest with myself, and I tried to be,

228
0:11:14.522,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I admitted that was going on.

229
0:11:17.269,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And so the more I talked to scientists

230
0:11:19.807,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and read peer-reviewed literature

231
0:11:21.889,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and tried to conduct myself the way I'd been taught to conduct myself

232
0:11:26.625,000 --> 0:11:28,000
at Penn State when I was a student,

233
0:11:29.665,000 --> 0:11:31,000
it became very difficult for me to make the argument

234
0:11:32.381,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that we weren't at least having some effect.

235
0:11:34.465,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Maybe there was still a doubt as to how much,

236
0:11:36.925,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but to say "nothing" was not a responsible thing for me to do

237
0:11:41.664,000 --> 0:11:42,000
as a scientist or a person.

238
0:11:45.387,000 --> 0:11:48,000
JMS: Greg Fishel just talked about expanding his radius

239
0:11:49.272,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of understanding of science.

240
0:11:50.919,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And when we expand our radius,

241
0:11:52.998,000 --> 0:11:55,000
it's not about making a better future,

242
0:11:56.22,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but it's about preserving life as we know it.

243
0:12:00.18,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So as we think about expanding our own radius in understanding science,

244
0:12:06.292,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it's critical for Athens, Georgia, for Atlanta, Georgia,

245
0:12:09.688,000 --> 0:12:11,000
for the state of Georgia, and for the world.

246
0:12:12.857,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So expand your radius.

247
0:12:14.952,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Thank you.

248
0:12:16.159,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
When most people think about the beginnings

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and the virus that causes it, HIV.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
from chimpanzees, where the virus originated, into humans who hunt these apes.

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
This photo was taken before the Great Depression

8
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in Brazzaville, Congo.

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
At this time, there were thousands of individuals,

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we think, that were infected with HIV.

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So I have a couple of really important questions for you.

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
If this virus was in thousands

13
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of individuals at this point,

14
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
why was it the case that it took us until 1984

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to be able to discover this virus?

16
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
OK now, more importantly,

17
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
had we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s,

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
had we seen this disease, had we understood

19
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
exactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved?

21
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
In fact, this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of

22
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
viruses come from animals.

23
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses

24
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from animals into human populations.

25
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human.

26
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Nevertheless, we spend the vast majority

27
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid,

28
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings,

29
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that are going to be very very difficult to address --

30
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
as we've seen in the case of HIV.

31
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So during the last 15 years,

32
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here --

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
what I've labeled "viral chatter," which was a term coined

34
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
by my mentor Don Burke.

35
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This is the idea that we can study the sort of

36
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
pinging of these viruses into human populations,

37
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the movement of these agents over into humans;

38
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and by capturing this moment,

39
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early.

40
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
OK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you

41
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
some pictures now from the field.

42
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is a picture of a central African hunter.

43
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's actually a fairly common picture.

44
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
One of the things I want you to note from it

45
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact.

46
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This was absolutely key for us. This is a

47
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
very intimate form of connection.

48
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So if we're going to study viral chatter, we need to

49
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals.

50
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And so we've been studying people like this individual.

51
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We collect blood from them, other specimens.

52
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans.

53
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things

54
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
early on, as they're moving over into human populations.

55
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And the basic objective of this work is not to just

56
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
go out once and look at these individuals,

57
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but to establish thousands of individuals

58
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
in these populations that we would monitor

59
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
continuously on a regular basis.

60
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
When they were sick, we would collect specimens from them.

61
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We would actually enlist them --

62
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals.

63
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We give them these little pieces of filter paper.

64
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
When they sample from animals,

65
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
they collect the blood on the filter paper

66
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals --

67
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the ones that are actually being hunted.

68
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Video) Narrator: Deep in a remote region of Cameroon,

69
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
two hunters stalk their prey.

70
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Their names are Patrice and Patee.

71
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They're searching for bush meat;

72
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
forest animals they can kill to feed their families.

73
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting

74
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
in the forest around their homes.

75
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up

76
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys,

77
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
rodents -- anything they can, really.

78
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing.

79
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The animals are simply gone.

80
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We stop for a drink of water.

81
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Then there is a rustle in the brush.

82
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
A group of hunters approach,

83
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
their packs loaded with wild game.

84
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
There's at least three viruses

85
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that you know about, which are in this particular monkey.

86
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Nathan Wolfe: This species, yeah. And there's many many more pathogens

87
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that are present in these animals.

88
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
These individuals are at specific risk,

89
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
particularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission

90
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and possibly infection with novel viruses.

91
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Narrator: As the hunters display their kills, something surprising happens.

92
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood.

93
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses,

94
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up.

95
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
NW: So this is from this animal right here,

96
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Greater Spot-Nosed Guenon.

97
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least,

98
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
at a minimum, been through our basic health education

99
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
about the risks associated with these activities,

100
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
which presumably, from our perspective,

101
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
gives them the ability to decrease their own risk,

102
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
and then obviously the risk to their families,

103
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the village, the country, and the world.

104
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
NW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment

105
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game.

106
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.

107
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I'm going to be talking about this.

108
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
When your children and grandchildren

109
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
sort of pose questions to you about this period of time,

110
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
one of the things they're gonna ask you,

111
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives,

112
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
some of the most valuable and endangered species

113
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
on our planet, to go extinct because we

114
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
weren't able to address some of the issues

115
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
of poverty in these parts of the world.

116
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this.

117
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
They're also going to ask you the question

118
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered

119
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
into the human population,

120
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this,

121
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
why did we let these behaviors continue?

122
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Why did we not find some other solution to this?

123
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They're going to say, in regions of profound

124
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
instability throughout the world,

125
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
where you have intense poverty, where populations are growing

126
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and you don't have sustainable resources like this,

127
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
this is going to lead to food insecurity.

128
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But they're also going to ask you probably a different question.

129
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves,

130
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.

131
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder --

132
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
this is the individual that hunted the monkey

133
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
from the last picture that I showed you.

134
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
OK, take a look at his shirt.

135
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You know, take a look at his face.

136
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Bush meat is one of the central crises,

137
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
which is occurring in our population right now,

138
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in humanity, on this planet.

139
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But it can't be the fault of somebody like this.

140
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
OK? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone.

141
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
There's no easy solutions,

142
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem

143
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
at our own peril.

144
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, in 1998, along with my mentors

145
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole,

146
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we went to actually start this work

147
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in Central Africa, to work with hunters

148
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
in this part of the world.

149
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow,

150
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and I was really tasked with setting this up.

151
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
So I said to myself, "OK, great --

152
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these

153
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
different locations. It's going to be wonderful."

154
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites;

155
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I figured, no problem.

156
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Needless to say, I was drastically wrong.

158
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This is challenging work to do.

159
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Fortunately, I had and continue to have

160
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team,

161
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and that's the only way that this work can really occur.

162
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We have a whole range of challenges about this work.

163
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
One of them is just obtaining trust

164
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
from individuals that we work with in the field.

165
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu.

166
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with.

167
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French,

168
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying.

169
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Paul worked for years

170
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
on the Cameroonian national radio and television,

171
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.

172
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could

173
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
be a great communicator.

174
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
When we would get to these rural villages, though, what we found out

175
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is that no one had television,

176
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
so they wouldn't recognize his face.

177
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But -- when he began to speak

178
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
they would actually recognize his voice from the radio.

179
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And this was somebody who had incredible

180
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
potential to spread aspects of our message,

181
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation

182
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
or health prevention.

183
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from

184
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
one of these very rural sites,

185
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with specimens from 200 individuals

186
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.

187
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I like to show this shot -- this is

188
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Ubald Tamoufe, who's the lead

189
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
investigator in our Cameroon site.

190
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo

191
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
because of course you can't see his face.

192
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But the reason I like to show the shot

193
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.

194
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Which -- which he did, which he did.

196
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Just a few quick before and after shots.

197
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This was our laboratory before.

198
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This is what it looks like now.

199
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Early on, in order to ship our specimens,

200
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go

201
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
to the breweries -- beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.

202
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.

203
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa -- it might be.

204
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And here's a shot of me, this is the before shot of me.

205
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

206
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
No comment.

207
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So what happened? So during the 10 years that we've been doing

208
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
this work, we actually surprised ourselves.

209
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We made a number of discoveries.

210
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And what we've found is that if you look in the right place,

211
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you can actually monitor the flow

212
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of these viruses into human populations.

213
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
That gave us a tremendous amount of hope.

214
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals,

215
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
including new viruses in the same group

216
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
as HIV -- so, brand new retroviruses.

217
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the

218
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
human population -- it's something we should be aware of.

219
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's something we should be following. It's not something

220
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that we should be surprised by.

221
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Needless to say in the past

222
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
these viruses entering into these rural communities

223
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
might very well have gone extinct.

224
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas.

225
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And critically, what happens in central Africa

226
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
doesn't stay in Central Africa.

227
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So, once we discovered that it was really possible

228
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that we could actually do this monitoring,

229
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we decided to move this from research, to

230
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.

231
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Through generous support and partnership

232
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation,

233
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative

234
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and begin work in four different sites

235
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in Africa and Asia.

236
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Needless to say, different populations from different parts of the world

237
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
have different sorts of contact.

238
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa.

239
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's also working in live animal markets --

240
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where

241
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
SARS emerged in Asia.

242
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But really, this is just the beginning from our perspective.

243
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Our objective right now, in addition to

244
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
deploying to these sites and getting everything moving,

245
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is to identify new partners

246
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
because we feel like this effort needs to be extended

247
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots --

248
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net

249
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
so that we can catch these things, ideally,

250
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
before they make it to blood banks,

251
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
sexual networks, airplanes. And that's really our objective.

252
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
There was a time not very long ago

253
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
when the discovery of unknown organisms

254
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
was something that held incredible awe for us.

255
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves,

256
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and thought about ourselves.

257
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Many people, I think, on our planet right now

258
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
despair, and they think

259
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things.

260
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I'm going tell you right now: please don't despair.

261
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
If an intelligent extra-terrestrial

262
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet,

263
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
27 out of 30 of these volumes

264
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
would be devoted to bacteria and virus,

265
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
with just a few of the volumes left

266
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
for plants, fungus and animals,

267
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
humans being a footnote;

268
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless.

269
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This is honestly the most exciting period

270
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.

271
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The dominant things that exist here

272
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we know almost nothing about.

273
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
And yet finally, we have the tools, which will allow us to actually explore that world

274
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and understand them.

275
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Thank you very much.

276
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

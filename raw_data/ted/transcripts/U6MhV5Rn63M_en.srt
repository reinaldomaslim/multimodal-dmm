1
0:00:16.794,000 --> 0:00:18,000
There are more Chinese restaurants in this country

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined --

3
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
40,000, actually.

4
0:00:24.821,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history,

5
0:00:28.173,000 --> 0:00:29,000
as a matter of fact.

6
0:00:29.376,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant

7
0:00:32.261,000 --> 0:00:34,000
called Yenching Palace in Washington, DC,

8
0:00:34.293,000 --> 0:00:35,000
which unfortunately is closed now,

9
0:00:35.951,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and about to be turned into Walgreen's.

10
0:00:37.84,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And the house where John Wilkes Booth

11
0:00:39.675,000 --> 0:00:41,000
planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln

12
0:00:41.977,000 --> 0:00:44,000
is also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok and Roll,

13
0:00:45.12,000 --> 0:00:46,000
on H Street in Washington.

14
0:00:46.383,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:49.667,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And it's not completely gratuitous,

16
0:00:51.362,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because "wok" and "roll" -- Chinese food and Japanese foods,

17
0:00:54.363,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so it kind of works out.

18
0:00:55.552,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And Americans love their Chinese food so much,

19
0:00:57.798,000 --> 0:00:58,000
they've actually brought it into space.

20
0:00:59.757,000 --> 0:01:02,000
NASA, for example, serves thermostabilized sweet-and-sour pork

21
0:01:03.392,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.

22
0:01:06.675,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, let me present the question to you:

23
0:01:08.93,000 --> 0:01:1,000
If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie,

24
0:01:11.578,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you should ask yourself: how often do you eat apple pie,

25
0:01:14.239,000 --> 0:01:15,000
versus how often do you eat Chinese food?

26
0:01:16.239,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:20.862,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And if you think about it,

28
0:01:23.655,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a lot of the foods that we or Americans think of as Chinese food

29
0:01:28.631,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are barely recognizable to Chinese.

30
0:01:30.79,000 --> 0:01:34,000
For example: beef with broccoli, egg rolls, General Tso's Chicken,

31
0:01:34.853,000 --> 0:01:37,000
fortune cookies, chop suey, the take-out boxes.

32
0:01:37.933,000 --> 0:01:4,000
For example, I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China,

33
0:01:41.105,000 --> 0:01:43,000
gave them to Chinese to see how they would react.

34
0:01:43.557,000 --> 0:01:44,000
[What is this?]

35
0:01:44.848,000 --> 0:01:45,000
[Should I try it?]

36
0:01:46.256,000 --> 0:01:47,000
[Try it!]

37
0:01:50.191,000 --> 0:01:51,000
[What is this called?]

38
0:01:52.08,000 --> 0:01:53,000
[Fortune cookie.]

39
0:01:54.935,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
[There's a piece of paper inside!]

41
0:02:01.059,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:04.754,000 --> 0:02:05,000
[What is this?]

43
0:02:07.516,000 --> 0:02:09,000
[You've won a prize!]

44
0:02:12.104,000 --> 0:02:14,000
[What is this?]

45
0:02:14.289,000 --> 0:02:15,000
[It's a fortune!]

46
0:02:19.326,000 --> 0:02:2,000
[Tasty!]

47
0:02:21.986,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So where are they from?

48
0:02:23.345,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The short answer is, actually, they're from Japan.

49
0:02:26.734,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And in Kyoto, outside, there are still small family-run bakeries

50
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that make fortune cookies, as they did over 100 years ago,

51
0:02:33.69,000 --> 0:02:37,000
30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States.

52
0:02:37.864,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If you see them side by side,

53
0:02:39.511,000 --> 0:02:4,000
there's yellow and brown.

54
0:02:40.814,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste,

55
0:02:43.528,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so they're not as sweet as our version.

56
0:02:45.567,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So how did they get to the US?

57
0:02:47.184,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over,

58
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and a bunch of the bakers introduced them --

59
0:02:52.642,000 --> 0:02:53,000
including at least one in Los Angeles,

60
0:02:54.642,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and one here in San Francisco, called Benkyodo,

61
0:02:57.159,000 --> 0:02:59,000
which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan.

62
0:02:59.329,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Back then, they made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons

63
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that we saw back in Kyoto.

64
0:03:05.933,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The interesting question is:

65
0:03:07.346,000 --> 0:03:1,000
How do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese

66
0:03:10.781,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to being something that is Chinese?

67
0:03:12.528,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Well, we locked up all the Japanese during World War II,

68
0:03:15.675,000 --> 0:03:17,000
including those that made fortune cookies.

69
0:03:17.768,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So that's when the Chinese moved in,

70
0:03:19.595,000 --> 0:03:2,000
saw a market opportunity and took over.

71
0:03:21.555,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:23.205,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So, fortune cookies: invented by the Japanese,

73
0:03:25.591,000 --> 0:03:26,000
popularized by the Chinese,

74
0:03:26.926,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but ultimately consumed by Americans.

75
0:03:28.779,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They're more American than anything else.

76
0:03:30.763,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Another of my favorite dishes:

77
0:03:32.228,000 --> 0:03:35,000
General Tso's Chicken -- which, by the way, in the US Naval Academy

78
0:03:35.409,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is called Admiral Tso's Chicken.

79
0:03:36.961,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:37.991,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I love this dish.

81
0:03:39.167,000 --> 0:03:42,000
The original name of my book was "The Long March of General Tso."

82
0:03:42.252,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And he has marched very far indeed,

83
0:03:43.963,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because he is sweet, he is fried, and he is chicken --

84
0:03:47.03,000 --> 0:03:48,000
all things that Americans love.

85
0:03:48.812,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:50.495,000 --> 0:03:51,000
He has marched so far, actually,

87
0:03:52.063,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that the chef who originally invented the dish

88
0:03:54.252,000 --> 0:03:56,000
doesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.

89
0:03:57.093,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Video: (In Chinese)

90
0:04:05.696,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Audience: (Laughter)

91
0:04:07.579,000 --> 0:04:08,000
He's in Taiwan right now.

92
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
He's retired, deaf and plays a lot of mah–jongg.

93
0:04:11.605,000 --> 0:04:14,000
After I showed him this, he got up,

94
0:04:14.898,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and says, "mòmíngqímiào," which means, "This is all nonsense,"

95
0:04:17.915,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and goes back to play his mah-jongg game during the afternoon.

96
0:04:21.358,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Another dish, one of my favorites: beef with broccoli.

97
0:04:24.894,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable;

98
0:04:28.08,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.

99
0:04:30.825,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s,

100
0:04:33.824,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s.

101
0:04:36.725,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The Chinese have their own version of broccoli, called Chinese broccoli,

102
0:04:40.198,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but they've now discovered American broccoli,

103
0:04:42.641,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and are importing it as a sort of exotic delicacy.

104
0:04:46.55,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I guarantee you, General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life.

105
0:04:50.663,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That was a picture of General Tso.

106
0:04:52.89,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I went to his home town.

107
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This is a billboard that says:

108
0:04:55.637,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."

109
0:04:57.677,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I went looking for chicken.

110
0:04:59.896,000 --> 0:05:,000
Finally found a cow --

111
0:05:01.366,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and did find chicken.

112
0:05:04.136,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Believe it or not, these guys were actually crossing the road.

113
0:05:07.12,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:10.766,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I found a whole bunch of General Tso's relatives

115
0:05:13.276,000 --> 0:05:14,000
who are still in the town.

116
0:05:14.585,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This guy is now five generations removed from the General;

117
0:05:17.372,000 --> 0:05:18,000
this guy is about seven.

118
0:05:18.602,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I showed them the pictures of General Tso Chicken,

119
0:05:21.452,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and they were like,

120
0:05:22.646,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"We don't know this dish. Is this Chinese food?"

121
0:05:24.933,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Because it doesn't look like Chinese food to them.

122
0:05:27.384,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But they weren't surprised I traveled around the world to visit them,

123
0:05:31.664,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because in their eyes he is, after all,

124
0:05:33.902,000 --> 0:05:34,000
a famous Qing dynasty military hero.

125
0:05:35.666,000 --> 0:05:37,000
He played an important role in the Taiping Rebellion,

126
0:05:38.184,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God

127
0:05:40.832,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and baby brother of Jesus Christ.

128
0:05:42.446,000 --> 0:05:44,000
He caused a war that killed 20 million people --

129
0:05:44.76,000 --> 0:05:47,000
still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day.

130
0:05:48.858,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So, you know, I realized when I was there,

131
0:05:51.078,000 --> 0:05:53,000
General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America,

132
0:05:54.079,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in that he's known for chicken and not war.

133
0:05:56.631,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But in China, this guy's actually known for war and not chicken.

134
0:06:00.787,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But the granddaddy of all the Chinese American dishes

135
0:06:03.312,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we probably ought to talk about is chop suey,

136
0:06:06.256,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century.

137
0:06:10.101,000 --> 0:06:11,000
According to the New York Times in 1904,

138
0:06:12.05,000 --> 0:06:14,000
there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town,

139
0:06:14.937,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and "... the city has gone 'chop suey' mad."

140
0:06:17.88,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized

141
0:06:21.597,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that chop suey is actually not known in China,

142
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and as this article points out,

143
0:06:26.101,000 --> 0:06:3,000
"The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey."

144
0:06:30.712,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Back then it was a way to show you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan;

145
0:06:34.121,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a guy who wanted to impress a girl could take her on a chop suey date.

146
0:06:37.816,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I like to say chop suey is the biggest culinary joke

147
0:06:40.293,000 --> 0:06:41,000
one culture ever played on another,

148
0:06:42.004,000 --> 0:06:44,000
because "chop suey," translated into Chinese,

149
0:06:44.147,000 --> 0:06:47,000
means "jaahp-seui," which, translated back, means "odds and ends."

150
0:06:47.287,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So, these people are going around China asking for chop suey,

151
0:06:50.684,000 --> 0:06:52,000
which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying,

152
0:06:53.557,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"I understand you have a very popular dish in your country

153
0:06:56.325,000 --> 0:06:57,000
called 'leftovers.'"

154
0:06:57.653,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:59.889,000 --> 0:07:,000
Right?

156
0:07:01.064,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And not only that:

158
0:07:05.462,000 --> 0:07:06,000
"This dish is particularly popular

159
0:07:07.129,000 --> 0:07:09,000
after that holiday you call 'Thanksgiving.'"

160
0:07:09.245,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:10.271,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So, why and where did chop suey come from?

162
0:07:13.377,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Let's go back to the mid-1800s,

163
0:07:16.598,000 --> 0:07:17,000
when the Chinese first came to America.

164
0:07:18.534,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Back then, Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food.

165
0:07:21.965,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In fact, they saw these people who landed at their shores as alien.

166
0:07:27.061,000 --> 0:07:29,000
These people weren't eating dogs, they were eating cats.

167
0:07:29.718,000 --> 0:07:31,000
If they weren't eating cats, they were eating rats.

168
0:07:32.125,000 --> 0:07:34,000
In fact, The New York Times, my esteemed employer,

169
0:07:34.499,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in 1883 ran an article that asked,

170
0:07:36.147,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"Do Chinese eat rats?"

171
0:07:37.322,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Not the most PC question to be asked today,

172
0:07:41.696,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but if you look at the popular imagery of the time,

173
0:07:44.131,000 --> 0:07:45,000
not so outlandish.

174
0:07:45.571,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison

175
0:07:50.551,000 --> 0:07:51,000
from the late 1800s.

176
0:07:51.782,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And if you see under the word "Clears" -- very small --

177
0:07:54.464,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it says, "They must go," which refers not only to the rats,

178
0:07:57.274,000 --> 0:07:58,000
but to the Chinese in their midst,

179
0:07:59.275,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because the way that the food was perceived

180
0:08:02.352,000 --> 0:08:05,000
was that these people who ate foods different from us

181
0:08:05.448,000 --> 0:08:06,000
must be different from us.

182
0:08:06.726,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Another way that you saw this antipathy towards the Chinese

183
0:08:10.128,000 --> 0:08:11,000
is through documents like this.

184
0:08:11.641,000 --> 0:08:12,000
This is in the Library of Congress.

185
0:08:13.336,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers,

186
0:08:15.423,000 --> 0:08:16,000
hero of our American labor movement.

187
0:08:17.185,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It's called, "Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion:

188
0:08:19.816,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Meat versus Rice: American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism:

189
0:08:23.524,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Which shall survive?"

190
0:08:24.699,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And it basically made the argument

191
0:08:26.5,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that Chinese men who ate rice

192
0:08:28.557,000 --> 0:08:3,000
would necessarily bring down the standard of living

193
0:08:30.963,000 --> 0:08:31,000
for American men who ate meat.

194
0:08:32.772,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And as a matter of fact, then,

195
0:08:34.234,000 --> 0:08:37,000
this is one of the reasons we must exclude them from this country.

196
0:08:37.358,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So, with sentiments like these,

197
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed between 1882 and 1902,

198
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
the only time in American history

199
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
when a group was specifically excluded

200
0:08:49.092,000 --> 0:08:52,000
for its national origin or ethnicity.

201
0:08:52.527,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So in a way, because the Chinese were attacked,

202
0:08:54.944,000 --> 0:08:57,000
chop suey was created as a defense mechanism.

203
0:08:58.117,000 --> 0:09:,000
Who came up with the idea of chop suey?

204
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
There's a lot of different mysteries and legends,

205
0:09:02.482,000 --> 0:09:03,000
but of the ones I've found,

206
0:09:03.979,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the most interesting is this article from 1904.

207
0:09:06.908,000 --> 0:09:07,000
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen

208
0:09:08.223,000 --> 0:09:1,000
shows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says,

209
0:09:10.454,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"I want you all to stop making chop suey,

210
0:09:12.445,000 --> 0:09:15,000
because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of chop suey.

211
0:09:15.999,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And the way he tells it,

212
0:09:17.404,000 --> 0:09:21,000
there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up,

213
0:09:22.417,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular

214
0:09:25.052,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and could, quote, "pass" as Chinese.

215
0:09:26.814,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And as he said -- we would never print this today --

216
0:09:29.51,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but basically, the American man has become very rich.

217
0:09:33.281,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Lem Sen: "I would've made this money, too, but I spent all this time

218
0:09:36.576,000 --> 0:09:38,000
looking for the American man who stole my recipe.

219
0:09:38.893,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now I've found him and I want my recipe back,

220
0:09:41.019,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and I want everyone to stop making chop suey,

221
0:09:43.17,000 --> 0:09:44,000
or pay me for the right to do the same.

222
0:09:45.067,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights.

223
0:09:48.756,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The thing is, this idea of Chinese-American food

224
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
doesn't exist only in America.

225
0:09:55.288,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In fact, Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet,

226
0:09:58.313,000 --> 0:10:,000
served on all seven continents, even Antarctica,

227
0:10:01.312,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station,

228
0:10:04.292,000 --> 0:10:07,000
which is the main scientific station in Antarctica.

229
0:10:07.435,000 --> 0:10:09,000
You see different varieties of Chinese food.

230
0:10:09.51,000 --> 0:10:11,000
For example, there is French Chinese food,

231
0:10:11.592,000 --> 0:10:13,000
where they serve salt and pepper frog legs.

232
0:10:14.565,000 --> 0:10:17,000
There is Italian Chinese food, where they don't have fortune cookies,

233
0:10:18.576,000 --> 0:10:19,000
so they serve fried gelato.

234
0:10:19.888,000 --> 0:10:21,000
My neighbor, Alessandra, was shocked when I told her,

235
0:10:22.686,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"Dude, fried gelato is not Chinese."

236
0:10:24.642,000 --> 0:10:28,000
She's like, "It's not? But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy."

237
0:10:28.672,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:32.386,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Even the Brits have their own version.

239
0:10:34.226,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This is a dish called "crispy shredded beef,"

240
0:10:36.501,000 --> 0:10:39,000
which has a lot of crisp, a lot of shred, and not a lot of beef.

241
0:10:39.701,000 --> 0:10:42,000
There is West Indian Chinese food, there's Jamaican Chinese food,

242
0:10:42.818,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Middle Eastern Chinese food, Mauritian Chinese food.

243
0:10:45.92,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This is a dish called "Magic Bowl," that I discovered.

244
0:10:48.666,000 --> 0:10:5,000
There's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food,

245
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Japanese Chinese food,

246
0:10:52.668,000 --> 0:10:55,000
where they take the bao, the little buns, and make them into pizza versions.

247
0:10:56.661,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

248
0:10:57.8,000 --> 0:11:,000
And they totally randomly take Chinese noodle dishes,

249
0:11:01.001,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and just ramenize them.

250
0:11:02.233,000 --> 0:11:05,000
This is something that, in the Chinese version, has no soup.

251
0:11:05.471,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,

252
0:11:07.458,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food,

253
0:11:09.937,000 --> 0:11:11,000
where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas.

254
0:11:12.934,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Laughter)

255
0:11:13.96,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And they have things like risotto chop suey.

256
0:11:16.044,000 --> 0:11:18,000
My personal favorite of all the restaurants

257
0:11:18.14,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I've encountered around the world

258
0:11:19.751,000 --> 0:11:21,000
was this one in Brazil, called "Kung Food."

259
0:11:21.815,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Laughter)

260
0:11:25.45,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So, let's take a step back and understand

261
0:11:28.723,000 --> 0:11:3,000
what is to be appreciated in America.

262
0:11:31.319,000 --> 0:11:36,000
McDonald's has garnered a lot of attention, a lot of respect,

263
0:11:36.602,000 --> 0:11:41,000
for basically standardizing the menu, decor and dining experience

264
0:11:42.176,000 --> 0:11:43,000
in post-World War II America.

265
0:11:43.75,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But you know what?

266
0:11:45.014,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois.

267
0:11:48.178,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue,

268
0:11:51.414,000 --> 0:11:53,000
with the menu and the decor, even the restaurant name,

269
0:11:53.986,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but without a centralized headquarters.

270
0:11:55.877,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So, this actually became very clear to me

271
0:11:58.242,000 --> 0:12:,000
with the March 30, 2005 Powerball drawing,

272
0:12:01.025,000 --> 0:12:04,000
where they expected, based on the number of ticket sales they had,

273
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to have three or four second-place winners,

274
0:12:06.205,000 --> 0:12:08,000
people who match five or six Powerball numbers.

275
0:12:08.449,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Instead, they had 110, and they were completely shocked.

276
0:12:11.112,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They looked all across the country and discovered it couldn't be fraud,

277
0:12:14.497,000 --> 0:12:17,000
since it happened in different states, across different computer systems.

278
0:12:18.003,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Whatever it was, it caused people to behave in a mass-synchronized way.

279
0:12:21.392,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So, OK, maybe it had to do with the patterns on the pieces of paper,

280
0:12:25.517,000 --> 0:12:27,000
like it was a diamond, or diagonal.

281
0:12:28.447,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It wasn't that, so they're like, OK, let's look at television.

282
0:12:31.411,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So they looked at an episode of "Lost."

283
0:12:33.364,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Now, I don't have a TV,

284
0:12:34.577,000 --> 0:12:36,000
which makes me a freak, but very productive --

285
0:12:36.803,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

286
0:12:38.954,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And there's an episode of "Lost" where one guy has a lucky number,

287
0:12:42.871,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but it's not a lucky number, it's why he's on the island,

288
0:12:45.593,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but they looked and the numbers did not match.

289
0:12:47.858,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They looked at "The Young and The Restless." It wasn't that, either.

290
0:12:51.08,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It wasn't until the first guy shows up the next day and they ask him,

291
0:12:54.389,000 --> 0:12:55,000
"Where did you get your number?"

292
0:12:55.942,000 --> 0:12:57,000
He said, "I got it from a fortune cookie."

293
0:12:57.971,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This is a slip one of the winners had,

294
0:12:59.815,000 --> 0:13:01,000
because the Tennessee lottery security officials

295
0:13:02.175,000 --> 0:13:03,000
were like, "Oh, no, this can't be true."

296
0:13:04.12,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But it was true.

297
0:13:05.307,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Basically, of those 110 people,

298
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
104 of them or so had gotten their number from a fortune cookie.

299
0:13:11.469,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Laughter)

300
0:13:13.296,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Yeah. So I went and started looking.

301
0:13:16.162,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I went across the country, looking for these restaurants

302
0:13:18.806,000 --> 0:13:2,000
where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from.

303
0:13:22.244,000 --> 0:13:25,000
There are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha --

304
0:13:25.421,000 --> 0:13:27,000
which is actually run by Koreans, but that's another point,

305
0:13:28.226,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and a bunch of them named "China Buffet."

306
0:13:30.807,000 --> 0:13:33,000
What's interesting is that their stories were similar, but different.

307
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It was lunch, it was take-out, it was sit-down, it was buffet,

308
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
it was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.

309
0:13:39.441,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But at some point, all these people had a very similar experience

310
0:13:42.585,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that converged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant.

311
0:13:45.473,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And all these restaurants were serving fortune cookies,

312
0:13:48.093,000 --> 0:13:5,000
which, of course, aren't even Chinese to begin with.

313
0:13:50.563,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's part of the phenomenon I called "spontaneous self-organization,"

314
0:13:54.127,000 --> 0:13:59,000
where, like in ant colonies, little decisions made on the micro level

315
0:13:59.999,000 --> 0:14:01,000
actually have a big impact on the macro level.

316
0:14:02.309,000 --> 0:14:06,000
A good contrast is Chicken McNuggets.

317
0:14:06.726,000 --> 0:14:09,000
McDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.

318
0:14:10.287,000 --> 0:14:14,000
They did chicken pot pie, fried chicken, and finally introduced Chicken McNuggets.

319
0:14:14.597,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggifying them,

320
0:14:18.626,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that's kind of an easy concept.

321
0:14:20.148,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The trick was, they were able to remove the chicken from the bone

322
0:14:23.947,000 --> 0:14:24,000
in a cost-efficient manner,

323
0:14:25.259,000 --> 0:14:28,000
which is why it took so long for people to copy them -- 10 years,

324
0:14:28.342,000 --> 0:14:3,000
then within a couple months, it was such a hit,

325
0:14:30.562,000 --> 0:14:33,000
they introduced it across the entire McDonald's system in the country.

326
0:14:33.877,000 --> 0:14:34,000
In contrast is General Tso's Chicken,

327
0:14:35.667,000 --> 0:14:37,000
which actually started in New York City in the early 1970s,

328
0:14:38.454,000 --> 0:14:41,000
as I was also started in this universe in New York City in the early 1970s.

329
0:14:42.013,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Laughter)

330
0:14:43.039,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And this logo!

331
0:14:44.214,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So me, General Tso's Chicken and this logo are all karmicly related.

332
0:14:47.489,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America

333
0:14:50.481,000 --> 0:14:51,000
from a restaurant in New York City.

334
0:14:52.184,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Someone's like, "It's sweet, it's fried, it's chicken --

335
0:14:54.982,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Americans will love this."

336
0:14:56.379,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So what I like to say, this being Bay Area, Silicon Valley,

337
0:15:00.359,000 --> 0:15:04,000
is that we think of McDonald's as sort of the Microsoft of dining experiences.

338
0:15:04.526,000 --> 0:15:06,000
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux,

339
0:15:07.306,000 --> 0:15:09,000
sort of an open-source thing, right?

340
0:15:09.576,000 --> 0:15:1,000
(Laughter)

341
0:15:10.602,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated

342
0:15:14.271,000 --> 0:15:15,000
across the entire system,

343
0:15:15.516,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food,

344
0:15:19.387,000 --> 0:15:2,000
depending on the region.

345
0:15:20.562,000 --> 0:15:23,000
For example, in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food,

346
0:15:24.184,000 --> 0:15:27,000
where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish.

347
0:15:27.978,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And in Philadelphia, you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll,

348
0:15:31.263,000 --> 0:15:34,000
which is like an egg roll on the outside and cheesesteak on the inside.

349
0:15:34.626,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I was surprised to discover that not only in Philadelphia, but also in Atlanta.

350
0:15:38.376,000 --> 0:15:39,000
What had happened was,

351
0:15:39.551,000 --> 0:15:43,000
a Chinese family had moved from Philadelphia to Atlanta,

352
0:15:44.138,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and brought that with them.

353
0:15:45.789,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So the thing is,

354
0:15:47.51,000 --> 0:15:49,000
our historical lore, because of the way we like narratives,

355
0:15:50.322,000 --> 0:15:53,000
is full of vast characters, such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks

356
0:15:53.375,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and Ray Kroc with McDonald's

357
0:15:55.655,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.

358
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
But, you know, it's very easy to overlook the smaller characters.

359
0:16:02.681,000 --> 0:16:04,000
For example, Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey,

360
0:16:05.015,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Chef Peng, who introduced General Tso's Chicken,

361
0:16:07.416,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies.

362
0:16:11.59,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So, the point of my presentation is to make you think twice;

363
0:16:14.961,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that those whose names are forgotten in history

364
0:16:17.423,000 --> 0:16:19,000
can often have had as much, if not more,

365
0:16:19.534,000 --> 0:16:2,000
impact on what we eat today.

366
0:16:21.453,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Thank you very much.

367
0:16:22.628,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

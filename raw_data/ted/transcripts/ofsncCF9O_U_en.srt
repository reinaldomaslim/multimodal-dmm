1
0:00:12.767,000 --> 0:00:14,000
To be honest, by personality,

2
0:00:15.619,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm just not much of a crier.

3
0:00:19.316,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But I think in my career that's been a good thing.

4
0:00:23.246,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm a civil rights lawyer,

5
0:00:24.63,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and I've seen some horrible things in the world.

6
0:00:29.034,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I began my career working police abuse cases in the United States.

7
0:00:32.844,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And then in 1994, I was sent to Rwanda

8
0:00:36.318,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to be the director of the U.N.'s genocide investigation.

9
0:00:41.908,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It turns out that tears just aren't much help

10
0:00:45.647,000 --> 0:00:48,000
when you're trying to investigate a genocide.

11
0:00:49.176,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The things I had to see, and feel and touch

12
0:00:54.037,000 --> 0:00:56,000
were pretty unspeakable.

13
0:00:57.534,000 --> 0:01:,000
What I can tell you is this:

14
0:01:00.891,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that the Rwandan genocide

15
0:01:02.988,000 --> 0:01:07,000
was one of the world's greatest failures of simple compassion.

16
0:01:09.711,000 --> 0:01:12,000
That word, compassion, actually comes from two Latin words:

17
0:01:13.12,000 --> 0:01:18,000
cum passio, which simply mean "to suffer with."

18
0:01:18.642,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And the things that I saw and experienced

19
0:01:22.204,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in Rwanda as I got up close to human suffering,

20
0:01:24.79,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it did, in moments, move me to tears.

21
0:01:28.129,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But I just wish that I, and the rest of the world,

22
0:01:30.855,000 --> 0:01:32,000
had been moved earlier.

23
0:01:33.37,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And not just to tears,

24
0:01:35.034,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but to actually stop the genocide.

25
0:01:38.834,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now by contrast, I've also been involved

26
0:01:41.292,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with one of the world's greatest successes of compassion.

27
0:01:47.125,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And that's the fight against global poverty.

28
0:01:50.071,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's a cause that probably has involved all of us here.

29
0:01:52.854,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I don't know if your first introduction

30
0:01:54.852,000 --> 0:01:57,000
might have been choruses of "We Are the World,"

31
0:01:58.217,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or maybe the picture of a sponsored child on your refrigerator door,

32
0:02:02.28,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or maybe the birthday you donated for fresh water.

33
0:02:06.367,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I don't really remember what my first introduction to poverty was

34
0:02:09.581,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but I do remember the most jarring.

35
0:02:13.145,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It was when I met Venus --

36
0:02:15.307,000 --> 0:02:17,000
she's a mom from Zambia.

37
0:02:18.029,000 --> 0:02:21,000
She's got three kids and she's a widow.

38
0:02:21.655,000 --> 0:02:24,000
When I met her, she had walked about 12 miles

39
0:02:25.022,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in the only garments she owned,

40
0:02:27.695,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to come to the capital city and to share her story.

41
0:02:31.957,000 --> 0:02:34,000
She sat down with me for hours,

42
0:02:35.572,000 --> 0:02:39,000
just ushered me in to the world of poverty.

43
0:02:40.097,000 --> 0:02:43,000
She described what it was like when the coals on the cooking fire

44
0:02:43.238,000 --> 0:02:46,000
finally just went completely cold.

45
0:02:46.967,000 --> 0:02:5,000
When that last drop of cooking oil finally ran out.

46
0:02:51.729,000 --> 0:02:54,000
When the last of the food, despite her best efforts,

47
0:02:55.585,000 --> 0:02:56,000
ran out.

48
0:02:58.113,000 --> 0:03:,000
She had to watch her youngest son, Peter,

49
0:03:01.096,000 --> 0:03:03,000
suffer from malnutrition,

50
0:03:03.878,000 --> 0:03:07,000
as his legs just slowly bowed into uselessness.

51
0:03:07.954,000 --> 0:03:1,000
As his eyes grew cloudy and dim.

52
0:03:11.302,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And then as Peter finally grew cold.

53
0:03:18.13,000 --> 0:03:23,000
For over 50 years, stories like this have been moving us to compassion.

54
0:03:23.811,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We whose kids have plenty to eat.

55
0:03:26.661,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And we're moved not only to care about global poverty,

56
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but to actually try to do our part to stop the suffering.

57
0:03:34.02,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now there's plenty of room for critique that we haven't done enough,

58
0:03:37.493,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and what it is that we've done hasn't been effective enough,

59
0:03:41.715,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but the truth is this:

60
0:03:44.845,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The fight against global poverty is probably the broadest,

61
0:03:48.396,000 --> 0:03:53,000
longest running manifestation of the human phenomenon of compassion

62
0:03:53.531,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in the history of our species.

63
0:03:56.673,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And so I'd like to share a pretty shattering insight

64
0:04:00.322,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that might forever change the way you think about that struggle.

65
0:04:04.615,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But first, let me begin with what you probably already know.

66
0:04:07.438,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Thirty-five years ago, when I would have been graduating from high school,

67
0:04:10.92,000 --> 0:04:16,000
they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty.

68
0:04:17.297,000 --> 0:04:21,000
That number, today, is now down to 17,000.

69
0:04:21.669,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Way too many, of course,

70
0:04:23.675,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but it does mean that every year,

71
0:04:26.352,000 --> 0:04:3,000
there's eight million kids who don't have to die from poverty.

72
0:04:31.65,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Moreover, the number of people in our world

73
0:04:34.067,000 --> 0:04:36,000
who are living in extreme poverty,

74
0:04:36.23,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which is defined as living off about a dollar and a quarter a day,

75
0:04:39.567,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that has fallen from 50 percent,

76
0:04:43.179,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to only 15 percent.

77
0:04:47.403,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This is massive progress,

78
0:04:48.853,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and this exceeds everybody's expectations about what is possible.

79
0:04:54.258,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I think you and I,

80
0:04:57.123,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I think, honestly, that we can feel proud and encouraged

81
0:05:01.399,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to see the way that compassion actually has the power

82
0:05:05.284,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to succeed in stopping the suffering of millions.

83
0:05:10.476,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But here's the part that you might not hear very much about.

84
0:05:14.852,000 --> 0:05:18,000
If you move that poverty mark just up to two dollars a day,

85
0:05:19.586,000 --> 0:05:21,000
it turns out that virtually the same two billion people

86
0:05:22.585,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who were stuck in that harsh poverty when I was in high school,

87
0:05:26.397,000 --> 0:05:27,000
are still stuck there,

88
0:05:28.278,000 --> 0:05:3,000
35 years later.

89
0:05:30.667,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So why, why are so many billions still stuck in such harsh poverty?

90
0:05:36.396,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Well, let's think about Venus for a moment.

91
0:05:39.351,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now for decades, my wife and I have been moved by common compassion

92
0:05:43.123,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to sponsor kids, to fund microloans,

93
0:05:45.952,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to support generous levels of foreign aid.

94
0:05:49.471,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But until I had actually talked to Venus,

95
0:05:52.563,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I would have had no idea that none of those approaches

96
0:05:55.2,000 --> 0:06:,000
actually addressed why she had to watch her son die.

97
0:06:01.806,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"We were doing fine," Venus told me,

98
0:06:06.243,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"until Brutus started to cause trouble."

99
0:06:10.785,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Now, Brutus is Venus' neighbor and "cause trouble"

100
0:06:13.755,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is what happened the day after Venus' husband died,

101
0:06:17.281,000 --> 0:06:2,000
when Brutus just came and threw Venus and the kids out of the house,

102
0:06:21.213,000 --> 0:06:24,000
stole all their land, and robbed their market stall.

103
0:06:26.385,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You see, Venus was thrown into destitution by violence.

104
0:06:32.882,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And then it occurred to me, of course,

105
0:06:34.891,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that none of my child sponsorships, none of the microloans,

106
0:06:38.69,000 --> 0:06:41,000
none of the traditional anti-poverty programs

107
0:06:42.552,000 --> 0:06:45,000
were going to stop Brutus,

108
0:06:46.518,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because they weren't meant to.

109
0:06:49.872,000 --> 0:06:54,000
This became even more clear to me when I met Griselda.

110
0:06:54.878,000 --> 0:06:58,000
She's a marvelous young girl living in a very poor community

111
0:06:59.097,000 --> 0:07:,000
in Guatemala.

112
0:07:00.913,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And one of the things we've learned over the years

113
0:07:03.31,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is that perhaps the most powerful thing

114
0:07:05.881,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that Griselda and her family can do

115
0:07:08.725,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to get Griselda and her family out of poverty

116
0:07:11.39,000 --> 0:07:14,000
is to make sure that she goes to school.

117
0:07:14.514,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The experts call this the Girl Effect.

118
0:07:19.239,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But when we met Griselda, she wasn't going to school.

119
0:07:23.321,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In fact, she was rarely ever leaving her home.

120
0:07:28.388,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Days before we met her,

121
0:07:30.173,000 --> 0:07:32,000
while she was walking home from church with her family,

122
0:07:32.818,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in broad daylight,

123
0:07:35.133,000 --> 0:07:38,000
men from her community just snatched her off the street,

124
0:07:38.61,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and violently raped her.

125
0:07:41.708,000 --> 0:07:45,000
See, Griselda had every opportunity to go to school,

126
0:07:46.205,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it just wasn't safe for her to get there.

127
0:07:49.626,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And Griselda's not the only one.

128
0:07:52.466,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Around the world, poor women and girls

129
0:07:55.19,000 --> 0:08:,000
between the ages of 15 and 44,

130
0:08:00.301,000 --> 0:08:04,000
they are -- when victims of the everyday violence

131
0:08:04.386,000 --> 0:08:07,000
of domestic abuse and sexual violence --

132
0:08:07.872,000 --> 0:08:11,000
those two forms of violence account for more death and disability

133
0:08:12.684,000 --> 0:08:19,000
than malaria, than car accidents, than war combined.

134
0:08:23.298,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The truth is, the poor of our world are trapped in whole systems of violence.

135
0:08:28.075,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In South Asia, for instance, I could drive past this rice mill

136
0:08:32.108,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and see this man hoisting these 100-pound sacks

137
0:08:35.045,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of rice upon his thin back.

138
0:08:37.089,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But I would have no idea, until later,

139
0:08:38.907,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that he was actually a slave,

140
0:08:41.349,000 --> 0:08:45,000
held by violence in that rice mill since I was in high school.

141
0:08:46.828,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Decades of anti-poverty programs right in his community

142
0:08:50.239,000 --> 0:08:54,000
were never able to rescue him or any of the hundred other slaves

143
0:08:54.321,000 --> 0:08:57,000
from the beatings and the rapes and the torture

144
0:08:57.957,000 --> 0:09:,000
of violence inside the rice mill.

145
0:09:01.652,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In fact, half a century of anti-poverty programs

146
0:09:06.032,000 --> 0:09:09,000
have left more poor people in slavery

147
0:09:09.706,000 --> 0:09:12,000
than in any other time in human history.

148
0:09:13.071,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Experts tell us that there's about 35 million people in slavery today.

149
0:09:19.05,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That's about the population of the entire nation of Canada,

150
0:09:22.711,000 --> 0:09:25,000
where we're sitting today.

151
0:09:26.179,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is why, over time, I have come to call this epidemic of violence

152
0:09:29.483,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the Locust Effect.

153
0:09:31.772,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Because in the lives of the poor, it just descends like a plague

154
0:09:34.783,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and it destroys everything.

155
0:09:37.571,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In fact, now when you survey very, very poor communities,

156
0:09:41.954,000 --> 0:09:45,000
residents will tell you that their greatest fear is violence.

157
0:09:46.038,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But notice the violence that they fear

158
0:09:48.607,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is not the violence of genocide or the wars,

159
0:09:51.785,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it's everyday violence.

160
0:09:54.14,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So for me, as a lawyer, of course, my first reaction was to think,

161
0:09:57.353,000 --> 0:09:59,000
well, of course we've got to change all the laws.

162
0:09:59.667,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We've got to make all this violence against the poor illegal.

163
0:10:03.167,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But then I found out, it already is.

164
0:10:06.902,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The problem is not that the poor don't get laws,

165
0:10:09.742,000 --> 0:10:12,000
it's that they don't get law enforcement.

166
0:10:14.542,000 --> 0:10:15,000
In the developing world,

167
0:10:16.185,000 --> 0:10:19,000
basic law enforcement systems are so broken

168
0:10:19.25,000 --> 0:10:22,000
that recently the U.N. issued a report that found

169
0:10:22.416,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that "most poor people live outside the protection of the law."

170
0:10:28.02,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now honestly, you and I have just about no idea

171
0:10:30.412,000 --> 0:10:31,000
of what that would mean

172
0:10:32.009,000 --> 0:10:35,000
because we have no first-hand experience of it.

173
0:10:35.688,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Functioning law enforcement for us is just a total assumption.

174
0:10:38.765,000 --> 0:10:42,000
In fact, nothing expresses that assumption more clearly than three simple numbers:

175
0:10:43.137,000 --> 0:10:45,000
9-1-1,

176
0:10:45.598,000 --> 0:10:48,000
which, of course, is the number for the emergency police operator

177
0:10:48.765,000 --> 0:10:51,000
here in Canada and in the United States,

178
0:10:52.066,000 --> 0:10:56,000
where the average response time to a police 911 emergency call

179
0:10:56.147,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is about 10 minutes.

180
0:10:57.81,000 --> 0:11:,000
So we take this just completely for granted.

181
0:11:00.995,000 --> 0:11:04,000
But what if there was no law enforcement to protect you?

182
0:11:06.582,000 --> 0:11:1,000
A woman in Oregon recently experienced what this would be like.

183
0:11:11.204,000 --> 0:11:15,000
She was home alone in her dark house on a Saturday night,

184
0:11:15.545,000 --> 0:11:17,000
when a man started to tear his way into her home.

185
0:11:18.51,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This was her worst nightmare,

186
0:11:20.467,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because this man had actually put her in the hospital from an assault

187
0:11:25.075,000 --> 0:11:27,000
just two weeks before.

188
0:11:27.193,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So terrified, she picks up that phone and does what any of us would do:

189
0:11:30.551,000 --> 0:11:32,000
She calls 911 --

190
0:11:33.196,000 --> 0:11:37,000
but only to learn that because of budget cuts in her county,

191
0:11:38.028,000 --> 0:11:41,000
law enforcement wasn't available on the weekends.

192
0:11:41.397,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Listen.

193
0:11:42.187,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Dispatcher: I don't have anybody to send out there.

194
0:11:45.006,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Woman: OK

195
0:11:46.023,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Dispatcher: Um, obviously if he comes inside the residence and assaults you,

196
0:11:50.126,000 --> 0:11:51,000
can you ask him to go away?

197
0:11:51.799,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Or do you know if he is intoxicated or anything?

198
0:11:54.042,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Woman: I've already asked him. I've already told him I was calling you.

199
0:11:57.415,000 --> 0:11:59,000
He's broken in before, busted down my door, assaulted me.

200
0:12:00.088,000 --> 0:12:,000
Dispatcher: Uh-huh.

201
0:12:01.033,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Woman: Um, yeah, so ...

202
0:12:02.186,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Dispatcher: Is there any way you could safely leave the residence?

203
0:12:05.405,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Woman: No, I can't, because he's blocking pretty much my only way out.

204
0:12:08.822,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Dispatcher: Well, the only thing I can do is give you some advice,

205
0:12:11.968,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and call the sheriff's office tomorrow.

206
0:12:14.684,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Obviously, if he comes in and unfortunately has a weapon

207
0:12:19.496,000 --> 0:12:22,000
or is trying to cause you physical harm, that's a different story.

208
0:12:22.822,000 --> 0:12:24,000
You know, the sheriff's office doesn't work up there.

209
0:12:25.489,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I don't have anybody to send."

210
0:12:29.735,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Gary Haugen: Tragically, the woman inside that house

211
0:12:32.388,000 --> 0:12:37,000
was violently assaulted, choked and raped

212
0:12:38.327,000 --> 0:12:44,000
because this is what it means to live outside the rule of law.

213
0:12:45.841,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And this is where billions of our poorest live.

214
0:12:52.015,000 --> 0:12:54,000
What does that look like?

215
0:12:54.443,000 --> 0:12:58,000
In Bolivia, for example, if a man sexually assaults a poor child,

216
0:12:58.871,000 --> 0:13:02,000
statistically, he's at greater risk of slipping in the shower and dying

217
0:13:03.544,000 --> 0:13:06,000
than he is of ever going to jail for that crime.

218
0:13:08.002,000 --> 0:13:12,000
In South Asia, if you enslave a poor person,

219
0:13:12.687,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you're at greater risk of being struck by lightning

220
0:13:15.61,000 --> 0:13:18,000
than ever being sent to jail for that crime.

221
0:13:18.66,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And so the epidemic of everyday violence, it just rages on.

222
0:13:23.639,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And it devastates our efforts to try to help billions of people

223
0:13:27.738,000 --> 0:13:3,000
out of their two-dollar-a-day hell.

224
0:13:31.315,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Because the data just doesn't lie.

225
0:13:33.817,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It turns out that you can give all manner of goods and services

226
0:13:36.876,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to the poor,

227
0:13:38.029,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but if you don't restrain the hands of the violent bullies

228
0:13:41.155,000 --> 0:13:42,000
from taking it all away,

229
0:13:42.99,000 --> 0:13:46,000
you're going to be very disappointed in the long-term impact of your efforts.

230
0:13:47.889,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement

231
0:13:51.66,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in the developing world would be a huge priority

232
0:13:54.675,000 --> 0:13:57,000
for the global fight against poverty.

233
0:13:57.915,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But it's not.

234
0:14:01.028,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Auditors of international assistance recently couldn't find

235
0:14:04.825,000 --> 0:14:07,000
even one percent of aid going to protect the poor

236
0:14:08.659,000 --> 0:14:12,000
from the lawless chaos of everyday violence.

237
0:14:12.99,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And honestly, when we do talk about violence against the poor,

238
0:14:16.296,000 --> 0:14:19,000
sometimes it's in the weirdest of ways.

239
0:14:19.805,000 --> 0:14:22,000
A fresh water organization tells a heart-wrenching story

240
0:14:22.888,000 --> 0:14:25,000
of girls who are raped on the way to fetching water,

241
0:14:26.48,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and then celebrates the solution of a new well

242
0:14:30.29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that drastically shortens their walk.

243
0:14:33.745,000 --> 0:14:35,000
End of story.

244
0:14:36.863,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But not a word about the rapists who are still right there in the community.

245
0:14:43.813,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If a young woman on one of our college campuses

246
0:14:46.127,000 --> 0:14:49,000
was raped on her walk to the library,

247
0:14:49.273,000 --> 0:14:54,000
we would never celebrate the solution of moving the library closer to the dorm.

248
0:14:55.121,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And yet, for some reason, this is okay for poor people.

249
0:15:00.915,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Now the truth is, the traditional experts

250
0:15:03.469,000 --> 0:15:05,000
in economic development and poverty alleviation,

251
0:15:05.775,000 --> 0:15:07,000
they don't know how to fix this problem.

252
0:15:08.035,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And so what happens?

253
0:15:09.856,000 --> 0:15:11,000
They don't talk about it.

254
0:15:13.237,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But the more fundamental reason

255
0:15:17.408,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that law enforcement for the poor in the developing world

256
0:15:20.188,000 --> 0:15:21,000
is so neglected,

257
0:15:22.072,000 --> 0:15:25,000
is because the people inside the developing world, with money,

258
0:15:25.957,000 --> 0:15:27,000
don't need it.

259
0:15:29.165,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I was at the World Economic Forum not long ago

260
0:15:31.745,000 --> 0:15:34,000
talking to corporate executives who have massive businesses in the developing world

261
0:15:35.689,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and I was just asking them,

262
0:15:37.771,000 --> 0:15:42,000
"How do you guys protect all your people and property from all the violence?"

263
0:15:43.325,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And they looked at each other, and they said, practically in unison,

264
0:15:48.147,000 --> 0:15:5,000
"We buy it."

265
0:15:51.474,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Indeed, private security forces in the developing world

266
0:15:55.336,000 --> 0:16:01,000
are now, four, five and seven times larger than the public police force.

267
0:16:02.146,000 --> 0:16:09,000
In Africa, the largest employer on the continent now is private security.

268
0:16:10.884,000 --> 0:16:13,000
But see, the rich can pay for safety and can keep getting richer,

269
0:16:14.702,000 --> 0:16:17,000
but the poor can't pay for it and they're left totally unprotected

270
0:16:18.504,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and they keep getting thrown to the ground.

271
0:16:22.464,000 --> 0:16:26,000
This is a massive and scandalous outrage.

272
0:16:26.896,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And it doesn't have to be this way.

273
0:16:29.849,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Broken law enforcement can be fixed.

274
0:16:32.416,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Violence can be stopped.

275
0:16:34.496,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Almost all criminal justice systems,

276
0:16:36.888,000 --> 0:16:38,000
they start out broken and corrupt,

277
0:16:39.417,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but they can be transformed by fierce effort and commitment.

278
0:16:43.687,000 --> 0:16:45,000
The path forward is really pretty clear.

279
0:16:45.93,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Number one: We have to start making

280
0:16:49.377,000 --> 0:16:52,000
stopping violence indispensable to the fight against poverty.

281
0:16:53.144,000 --> 0:16:55,000
In fact, any conversation about global poverty

282
0:16:55.578,000 --> 0:16:59,000
that doesn't include the problem of violence must be deemed not serious.

283
0:17:01.416,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And secondly, we have to begin to seriously invest resources

284
0:17:05.792,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and share expertise to support the developing world

285
0:17:09.729,000 --> 0:17:12,000
as they fashion new, public systems of justice,

286
0:17:13.086,000 --> 0:17:14,000
not private security,

287
0:17:14.652,000 --> 0:17:16,000
that give everybody a chance to be safe.

288
0:17:18.349,000 --> 0:17:2,000
These transformations are actually possible

289
0:17:21.031,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and they're happening today.

290
0:17:23.64,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Recently, the Gates Foundation funded a project

291
0:17:26.778,000 --> 0:17:28,000
in the second largest city of the Philippines,

292
0:17:29.254,000 --> 0:17:32,000
where local advocates and local law enforcement

293
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
were able to transform corrupt police and broken courts so drastically,

294
0:17:39.118,000 --> 0:17:41,000
that in just four short years,

295
0:17:41.705,000 --> 0:17:43,000
they were able to measurably reduce

296
0:17:44.177,000 --> 0:17:49,000
the commercial sexual violence against poor kids by 79 percent.

297
0:17:51.758,000 --> 0:17:54,000
You know, from the hindsight of history,

298
0:17:55.302,000 --> 0:18:,000
what's always most inexplicable and inexcusable

299
0:18:00.859,000 --> 0:18:03,000
are the simple failures of compassion.

300
0:18:05.48,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Because I think history convenes a tribunal of our grandchildren

301
0:18:10.208,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and they just ask us,

302
0:18:11.969,000 --> 0:18:14,000
"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you?

303
0:18:16.211,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Where were you, Grandpa, when the Jews were fleeing Nazi Germany

304
0:18:19.766,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and were being rejected from our shores?

305
0:18:21.695,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Where were you?

306
0:18:23.823,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And Grandma, where were you when they were marching

307
0:18:26.223,000 --> 0:18:3,000
our Japanese-American neighbors off to internment camps?

308
0:18:30.276,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And Grandpa, where were you when they were beating

309
0:18:32.665,000 --> 0:18:34,000
our African-American neighbors

310
0:18:34.938,000 --> 0:18:37,000
just because they were trying to register to vote?"

311
0:18:38.458,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Likewise, when our grandchildren ask us,

312
0:18:42.702,000 --> 0:18:44,000
"Grandma, Grandpa, where were you

313
0:18:45.143,000 --> 0:18:49,000
when two billion of the world's poorest were drowning in a lawless chaos

314
0:18:49.636,000 --> 0:18:51,000
of everyday violence?"

315
0:18:53.287,000 --> 0:18:59,000
I hope we can say that we had compassion, that we raised our voice,

316
0:18:59.852,000 --> 0:19:06,000
and as a generation, we were moved to make the violence stop.

317
0:19:07.684,000 --> 0:19:09,000
Thank you very much.

318
0:19:10.141,000 --> 0:19:13,000
(Applause)

319
0:19:25.89,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Chris Anderson: Really powerfully argued.

320
0:19:28.785,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Talk to us a bit about some of the things

321
0:19:31.064,000 --> 0:19:37,000
that have actually been happening to, for example, boost police training.

322
0:19:37.588,000 --> 0:19:38,000
How hard a process is that?

323
0:19:39.427,000 --> 0:19:42,000
GH: Well, one of the glorious things that's starting to happen now

324
0:19:43.009,000 --> 0:19:47,000
is that the collapse of these systems and the consequences are becoming obvious.

325
0:19:47.619,000 --> 0:19:5,000
There's actually, now, political will to do that.

326
0:19:50.981,000 --> 0:19:54,000
But it just requires now an investment of resources and transfer of expertise.

327
0:19:55.106,000 --> 0:19:58,000
There's a political will struggle that's going to take place as well,

328
0:19:58.509,000 --> 0:19:59,000
but those are winnable fights,

329
0:20:00.324,000 --> 0:20:02,000
because we've done some examples around the world

330
0:20:02.623,000 --> 0:20:05,000
at International Justice Mission that are very encouraging.

331
0:20:05.732,000 --> 0:20:08,000
CA: So just tell us in one country, how much it costs

332
0:20:09.233,000 --> 0:20:12,000
to make a material difference to police, for example --

333
0:20:12.748,000 --> 0:20:13,000
I know that's only one piece of it.

334
0:20:14.538,000 --> 0:20:17,000
GH: In Guatemala, for instance, we've started a project there

335
0:20:17.754,000 --> 0:20:2,000
with the local police and court system, prosecutors,

336
0:20:21.006,000 --> 0:20:24,000
to retrain them so that they can actually effectively bring these cases.

337
0:20:24.819,000 --> 0:20:28,000
And we've seen prosecutions against perpetrators of sexual violence

338
0:20:29.131,000 --> 0:20:31,000
increase by more than 1,000 percent.

339
0:20:31.967,000 --> 0:20:35,000
This project has been very modestly funded at about a million dollars a year,

340
0:20:36.356,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and the kind of bang you can get for your buck

341
0:20:38.662,000 --> 0:20:42,000
in terms of leveraging a criminal justice system

342
0:20:42.838,000 --> 0:20:46,000
that could function if it were properly trained and motivated and led,

343
0:20:47.595,000 --> 0:20:49,000
and these countries, especially a middle class

344
0:20:50.138,000 --> 0:20:53,000
that is seeing that there's really no future

345
0:20:53.282,000 --> 0:20:56,000
with this total instability and total privatization of security

346
0:20:57.15,000 --> 0:21:,000
I think there's an opportunity, a window for change.

347
0:21:00.341,000 --> 0:21:05,000
CA: But to make this happen, you have to look at each part in the chain --

348
0:21:05.421,000 --> 0:21:07,000
the police, who else?

349
0:21:07.676,000 --> 0:21:09,000
GH: So that's the thing about law enforcement,

350
0:21:09.957,000 --> 0:21:1,000
it starts out with the police,

351
0:21:11.4,000 --> 0:21:13,000
they're the front end of the pipeline of justice,

352
0:21:14.083,000 --> 0:21:15,000
but they hand if off to the prosecutors,

353
0:21:16.03,000 --> 0:21:18,000
and the prosecutors hand it off to the courts,

354
0:21:18.265,000 --> 0:21:21,000
and the survivors of violence have to be supported by social services

355
0:21:21.557,000 --> 0:21:22,000
all the way through that.

356
0:21:22.863,000 --> 0:21:24,000
So you have to do an approach that pulls that all together.

357
0:21:25.675,000 --> 0:21:28,000
In the past, there's been a little bit of training of the courts,

358
0:21:28.726,000 --> 0:21:3,000
but they get crappy evidence from the police,

359
0:21:30.9,000 --> 0:21:33,000
or a little police intervention that has to do with narcotics or terrorism

360
0:21:34.537,000 --> 0:21:36,000
but nothing to do with treating the common poor person

361
0:21:37.405,000 --> 0:21:38,000
with excellent law enforcement,

362
0:21:38.924,000 --> 0:21:4,000
so it's about pulling that all together,

363
0:21:40.949,000 --> 0:21:43,000
and you can actually have people in very poor communities

364
0:21:44.091,000 --> 0:21:46,000
experience law enforcement like us,

365
0:21:46.274,000 --> 0:21:48,000
which is imperfect in our own experience, for sure,

366
0:21:49.096,000 --> 0:21:52,000
but boy, is it a great thing to sense that you can call 911

367
0:21:52.228,000 --> 0:21:55,000
and maybe someone will protect you.

368
0:21:55.264,000 --> 0:21:57,000
CA: Gary, I think you've done a spectacular job

369
0:21:57.537,000 --> 0:21:59,000
of bringing this to the world's attention

370
0:21:59.664,000 --> 0:22:,000
in your book and right here today.

371
0:22:01.411,000 --> 0:22:02,000
Thanks so much.

372
0:22:02.505,000 --> 0:22:02,000
Gary Haugen.

373
0:22:03.281,000 --> 0:22:04,000

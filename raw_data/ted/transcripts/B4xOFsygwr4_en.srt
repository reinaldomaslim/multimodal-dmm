1
0:00:12.942,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Ah yes, those university days,

2
0:00:15.77,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a heady mix of Ph.D-level pure mathematics

3
0:00:19.673,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and world debating championships,

4
0:00:22.144,000 --> 0:00:27,000
or, as I like to say, "Hello, ladies. Oh yeah."

5
0:00:27.397,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Didn't get much sexier than the Spence

6
0:00:29.389,000 --> 0:00:3,000
at university, let me tell you.

7
0:00:30.853,000 --> 0:00:34,000
It is such a thrill for a humble breakfast radio announcer

8
0:00:35.239,000 --> 0:00:37,000
from Sydney, Australia, to be here on the TED stage

9
0:00:37.57,000 --> 0:00:39,000
literally on the other side of the world.

10
0:00:39.733,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I wanted to let you know, a lot of the things you've heard

11
0:00:41.366,000 --> 0:00:42,000
about Australians are true.

12
0:00:43.011,000 --> 0:00:45,000
From the youngest of ages, we display

13
0:00:45.433,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a prodigious sporting talent.

14
0:00:47.944,000 --> 0:00:51,000
On the field of battle, we are brave and noble warriors.

15
0:00:52.289,000 --> 0:00:52,000
What you've heard is true.

16
0:00:52.946,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Australians, we don't mind a bit of a drink,

17
0:00:56.77,000 --> 0:00:59,000
sometimes to excess, leading to embarrassing social situations. (Laughter)

18
0:01:00.52,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This is my father's work Christmas party, December 1973.

19
0:01:06.707,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I'm almost five years old. Fair to say,

20
0:01:08.629,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I'm enjoying the day a lot more than Santa was.

21
0:01:11.009,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But I stand before you today

22
0:01:14.889,000 --> 0:01:15,000
not as a breakfast radio host,

23
0:01:16.335,000 --> 0:01:19,000
not as a comedian, but as someone who was, is,

24
0:01:20.241,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and always will be a mathematician.

25
0:01:23.421,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And anyone who's been bitten by the numbers bug

26
0:01:25.615,000 --> 0:01:28,000
knows that it bites early and it bites deep.

27
0:01:29.375,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I cast my mind back when I was in second grade

28
0:01:32.312,000 --> 0:01:34,000
at a beautiful little government-run school

29
0:01:34.335,000 --> 0:01:37,000
called Boronia Park in the suburbs of Sydney,

30
0:01:38.09,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and as we came up towards lunchtime, our teacher,

31
0:01:40.151,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Ms. Russell, said to the class,

32
0:01:41.879,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"Hey, year two. What do you want to do after lunch?

33
0:01:44.344,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I've got no plans."

34
0:01:46.613,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It was an exercise in democratic schooling,

35
0:01:49.76,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and I am all for democratic schooling, but we were only seven.

36
0:01:54.382,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So some of the suggestions we made as to what

37
0:01:56.124,000 --> 0:01:58,000
we might want to do after lunch were a little bit impractical,

38
0:01:58.688,000 --> 0:02:,000
and after a while, someone made a particularly silly suggestion

39
0:02:00.962,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and Ms. Russell patted them down with that gentle aphorism,

40
0:02:03.107,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"That wouldn't work.

41
0:02:04.704,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That'd be like trying to put a square peg through a round hole."

42
0:02:08.695,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now I wasn't trying to be smart.

43
0:02:10.962,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I wasn't trying to be funny.

44
0:02:11.797,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I just politely raised my hand,

45
0:02:14.012,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and when Ms. Russell acknowledged me, I said,

46
0:02:15.995,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in front of my year two classmates, and I quote,

47
0:02:18.631,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"But Miss,

48
0:02:22.194,000 --> 0:02:25,000
surely if the diagonal of the square

49
0:02:25.99,000 --> 0:02:29,000
is less than the diameter of the circle,

50
0:02:30.201,000 --> 0:02:32,000
well, the square peg will pass quite easily through the round hole."

51
0:02:33.086,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:36.104,000 --> 0:02:4,000
"It'd be like putting a piece of toast through a basketball hoop, wouldn't it?"

53
0:02:40.375,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And there was that same awkward silence

54
0:02:42.018,000 --> 0:02:43,000
from most of my classmates,

55
0:02:43.216,000 --> 0:02:45,000
until sitting next to me, one of my friends,

56
0:02:45.319,000 --> 0:02:47,000
one of the cool kids in class, Steven, leaned across

57
0:02:47.771,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and punched me really hard in the head.

58
0:02:50.114,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:51.198,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Now what Steven was saying was, "Look, Adam,

60
0:02:53.699,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you are at a critical juncture in your life here, my friend.

61
0:02:58.248,000 --> 0:03:,000
You can keep sitting here with us.

62
0:03:00.525,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Any more of that sort of talk, you've got to go and sit

63
0:03:02.195,000 --> 0:03:05,000
over there with them."

64
0:03:05.975,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I thought about it for a nanosecond.

65
0:03:07.577,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I took one look at the road map of life,

66
0:03:11.353,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I ran off down the street marked "Geek"

67
0:03:15.181,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as fast as my chubby, asthmatic little legs would carry me.

68
0:03:20.623,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I fell in love with mathematics from the earliest of ages.

69
0:03:24.351,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I explained it to all my friends. Maths is beautiful.

70
0:03:27.209,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's natural. It's everywhere.

71
0:03:29.193,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Numbers are the musical notes

72
0:03:32.498,000 --> 0:03:36,000
with which the symphony of the universe is written.

73
0:03:36.72,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The great Descartes said something quite similar.

74
0:03:39.003,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The universe "is written in the mathematical language."

75
0:03:41.713,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And today, I want to show you one of those musical notes,

76
0:03:45.937,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a number so beautiful, so massive,

77
0:03:50.329,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I think it will blow your mind.

78
0:03:52.902,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Today we're going to talk about prime numbers.

79
0:03:55.649,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Most of you I'm sure remember that six is not prime

80
0:03:59.615,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because it's 2 x 3.

81
0:04:01.931,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Seven is prime because it's 1 x 7,

82
0:04:05.545,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but we can't break it down into any smaller chunks,

83
0:04:08.148,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or as we call them, factors.

84
0:04:10.131,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now a few things you might like to know about prime numbers.

85
0:04:12.621,000 --> 0:04:14,000
One is not prime.

86
0:04:14.632,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The proof of that is a great party trick

87
0:04:17.172,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that admittedly only works at certain parties.

88
0:04:20.076,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:23.066,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Another thing about primes, there is no final biggest prime number.

90
0:04:26.728,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They keep going on forever.

91
0:04:28.14,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We know there are an infinite number of primes

92
0:04:29.979,000 --> 0:04:3,000
due to the brilliant mathematician Euclid.

93
0:04:31.929,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Over thousands of years ago, he proved that for us.

94
0:04:35.161,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But the third thing about prime numbers,

95
0:04:36.858,000 --> 0:04:37,000
mathematicians have always wondered,

96
0:04:38.368,000 --> 0:04:4,000
well at any given moment in time,

97
0:04:40.63,000 --> 0:04:42,000
what is the biggest prime that we know about?

98
0:04:43.433,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Today we're going to hunt for that massive prime.

99
0:04:47.741,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Don't freak out.

100
0:04:50.888,000 --> 0:04:53,000
All you need to know, of all the mathematics

101
0:04:53.889,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you've ever learned, unlearned, crammed, forgotten,

102
0:04:58.374,000 --> 0:04:59,000
never understood in the first place,

103
0:05:00.107,000 --> 0:05:02,000
all you need to know is this:

104
0:05:02.492,000 --> 0:05:06,000
When I say 2 ^ 5,

105
0:05:06.739,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I'm talking about five little number twos next to each other

106
0:05:09.586,000 --> 0:05:1,000
all multiplied together,

107
0:05:10.881,000 --> 0:05:13,000
2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2.

108
0:05:14.097,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So 2 ^ 5 is 2 x 2 = 4,

109
0:05:17.501,000 --> 0:05:19,000
8, 16, 32.

110
0:05:19.681,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you've got that, you're with me for the entire journey. Okay?

111
0:05:23.195,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So 2 ^ 5,

112
0:05:25.167,000 --> 0:05:26,000
those five little twos multiplied together.

113
0:05:26.879,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(2 ^ 5) - 1 = 31.

114
0:05:31.142,000 --> 0:05:34,000
31 is a prime number, and that five in the power

115
0:05:34.453,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is also a prime number.

116
0:05:36.998,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And the vast bulk of massive primes we've ever found

117
0:05:40.502,000 --> 0:05:41,000
are of that form:

118
0:05:41.738,000 --> 0:05:44,000
two to a prime number, take away one.

119
0:05:45.017,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I won't go into great detail as to why,

120
0:05:47.434,000 --> 0:05:49,000
because most of your eyes will bleed out of your head if I do,

121
0:05:50.185,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but suffice to say, a number of that form

122
0:05:54.396,000 --> 0:05:57,000
is fairly easy to test for primacy.

123
0:05:57.859,000 --> 0:06:,000
A random odd number is a lot harder to test.

124
0:06:01.459,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But as soon as we go hunting for massive primes,

125
0:06:03.38,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we realize it's not enough

126
0:06:05.219,000 --> 0:06:07,000
just to put in any prime number in the power.

127
0:06:07.96,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(2 ^ 11) - 1 = 2,047,

128
0:06:10.557,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and you don't need me to tell you that's 23 x 89.

129
0:06:13.925,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:16.051,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But (2 ^ 13) - 1, (2 ^ 17) - 1

131
0:06:19.291,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(2 ^ 19) - 1, are all prime numbers.

132
0:06:22.648,000 --> 0:06:24,000
After that point, they thin out a lot.

133
0:06:25.517,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And one of the things about the search for massive primes

134
0:06:27.647,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that I love so much is some of the great mathematical minds

135
0:06:30.786,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of all time have gone on this search.

136
0:06:33.303,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.

137
0:06:36.04,000 --> 0:06:38,000
In the 1700s, other mathematicians said

138
0:06:38.501,000 --> 0:06:41,000
he is simply the master of us all.

139
0:06:41.533,000 --> 0:06:44,000
He was so respected, they put him on European currency

140
0:06:44.721,000 --> 0:06:46,000
back when that was a compliment.

141
0:06:47.366,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:52.346,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Euler discovered at the time the world's biggest prime:

143
0:06:55.429,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(2 ^ 31) - 1.

144
0:06:57.216,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's over two billion.

145
0:06:59.564,000 --> 0:07:01,000
He proved it was prime with nothing more

146
0:07:01.599,000 --> 0:07:04,000
than a quill, ink, paper and his mind.

147
0:07:05.387,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You think that's big.

148
0:07:06.341,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We know that (2 ^ 127) - 1

149
0:07:09.618,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is a prime number.

150
0:07:11.212,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's an absolute brute.

151
0:07:12.856,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Look at it here: 39 digits long,

152
0:07:16.861,000 --> 0:07:19,000
proven to be prime in 1876

153
0:07:20.224,000 --> 0:07:22,000
by a mathematician called Lucas.

154
0:07:22.288,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Word up, L-Dog.

155
0:07:24.224,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:25.969,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But one of the great things about the search for massive primes,

157
0:07:28.363,000 --> 0:07:29,000
it's not just finding the primes.

158
0:07:29.56,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Sometimes proving another number not to be prime is just as exciting.

159
0:07:33.811,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Lucas again, in 1876, showed us (2 ^ 67) - 1,

160
0:07:39.593,000 --> 0:07:41,000
21 digits long, was not prime.

161
0:07:42.269,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But he didn't know what the factors were.

162
0:07:44.698,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We knew it was like six, but we didn't know

163
0:07:46.483,000 --> 0:07:48,000
what are the 2 x 3 that multiply together

164
0:07:48.904,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to give us that massive number.

165
0:07:50.154,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We didn't know for almost 40 years

166
0:07:52.195,000 --> 0:07:54,000
until Frank Nelson Cole came along.

167
0:07:55.117,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And at a gathering of prestigious American mathematicians,

168
0:07:57.495,000 --> 0:08:,000
he walked to the board, took up a piece of chalk,

169
0:08:01.291,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and started writing out the powers of two:

170
0:08:04.056,000 --> 0:08:07,000
two, four, eight, 16 --

171
0:08:07.177,000 --> 0:08:08,000
come on, join in with me, you know how it goes --

172
0:08:08.833,000 --> 0:08:11,000
32, 64, 128, 256,

173
0:08:12.699,000 --> 0:08:16,000
512, 1,024, 2,048.

174
0:08:17.355,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I'm in geek heaven. We'll stop it there for a second.

175
0:08:19.907,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Frank Nelson Cole did not stop there.

176
0:08:22.677,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He went on and on

177
0:08:24.34,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and calculated 67 powers of two.

178
0:08:28.009,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He took away one and wrote that number on the board.

179
0:08:30.501,000 --> 0:08:34,000
A frisson of excitement went around the room.

180
0:08:34.842,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It got even more exciting when he then wrote down

181
0:08:37.104,000 --> 0:08:41,000
these two large prime numbers in your standard multiplication format --

182
0:08:41.509,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and for the rest of the hour of his talk

183
0:08:45.416,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Frank Nelson Cole busted that out.

184
0:08:50.049,000 --> 0:08:52,000
He had found the prime factors

185
0:08:52.223,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of (2 ^ 67) - 1.

186
0:08:54.633,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The room went berserk --

187
0:08:57.135,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter) --

188
0:08:58.955,000 --> 0:09:,000
as Frank Nelson Cole sat down,

189
0:09:00.997,000 --> 0:09:03,000
having delivered the only talk in the history of mathematics

190
0:09:04.344,000 --> 0:09:06,000
with no words.

191
0:09:07.153,000 --> 0:09:09,000
He admitted afterwards it wasn't that hard to do.

192
0:09:09.84,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It took focus. It took dedication.

193
0:09:12.49,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It took him, by his estimate,

194
0:09:14.49,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"three years of Sundays."

195
0:09:18.461,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But then in the field of mathematics,

196
0:09:20.799,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as in so many of the fields that we've heard from in this TED,

197
0:09:23.914,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the age of the computer goes along and things explode.

198
0:09:28.257,000 --> 0:09:3,000
These are the largest prime numbers we knew

199
0:09:30.694,000 --> 0:09:33,000
decade by decade, each one dwarfing the one before

200
0:09:34.101,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as computers took over and our power to calculate

201
0:09:37.301,000 --> 0:09:38,000
just grew and grew.

202
0:09:39.23,000 --> 0:09:42,000
This is the largest prime number we knew in 1996,

203
0:09:42.295,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a very emotional year for me.

204
0:09:44.315,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It was the year I left university.

205
0:09:46.25,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I was torn between mathematics and media.

206
0:09:48.875,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It was a tough decision. I loved university.

207
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
My arts degree was the best nine and a half years of my life.

208
0:09:55.203,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:57.786,000 --> 0:10:,000
But I came to a realization about my own ability.

210
0:10:01.413,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Put simply, in a room full of randomly selected people,

211
0:10:04.93,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I'm a maths genius.

212
0:10:06.805,000 --> 0:10:08,000
In a roomful of maths Ph.Ds,

213
0:10:08.882,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I'm as dumb as a box of hammers.

214
0:10:12.611,000 --> 0:10:13,000
My skill is not in the mathematics.

215
0:10:14.358,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It is in telling the story of the mathematics.

216
0:10:18.25,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And during that time, since I've left university,

217
0:10:20.436,000 --> 0:10:22,000
these numbers have got bigger and bigger,

218
0:10:22.572,000 --> 0:10:23,000
each one dwarfing the last,

219
0:10:24.338,000 --> 0:10:28,000
until along came this man, Dr. Curtis Cooper,

220
0:10:29.231,000 --> 0:10:32,000
who a few years ago held the record for the largest ever prime,

221
0:10:32.59,000 --> 0:10:35,000
only to see it snatched away by a rival university.

222
0:10:35.895,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And then Curtis Cooper got it back.

223
0:10:40.072,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Not years ago, not months ago, days ago.

224
0:10:45.399,000 --> 0:10:46,000
In an amazing moment of serendipity,

225
0:10:47.043,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I had to send TED a new slide

226
0:10:51.195,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to show you what this guy had done.

227
0:10:53.205,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I still remember -- (Applause) --

228
0:10:55.855,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I still remember when it happened.

229
0:10:57.358,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I was doing my breakfast radio show.

230
0:10:58.806,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I looked down on Twitter. There was a tweet:

231
0:11:00.178,000 --> 0:11:02,000
"Adam, have you seen the new largest prime number?"

232
0:11:02.483,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I shivered --

233
0:11:03.897,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Laughter) --

234
0:11:05.637,000 --> 0:11:08,000
contacted the women who produced my radio show out in the other room,

235
0:11:08.719,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and said "Girls, hold the front page.

236
0:11:11.17,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We're not talking politics today.

237
0:11:12.63,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We're not talking sport today.

238
0:11:14.587,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They found another megaprime."

239
0:11:16.917,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The girls just shook their heads,

240
0:11:18.429,000 --> 0:11:2,000
put them in their hands, and let me go my own way.

241
0:11:20.666,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It's because of Curtis Cooper that we know,

242
0:11:23.242,000 --> 0:11:25,000
currently the largest prime number we know,

243
0:11:25.571,000 --> 0:11:33,000
is 2 ^ 57,885,161.

244
0:11:33.581,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Don't forget to subtract the one.

245
0:11:36.384,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This number is almost 17 and a half million digits long.

246
0:11:43.608,000 --> 0:11:46,000
If you typed it out on a computer and saved it as a text file,

247
0:11:47.034,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that's 22 meg.

248
0:11:49.829,000 --> 0:11:51,000
For the slightly less geeky of you,

249
0:11:51.873,000 --> 0:11:53,000
think about the Harry Potter novels, okay?

250
0:11:54.01,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is the first Harry Potter novel.

251
0:11:56.36,000 --> 0:11:57,000
This is all seven Harry Potter novels,

252
0:11:58.062,000 --> 0:12:,000
because she did tend to faff on a bit near the end.

253
0:12:00.424,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:03.943,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Written out as a book, this number would run

255
0:12:06.255,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the length of the Harry Potter novels and half again.

256
0:12:10.73,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Here's a slide of the first 1,000 digits of this prime.

257
0:12:16.269,000 --> 0:12:19,000
If, when TED had begun, at 11 o'clock on Tuesday,

258
0:12:19.39,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we'd walked out and simply hit one slide every second,

259
0:12:23.958,000 --> 0:12:28,000
it would have taken five hours to show you that number.

260
0:12:29.328,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I was keen to do it, could not convince Bono.

261
0:12:32.294,000 --> 0:12:34,000
That's the way it goes.

262
0:12:34.897,000 --> 0:12:38,000
This number is 17 and a half thousand slides long,

263
0:12:39.317,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and we know it is prime as confidently

264
0:12:43.44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
as we know the number seven is prime.

265
0:12:46.814,000 --> 0:12:51,000
That fills me with almost sexual excitement.

266
0:12:52.5,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And who am I kidding when I say almost?

267
0:12:54.683,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Laughter)

268
0:12:57.245,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I know what you're thinking:

269
0:12:58.896,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Adam, we're happy that you're happy,

270
0:13:03.875,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but why should we care?

271
0:13:06.373,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Let me give you just three reasons why this is so beautiful.

272
0:13:09.083,000 --> 0:13:12,000
First of all, as I explained, to ask a computer

273
0:13:12.634,000 --> 0:13:15,000
"Is that number prime?" to type it in its abbreviated form,

274
0:13:15.713,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and then only about six lines of code is the test for primacy,

275
0:13:19.915,000 --> 0:13:21,000
is a remarkably simple question to ask.

276
0:13:22.236,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It's got a remarkably clear yes/no answer,

277
0:13:25.249,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and just requires phenomenal grunt.

278
0:13:27.806,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Large prime numbers are a great way of testing

279
0:13:29.975,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the speed and accuracy of computer chips.

280
0:13:32.608,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But secondly, as Curtis Cooper was looking for that monster prime,

281
0:13:35.409,000 --> 0:13:36,000
he wasn't the only guy searching.

282
0:13:37.334,000 --> 0:13:38,000
My laptop at home was looking through

283
0:13:38.519,000 --> 0:13:4,000
four potential candidate primes myself

284
0:13:40.794,000 --> 0:13:43,000
as part of a networked computer hunt around the world

285
0:13:44.45,000 --> 0:13:45,000
for these large numbers.

286
0:13:45.705,000 --> 0:13:46,000
The discovery of that prime is similar to the work

287
0:13:47.634,000 --> 0:13:5,000
people are doing in unraveling RNA sequences,

288
0:13:50.836,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in searching through data from SETI and other astronomical projects.

289
0:13:53.908,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs

290
0:13:57.15,000 --> 0:13:59,000
are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia

291
0:13:59.669,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but on laptops, desktops,

292
0:14:01.783,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in the palms of people's hands

293
0:14:03.649,000 --> 0:14:06,000
who are simply helping out for the search.

294
0:14:07.062,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But for me it's amazing because it's a metaphor

295
0:14:09.391,000 --> 0:14:1,000
for the time in which we live,

296
0:14:11.328,000 --> 0:14:15,000
when human minds and machines can conquer together.

297
0:14:16.172,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We've heard a lot about robots in this TED.

298
0:14:18.531,000 --> 0:14:19,000
We've heard a lot about what they can and can't do.

299
0:14:20.141,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It is true, you can now download onto your smartphone

300
0:14:22.663,000 --> 0:14:25,000
an app that would beat most grandmasters at chess.

301
0:14:26.558,000 --> 0:14:27,000
You think that's cool.

302
0:14:28.022,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Here's a machine doing something cool.

303
0:14:30.588,000 --> 0:14:32,000
This is the CubeStormer II.

304
0:14:32.774,000 --> 0:14:35,000
It can take a randomly shuffled Rubik's Cube.

305
0:14:36.595,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Using the power of the smartphone,

306
0:14:39.161,000 --> 0:14:46,000
it can examine the cube and solve the cube

307
0:14:46.354,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in five seconds.

308
0:14:49.053,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Applause)

309
0:14:52.934,000 --> 0:14:56,000
That scares some people. That excites me.

310
0:14:56.999,000 --> 0:14:59,000
How lucky are we to live in this age

311
0:15:00.23,000 --> 0:15:03,000
when mind and machine can work together?

312
0:15:03.523,000 --> 0:15:05,000
I was asked in an interview last year in my capacity

313
0:15:05.795,000 --> 0:15:07,000
as a lower-case "c" celebrity in Australia,

314
0:15:08.783,000 --> 0:15:1,000
"What was your highlight of 2012?"

315
0:15:10.788,000 --> 0:15:11,000
People were expecting me to talk about

316
0:15:12.25,000 --> 0:15:14,000
my beloved Sydney Swans football team.

317
0:15:14.918,000 --> 0:15:17,000
In our beautiful, indigenous sport of Australian football,

318
0:15:17.926,000 --> 0:15:19,000
they won the equivalent of the Super Bowl.

319
0:15:20.06,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I was there. It was the most emotional, exciting day.

320
0:15:23.051,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It wasn't my highlight of 2012.

321
0:15:25.165,000 --> 0:15:26,000
People thought it might have been an interview I'd done on my show.

322
0:15:27.128,000 --> 0:15:29,000
It might have been a politician. It might have been a breakthrough.

323
0:15:29.196,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It might have been a book I read, the arts. No, no, no.

324
0:15:31.251,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It might have been something my two gorgeous daughters had done.

325
0:15:33.415,000 --> 0:15:36,000
No, it wasn't. The highlight of 2012, so clearly,

326
0:15:36.994,000 --> 0:15:39,000
was the discovery of the Higgs boson.

327
0:15:40.626,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Give it up for the fundamental particle

328
0:15:43.302,000 --> 0:15:46,000
that bequeaths all other fundamental particles their mass.

329
0:15:46.307,000 --> 0:15:47,000
(Applause)

330
0:15:47.803,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And what was so gorgeous about this discovery was

331
0:15:50.616,000 --> 0:15:52,000
50 years ago Peter Higgs and his team

332
0:15:52.852,000 --> 0:15:54,000
considered one of the deepest of all questions:

333
0:15:55.262,000 --> 0:15:59,000
How is it that the things that make us up have no mass?

334
0:15:59.902,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I've clearly got mass. Where does it come from?

335
0:16:04.361,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And he postulated a suggestion

336
0:16:06.175,000 --> 0:16:09,000
that there's this infinite, incredibly small field

337
0:16:09.845,000 --> 0:16:11,000
stretching throughout the universe,

338
0:16:11.963,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and as other particles go through those particles

339
0:16:14.048,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and interact, that's where they get their mass.

340
0:16:16.44,000 --> 0:16:18,000
The rest of the scientific community said,

341
0:16:18.897,000 --> 0:16:19,000
"Great idea, Higgsy.

342
0:16:20.506,000 --> 0:16:21,000
We've got no idea if we could ever prove it.

343
0:16:22.192,000 --> 0:16:24,000
It's beyond our reach."

344
0:16:24.3,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And within just 50 years,

345
0:16:26.797,000 --> 0:16:31,000
in his lifetime, with him sitting in the audience,

346
0:16:32.681,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we had designed the greatest machine ever

347
0:16:36.313,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to prove this incredible idea

348
0:16:39.379,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that originated just in a human mind.

349
0:16:43.342,000 --> 0:16:45,000
That's what is so exciting for me about this prime number.

350
0:16:45.874,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We thought it might be there,

351
0:16:47.96,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and we went and found it.

352
0:16:50.38,000 --> 0:16:53,000
That is the essence of being human.

353
0:16:54.28,000 --> 0:16:57,000
That is what we are all about.

354
0:16:57.954,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Or as my friend Descartes might put it,

355
0:16:59.923,000 --> 0:17:,000
we think,

356
0:17:01.636,000 --> 0:17:03,000
therefore we are.

357
0:17:04.049,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Thank you.

358
0:17:05.44,000 --> 0:17:1,000
(Applause)

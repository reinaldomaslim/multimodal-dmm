1
0:00:14.585,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What do you see?

2
0:00:17.888,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Most of you see a barbershop,

3
0:00:20.792,000 --> 0:00:22,000
but I see an opportunity:

4
0:00:23.704,000 --> 0:00:25,000
an opportunity for health,

5
0:00:26.453,000 --> 0:00:28,000
an opportunity for health equity.

6
0:00:30.112,000 --> 0:00:33,000
For black men, the barbershop is not just a place

7
0:00:33.826,000 --> 0:00:35,000
where you get your hair cut or your beard trimmed.

8
0:00:37.328,000 --> 0:00:39,000
No, it's much more than that.

9
0:00:40.465,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Historically, the barbershop has been a safe haven for black men.

10
0:00:45.364,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's a place where we go for friendship,

11
0:00:48.594,000 --> 0:00:5,000
solidarity and solace.

12
0:00:52.094,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's a place where we go to get away from the stress

13
0:00:55.711,000 --> 0:00:58,000
of the grind of work

14
0:00:58.982,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and sometimes home life.

15
0:01:02.241,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's a place where we don't have to worry

16
0:01:04.226,000 --> 0:01:06,000
about how we're being perceived by the outside world.

17
0:01:08.233,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's a place where we don't feel threatened,

18
0:01:11.566,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or threatening.

19
0:01:15.082,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It's a place of loyalty and trust.

20
0:01:18.335,000 --> 0:01:2,000
For that reason,

21
0:01:20.502,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it's one of the few places where we can fearlessly be ourselves

22
0:01:24.425,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and just ... talk.

23
0:01:28.533,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The talk, the shop talk, the conversation,

24
0:01:31.558,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that is the essence of the black barbershop.

25
0:01:35.178,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I can remember going to the barbershop with my dad as a kid.

26
0:01:39.134,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We went to Mr. Mike's barbershop every other Saturday.

27
0:01:43.53,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And like clockwork, the same group of men would be there

28
0:01:47.221,000 --> 0:01:48,000
every time we went,

29
0:01:48.966,000 --> 0:01:5,000
either waiting on their favorite barber

30
0:01:51.347,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or just soaking up the atmosphere.

31
0:01:55.321,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I can remember the jovial greeting that warmly welcomed us

32
0:01:59.193,000 --> 0:02:,000
every time we went.

33
0:02:01.677,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Hey Rev," they would say to my dad.

34
0:02:05.726,000 --> 0:02:07,000
He's a local pastor, and they treated him like a celebrity.

35
0:02:09.923,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"Hey young fella, how you doing?"

36
0:02:12.266,000 --> 0:02:13,000
they would say to me,

37
0:02:13.742,000 --> 0:02:15,000
making me feel just as special.

38
0:02:17.118,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I remember the range of the conversations was immense.

39
0:02:22.173,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The men would talk about politics and sports and music

40
0:02:27.205,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and world news, national news,

41
0:02:30.776,000 --> 0:02:31,000
neighborhood news.

42
0:02:33.064,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There was some talk about women

43
0:02:36.387,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and what it was like to be a black man in America.

44
0:02:40.585,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But many times they also talked about health.

45
0:02:45.171,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The conversations about health were lengthy and deep.

46
0:02:49.395,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The men often recounted their doctor's recommendations

47
0:02:52.608,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to cut salt in their diet

48
0:02:54.723,000 --> 0:02:56,000
or to eat less fried foods

49
0:02:57.468,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or to stop smoking

50
0:02:59.713,000 --> 0:03:,000
or to reduce stress.

51
0:03:01.911,000 --> 0:03:04,000
They talked about the different ways you could reduce stress,

52
0:03:05.356,000 --> 0:03:07,000
like simplifying one's love life --

53
0:03:08.378,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:12.866,000 --> 0:03:15,000
all ways to treat high blood pressure.

55
0:03:17.585,000 --> 0:03:2,000
There's a lot of talk about high blood pressure in the barbershop.

56
0:03:22.261,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That's because almost 40 percent of black men have it.

57
0:03:28.14,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That means that almost every single black man

58
0:03:32.157,000 --> 0:03:33,000
either has high blood pressure

59
0:03:34.123,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or knows a black man who has it.

60
0:03:37.94,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Sometimes, those conversations in the barbershop

61
0:03:41.211,000 --> 0:03:43,000
would be about what happens when high blood pressure

62
0:03:43.874,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is not adequately addressed.

63
0:03:47.318,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"Say, did you hear about Jimmy? He had a stroke."

64
0:03:53.612,000 --> 0:03:57,000
"Did you hear about Eddie? He died last week.

65
0:03:57.891,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Massive heart attack.

66
0:03:59.603,000 --> 0:04:,000
He was 50."

67
0:04:02.584,000 --> 0:04:05,000
More black men die from high blood pressure than from anything else,

68
0:04:06.527,000 --> 0:04:1,000
even though decades of medical wisdom and science have demonstrated

69
0:04:11.446,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that death from high blood pressure can be prevented

70
0:04:14.614,000 --> 0:04:17,000
with timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

71
0:04:19.132,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So why is high blood pressure so differentially deadly for black men?

72
0:04:24.457,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Because too often, high blood pressure is either untreated

73
0:04:28.391,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or under-treated in black men,

74
0:04:31.056,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in part because of our lower engagement with the primary healthcare system.

75
0:04:36.558,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Black men, in particular those with high blood pressure,

76
0:04:40.363,000 --> 0:04:42,000
are less likely to have a primary care doctor

77
0:04:42.491,000 --> 0:04:43,000
than other groups.

78
0:04:44.238,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But why?

79
0:04:46.381,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Some of our earliest research on black men's health

80
0:04:49.505,000 --> 0:04:53,000
revealed that for many, the doctor's office is associated with fear,

81
0:04:55.09,000 --> 0:04:56,000
mistrust,

82
0:04:57.039,000 --> 0:04:59,000
disrespect,

83
0:04:59.084,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and unnecessary unpleasantness.

84
0:05:03.074,000 --> 0:05:07,000
The doctor's office is only a place that you go when you don't feel well.

85
0:05:07.902,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And when you do go, you might wait for hours

86
0:05:11.216,000 --> 0:05:13,000
only to get the run-around

87
0:05:13.589,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and to be evaluated by a stoic figure in a white coat

88
0:05:18.184,000 --> 0:05:2,000
who only has 10 minutes to give you

89
0:05:20.835,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and who doesn't value the talk.

90
0:05:25.215,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So it's no wonder that some men don't want to be bothered

91
0:05:28.707,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and skip going to the doctor altogether,

92
0:05:32.027,000 --> 0:05:34,000
especially if they feel fine.

93
0:05:35.402,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But herein lies the problem.

94
0:05:38.328,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You can feel just fine

95
0:05:40.473,000 --> 0:05:43,000
while high blood pressure ravages your most vital organs.

96
0:05:46.834,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is Denny Moe,

97
0:05:49.525,000 --> 0:05:52,000
owner of Denny Moe's Superstar Barbershop in Harlem.

98
0:05:53.738,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I've been lucky enough to have Denny as my barber for the last eight years.

99
0:05:58.54,000 --> 0:05:59,000
He said to me once,

100
0:06:00.245,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"Hey Doc, you know,

101
0:06:02.318,000 --> 0:06:06,000
lots of black men trust their barbers more than they trust their doctors."

102
0:06:07.879,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This was stunning to me,

103
0:06:09.961,000 --> 0:06:1,000
at first,

104
0:06:11.769,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but not so much when you think about it.

105
0:06:14.871,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Black men have been with their current barbers

106
0:06:17.611,000 --> 0:06:19,000
on average as long as I've been with Denny,

107
0:06:19.636,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about eight years.

108
0:06:21.674,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And black men see their barbers about every two weeks.

109
0:06:26.841,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Not only do you trust your barber with your look and with your style,

110
0:06:31.468,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but you also trust him with your secrets and sometimes your life.

111
0:06:37.191,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Denny, like many barbers, is more than just an artist,

112
0:06:40.843,000 --> 0:06:42,000
a businessman and confidant.

113
0:06:43.906,000 --> 0:06:47,000
He's a leader and a passionate advocate for the well-being of his community.

114
0:06:50.969,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The very first time I walked into Denny Moe's shop,

115
0:06:53.971,000 --> 0:06:54,000
he wasn't just cutting hair.

116
0:06:56.445,000 --> 0:06:59,000
He was also orchestrating a voter registration drive

117
0:07:00.222,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to give a voice to his customers and his community.

118
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
With this kind of activism,

119
0:07:09.206,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and community investment that typifies the black barbershop,

120
0:07:13.467,000 --> 0:07:16,000
of course the barbershop is a perfect place

121
0:07:17.039,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to talk about high blood pressure and other health concerns in the community.

122
0:07:21.944,000 --> 0:07:25,000
First, the barbershop is not a medical setting,

123
0:07:26.118,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and so it doesn't have all the negative psychological baggage

124
0:07:29.387,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that comes along with that.

125
0:07:31.428,000 --> 0:07:33,000
When you're in a barbershop,

126
0:07:33.507,000 --> 0:07:36,000
you're in your territory, and you're among friends

127
0:07:36.96,000 --> 0:07:38,000
who share your history,

128
0:07:39.246,000 --> 0:07:42,000
your struggle and your health risks.

129
0:07:43.308,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Second, because the barbershop is a place of connection,

130
0:07:47.393,000 --> 0:07:49,000
loyalty and trust,

131
0:07:49.919,000 --> 0:07:52,000
it's a place where you're more open to have a conversation about health

132
0:07:53.452,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and especially about high blood pressure.

133
0:07:56.165,000 --> 0:07:57,000
After all,

134
0:07:57.659,000 --> 0:08:01,000
conversations about high blood pressure have all the elements of great shop talk:

135
0:08:03.017,000 --> 0:08:05,000
stress and high blood pressure,

136
0:08:05.642,000 --> 0:08:07,000
food and high blood pressure,

137
0:08:08.196,000 --> 0:08:1,000
relationships and high blood pressure,

138
0:08:10.857,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and yes, what it's like to be a black man in America

139
0:08:14.816,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and high blood pressure.

140
0:08:17.846,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But you can do more than just talk about high blood pressure

141
0:08:20.942,000 --> 0:08:21,000
in the barbershop.

142
0:08:22.675,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You can concretely take action.

143
0:08:25.915,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Here we have an opportunity to partner with the Denny Moe's of the world

144
0:08:30.697,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and empower communities to address the health inequities

145
0:08:34.999,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that uniquely affect it.

146
0:08:37.364,000 --> 0:08:4,000
When high blood pressure screening expanded from clinics and hospitals

147
0:08:40.848,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to communities in the 1960s and '70s,

148
0:08:43.999,000 --> 0:08:46,000
black physicians like Dr. Eli Saunders in Baltimore

149
0:08:47.38,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and Dr. Keith Ferdinand in New Orleans

150
0:08:49.889,000 --> 0:08:53,000
were at the forefront of bringing health promotion to community hubs

151
0:08:53.988,000 --> 0:08:54,000
in urban black neighborhoods.

152
0:08:56.409,000 --> 0:09:,000
These pioneers paved the way for my professional journey

153
0:09:00.573,000 --> 0:09:01,000
with barbershops and health,

154
0:09:02.58,000 --> 0:09:05,000
which began in Chicago in medical school.

155
0:09:07.372,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The very first research project that I worked on as a medical student

156
0:09:10.878,000 --> 0:09:12,000
was to help design healthcare interventions

157
0:09:13.402,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that would appeal to black men.

158
0:09:16.844,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We conducted about a dozen focus groups

159
0:09:19.751,000 --> 0:09:22,000
with a broad cross-section of black men,

160
0:09:23.05,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and we learned that for them,

161
0:09:25.188,000 --> 0:09:29,000
being healthy was as much about being perceived as healthy

162
0:09:29.595,000 --> 0:09:31,000
as it was about feeling healthy,

163
0:09:31.867,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and that feeling good went hand in hand with looking good.

164
0:09:38.009,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This work led to the development of Project Brotherhood,

165
0:09:41.882,000 --> 0:09:43,000
a community clinic founded by Dr. Eric Whitaker

166
0:09:44.811,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that provided tailored healthcare to black men.

167
0:09:48.715,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Part of this tailored care

168
0:09:50.747,000 --> 0:09:52,000
involved having a barber on the premises

169
0:09:53.572,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to reward the men who came for needed healthcare

170
0:09:57.199,000 --> 0:09:58,000
with a free haircut,

171
0:09:59.188,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to let the men know that we, too, valued how they looked

172
0:10:03.158,000 --> 0:10:04,000
as well as how they felt,

173
0:10:05.052,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and that what was important to them was also important to us.

174
0:10:10.32,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But while there's only one Project Brotherhood,

175
0:10:13.572,000 --> 0:10:16,000
there are thousands of black barbershops

176
0:10:16.917,000 --> 0:10:2,000
where the intersection of health and haircuts can be cultivated.

177
0:10:22.782,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The next stop on my journey was Dallas, Texas,

178
0:10:26.178,000 --> 0:10:29,000
where we learned that barbers were not only willing

179
0:10:29.219,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but fully able to roll up their sleeves and participate

180
0:10:33.282,000 --> 0:10:38,000
in delivering needed health services to improve the health of their customers

181
0:10:38.83,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and their community.

182
0:10:40.916,000 --> 0:10:43,000
We teamed up with an amazing cadre of black barbers

183
0:10:44.413,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and taught them how to measure blood pressure

184
0:10:46.581,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and how to counsel their customers

185
0:10:48.386,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and refer them to doctors

186
0:10:50.237,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to help manage high blood pressure.

187
0:10:52.977,000 --> 0:10:54,000
The barbers were not only willing to do it

188
0:10:55.263,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but they were damn good at it.

189
0:10:57.794,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Over a three-year period,

190
0:10:59.772,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the barbers measured thousands of blood pressures

191
0:11:02.74,000 --> 0:11:06,000
resulting in hundreds of black men being referred to doctors

192
0:11:07.565,000 --> 0:11:1,000
for medical care of their high blood pressure.

193
0:11:11.232,000 --> 0:11:13,000
These barber-doctor partnerships

194
0:11:14.168,000 --> 0:11:18,000
resulted in a 20 percent increase in the number of men

195
0:11:18.676,000 --> 0:11:2,000
who were able to achieve target blood pressure levels

196
0:11:21.493,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and a three-point drop, on average,

197
0:11:23.977,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in the blood pressure of each participant.

198
0:11:26.421,000 --> 0:11:28,000
If we were to extrapolate that three point drop

199
0:11:29.413,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to every single black man with high blood pressure in America,

200
0:11:32.842,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we would prevent 800 heart attacks, 500 strokes and 900 deaths

201
0:11:39.113,000 --> 0:11:4,000
from high blood pressure

202
0:11:40.995,000 --> 0:11:41,000
in just one year.

203
0:11:44.802,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And our experience with barbershops has been no different in New York City,

204
0:11:49.048,000 --> 0:11:5,000
where my journey has currently led me.

205
0:11:51.722,000 --> 0:11:54,000
With an incredible team of diverse research assistants,

206
0:11:55.69,000 --> 0:11:58,000
community health workers and volunteers,

207
0:11:58.84,000 --> 0:12:01,000
we've been able to partner with over 200 barbershops

208
0:12:02.265,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and other trusted community venues

209
0:12:04.773,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to reach over 7,000 older black men.

210
0:12:08.564,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And we've offered high blood pressure screening and counseling

211
0:12:11.501,000 --> 0:12:12,000
to each and every one of them.

212
0:12:13.81,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thanks to Denny Moe

213
0:12:15.519,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and the myriad other barbers and community leaders

214
0:12:19.146,000 --> 0:12:23,000
who shared the vision of opportunity and empowerment

215
0:12:24.114,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to make a difference in their communities,

216
0:12:26.844,000 --> 0:12:28,000
we've been able to not only lower blood pressure

217
0:12:29.623,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in our participants,

218
0:12:31.107,000 --> 0:12:34,000
but we've also been able to impact other health indicators.

219
0:12:38.3,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So what do you see?

220
0:12:41.532,000 --> 0:12:42,000
What is your barbershop?

221
0:12:45.694,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Where is that place for you

222
0:12:49.574,000 --> 0:12:51,000
where people who are affected by a unique problem

223
0:12:53.123,000 --> 0:12:54,000
can meet a unique solution?

224
0:12:57.567,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When you find that place, see the opportunity.

225
0:13:02.603,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Thank you.

226
0:13:03.778,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

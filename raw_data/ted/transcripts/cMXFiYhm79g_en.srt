1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Meet Tony. He's my student.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
He's about my age,

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and he's in San Quentin State Prison.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
When Tony was 16 years old,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
one day, one moment,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"It was mom's gun.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Just flash it, scare the guy. He's a punk.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He took some money; we'll take his money. That'll teach him.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Then last minute, I'm thinking, 'Can't do this. This is wrong.'

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
My buddy says, 'C'mon, let's do this.'

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I say, 'Let's do this.'"

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And those three words, Tony's going to remember,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
because the next thing he knows, he hears the pop.

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
There's the punk on the ground, puddle of blood.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And that's felony murder --

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
25 to life, parole at 50 if you're lucky,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and Tony's not feeling very lucky.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I say, "In this class, we will discuss the foundations of ethics,"

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Tony interrupts me.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"What are you going to teach me about right and wrong?

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I know what is wrong. I have done wrong.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I am told every day,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by every face I see, every wall I face, that I am wrong.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If I ever get out of here, there will always be a mark by my name.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I'm a convict; I am branded 'wrong.'

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
What are you going to tell me about right and wrong?"

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I say to Tony,

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"Sorry, but it's worse than you think.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
You think you know right and wrong?

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Then can you tell me what wrong is?

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
No, don't just give me an example.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I want to know about wrongness itself, the idea of wrong.

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
What is that idea?

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
What makes something wrong?

36
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
How do we know that it's wrong? Maybe you and I disagree.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Maybe it's you, maybe it's me -- but we're not here to trade opinions;

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
everyone's got an opinion.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We are here for knowledge.

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Our enemy is thoughtlessness. This is philosophy."

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And something changes for Tony.

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"Could be I'm wrong. I'm tired of being wrong.

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I want to know what is wrong.

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I want to know what I know."

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy,

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the project that begins in wonder --

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
what Kant called "admiration and awe

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
at the starry sky above and the moral law within."

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
What can creatures like us know of such things?

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence --

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
what Heidegger called "the always already there."

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it --

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
what Socrates called "the examined life."

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Socrates, a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Socrates died in prison,

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
his philosophy intact.

58
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So Tony starts doing his homework.

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
He learns his whys and wherefores, his causes and correlations,

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
his logic, his fallacies.

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Turns out, Tony's got the philosophy muscle.

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
His body is in prison, but his mind is free.

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous,

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the epistemologically anxious,

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the ethically dubious, the metaphysically ridiculous.

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
That's Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and Bill Clinton.

68
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So when he gives me his final paper,

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in which he argues that the categorical imperative

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
is perhaps too uncompromising

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday

72
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and challenges me to tell him

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure,

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I say, "I don't know.

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Let us think about that."

76
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Because in that moment, there's no mark by Tony's name;

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it's just the two of us standing there.

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It is not professor and convict,

79
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it is just two minds ready to do philosophy.

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I say to Tony,

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
"Let's do this."

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Thank you.

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Applause)

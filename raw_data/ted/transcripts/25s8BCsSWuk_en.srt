1
0:00:12.991,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I get out of bed for two reasons.

2
0:00:15.341,000 --> 0:00:19,000
One, small-scale family farmers need more food.

3
0:00:19.738,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's crazy that in 2019 farmers that feed us are hungry.

4
0:00:25.353,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And two, science needs to be more diverse and inclusive.

5
0:00:30.679,000 --> 0:00:33,000
If we're going to solve the toughest challenges on the planet,

6
0:00:34.125,000 --> 0:00:38,000
like food insecurity for the millions living in extreme poverty,

7
0:00:38.482,000 --> 0:00:39,000
it's going to take all of us.

8
0:00:40.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I want to use the latest technology

9
0:00:43.284,000 --> 0:00:46,000
with the most diverse and inclusive teams on the planet

10
0:00:46.601,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to help farmers have more food.

11
0:00:49.545,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm a computational biologist.

12
0:00:51.45,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I know -- what is that and how is it going to help end hunger?

13
0:00:54.878,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Basically, I like computers and biology

14
0:00:58.148,000 --> 0:01:,000
and somehow, putting that together is a job.

15
0:01:00.616,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:01.723,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I don't have a story

17
0:01:03.267,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of wanting to be a biologist from a young age.

18
0:01:06.577,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The truth is, I played basketball in college.

19
0:01:10.585,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And part of my financial aid package was I needed a work-study job.

20
0:01:16.3,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So one random day,

21
0:01:17.864,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I wandered to the nearest building to my dorm room.

22
0:01:21.085,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And it just so happens it was the biology building.

23
0:01:24.347,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I went inside and looked at the job board.

24
0:01:27.493,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Yes, this is pre-the-internet.

25
0:01:30.43,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I saw a three-by-five card

26
0:01:32.461,000 --> 0:01:35,000
advertising a job to work in the herbarium.

27
0:01:36.601,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I quickly took down the number,

28
0:01:38.626,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because it said "flexible hours,"

29
0:01:40.355,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I needed that to work around my basketball schedule.

30
0:01:44.204,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I ran to the library to figure out what an herbarium was.

31
0:01:48.815,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:51.046,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And it turns out

33
0:01:52.379,000 --> 0:01:56,000
an herbarium is where they store dead, dried plants.

34
0:01:57.379,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I was lucky to land the job.

35
0:01:59.117,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So my first scientific job

36
0:02:02.347,000 --> 0:02:07,000
was gluing dead plants onto paper for hours on end.

37
0:02:07.706,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:11.008,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's so glamorous.

39
0:02:12.182,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is how I became a computational biologist.

40
0:02:16.323,000 --> 0:02:17,000
During that time,

41
0:02:17.53,000 --> 0:02:19,000
genomics and computing were coming of age.

42
0:02:20.276,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I went on to do my masters

43
0:02:22.704,000 --> 0:02:25,000
combining biology and computers.

44
0:02:25.823,000 --> 0:02:26,000
During that time,

45
0:02:27.012,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I worked at Los Alamos National Lab

46
0:02:28.815,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in the theoretical biology and biophysics group.

47
0:02:31.776,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And it was there I had my first encounter with the supercomputer,

48
0:02:35.53,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and my mind was blown.

49
0:02:37.84,000 --> 0:02:39,000
With the power of supercomputing,

50
0:02:39.903,000 --> 0:02:43,000
which is basically thousands of connected PCs on steroids,

51
0:02:44.15,000 --> 0:02:49,000
we were able to uncover the complexities of influenza and hepatitis C.

52
0:02:50.134,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And it was during this time that I saw the power

53
0:02:52.489,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of using computers and biology combined, for humanity.

54
0:02:56.633,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I wanted this to be my career path.

55
0:03:00.03,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So, since 1999,

56
0:03:01.831,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I've spent the majority of my scientific career

57
0:03:04.553,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in very high-tech labs,

58
0:03:06.506,000 --> 0:03:08,000
surrounded by really expensive equipment.

59
0:03:09.712,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So many ask me

60
0:03:11.379,000 --> 0:03:14,000
how and why do I work for farmers in Africa.

61
0:03:15.804,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Well, because of my computing skills,

62
0:03:18.13,000 --> 0:03:22,000
in 2013, a team of East African scientists

63
0:03:22.693,000 --> 0:03:26,000
asked me to join the team in the plight to save cassava.

64
0:03:27.766,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Cassava is a plant whose leaves and roots feed 800 million people globally.

65
0:03:35.639,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And 500 million in East Africa.

66
0:03:38.994,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So that's nearly a billion people

67
0:03:41.025,000 --> 0:03:43,000
relying on this plant for their daily calories.

68
0:03:44.581,000 --> 0:03:47,000
If a small-scale family farmer has enough cassava,

69
0:03:48.45,000 --> 0:03:5,000
she can feed her family

70
0:03:50.618,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and she can sell it at the market for important things like school fees,

71
0:03:54.688,000 --> 0:03:56,000
medical expenses and savings.

72
0:03:57.752,000 --> 0:04:,000
But cassava is under attack in Africa.

73
0:04:01.665,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Whiteflies and viruses are devastating cassava.

74
0:04:06.593,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Whiteflies are tiny insects

75
0:04:08.823,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that feed on the leaves of over 600 plants.

76
0:04:11.665,000 --> 0:04:12,000
They are bad news.

77
0:04:13.49,000 --> 0:04:14,000
There are many species;

78
0:04:14.673,000 --> 0:04:16,000
they become pesticide resistant;

79
0:04:16.966,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and they transmit hundreds of plant viruses

80
0:04:21.244,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that cause cassava brown streak disease

81
0:04:23.792,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and cassava mosaic disease.

82
0:04:26.085,000 --> 0:04:28,000
This completely kills the plant.

83
0:04:29.038,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And if there's no cassava,

84
0:04:30.879,000 --> 0:04:33,000
there's no food or income for millions of people.

85
0:04:36.141,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It took me one trip to Tanzania

86
0:04:38.641,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to realize that these women need some help.

87
0:04:41.403,000 --> 0:04:45,000
These amazing, strong, small-scale family farmers,

88
0:04:45.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the majority women,

89
0:04:46.972,000 --> 0:04:47,000
are doing it rough.

90
0:04:48.744,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They don't have enough food to feed their families,

91
0:04:51.204,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and it's a real crisis.

92
0:04:53.53,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What happens is

93
0:04:55.053,000 --> 0:04:57,000
they go out and plant fields of cassava when the rains come.

94
0:04:58.069,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Nine months later,

95
0:04:59.799,000 --> 0:05:02,000
there's nothing, because of these pests and pathogens.

96
0:05:02.903,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And I thought to myself,

97
0:05:05.085,000 --> 0:05:08,000
how in the world can farmers be hungry?

98
0:05:08.815,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So I decided to spend some time on the ground

99
0:05:11.159,000 --> 0:05:12,000
with the farmers and the scientists

100
0:05:12.863,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to see if I had any skills that could be helpful.

101
0:05:16.427,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The situation on the ground is shocking.

102
0:05:19.307,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The whiteflies have destroyed the leaves that are eaten for protein,

103
0:05:23.601,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and the viruses have destroyed the roots that are eaten for starch.

104
0:05:27.592,000 --> 0:05:29,000
An entire growing season will pass,

105
0:05:30.061,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and the farmer will lose an entire year of income and food,

106
0:05:34.195,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and the family will suffer a long hunger season.

107
0:05:37.942,000 --> 0:05:39,000
This is completely preventable.

108
0:05:40.046,000 --> 0:05:41,000
If the farmer knew

109
0:05:41.394,000 --> 0:05:44,000
what variety of cassava to plant in her field,

110
0:05:44.482,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that was resistant to those viruses and pathogens,

111
0:05:48.831,000 --> 0:05:49,000
they would have more food.

112
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We have all the technology we need,

113
0:05:53.619,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but the knowledge and the resources

114
0:05:56.847,000 --> 0:05:59,000
are not equally distributed around the globe.

115
0:06:00.712,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So what I mean specifically is,

116
0:06:03.298,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the older genomic technologies

117
0:06:05.174,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that have been required to uncover the complexities

118
0:06:08.061,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in these pests and pathogens --

119
0:06:11.147,000 --> 0:06:13,000
these technologies were not made for sub-Saharan Africa.

120
0:06:15.058,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They cost upwards of a million dollars;

121
0:06:17.423,000 --> 0:06:18,000
they require constant power

122
0:06:19.335,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and specialized human capacity.

123
0:06:21.97,000 --> 0:06:23,000
These machines are few and far between on the continent,

124
0:06:24.855,000 --> 0:06:28,000
which is leaving many scientists battling on the front lines no choice

125
0:06:29.5,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but to send the samples overseas.

126
0:06:31.523,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And when you send the samples overseas,

127
0:06:33.507,000 --> 0:06:35,000
samples degrade, it costs a lot of money,

128
0:06:36.157,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and trying to get the data back over weak internet

129
0:06:39.348,000 --> 0:06:4,000
is nearly impossible.

130
0:06:41.142,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So sometimes it can take six months to get the results back to the farmer.

131
0:06:45.465,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And by then, it's too late.

132
0:06:47.243,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The crop is already gone,

133
0:06:48.854,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which results in further poverty and more hunger.

134
0:06:53.306,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We knew we could fix this.

135
0:06:55.989,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In 2017,

136
0:06:57.417,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we had heard of this handheld, portable DNA sequencer

137
0:07:02.227,000 --> 0:07:04,000
called an Oxford Nanopore MinION.

138
0:07:04.76,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This was being used in West Africa to fight Ebola.

139
0:07:08.937,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So we thought:

140
0:07:10.458,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Why can't we use this in East Africa to help farmers?

141
0:07:13.768,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So, what we did was we set out to do that.

142
0:07:18.609,000 --> 0:07:2,000
At the time, the technology was very new,

143
0:07:21.331,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and many doubted we could replicate this on the farm.

144
0:07:24.879,000 --> 0:07:25,000
When we set out to do this,

145
0:07:26.22,000 --> 0:07:29,000
one of our "collaborators" in the UK

146
0:07:30.125,000 --> 0:07:33,000
told us that we would never get that to work in East Africa,

147
0:07:33.776,000 --> 0:07:34,000
let alone on the farm.

148
0:07:35.863,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So we accepted the challenge.

149
0:07:37.934,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This person even went so far as to bet us two of the best bottles of champagne

150
0:07:44.411,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that we would never get that to work.

151
0:07:48.871,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Two words:

152
0:07:50.474,000 --> 0:07:51,000
pay up.

153
0:07:51.649,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:53.847,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Applause)

155
0:07:58.023,000 --> 0:08:,000
Pay up, because we did it.

156
0:08:00.96,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We took the entire high-tech molecular lab

157
0:08:04.269,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to the farmers of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda,

158
0:08:07.942,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and we called it Tree Lab.

159
0:08:10.942,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So what did we do?

160
0:08:12.157,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Well, first of all, we gave ourselves a team name --

161
0:08:14.76,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it's called the Cassava Virus Action Project.

162
0:08:16.958,000 --> 0:08:17,000
We made a website,

163
0:08:18.339,000 --> 0:08:21,000
we gathered support from the genomics and computing communities,

164
0:08:21.974,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and away we went to the farmers.

165
0:08:24.411,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Everything that we need for our Tree Lab

166
0:08:27.244,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is being carried by the team here.

167
0:08:29.677,000 --> 0:08:33,000
All of the molecular and computational requirements needed

168
0:08:33.748,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to diagnose sick plants is there.

169
0:08:37.431,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And it's actually all on this stage here as well.

170
0:08:41.161,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We figured if we could get the data closer to the problem,

171
0:08:44.772,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and closer to the farmer,

172
0:08:46.414,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the quicker we could tell her what was wrong with her plant.

173
0:08:50.169,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And not only tell her what was wrong --

174
0:08:52.066,000 --> 0:08:53,000
give her the solution.

175
0:08:53.482,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And the solution is,

176
0:08:54.831,000 --> 0:08:56,000
burn the field and plant varieties

177
0:08:57.478,000 --> 0:09:,000
that are resistant to the pests and pathogens she has in her field.

178
0:09:01.942,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So the first thing that we did was we had to do a DNA extraction.

179
0:09:06.17,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And we used this machine here.

180
0:09:09.05,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's called a PDQeX,

181
0:09:12.273,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which stands for "Pretty Damn Quick Extraction."

182
0:09:16.188,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Laughter)

183
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I know.

184
0:09:19.768,000 --> 0:09:21,000
My friend Joe is really cool.

185
0:09:23.394,000 --> 0:09:26,000
One of the biggest challenges in doing a DNA extraction

186
0:09:26.778,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is it usually requires very expensive equipment,

187
0:09:30.117,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and takes hours.

188
0:09:31.545,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But with this machine,

189
0:09:33.061,000 --> 0:09:35,000
we've been able to do it in 20 minutes,

190
0:09:35.839,000 --> 0:09:36,000
at a fraction of the cost.

191
0:09:37.109,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And this runs off of a motorcycle battery.

192
0:09:41.164,000 --> 0:09:46,000
From there, we take the DNA extraction and prepare it into a library,

193
0:09:46.331,000 --> 0:09:47,000
getting it ready to load on

194
0:09:48.134,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to this portable, handheld genomic sequencer,

195
0:09:52.45,000 --> 0:09:53,000
which is here,

196
0:09:53.625,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and then we plug this into a mini supercomputer,

197
0:09:57.387,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which is called a MinIT.

198
0:09:59.728,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And both of these things are plugged into a portable battery pack.

199
0:10:04.569,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So we were able to eliminate

200
0:10:06.466,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the requirements of main power and internet,

201
0:10:08.895,000 --> 0:10:11,000
which are two very limiting factors on a small-scale family farm.

202
0:10:13.807,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Analyzing the data quickly can also be a problem.

203
0:10:17.033,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But this is where me being a computational biologist came in handy.

204
0:10:21.382,000 --> 0:10:23,000
All that gluing of dead plants,

205
0:10:23.636,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and all that measuring,

206
0:10:25.22,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and all that computing

207
0:10:27.236,000 --> 0:10:31,000
finally came in handy in a real-world, real-time way.

208
0:10:31.411,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I was able to make customized databases

209
0:10:34.488,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and we were able to give the farmers results in three hours

210
0:10:39.107,000 --> 0:10:4,000
versus six months.

211
0:10:41.694,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

212
0:10:50.085,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The farmers were overjoyed.

213
0:10:53.799,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So how do we know that we're having impact?

214
0:10:56.619,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Nine moths after our Tree Lab,

215
0:10:58.643,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Asha went from having zero tons per hectare

216
0:11:01.897,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to 40 tons per hectare.

217
0:11:03.929,000 --> 0:11:04,000
She had enough to feed her family

218
0:11:05.752,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and she was selling it at the market,

219
0:11:08.466,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and she's now building a house for her family.

220
0:11:12.212,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Yeah, so cool.

221
0:11:13.395,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Applause)

222
0:11:17.673,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So how do we scale Tree Lab?

223
0:11:19.94,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The thing is,

224
0:11:21.344,000 --> 0:11:23,000
farmers are scaled already in Africa.

225
0:11:23.471,000 --> 0:11:24,000
These women work in farmer groups,

226
0:11:25.384,000 --> 0:11:29,000
so helping Asha actually helped 3,000 people in her village,

227
0:11:29.534,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because she shared the results and also the solution.

228
0:11:33.673,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I remember every single farmer I've ever met.

229
0:11:38.665,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Their pain and their joy

230
0:11:42.252,000 --> 0:11:43,000
is engraved in my memories.

231
0:11:44.958,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Our science is for them.

232
0:11:47.711,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Tree Lab is our best attempt to help them become more food secure.

233
0:11:53.18,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I never dreamt

234
0:11:54.99,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that the best science I would ever do in my life

235
0:11:57.958,000 --> 0:12:,000
would be on that blanket in East Africa,

236
0:12:01.481,000 --> 0:12:03,000
with the highest-tech genomic gadgets.

237
0:12:04.312,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But our team did dream

238
0:12:06.788,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that we could give farmers answers in three hours versus six months,

239
0:12:11.082,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and then we did it.

240
0:12:12.542,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Because that's the power of diversity and inclusion in science.

241
0:12:17.156,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Thank you.

242
0:12:18.331,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause)

243
0:12:21.506,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Cheers)

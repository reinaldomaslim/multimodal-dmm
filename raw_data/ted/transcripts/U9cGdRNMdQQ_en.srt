1
0:00:16.006,000 --> 0:00:18,000
When I was a child, I always wanted to be a superhero.

2
0:00:18.736,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I wanted to save the world and make everyone happy.

3
0:00:22.196,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But I knew that I'd need superpowers to make my dreams come true.

4
0:00:26.013,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton,

6
0:00:31.773,000 --> 0:00:33,000
which was a lot of fun, but didn't yield much result.

7
0:00:35.321,000 --> 0:00:36,000
When I grew up and realized

8
0:00:37.084,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers,

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science,

10
0:00:43.606,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to find a more useful truth.

11
0:00:45.855,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I started my journey in California,

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with a UC Berkeley 30-year longitudinal study

13
0:00:51.529,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook,

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life.

15
0:00:59.826,000 --> 0:01:01,000
By measuring the students' smiles,

16
0:01:01.898,000 --> 0:01:02,000
researchers were able to predict

17
0:01:03.707,000 --> 0:01:07,000
how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject's marriage would be,

18
0:01:07.948,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:09.034,000 --> 0:01:12,000
how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being,

20
0:01:12.979,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and how inspiring she would be to others.

21
0:01:16.479,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In another yearbook, I stumbled upon Barry Obama's picture.

22
0:01:20.188,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When I first saw his picture,

23
0:01:21.687,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I thought that his superpowers came from his super collar.

24
0:01:24.87,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:25.974,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But now I know it was all in his smile.

26
0:01:28.91,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Another aha! moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project

27
0:01:34.29,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players.

28
0:01:39.036,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The researchers found that the span of a player's smile

29
0:01:42.567,000 --> 0:01:44,000
could actually predict the span of his life.

30
0:01:45.948,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Players who didn't smile in their pictures

31
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
lived an average of only 72.9 years,

32
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
where players with beaming smiles

33
0:01:53.865,000 --> 0:01:55,000
lived an average of almost 80 years.

34
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:58.675,000 --> 0:02:,000
The good news is that we're actually born smiling.

36
0:02:01.818,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Using 3D ultrasound technology,

37
0:02:03.827,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we can now see that developing babies appear to smile,

38
0:02:07.429,000 --> 0:02:08,000
even in the womb.

39
0:02:09.27,000 --> 0:02:11,000
When they're born, babies continue to smile --

40
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
initially, mostly in their sleep.

41
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And even blind babies smile

42
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to the sound of the human voice.

43
0:02:19.641,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Smiling is one of the most basic, biologically uniform

44
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
expressions of all humans.

45
0:02:24.721,000 --> 0:02:26,000
In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea,

46
0:02:26.809,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Paul Ekman, the world's most renowned researcher on facial expressions,

47
0:02:31.104,000 --> 0:02:34,000
found that even members of the Fore tribe,

48
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
who were completely disconnected from Western culture,

49
0:02:37.456,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals,

50
0:02:40.743,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:42.051,000 --> 0:02:44,000
attributed smiles to descriptions of situations

52
0:02:44.718,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the same way you and I would.

53
0:02:47.201,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So from Papua New Guinea

54
0:02:48.917,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to Hollywood

55
0:02:52.115,000 --> 0:02:55,000
all the way to modern art in Beijing,

56
0:02:55.551,000 --> 0:02:56,000
we smile often,

57
0:02:56.98,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and use smiles to express joy and satisfaction.

58
0:03:00.9,000 --> 0:03:03,000
How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day?

59
0:03:04.543,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Raise your hand if you do.

60
0:03:06.621,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Oh, wow.

61
0:03:08.162,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Outside of this room,

62
0:03:09.685,000 --> 0:03:12,000
more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day,

63
0:03:13.019,000 --> 0:03:17,000
whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five.

64
0:03:17.582,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In fact, those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children,

65
0:03:23.229,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who smile as many as 400 times per day.

66
0:03:27.091,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Have you ever wondered why being around children,

67
0:03:29.475,000 --> 0:03:32,000
who smile so frequently, makes you smile very often?

68
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden

69
0:03:37.171,000 --> 0:03:41,000
found that it's very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles.

70
0:03:42.06,000 --> 0:03:43,000
You ask why?

71
0:03:43.506,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious,

72
0:03:45.99,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles.

73
0:03:51.148,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically

74
0:03:54.6,000 --> 0:03:57,000
helps us understand whether our smile is fake or real,

75
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler.

76
0:04:02.536,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In a recent mimicking study

77
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France,

78
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake

79
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles.

80
0:04:16.069,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Without the pencil, subjects were excellent judges,

81
0:04:18.997,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but with the pencil in their mouth --

82
0:04:20.901,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when they could not mimic the smile they saw --

83
0:04:23.52,000 --> 0:04:24,000
their judgment was impaired.

84
0:04:25.45,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In addition to theorizing on evolution in "The Origin of Species,"

86
0:04:30.609,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory.

87
0:04:35.149,000 --> 0:04:4,000
His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better,

88
0:04:40.678,000 --> 0:04:43,000
rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good.

89
0:04:44.694,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In his study, Darwin actually cited a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne,

90
0:04:49.284,000 --> 0:04:54,000
who sent electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles.

91
0:04:54.664,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Please, don't try this at home.

92
0:04:56.592,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:58.846,000 --> 0:04:59,000
In a related German study,

94
0:05:00.569,000 --> 0:05:03,000
researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity

95
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles.

96
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The finding supported Darwin's theory,

97
0:05:12.57,000 --> 0:05:13,000
by showing that facial feedback

98
0:05:14.467,000 --> 0:05:17,000
modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain,

99
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in a way that helps us feel better when we smile.

100
0:05:22.94,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism

101
0:05:25.226,000 --> 0:05:26,000
in a way that even chocolate --

102
0:05:26.774,000 --> 0:05:28,000
a well-regarded pleasure inducer --

103
0:05:29.607,000 --> 0:05:3,000
cannot match.

104
0:05:31.337,000 --> 0:05:34,000
British researchers found that one smile

105
0:05:34.527,000 --> 0:05:36,000
can generate the same level of brain stimulation

106
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate.

107
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:42.932,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Wait --

109
0:05:44.115,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The same study found that smiling is as stimulating

110
0:05:47.946,000 --> 0:05:51,000
as receiving up to 16,000 pounds sterling in cash.

111
0:05:52.076,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:53.101,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That's like 25 grand a smile.

113
0:05:54.97,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's not bad.

114
0:05:56.703,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And think about it this way:

115
0:05:58.172,000 --> 0:06:,000
25,000 times 400 --

116
0:06:00.885,000 --> 0:06:03,000
quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day.

117
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

118
0:06:06.099,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And unlike lots of chocolate,

119
0:06:07.712,000 --> 0:06:09,000
lots of smiling can actually make you healthier.

120
0:06:10.458,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones

121
0:06:14.329,000 --> 0:06:17,000
like cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine,

122
0:06:17.534,000 --> 0:06:2,000
increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphins,

123
0:06:21.252,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and reduce overall blood pressure.

124
0:06:24.113,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And if that's not enough,

125
0:06:25.787,000 --> 0:06:28,000
smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others.

126
0:06:29.469,000 --> 0:06:32,000
A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile,

127
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you don't only appear to be more likable and courteous,

128
0:06:37.139,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but you actually appear to be more competent.

129
0:06:41.061,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So whenever you want to look great and competent,

130
0:06:43.459,000 --> 0:06:45,000
reduce your stress or improve your marriage,

131
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate

132
0:06:50.172,000 --> 0:06:52,000
without incurring the caloric cost,

133
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn't worn for ages,

134
0:06:58.117,000 --> 0:07:01,000
or whenever you want to tap into a superpower

135
0:07:01.655,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that will help you and everyone around you

136
0:07:04.641,000 --> 0:07:07,000
live a longer, healthier, happier life,

137
0:07:08.468,000 --> 0:07:09,000
smile.

138
0:07:09.791,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Applause)

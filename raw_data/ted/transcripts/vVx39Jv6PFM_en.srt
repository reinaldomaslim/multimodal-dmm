1
0:00:12.872,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So the other morning I went to the grocery store

2
0:00:15.151,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and an employee greeted me

3
0:00:16.493,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with a "Good morning, sir, can I help you with anything?"

4
0:00:19.214,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I said, "No, thanks, I'm good."

5
0:00:21.576,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The person smiled and we went our separate ways.

6
0:00:23.839,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I grabbed Cheerios and I left the grocery store.

7
0:00:26.175,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I went through the drive-through of a local coffee shop.

8
0:00:28.934,000 --> 0:00:3,000
After I placed my order, the voice on the other end said,

9
0:00:31.633,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"Thank you, ma'am. Drive right around."

10
0:00:33.522,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, in the span of less than an hour,

11
0:00:35.356,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was understood both as a "sir" and as a "ma'am."

12
0:00:38.762,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But for me, neither of these people are wrong,

13
0:00:40.993,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but they're also not completely right.

14
0:00:44.31,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This cute little human is my almost-two-year-old Elliot.

15
0:00:48.362,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Yeah, alright.

16
0:00:50.529,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And over the past two years,

17
0:00:51.924,000 --> 0:00:53,000
this kid has forced me to rethink the world

18
0:00:53.955,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and how I participate in it.

19
0:00:55.455,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I identify as transgender and as a parent, that makes me a transparent.

20
0:01:00.45,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:02.935,000 --> 0:01:03,000
(Applause)

22
0:01:04.385,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Cheering)

23
0:01:06.258,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Applause)

24
0:01:11.768,000 --> 0:01:14,000
As you can see, I took this year's theme super literal.

25
0:01:15.372,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:16.457,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Like any good dad joke should.

27
0:01:19.599,000 --> 0:01:21,000
More specifically, I identify as genderqueer.

28
0:01:21.95,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And there are lots of ways to experience being genderqueer,

29
0:01:24.753,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but for me that means I don't really identify as a man or a woman.

30
0:01:27.967,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I feel in between and sometimes outside of this gender binary.

31
0:01:31.537,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And being outside of this gender binary

32
0:01:33.419,000 --> 0:01:35,000
means that sometimes I get "sired" and "ma'amed"

33
0:01:35.784,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in the span of less than an hour when I'm out doing everyday things

34
0:01:38.967,000 --> 0:01:39,000
like getting Cheerios.

35
0:01:40.149,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But this in between lane is where I'm most comfortable.

36
0:01:42.745,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This space where I can be both a sir and a ma'am

37
0:01:45.023,000 --> 0:01:47,000
feels the most right and the most authentic.

38
0:01:47.339,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But it doesn't mean that these interactions aren't uncomfortable.

39
0:01:50.419,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Trust me, the discomfort can range from minor annoyance

40
0:01:53.022,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to feeling physically unsafe.

41
0:01:54.458,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Like the time at a bar in college

42
0:01:56.085,000 --> 0:01:58,000
when a bouncer physically removed me by the back of the neck

43
0:01:58.95,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and threw me out of a woman's restroom.

44
0:02:00.849,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But for me, authenticity doesn't mean "comfortable."

45
0:02:03.626,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It means managing and negotiating the discomfort of everyday life,

46
0:02:06.754,000 --> 0:02:07,000
even at times when it's unsafe.

47
0:02:09.093,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And it wasn't until my experience as a trans person

48
0:02:11.515,000 --> 0:02:12,000
collided with my new identity as a parent

49
0:02:13.53,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that I understood the depth of my vulnerabilities

50
0:02:15.87,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and how they are preventing me from being my most authentic self.

51
0:02:20.203,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Now, for most people, what their child will call them

52
0:02:22.704,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is not something that they give much thought to

53
0:02:24.927,000 --> 0:02:25,000
outside of culturally specific words

54
0:02:26.696,000 --> 0:02:29,000
or variations on a gendered theme like "mama," "mommy," or "daddy," "papa."

55
0:02:30.266,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But for me, the possibility is what this child,

56
0:02:32.694,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who will grow to be a teenager and then a real-life adult,

57
0:02:35.632,000 --> 0:02:36,000
will call me for the rest of our lives,

58
0:02:37.514,000 --> 0:02:39,000
was both extremely scary and exciting.

59
0:02:41.185,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I spent nine months wrestling with the reality that being called "mama"

60
0:02:44.742,000 --> 0:02:46,000
or something like it didn't feel like me at all.

61
0:02:47.053,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And no matter how many times or versions of "mom" I tried,

62
0:02:49.805,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it always felt forced and deeply uncomfortable.

63
0:02:52.901,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I knew being called "mom" or "mommy" would be easier to digest for most people.

64
0:02:56.641,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The idea of having two moms is not super novel,

65
0:02:59.006,000 --> 0:03:,000
especially where we live.

66
0:03:01.743,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So I tried other words.

67
0:03:03.363,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And when I played around with "daddy," it felt better.

68
0:03:06.568,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Better, but not perfect.

69
0:03:09.124,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It felt like a pair of shoes that you really liked

70
0:03:11.482,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but you needed to wear and break in.

71
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And I knew the idea of being a female-born person being called "daddy"

72
0:03:17.038,000 --> 0:03:2,000
was going to be a harder road with a lot more uncomfortable moments.

73
0:03:20.388,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But, before I knew it, the time had come

74
0:03:22.602,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and Elliot came screaming into the world, like most babies do,

75
0:03:25.57,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and my new identity as a parent began.

76
0:03:28.196,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I decided on becoming a daddy, and our new family faced the world.

77
0:03:32.538,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Now one of the most common things that happens when people meet us

78
0:03:35.665,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is for people to "mom" me.

79
0:03:36.998,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And when I get "momed", there are several ways the interaction can go,

80
0:03:40.315,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and I've drawn this map to help illustrate my options.

81
0:03:43.752,000 --> 0:03:44,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:45.387,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So, option one is to ignore the assumption

83
0:03:48.307,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and allow folks to continue to refer to me as "mom,"

84
0:03:51.271,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which is not awkward for the other party,

85
0:03:53.248,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but is typically really awkward for us.

86
0:03:55.609,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And it usually causes me to restrict my interaction with those people.

87
0:03:59.331,000 --> 0:04:,000
Option one.

88
0:04:00.704,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Option two is to stop and correct them

89
0:04:03.998,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and say something like,

90
0:04:05.195,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Actually, I'm Elliot's dad" or "Elliot calls me 'daddy.'"

91
0:04:08.339,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And when I do this, one or two of the following things happen.

92
0:04:11.624,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Folks take it in stride and say something like, "Oh, OK."

93
0:04:14.941,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And move on.

94
0:04:16.242,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Or they respond by apologizing profusely

95
0:04:18.839,000 --> 0:04:2,000
because they feel bad or awkward or guilty or weird.

96
0:04:22.067,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But more often, what happens is folks get really confused

97
0:04:25.609,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and look up with an intense look and say something like,

98
0:04:29.132,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"Does this mean you want to transition?

99
0:04:31.134,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Do you want to be a man?"

100
0:04:32.673,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Or say things like,

101
0:04:34.419,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"How can she be a father?

102
0:04:35.927,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Only men can be dads."

103
0:04:38.283,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Well, option one is oftentimes the easier route.

104
0:04:40.57,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Option two is always the more authentic one.

105
0:04:43.395,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And all of these scenarios involve a level of discomfort,

106
0:04:46.101,000 --> 0:04:47,000
even in the best case.

107
0:04:47.282,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I'll say that over time, my ability to navigate this complicated map

108
0:04:50.687,000 --> 0:04:51,000
has gotten easier.

109
0:04:51.931,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But the discomfort is still there.

110
0:04:53.877,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Now, I won't stand here and pretend

111
0:04:55.577,000 --> 0:04:57,000
like I've mastered this, it's pretty far from it.

112
0:04:57.99,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And there are days when I still allow option one to take place

113
0:05:00.931,000 --> 0:05:02,000
because option two is just too hard or too risky.

114
0:05:04.141,000 --> 0:05:07,000
There's no way to be sure of anyone's reaction,

115
0:05:07.451,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and I want to be sure that folks have good intentions,

116
0:05:10.196,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that people are good.

117
0:05:11.538,000 --> 0:05:14,000
But we live in a world where someone's opinion of my existence

118
0:05:14.696,000 --> 0:05:15,000
can be met with serious threats to me

119
0:05:16.585,000 --> 0:05:18,000
or even my family's emotional or physical safety.

120
0:05:19.498,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So I weigh the costs against the risks

121
0:05:23.767,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and sometimes the safety of my family comes before my own authenticity.

122
0:05:28.934,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But despite this risk,

123
0:05:30.141,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I know as Elliot gets older and grows into her consciousness and language skills,

124
0:05:34.371,000 --> 0:05:36,000
if I don't correct people, she will.

125
0:05:37.727,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I don't want my fears and insecurities to be placed on her,

126
0:05:40.537,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to dampen her spirit or make her question her own voice.

127
0:05:43.783,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I need to model agency, authenticity and vulnerability,

128
0:05:46.593,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and that means leaning into those uncomfortable moments of being "momed"

129
0:05:50.525,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and standing up and saying, "No, I'm a dad.

130
0:05:53.406,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And I even have the dad jokes to prove it."

131
0:05:55.478,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:58.188,000 --> 0:06:,000
Now, there have already been plenty of uncomfortable moments

133
0:06:01.03,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and even some painful ones.

134
0:06:02.395,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But there's also been, in just two short years,

135
0:06:04.625,000 --> 0:06:07,000
validating and at times transformative moments on my journey as a dad

136
0:06:07.888,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and my path towards authenticity.

137
0:06:10.466,000 --> 0:06:11,000
When we got our first sonogram,

138
0:06:11.998,000 --> 0:06:13,000
we decided we wanted to know the sex of the baby.

139
0:06:14.577,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The technician saw a vulva and slapped the words "It's a girl"

140
0:06:17.99,000 --> 0:06:19,000
on the screen and gave us a copy and sent us on our way.

141
0:06:21.411,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We shared the photo with our families like everyone does

142
0:06:24.085,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and soon after, my mom showed up at our house with a bag filled --

143
0:06:27.212,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I'm not exaggerating,

144
0:06:28.538,000 --> 0:06:33,000
it was like this high and it was filled, overflowing with pink clothes and toys.

145
0:06:35.014,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now I was a little annoyed to be confronted with a lot of pink things,

146
0:06:38.362,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and having studied gender

147
0:06:39.681,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and spent countless hours teaching about it in workshops and classrooms,

148
0:06:43.332,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I thought I was pretty well versed on the social construction of gender

149
0:06:46.704,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and how sexism is a devaluing of the feminine

150
0:06:49.244,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and how it manifests both explicitly and implicitly.

151
0:06:52.883,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But this situation, this aversion to a bag full of pink stuff,

152
0:06:57.328,000 --> 0:07:,000
forced me to explore my rejection of highly feminized things

153
0:07:00.645,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in my child's world.

154
0:07:03.466,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I realized that I was reinforcing sexism

155
0:07:05.688,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and the cultural norms I teach as problematic.

156
0:07:08.657,000 --> 0:07:11,000
No matter how much I believed in gender neutrality in theory,

157
0:07:11.899,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in practice, the absence of femininity is not neutrality, it's masculinity.

158
0:07:18.296,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If I only dress my baby in greens and blues and grays,

159
0:07:21.141,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the outside world doesn't think, "Oh, that's a cute gender-neutral baby."

160
0:07:25.379,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They think, "Oh, what a cute boy."

161
0:07:28.537,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So my theoretical understanding of gender and my parenting world collided hard.

162
0:07:32.72,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Yes, I want a diversity of colors and toys for my child to experience.

163
0:07:36.339,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I want a balanced environment for her to explore

164
0:07:38.602,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and make sense of in her own way.

165
0:07:40.204,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We even picked a gender-neutral name for our female-born child.

166
0:07:43.268,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But gender neutrality is much easier as a theoretical endeavor

167
0:07:46.712,000 --> 0:07:47,000
than it is as a practice.

168
0:07:48.767,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And in my attempts to create gender neutrality,

169
0:07:51.367,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I was inadvertently privileging masculinity over femininity.

170
0:07:55.398,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So, rather than toning down or eliminating femininity in our lives,

171
0:07:58.851,000 --> 0:08:,000
we make a concerted effort to celebrate it.

172
0:08:01.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We have pinks among the variety of colors,

173
0:08:03.779,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we balance out the cutes with handsomes

174
0:08:05.661,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and the prettys with strongs and smarts

175
0:08:07.561,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and work really hard not to associate any words with gender.

176
0:08:10.577,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We value femininity and masculinity

177
0:08:13.141,000 --> 0:08:14,000
while also being highly critical of it.

178
0:08:15.148,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And do our best to not make her feel limited by gender roles.

179
0:08:18.879,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And we do all this in hopes

180
0:08:20.328,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that we model a healthy and empowered relationship with gender for our kid.

181
0:08:25.49,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Now this work to develop a healthy relationship with gender for Elliot

182
0:08:28.871,000 --> 0:08:3,000
made me rethink and evaluate how I allowed sexism to manifest

183
0:08:31.76,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in my own gender identity.

184
0:08:33.768,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I began to reevaluate how I was rejecting femininity

185
0:08:36.427,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in order to live up to a masculinity that was not healthy

186
0:08:39.149,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or something I wanted to pass on.

187
0:08:41.839,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Doing this self-work meant I had to reject option one.

188
0:08:44.815,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I couldn't ignore and move on.

189
0:08:46.649,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I had to choose option two.

190
0:08:48.895,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I had to engage with some of my most uncomfortable parts

191
0:08:51.585,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to move towards my most authentic self.

192
0:08:53.491,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And that meant I had to get real about the discomfort I have with my body.

193
0:08:58.46,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's pretty common for trans people to feel uncomfortable in their body,

194
0:09:02.111,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and this discomfort can range from debilitating to annoying

195
0:09:04.897,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and everywhere in between.

196
0:09:06.246,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And learning my body and how to be comfortable in it as a trans person

197
0:09:09.569,000 --> 0:09:1,000
has been a lifelong journey.

198
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I've always struggled with the parts of my body

199
0:09:13.482,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that can be defined as more feminine --

200
0:09:15.395,000 --> 0:09:17,000
my chest, my hips, my voice.

201
0:09:17.997,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And I've made the sometimes hard, sometimes easy decision

202
0:09:20.688,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to not take hormones or have any surgeries to change it

203
0:09:23.649,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to make myself more masculine by society's standards.

204
0:09:27.276,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And while I certainly haven't overcome all the feelings of dissatisfaction,

205
0:09:30.847,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I realized that by not engaging with that discomfort

206
0:09:33.323,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and coming to a positive and affirming place with my body,

207
0:09:36.07,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I was reinforcing sexism, transphobia and modeling body shaming.

208
0:09:40.823,000 --> 0:09:41,000
If I hate my body,

209
0:09:42.244,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in particular, the parts society deems feminine or female,

210
0:09:45.482,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I potentially damage how my kid can see the possibilities of her body

211
0:09:49.125,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and her feminine and female parts.

212
0:09:51.653,000 --> 0:09:53,000
If I hate or am uncomfortable with my body,

213
0:09:54.121,000 --> 0:09:56,000
how can I expect my kid to love hers?

214
0:09:57.517,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Now it would be easier for me to choose option one:

215
0:10:01.077,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to ignore my kid when she asks me about my body or to hide it from her.

216
0:10:04.609,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But I have to choose option two every day.

217
0:10:07.76,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I have to confront my own assumptions about what a dad's body can and should be.

218
0:10:11.887,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So I work every day to try and be more comfortable in this body

219
0:10:15.022,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and in the ways I express femininity.

220
0:10:17.284,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So I talk about it more,

221
0:10:18.8,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I explore the depths of this discomfort

222
0:10:20.716,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and find language that I feel comfortable with.

223
0:10:22.982,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And this daily discomfort helps me build both agency and authenticity

224
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
in how I show up in my body and in my gender.

225
0:10:28.982,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I'm working against limiting myself.

226
0:10:31.149,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I want to show her that a dad can have hips,

227
0:10:33.276,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a dad doesn't have to have a perfectly flat chest

228
0:10:35.665,000 --> 0:10:36,000
or even be able to grow facial hair.

229
0:10:38.291,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And when she's developmentally able to,

230
0:10:40.173,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I want to talk to her about my journey with my body.

231
0:10:42.649,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I want her to see my journey towards authenticity

232
0:10:45.007,000 --> 0:10:47,000
even when it means showing her the messier parts.

233
0:10:49.346,000 --> 0:10:5,000
We have a wonderful pediatrician

234
0:10:50.997,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and have established a good relationship with our kid's doctor.

235
0:10:53.982,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And as you all know, while your doctor stays the same,

236
0:10:56.545,000 --> 0:10:58,000
your nurses and nurse practitioners change in and out.

237
0:10:59.284,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And when Elliot was first born, we took her to the pediatrician

238
0:11:02.3,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and we met our first nurse -- we'll call her Sarah.

239
0:11:04.705,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Very early in in our time with Sarah,

240
0:11:06.729,000 --> 0:11:08,000
we told her how I was going to be called "dad"

241
0:11:08.896,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and my partner is "mama."

242
0:11:10.347,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Sarah was one of those folks that took it in stride,

243
0:11:12.796,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and our subsequent visits went pretty smoothly.

244
0:11:15.03,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And about a year later, Sarah switched shifts

245
0:11:17.157,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and we started working with a new nurse -- we'll call her Becky.

246
0:11:20.209,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We didn't get in front of the dad conversations

247
0:11:22.447,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and it didn't actually come up until Sarah, our original nurse,

248
0:11:25.464,000 --> 0:11:26,000
walked in to say hi.

249
0:11:26.712,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Sarah's warm and bubbly and said hi to Elliot and me and my wife

250
0:11:29.737,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and when talking to Elliot said something like,

251
0:11:31.967,000 --> 0:11:32,000
"Is your daddy holding your toy?"

252
0:11:33.744,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Now out of the corner of my eye,

253
0:11:35.403,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I could see Becky swing around in her chair

254
0:11:37.483,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and make daggers at Sarah.

255
0:11:40.244,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And as the conversation shifted to our pediatrician,

256
0:11:42.712,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I saw Sarah and Becky's interaction continue, and it went something like this.

257
0:11:46.434,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Becky, shaking her head "no" and mouthing the word "mom."

258
0:11:50.902,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Sarah, shaking her head "no" and mouthing the word "no, dad."

259
0:11:55.323,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

260
0:11:57.657,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Awkward, right?

261
0:11:58.831,000 --> 0:12:,000
So this went back and forth in total silence a few more times

262
0:12:01.736,000 --> 0:12:02,000
until we walked away.

263
0:12:03.617,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Now, this interaction has stuck with me.

264
0:12:05.665,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Sarah could have chosen option one,

265
0:12:07.839,000 --> 0:12:1,000
ignored Becky, and let her refer to me as mom.

266
0:12:11.228,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It would have been easier for Sarah.

267
0:12:13.276,000 --> 0:12:16,000
She could have put the responsibility back on me or not said anything at all.

268
0:12:16.934,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But in that moment, she chose option two.

269
0:12:19.815,000 --> 0:12:22,000
She chose to confront the assumptions and affirm my existence.

270
0:12:23.356,000 --> 0:12:25,000
She insisted that a person who looks and sounds like me

271
0:12:26.007,000 --> 0:12:27,000
can in fact be a dad.

272
0:12:27.285,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And in a small but meaningful way,

273
0:12:29.102,000 --> 0:12:32,000
advocated for me, my authenticity and my family.

274
0:12:33.962,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Unfortunately, we live in a world that refuses to acknowledge trans people

275
0:12:38.455,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and the diversity of trans people in general.

276
0:12:41.76,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And my hope is that when confronted with an opportunity

277
0:12:44.45,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to stand up for someone else,

278
0:12:46.284,000 --> 0:12:49,000
we all take action like Sarah, even when there's risk involved.

279
0:12:50.608,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So some days, the risk of being a genderqueer dad feels too much.

280
0:12:55.244,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And deciding to be a dad has been really hard.

281
0:12:57.878,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I'm sure it will continue to be the hardest,

282
0:13:00.149,000 --> 0:13:02,000
yet the most rewarding experience of my life.

283
0:13:02.617,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But despite this challenge, every day has felt 100 percent worth it.

284
0:13:06.815,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So each day I affirm my promise to Elliot

285
0:13:09.577,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and that same promise to myself.

286
0:13:12.045,000 --> 0:13:14,000
To love her and myself hard

287
0:13:14.482,000 --> 0:13:16,000
with forgiveness and compassion,

288
0:13:16.538,000 --> 0:13:18,000
with tough love and with generosity.

289
0:13:19.466,000 --> 0:13:22,000
To give room for growth, to push beyond comfort

290
0:13:22.577,000 --> 0:13:24,000
in hopes of attaining and living a more meaningful life.

291
0:13:26.306,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I know in my head and in my heart

292
0:13:27.982,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that there are hard and painful and uncomfortable days ahead.

293
0:13:31.291,000 --> 0:13:32,000
My head and my heart also know

294
0:13:32.755,000 --> 0:13:34,000
that all of it will lead to a more rich, authentic life

295
0:13:35.69,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that I can look back on without regrets.

296
0:13:38.27,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Thank you.

297
0:13:39.444,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Applause)

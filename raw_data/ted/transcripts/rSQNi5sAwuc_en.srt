1
0:00:14.318,000 --> 0:00:16,000
The brain is an amazing and complex organ.

2
0:00:17.627,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And while many people are fascinated by the brain,

3
0:00:20.093,000 --> 0:00:21,000
they can't really tell you that much

4
0:00:21.865,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about the properties about how the brain works

5
0:00:24.142,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because we don't teach neuroscience in schools.

6
0:00:26.455,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And one of the reasons why is that the equipment

7
0:00:28.898,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is so complex and so expensive

8
0:00:31.557,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that it's really only done at major universities and large institutions.

9
0:00:35.703,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And so in order to be able to access the brain,

10
0:00:37.942,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you really need to dedicate your life

11
0:00:39.767,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and spend six and a half years as a graduate student

12
0:00:42.247,000 --> 0:00:44,000
just to become a neuroscientist to get access to these tools.

13
0:00:45.202,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And that's a shame because one out of five of us,

14
0:00:47.539,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that's 20 percent of the entire world, will have a neurological disorder.

15
0:00:51.365,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And there are zero cures for these diseases.

16
0:00:54.796,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And so it seems that what we should be doing

17
0:00:57.015,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is reaching back earlier in the eduction process

18
0:00:59.432,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and teaching students about neuroscience so that in the future,

19
0:01:04.009,000 --> 0:01:07,000
they may be thinking about possibly becoming a brain scientist.

20
0:01:08.064,000 --> 0:01:11,000
When I was a graduate student, my lab mate Tim Marzullo and myself,

21
0:01:11.758,000 --> 0:01:14,000
decided that what if we took this complex equipment that we have

22
0:01:15.639,000 --> 0:01:18,000
for studying the brain and made it simple enough and affordable enough

23
0:01:19.038,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that anyone that you know, an amateur or a high school student,

24
0:01:22.354,000 --> 0:01:25,000
could learn and actually participate in the discovery of neuroscience.

25
0:01:25.836,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And so we did just that.

26
0:01:27.573,000 --> 0:01:29,000
A few years ago, we started a company called Backyard Brains

27
0:01:30.466,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we make DIY neuroscience equipment and I brought some here tonight,

28
0:01:34.871,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and I want to do some demonstrations.

29
0:01:37.377,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You guys want to see some?

30
0:01:38.811,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I need a volunteer.

31
0:01:41.774,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So right before -- what is your name? (Applause)

32
0:01:44.027,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Sam Kelly: Sam.

33
0:01:45.07,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Greg Gage: All right, Sam, I'm going to record from your brain.

34
0:01:48.095,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Have you had this before?

35
0:01:49.849,000 --> 0:01:5,000
SK: No.

36
0:01:50.95,000 --> 0:01:52,000
GG: I need you to stick out your arm for science,

37
0:01:53.264,000 --> 0:01:54,000
roll up your sleeve a bit,

38
0:01:54.833,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So what I'm going to do, I'm putting electrodes on your arm,

39
0:01:57.713,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and you're probably wondering,

40
0:01:59.202,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I just said I'm going to record from your brain, what am I doing with your arm?

41
0:02:02.941,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Well, you have about 80 billion neurons inside your brain right now.

42
0:02:06.175,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They're sending electrical messages back and forth, and chemical messages.

43
0:02:09.663,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But some of your neurons right here in your motor cortex

44
0:02:12.336,000 --> 0:02:15,000
are going to send messages down when you move your arm like this.

45
0:02:15.431,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They're going to go down across your corpus callosum,

46
0:02:17.915,000 --> 0:02:19,000
down onto your spinal cord to your lower motor neuron

47
0:02:20.449,000 --> 0:02:21,000
out to your muscles here,

48
0:02:21.718,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and that electrical discharge is going to be picked up

49
0:02:24.327,000 --> 0:02:25,000
by these electrodes right here

50
0:02:25.861,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and we're going to be able to listen

51
0:02:27.583,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to exactly what your brain is going to be doing.

52
0:02:29.835,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So I'm going to turn this on for a second.

53
0:02:31.835,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Have you ever heard what your brain sounds like?

54
0:02:34.131,000 --> 0:02:35,000
SK: No.

55
0:02:35.166,000 --> 0:02:37,000
GG: Let's try it out. So go ahead and squeeze your hand.

56
0:02:37.9,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Rumbling)

57
0:02:38.972,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So what you're listening to,

58
0:02:40.848,000 --> 0:02:43,000
so this is your motor units happening right here.

59
0:02:44.111,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Let's take a look at it as well.

60
0:02:46.192,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I'm going to stand over here,

61
0:02:49.009,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and I'm going to open up our app here.

62
0:02:52.028,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So now I want you to squeeze.

63
0:02:53.727,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Rumbling)

64
0:02:54.816,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So right here, these are the motor units that are happening

65
0:02:57.674,000 --> 0:02:59,000
from her spinal cord out to her muscle right here,

66
0:03:00.133,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and as she's doing it,

67
0:03:01.355,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you're seeing the electrical activity that's happening here.

68
0:03:04.189,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You can even click here and try to see one of them.

69
0:03:06.63,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So keep doing it really hard.

70
0:03:08.101,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So now we've paused

71
0:03:09.171,000 --> 0:03:13,000
on one motor action potential that's happening right now inside of your brain.

72
0:03:13.451,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Do you guys want to see some more?

73
0:03:15.227,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:16.81,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That's interesting, but let's get it better.

75
0:03:18.954,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I need one more volunteer.

76
0:03:21.857,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What is your name, sir?

77
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Miguel Goncalves: Miguel.

78
0:03:25.269,000 --> 0:03:26,000
GG: Miguel, all right.

79
0:03:26.4,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You're going to stand right here.

80
0:03:27.976,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So when you're moving your arm like this,

81
0:03:29.968,000 --> 0:03:32,000
your brain is sending a signal down to your muscles right here.

82
0:03:33.083,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I want you to move your arm as well.

83
0:03:34.857,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So your brain is going to send a signal down to your muscles.

84
0:03:37.731,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And so it turns out that there is a nerve that's right here

85
0:03:41.58,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that runs up here that innervates these three fingers,

86
0:03:44.336,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and it's close enough to the skin that we might be able

87
0:03:47.012,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to stimulate that so that what we can do

88
0:03:49.346,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is copy your brain signals going out to your hand

89
0:03:52.832,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and inject it into your hand,

90
0:03:54.353,000 --> 0:03:57,000
so that your hand will move when your brain tells your hand to move.

91
0:03:57.726,000 --> 0:04:,000
So in a sense, she will take away your free will

92
0:04:00.933,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and you will no longer have any control over this hand.

93
0:04:03.964,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You with me?

94
0:04:05.567,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So I just need to hook you up.

95
0:04:07.618,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:09.369,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So I'm going to find your ulnar nerve,

97
0:04:11.43,000 --> 0:04:12,000
which is probably right around here.

98
0:04:14.63,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You don't know what you're signing up for

99
0:04:16.631,000 --> 0:04:17,000
when you come up.

100
0:04:17.734,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So now I'm going to move away and we're going to plug it in

101
0:04:20.524,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to our human-to-human interface over here.

102
0:04:24.345,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Okay, so Sam, I want you to squeeze your hand again.

103
0:04:29.194,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Do it again. Perfect.

104
0:04:31.152,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So now I'm going to hook you up over here so that you get the --

105
0:04:34.155,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's going to feel a little bit weird at first,

106
0:04:36.399,000 --> 0:04:38,000
this is going to feel like a -- (Laughter)

107
0:04:38.863,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You know, when you lose your free will, and someone else becomes your agent,

108
0:04:42.68,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it does feel a bit strange.

109
0:04:44.306,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now I want you to relax your hand.

110
0:04:46.208,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Sam, you're with me?

111
0:04:47.532,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So you're going to squeeze.

112
0:04:48.997,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I'm not going to turn it on yet, so go ahead and give it a squeeze.

113
0:04:52.284,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So now, are you ready, Miguel?

114
0:04:54.24,000 --> 0:04:55,000
MG: Ready as I'll ever be.

115
0:04:56.062,000 --> 0:04:59,000
GG: I've turned it on, so go ahead and turn your hand.

116
0:04:59.265,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Do you feel that a little bit? MG: Nope.

117
0:05:01.298,000 --> 0:05:02,000
GG: Okay, do it again? MG: A little bit.

118
0:05:03.198,000 --> 0:05:04,000
GG: A little bit? (Laughter)

119
0:05:04.884,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So relax.

120
0:05:05.909,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So hit it again.

121
0:05:07.325,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:08.521,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Oh, perfect, perfect.

123
0:05:10.226,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So relax, do it again.

124
0:05:12.11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
All right, so right now,

125
0:05:14.878,000 --> 0:05:18,000
your brain is controlling your arm and it's also controlling his arm,

126
0:05:19.279,000 --> 0:05:21,000
so go ahead and just do it one more time.

127
0:05:21.471,000 --> 0:05:23,000
All right, so it's perfect. (Laughter)

128
0:05:23.504,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So now, what would happen if I took over my control of your hand?

129
0:05:27.265,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And so, just relax your hand.

130
0:05:29.508,000 --> 0:05:31,000
What happens?

131
0:05:31.726,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Ah, nothing.

132
0:05:32.76,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Why not?

133
0:05:34.298,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Because the brain has to do it.

134
0:05:35.993,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So you do it again.

135
0:05:37.346,000 --> 0:05:39,000
All right, that's perfect.

136
0:05:39.78,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Thank you guys for being such a good sport.

137
0:05:42.319,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This is what's happening all across the world --

138
0:05:44.575,000 --> 0:05:45,000
electrophysiology!

139
0:05:45.911,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We're going to bring on the neuro-revolution.

140
0:05:48.158,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Thank you.

141
0:05:49.175,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Applause)

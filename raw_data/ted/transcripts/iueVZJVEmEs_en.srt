2
0:00:16.361,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What you have here

3
0:00:17.911,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is an electronic cigarette.

4
0:00:22.097,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's something that, since it was invented a year or two ago,

5
0:00:25.34,000 --> 0:00:26,000
has given me untold happiness.

6
0:00:26.835,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.04,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A little bit of it, I think, is the nicotine,

8
0:00:30.499,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but there's something much bigger than that;

9
0:00:32.733,000 --> 0:00:37,000
which is, ever since, in the UK, they banned smoking in public places,

10
0:00:38.324,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I've never enjoyed a drinks party ever again.

11
0:00:41.168,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:43.05,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And the reason, I only worked out just the other day,

13
0:00:46.17,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which is: when you go to a drinks party and you stand up

14
0:00:48.862,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people,

15
0:00:51.846,000 --> 0:00:53,000
you don't actually want to spend all the time talking.

16
0:00:54.444,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's really, really tiring.

17
0:00:55.939,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Sometimes you just want to stand there silently, alone with your thoughts.

18
0:00:59.976,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window.

19
0:01:04.907,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now the problem is, when you can't smoke,

20
0:01:08.105,000 --> 0:01:11,000
if you stand and stare out of the window on your own,

21
0:01:11.78,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you're an antisocial, friendless idiot.

22
0:01:14.026,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:16.36,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette,

24
0:01:19.789,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you're a fucking philosopher.

25
0:01:21.566,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:24.393,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Applause)

27
0:01:30.069,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So the power of reframing things

28
0:01:34.978,000 --> 0:01:36,000
cannot be overstated.

29
0:01:37.458,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What we have is exactly the same thing, the same activity,

30
0:01:40.854,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but one of them makes you feel great

31
0:01:43.196,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and the other one, with just a small change of posture,

32
0:01:46.921,000 --> 0:01:47,000
makes you feel terrible.

33
0:01:49.529,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I think one of the problems with classical economics is,

34
0:01:52.458,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it's absolutely preoccupied with reality.

35
0:01:54.915,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And reality isn't a particularly good guide to human happiness.

36
0:01:59.155,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Why, for example, are pensioners much happier

37
0:02:04.187,000 --> 0:02:05,000
than the young unemployed?

38
0:02:06.553,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Both of them, after all, are in exactly the same stage of life.

39
0:02:09.823,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You both have too much time on your hands and not much money.

40
0:02:13.616,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But pensioners are reportedly very, very happy,

41
0:02:16.341,000 --> 0:02:19,000
whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed.

42
0:02:20.641,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The reason, I think, is that the pensioners believe

43
0:02:23.115,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they've chosen to be pensioners,

44
0:02:24.712,000 --> 0:02:27,000
whereas the young unemployed feel it's been thrust upon them.

45
0:02:29.998,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In England, the upper-middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly,

46
0:02:34.058,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because they've re-branded unemployment.

47
0:02:36.408,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If you're an upper-middle-class English person,

48
0:02:38.698,000 --> 0:02:4,000
you call unemployment "a year off."

49
0:02:41.05,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:43.768,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And that's because having a son who's unemployed in Manchester

51
0:02:46.836,000 --> 0:02:47,000
is really quite embarrassing.

52
0:02:48.787,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But having a son who's unemployed in Thailand

53
0:02:51.889,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is really viewed as quite an accomplishment.

54
0:02:53.996,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:56.049,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But actually, the power to re-brand things --

56
0:02:58.396,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to understand that our experiences, costs, things

57
0:03:03.959,000 --> 0:03:05,000
don't actually much depend on what they really are,

58
0:03:06.433,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but on how we view them --

59
0:03:08.03,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I genuinely think can't be overstated.

60
0:03:10.963,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There's an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to,

61
0:03:13.443,000 --> 0:03:15,000
where you put two dogs in a box

62
0:03:15.986,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and the box has an electric floor.

63
0:03:20.616,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Every now and then, an electric shock is applied to the floor,

64
0:03:25.069,000 --> 0:03:26,000
which pains the dogs.

65
0:03:27.92,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box.

66
0:03:31.782,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And when it nuzzles the button, the electric shock stops.

67
0:03:36.636,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The other dog doesn't have the button.

68
0:03:39.164,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box,

69
0:03:43.429,000 --> 0:03:45,000
but it has no control over the circumstances.

70
0:03:47.438,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Generally, the first dog can be relatively content.

71
0:03:50.357,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The second dog lapses into complete depression.

72
0:03:54.642,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness

73
0:03:58.954,000 --> 0:04:01,000
than the sense of control we feel over our lives.

74
0:04:03.77,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's an interesting question.

75
0:04:06.529,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We ask the question -- the whole debate in the Western world

76
0:04:09.631,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is about the level of taxation.

77
0:04:11.489,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But I think there's another debate to be asked,

78
0:04:13.736,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which is the level of control we have over our tax money,

79
0:04:17.191,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse;

80
0:04:21.851,000 --> 0:04:25,000
what costs us 10 pounds in a different context, we may actually welcome.

81
0:04:27.564,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You know, pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health,

82
0:04:31.902,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and you're merely feeling a mug.

83
0:04:33.855,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Pay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward,

84
0:04:37.141,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and you're called a philanthropist.

85
0:04:40.177,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I'm probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax.

86
0:04:43.602,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:45.313,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So I'll give you one in return: how you frame things really matters.

88
0:04:50.537,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Do you call it "The bailout of Greece"?

89
0:04:52.839,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Or "The bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece"?

90
0:04:56.059,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:57.094,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Because they are actually the same thing.

92
0:04:59.468,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What you call them actually affects how you react to them,

93
0:05:03.352,000 --> 0:05:05,000
viscerally and morally.

94
0:05:05.41,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I think psychological value is great, to be absolutely honest.

95
0:05:08.628,000 --> 0:05:1,000
One of my great friends, a professor called Nick Chater,

96
0:05:11.524,000 --> 0:05:13,000
who's the Professor of Decision Sciences in London,

97
0:05:14.422,000 --> 0:05:18,000
believes we should spend far less time looking into humanity's hidden depths,

98
0:05:18.946,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows.

99
0:05:22.393,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I think that's true, actually.

100
0:05:23.929,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do.

101
0:05:29.027,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But what we don't have is a really good model of human psychology --

102
0:05:32.634,000 --> 0:05:34,000
at least pre-Kahneman, perhaps,

103
0:05:34.943,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we didn't have a really good model of human psychology

104
0:05:37.931,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to put alongside models of engineering, of neoclassical economics.

105
0:05:42.828,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So people who believed in psychological solutions didn't have a model.

106
0:05:46.175,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We didn't have a framework.

107
0:05:48.134,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is what Warren Buffett's business partner Charlie Munger calls

108
0:05:51.505,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"a latticework on which to hang your ideas."

109
0:05:54.707,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Engineers, economists, classical economists

110
0:05:57.604,000 --> 0:05:59,000
all had a very, very robust existing latticework

111
0:06:00.559,000 --> 0:06:02,000
on which practically every idea could be hung.

112
0:06:03.278,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We merely have a collection of random individual insights

113
0:06:06.698,000 --> 0:06:07,000
without an overall model.

114
0:06:08.872,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And what that means is that, in looking at solutions,

115
0:06:13.335,000 --> 0:06:15,000
we've probably given too much priority

116
0:06:16.085,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to what I call technical engineering solutions, Newtonian solutions,

117
0:06:20.23,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and not nearly enough to the psychological ones.

118
0:06:22.632,000 --> 0:06:24,000
You know my example of the Eurostar:

119
0:06:24.969,000 --> 0:06:25,000
six million pounds spent

120
0:06:26.191,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to reduce the journey time between Paris and London

121
0:06:29.435,000 --> 0:06:3,000
by about 40 minutes.

122
0:06:31.829,000 --> 0:06:34,000
For 0.01 percent of this money, you could have put wi-fi on the trains,

123
0:06:35.701,000 --> 0:06:37,000
which wouldn't have reduced the duration of the journey,

124
0:06:38.393,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefulness far more.

125
0:06:43.285,000 --> 0:06:44,000
For maybe 10 percent of the money,

126
0:06:44.977,000 --> 0:06:47,000
you could have paid all of the world's top male and female supermodels

127
0:06:48.335,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to walk up and down the train handing out free Château Pétrus

128
0:06:51.294,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to all the passengers.

129
0:06:52.592,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:53.658,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You'd still have five million pounds in change,

131
0:06:56.032,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.

132
0:06:58.681,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:02.799,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically?

134
0:07:06.185,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I think it's because there's an imbalance,

135
0:07:08.693,000 --> 0:07:14,000
an asymmetry in the way we treat creative, emotionally driven psychological ideas

136
0:07:15.351,000 --> 0:07:19,000
versus the way we treat rational, numerical, spreadsheet-driven ideas.

137
0:07:20.276,000 --> 0:07:22,000
If you're a creative person, I think, quite rightly,

138
0:07:22.767,000 --> 0:07:24,000
you have to share all your ideas for approval

139
0:07:24.926,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with people much more rational than you.

140
0:07:26.887,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You have to go in and have a cost-benefit analysis,

141
0:07:30.175,000 --> 0:07:33,000
a feasibility study, an ROI study and so forth.

142
0:07:33.252,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And I think that's probably right.

143
0:07:35.903,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But this does not apply the other way around.

144
0:07:38.573,000 --> 0:07:4,000
People who have an existing framework --

145
0:07:40.625,000 --> 0:07:42,000
an economic framework, an engineering framework --

146
0:07:43.028,000 --> 0:07:46,000
feel that, actually, logic is its own answer.

147
0:07:46.763,000 --> 0:07:48,000
What they don't say is, "Well, the numbers all seem to add up,

148
0:07:49.693,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but before I present this idea, I'll show it to some really crazy people

149
0:07:53.169,000 --> 0:07:55,000
to see if they can come up with something better."

150
0:07:55.559,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And so we -- artificially, I think -- prioritize

151
0:07:58.338,000 --> 0:08:01,000
what I'd call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas.

152
0:08:02.837,000 --> 0:08:04,000
An example of a great psychological idea:

153
0:08:04.893,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the single best improvement in passenger satisfaction

154
0:08:07.533,000 --> 0:08:08,000
on the London Underground,

155
0:08:08.861,000 --> 0:08:09,000
per pound spent,

156
0:08:10.455,000 --> 0:08:12,000
came when they didn't add any extra trains,

157
0:08:12.814,000 --> 0:08:13,000
nor change the frequency of the trains;

158
0:08:14.743,000 --> 0:08:17,000
they put dot matrix display boards on the platforms --

159
0:08:18.877,000 --> 0:08:21,000
because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality,

160
0:08:22.752,000 --> 0:08:23,000
its duration,

161
0:08:24.019,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait.

162
0:08:27.457,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock

163
0:08:30.37,000 --> 0:08:31,000
is less frustrating and irritating

164
0:08:32.287,000 --> 0:08:34,000
than waiting four minutes, knuckle biting, going,

165
0:08:35.25,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"When's this train going to damn well arrive?"

166
0:08:38.139,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Here's a beautiful example of a psychological solution

167
0:08:40.72,000 --> 0:08:41,000
deployed in Korea.

168
0:08:41.915,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay.

169
0:08:44.348,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments.

170
0:08:47.398,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Why?

171
0:08:48.58,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Because road rage, impatience and general irritation are massively reduced

172
0:08:52.125,000 --> 0:08:55,000
when you can actually see the time you have to wait.

173
0:08:55.998,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In China, not really understanding the principle behind this,

174
0:08:58.925,000 --> 0:09:,000
they applied the same principle to green traffic lights --

175
0:09:01.688,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

176
0:09:05.55,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which isn't a great idea.

177
0:09:07.096,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You're 200 yards away, you realize you've got five seconds to go,

178
0:09:10.21,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you floor it.

179
0:09:11.386,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:14.733,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The Koreans, very assiduously, did test both.

181
0:09:17.258,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights;

182
0:09:20.617,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights.

183
0:09:23.229,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This is all I'm asking for, really, in human decision making,

184
0:09:26.191,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is the consideration of these three things.

185
0:09:28.32,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I'm not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other.

186
0:09:31.309,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I'm merely saying that when you solve problems,

187
0:09:33.573,000 --> 0:09:35,000
you should look at all three of these equally,

188
0:09:36.079,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and you should seek as far as possible

189
0:09:38.304,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle.

190
0:09:41.187,000 --> 0:09:42,000
If you actually look at a great business,

191
0:09:43.182,000 --> 0:09:46,000
you'll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play.

192
0:09:46.795,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Really successful businesses --

193
0:09:48.502,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Google is a great, great technological success,

194
0:09:51.188,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but it's also based on a very good psychological insight:

195
0:09:55.354,000 --> 0:09:57,000
people believe something that only does one thing

196
0:09:57.935,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else.

197
0:10:02.118,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's an innate thing called "goal dilution."

198
0:10:04.848,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this.

199
0:10:07.633,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Everybody else at the time of Google, more or less,

200
0:10:10.147,000 --> 0:10:11,000
was trying to be a portal.

201
0:10:11.418,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Yes, there's a search function, but you also have weather,

202
0:10:14.268,000 --> 0:10:15,000
sports scores, bits of news.

203
0:10:17.189,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Google understood that if you're just a search engine,

204
0:10:19.755,000 --> 0:10:21,000
people assume you're a very, very good search engine.

205
0:10:22.617,000 --> 0:10:25,000
All of you know this, actually, from when you go in to buy a television,

206
0:10:26.123,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and in the shabbier end of the row of flat-screen TVs,

207
0:10:29.049,000 --> 0:10:31,000
you can see, are these rather despised things

208
0:10:31.378,000 --> 0:10:33,000
called "combined TV and DVD players."

209
0:10:35.062,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things,

210
0:10:38.277,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go, "Uck.

211
0:10:41.74,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player."

212
0:10:45.696,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So we walk out of the shops with one of each.

213
0:10:48.586,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one.

214
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems

215
0:10:56.917,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that we didn't even realize were problems at all.

216
0:10:59.272,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics.

217
0:11:03.059,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Don't give them 24 white pills;

218
0:11:04.652,000 --> 0:11:07,000
give them 18 white pills and six blue ones

219
0:11:07.689,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and tell them to take the white pills first,

220
0:11:09.78,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and then take the blue ones.

221
0:11:12.146,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It's called "chunking."

222
0:11:13.321,000 --> 0:11:15,000
The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater

223
0:11:16.321,000 --> 0:11:18,000
when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle.

224
0:11:20.107,000 --> 0:11:22,000
One of the great mistakes, I think, of economics

225
0:11:22.477,000 --> 0:11:24,000
is it fails to understand that what something is --

226
0:11:24.904,000 --> 0:11:26,000
whether it's retirement, unemployment, cost --

227
0:11:28.676,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is a function, not only of its amount, but also its meaning.

228
0:11:33.231,000 --> 0:11:35,000
This is a toll crossing in Britain.

229
0:11:36.057,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Quite often queues happen at the tolls.

230
0:11:39.018,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Sometimes you get very, very severe queues.

231
0:11:41.266,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You could apply the same principle, actually,

232
0:11:43.48,000 --> 0:11:44,000
to the security lanes in airports.

233
0:11:45.244,000 --> 0:11:47,000
What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money

234
0:11:48.254,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to cross the bridge,

235
0:11:49.429,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but go through a lane that's an express lane?

236
0:11:51.572,000 --> 0:11:52,000
It's not an unreasonable thing to do;

237
0:11:53.366,000 --> 0:11:55,000
it's an economically efficient thing to do.

238
0:11:55.401,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Time means more to some people than others.

239
0:11:57.466,000 --> 0:11:59,000
If you're waiting trying to get to a job interview,

240
0:11:59.921,000 --> 0:12:03,000
you'd patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane.

241
0:12:04.159,000 --> 0:12:06,000
If you're on the way to visit your mother-in-law,

242
0:12:06.512,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you'd probably prefer --

243
0:12:07.687,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

244
0:12:08.894,000 --> 0:12:1,000
you'd probably prefer to stay on the left.

245
0:12:11.616,000 --> 0:12:14,000
The only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution,

246
0:12:15.117,000 --> 0:12:16,000
people hate it ...

247
0:12:16.894,000 --> 0:12:19,000
because they think you're deliberately creating delays at the bridge

248
0:12:20.249,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in order to maximize your revenue,

249
0:12:21.927,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and, "Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your incompetence?"

250
0:12:25.636,000 --> 0:12:27,000
On the other hand, change the frame slightly

251
0:12:27.84,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and create charitable yield management,

252
0:12:30.155,000 --> 0:12:33,000
so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company,

253
0:12:33.313,000 --> 0:12:34,000
it goes to charity ...

254
0:12:35.471,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and the mental willingness to pay completely changes.

255
0:12:39.388,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You have a relatively economically efficient solution,

256
0:12:42.055,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but one that actually meets with public approval

257
0:12:44.398,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and even a small degree of affection,

258
0:12:46.422,000 --> 0:12:48,000
rather than being seen as bastardy.

259
0:12:49.764,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So where economists make the fundamental mistake

260
0:12:52.442,000 --> 0:12:53,000
is they think that money is money.

261
0:12:55.535,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Actually, my pain experienced in paying five pounds

262
0:12:59.79,000 --> 0:13:01,000
is not just proportionate to the amount,

263
0:13:01.961,000 --> 0:13:02,000
but where I think that money is going.

264
0:13:04.574,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy.

265
0:13:07.594,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It could revolutionize the public services.

266
0:13:09.621,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It could actually change things quite significantly.

267
0:13:12.158,000 --> 0:13:13,000
[Ludwig Von Mises is my hero.]

268
0:13:13.644,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Here's a guy you all need to study.

269
0:13:15.382,000 --> 0:13:16,000
He's an Austrian School economist

270
0:13:17.011,000 --> 0:13:21,000
who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in Vienna.

271
0:13:21.599,000 --> 0:13:23,000
What was interesting about the Austrian School

272
0:13:23.815,000 --> 0:13:26,000
is they actually grew up alongside Freud.

273
0:13:26.872,000 --> 0:13:28,000
And so they're predominantly interested in psychology.

274
0:13:29.549,000 --> 0:13:33,000
They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology,

275
0:13:34.126,000 --> 0:13:36,000
which is a prior discipline to the study of economics.

276
0:13:36.746,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Praxeology is the study of human choice, action and decision-making.

277
0:13:41.92,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I think they're right.

278
0:13:43.269,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I think the danger we have in today's world

279
0:13:45.361,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is we have the study of economics

280
0:13:47.065,000 --> 0:13:51,000
considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology.

281
0:13:51.119,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But as Charlie Munger says, "If economics isn't behavioral,

282
0:13:54.112,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I don't know what the hell is."

283
0:13:57.064,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Von Mises, interestingly, believes economics is just a subset of psychology.

284
0:14:02.889,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I think he just refers to economics

285
0:14:04.818,000 --> 0:14:07,000
as "the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity."

286
0:14:09.002,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But Von Mises, among many other things,

287
0:14:12.122,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation

288
0:14:16.796,000 --> 0:14:2,000
for the value of marketing, the value of perceived value

289
0:14:21.027,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and the fact that we should treat it as being absolutely equivalent

290
0:14:24.328,000 --> 0:14:25,000
to any other kind of value.

291
0:14:26.314,000 --> 0:14:28,000
We tend to, all of us, even those of us who work in marketing,

292
0:14:29.29,000 --> 0:14:3,000
think of value in two ways:

293
0:14:30.612,000 --> 0:14:32,000
the real value, which is when you make something in a factory

294
0:14:33.533,000 --> 0:14:34,000
or provide a service,

295
0:14:34.711,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and then there's a dubious value,

296
0:14:36.353,000 --> 0:14:38,000
which you create by changing the way people look at things.

297
0:14:39.188,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction.

298
0:14:41.506,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And he used this following analogy:

299
0:14:43.421,000 --> 0:14:48,000
he referred to strange economists called the French physiocrats,

300
0:14:48.778,000 --> 0:14:51,000
who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land.

301
0:14:52.432,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So if you're a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer,

302
0:14:54.941,000 --> 0:14:55,000
you created true value.

303
0:14:56.386,000 --> 0:14:58,000
If however, you bought some wool from the shepherd

304
0:14:59.269,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and charged a premium for converting it into a hat,

305
0:15:02.274,000 --> 0:15:03,000
you weren't actually creating value,

306
0:15:04.08,000 --> 0:15:05,000
you were exploiting the shepherd.

307
0:15:06.699,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Now, Von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake

308
0:15:10.446,000 --> 0:15:12,000
with regard to advertising and marketing.

309
0:15:12.837,000 --> 0:15:13,000
He says if you run a restaurant,

310
0:15:14.743,000 --> 0:15:16,000
there is no healthy distinction to be made

311
0:15:17.006,000 --> 0:15:19,000
between the value you create by cooking the food

312
0:15:19.583,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and the value you create by sweeping the floor.

313
0:15:22.463,000 --> 0:15:24,000
One of them creates, perhaps, the primary product --

314
0:15:24.977,000 --> 0:15:25,000
the thing we think we're paying for --

315
0:15:26.866,000 --> 0:15:28,000
the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy

316
0:15:29.731,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and appreciate that product.

317
0:15:31.279,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And the idea that one of them should have priority over the other

318
0:15:34.475,000 --> 0:15:35,000
is fundamentally wrong.

319
0:15:36.204,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Try this quick thought experiment:

320
0:15:37.895,000 --> 0:15:39,000
imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin-starred food,

321
0:15:40.57,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but where the restaurant smells of sewage

322
0:15:43.241,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and there's human feces on the floor.

323
0:15:45.403,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Laughter)

324
0:15:46.836,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The best thing you can do there to create value

325
0:15:49.353,000 --> 0:15:52,000
is not actually to improve the food still further,

326
0:15:52.393,000 --> 0:15:54,000
it's to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor.

327
0:15:57.519,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And it's vital we understand this.

328
0:16:00.096,000 --> 0:16:02,000
If that seems like a sort of strange, abstruse thing --

329
0:16:02.767,000 --> 0:16:05,000
in the UK, the post office had a 98 percent success rate

330
0:16:06.689,000 --> 0:16:08,000
at delivering first-class mail the next day.

331
0:16:09.452,000 --> 0:16:1,000
They decided this wasn't good enough,

332
0:16:11.361,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and they wanted to get it up to 99.

333
0:16:14.494,000 --> 0:16:17,000
The effort to do that almost broke the organization.

334
0:16:18.78,000 --> 0:16:2,000
If, at the same time, you'd gone and asked people,

335
0:16:21.194,000 --> 0:16:23,000
"What percentage of first-class mail arrives the next day?"

336
0:16:24.037,000 --> 0:16:27,000
the average answer, or the modal answer, would have been "50 to 60 percent."

337
0:16:28.641,000 --> 0:16:3,000
Now, if your perception is much worse than your reality,

338
0:16:31.379,000 --> 0:16:34,000
what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality?

339
0:16:34.427,000 --> 0:16:37,000
That's like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks.

340
0:16:39.622,000 --> 0:16:41,000
What you need to do is, first of all, tell people

341
0:16:42.364,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that 98 percent of first-class mail gets there the next day.

342
0:16:46.895,000 --> 0:16:47,000
That's pretty good.

343
0:16:48.44,000 --> 0:16:51,000
I would argue, in Britain, there's a much better frame of reference,

344
0:16:51.672,000 --> 0:16:54,000
which is to tell people that more first-class mail arrives the next day

345
0:16:55.063,000 --> 0:16:57,000
in the UK than in Germany, because generally, in Britain,

346
0:16:57.802,000 --> 0:16:59,000
if you want to make us happy about something,

347
0:17:00.11,000 --> 0:17:02,000
just tell us we do it better than the Germans.

348
0:17:02.326,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Laughter)

349
0:17:04.08,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Applause)

350
0:17:06.356,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value,

351
0:17:09.601,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and therefore, the actual value is completely transformed.

352
0:17:13.031,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It has to be said of the Germans

353
0:17:14.7,000 --> 0:17:16,000
that the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job

354
0:17:17.426,000 --> 0:17:18,000
of creating a united Europe.

355
0:17:18.904,000 --> 0:17:2,000
The only thing they didn't expect is they're uniting Europe

356
0:17:21.798,000 --> 0:17:23,000
through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans.

357
0:17:24.82,000 --> 0:17:26,000
But I'm British; that's the way we like it.

358
0:17:26.894,000 --> 0:17:28,000
(Laughter)

359
0:17:29.359,000 --> 0:17:31,000
What you'll also notice is that, in any case,

360
0:17:31.504,000 --> 0:17:32,000
our perception is leaky.

361
0:17:32.718,000 --> 0:17:34,000
We can't tell the difference between the quality of the food

362
0:17:35.62,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and the environment in which we consume it.

363
0:17:37.657,000 --> 0:17:39,000
All of you will have seen this phenomenon

364
0:17:39.719,000 --> 0:17:4,000
if you have your car washed or valeted.

365
0:17:41.725,000 --> 0:17:44,000
When you drive away, your car feels as if it drives better.

366
0:17:44.87,000 --> 0:17:45,000
(Laughter)

367
0:17:46.235,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And the reason for this --

368
0:17:47.515,000 --> 0:17:49,000
unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil

369
0:17:50.187,000 --> 0:17:53,000
and performing work which I'm not paying him for and I'm unaware of --

370
0:17:53.554,000 --> 0:17:55,000
is because perception is, in any case, leaky.

371
0:17:55.885,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain

372
0:17:59.826,000 --> 0:18:,000
than analgesics that are not branded.

373
0:18:01.661,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I don't just mean through reported pain reduction --

374
0:18:04.303,000 --> 0:18:05,000
actual measured pain reduction.

375
0:18:05.998,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And so perception actually is leaky in any case.

376
0:18:11.281,000 --> 0:18:14,000
So if you do something that's perceptually bad in one respect,

377
0:18:14.323,000 --> 0:18:15,000
you can damage the other.

378
0:18:15.57,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Thank you very much.

379
0:18:16.745,000 --> 0:18:18,000
(Applause)

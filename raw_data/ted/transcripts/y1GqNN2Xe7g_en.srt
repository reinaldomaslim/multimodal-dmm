1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Early visions of wireless power

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
basically about 100 years ago.

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The thought that

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
no one ever thought of that.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And so, in fact, he actually set about

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
doing a variety of things.

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built

11
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power

13
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
anywhere on Earth.

14
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the

15
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Federal Bureau of Investigation

16
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
took it down for security purposes,

17
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
sometime in the early 1900s.

18
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But the one thing that did come out of electricity

19
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is that we love this stuff so much.

20
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
I mean, think about how much we love this.

21
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
If you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars

22
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that have been invested in infrastructure around the world,

23
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
putting up wires to get power from where it's created

24
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to where it's used.

25
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The other thing is, we love batteries.

26
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And for those of us that have an environmental element to us,

27
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
there is something like 40 billion

28
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
disposable batteries built every year

29
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
for power that, generally speaking,

30
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is used within a few inches or a few feet

31
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of where there is very inexpensive power.

32
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So, before I got here,

33
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I thought, "You know, I am from North America.

34
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States."

35
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I thought I'd better look it up first.

36
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So definition number six is the North American

37
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
definition of the word "suck."

38
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Wires suck, they really do.

39
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture

40
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or something under your desk.

41
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The other thing is, batteries suck too.

42
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And they really, really do.

43
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?

44
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
40 billion of these things built.

45
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is what happens.

46
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They fall apart, they disintegrate,

47
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and they end up here.

48
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So when you talk about expensive power,

49
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the cost per kilowatt-hour

50
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to supply battery power to something

51
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is on the order of two to three hundred pounds.

52
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Think about that.

53
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The most expensive grid power in the world

54
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
is thousandths of that.

55
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So fortunately, one of the other definitions

56
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of "suck" that was in there, it does create a vacuum.

57
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And nature really does abhor a vacuum.

58
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
What happened back a few years ago

59
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT

60
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance.

61
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb

62
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
at a distance of about two meters.

63
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It got about 50 percent of the efficiency --

64
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
by the way, that's still a couple thousand times

65
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
more efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.

66
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But were able to light that,

67
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and do it very successfully.

68
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This was actually the experiment. So you can see

69
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the coils were somewhat larger.

70
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint.

71
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This all came from a professor

72
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
waking up at night to the third night in a row

73
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that his wife's cellphone was beeping

74
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because it was running out of battery power.

75
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls,

76
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?"

77
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And he actually came up with this concept

78
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of resonant energy transfer.

79
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.

80
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other,

81
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and actually do transfer power

82
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance.

83
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do

84
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
was separate the coils in a transformer

85
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to a greater distance than the size of those transformers

86
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
using this technology, which is not dissimilar

87
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.

88
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's a resonant phenomenon

89
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award,

90
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
which is nicknamed the Genius Award,

91
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
last September, for his discovery.

92
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So how does it work?

93
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers,

94
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
there's a capacitor attached to it too.

95
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And if you can cause that coil to resonate,

96
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
what will happen is it will pulse

97
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
at alternating current frequencies --

98
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
at a fairly high frequency, by the way.

99
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And if you can bring another device

100
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
close enough to the source,

101
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that will only work at exactly that frequency,

102
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple,

103
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and transfer magnetic energy between them.

104
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And then what you do is, you start out with electricity,

105
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field,

106
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
turn it back into electricity,

107
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and then you can use it.

108
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Number one question I get asked.

109
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe.

110
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You know. What about safety?

111
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The first thing is this is not a "radiative" technology.

112
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It doesn't radiate.

113
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field.

114
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It stays within either what we call the source,

115
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or within the device.

116
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And actually, the magnetic fields we're using

117
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.

118
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We live in a magnetic field.

119
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is

120
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.

121
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen.

122
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere

123
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that will regulate everything we do.

124
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They've pretty much set field exposure limits,

125
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today

126
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
sort of sit underneath those guidelines.

127
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Mobile electronics.

128
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Home electronics.

129
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Those cords under your desk, I bet everybody here

130
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
has something that looks like that or those batteries.

131
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
There are industrial applications.

132
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And then finally, electric vehicles.

133
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
These electric cars are beautiful.

134
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But who is going to want to plug them in?

135
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Imagine driving into your garage -- we've built a system to do this --

136
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you drive into your garage, and the car charges itself,

137
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.

138
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently.

139
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices,

140
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
where people don't have to die of infections anymore

141
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
if you can seal the thing up.

142
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.

143
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes

144
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and show you, actually, how it works.

145
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here.

146
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You've got a coil.

147
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier

148
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.

149
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We put one on the back of the television set.

150
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
By the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.

151
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
There's lots of electronics and secret sauce

152
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it.

153
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But then what's going to happen is, it will create a field.

154
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
It will cause one to get created

155
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
on the other side.

156
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And if the demo gods are willing,

157
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
in about 10 seconds or so we should see it.

158
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The 10 seconds actually are because we --

159
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in

160
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
when you use just a cord.

161
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Generally, you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought

162
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
we put a little computer in it that has to wake up

163
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to tell it to do that.

164
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So, I'll plug that in.

165
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It creates a magnetic field here.

166
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It causes one to be created out here.

167
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds

168
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we should start to see ...

169
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
This is a commercially --

170
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause)

171
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
available color television set.

172
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Imagine, you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall.

173
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
How many people want to hang them on the wall?

174
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down.

175
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
Imagine if you can get rid of it.

176
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety.

177
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.

178
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.

179
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Almost immediately, though, people ask,

180
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
"How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?"

181
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea

182
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
was his wife's cellphone beeping.

183
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So, I wanted to show you something.

184
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.

185
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This a Google G1.

186
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You know, it's the latest thing that's come out.

187
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It runs the Android operating system.

188
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I think I heard somebody talk about that before.

189
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It's odd. It has a battery.

190
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It also has coiled electronics

191
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that WiTricity has put into the back of it.

192
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And if I can get the camera --

193
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
okay, great --

194
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you'll see, as I get sort of close...

195
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.

196
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

197
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And I know some of you are Apple aficionados.

198
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones.

199
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So we put a little sleeve on the back,

200
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.

201
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.

202
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Applause)

203
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And Nokia as well.

204
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that,

205
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.

206
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But they typically use it to light up the screen.

207
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.

208
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They could go in the floor. They could go, actually, underneath your desktop.

209
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So that when you walk in or you come in from home,

210
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
if you carry a purse, it works in your purse.

211
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again.

212
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And think of what that would do for you.

213
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So I think in closing,

214
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine,

215
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I thought I'd put up one more slide.

216
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And for those of you who can't read it, it says,

217
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
"It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology."

218
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So, thank you very much.

219
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Applause)

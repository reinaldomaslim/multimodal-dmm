1
0:00:15.894,000 --> 0:00:18,000
How often do we hear that people just don't care?

2
0:00:20.218,000 --> 0:00:21,000
How many times have you been told

3
0:00:21.833,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that real, substantial change isn't possible

4
0:00:25.098,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because most people are too selfish,

5
0:00:27.197,000 --> 0:00:28,000
too stupid or too lazy

6
0:00:29.153,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to try to make a difference in their community?

7
0:00:31.809,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it

8
0:00:34.927,000 --> 0:00:35,000
doesn't actually exist;

9
0:00:36.662,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but rather, that people do care,

10
0:00:38.86,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement

11
0:00:42.593,000 --> 0:00:45,000
by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way.

12
0:00:45.978,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I'll give you some examples of what I mean.

13
0:00:48.034,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Let's start with city hall.

14
0:00:50.123,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You ever see one of these before?

15
0:00:52.218,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is a newspaper ad.

16
0:00:53.86,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building

17
0:00:57.252,000 --> 0:00:59,000
so the neighborhood knows what's happening.

18
0:00:59.347,000 --> 0:01:,000
As you can see, it's impossible to read.

19
0:01:01.293,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You need to get halfway down

20
0:01:02.693,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to even find out which address they're talking about,

21
0:01:05.251,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and then further down, in tiny 10-point font,

22
0:01:07.419,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to find out how to actually get involved.

23
0:01:09.479,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way --

24
0:01:12.63,000 --> 0:01:14,000
if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes --

25
0:01:14.696,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:15.86,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And put an ad in the paper like that.

27
0:01:17.849,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:21.86,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Now, that would never happen.

29
0:01:24.695,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You'll never see an ad like that,

30
0:01:26.298,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes,

31
0:01:28.753,000 --> 0:01:3,000
whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn't want you involved

32
0:01:31.658,000 --> 0:01:32,000
with the planning process,

33
0:01:32.934,000 --> 0:01:34,000
otherwise their ads would look something like this,

34
0:01:35.374,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with all the information laid out clearly.

35
0:01:37.415,000 --> 0:01:39,000
As long as the city's putting out notices like this

36
0:01:39.856,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to try to get people engaged,

37
0:01:41.306,000 --> 0:01:43,000
then of course people aren't going to be engaged.

38
0:01:43.664,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But that's not apathy; that's intentional exclusion.

39
0:01:47.584,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Public space.

40
0:01:48.872,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Applause)

41
0:01:51.781,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces

42
0:01:54.14,000 --> 0:01:58,000
is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change,

43
0:01:58.424,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because we've essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression.

44
0:02:01.647,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice,

45
0:02:04.256,000 --> 0:02:06,000
dominating the visual and mental environment.

46
0:02:06.679,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The problem with this model is there are some amazing messages

47
0:02:09.683,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that need to be said, that aren't profitable to say.

48
0:02:12.548,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So you're never going to see them on a billboard.

49
0:02:16.015,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The media plays an important role

50
0:02:17.652,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in developing our relationship with political change,

51
0:02:20.86,000 --> 0:02:24,000
mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals,

52
0:02:25.035,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but even when they do talk about important political issues,

53
0:02:27.912,000 --> 0:02:29,000
they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement.

54
0:02:30.789,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I'll give you an example.

55
0:02:32.031,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The "Now" magazine from last week: progressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.

56
0:02:35.648,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is the cover story.

57
0:02:36.86,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's an article about a theater performance,

58
0:02:39.372,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and it starts with basic information about where it is,

59
0:02:42.154,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in case you actually want to go and see it after you've read the article --

60
0:02:45.703,000 --> 0:02:46,000
where, the time, the website.

61
0:02:47.51,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Same with this -- it's a movie review.

62
0:02:49.939,000 --> 0:02:5,000
An art review.

63
0:02:51.547,000 --> 0:02:54,000
A book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go.

64
0:02:54.709,000 --> 0:02:56,000
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it,

65
0:02:57.443,000 --> 0:02:58,000
maybe you want to go there.

66
0:02:58.894,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So they tell you where it is, the prices, the address, the phone number, etc.

67
0:03:02.691,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Then you get to their political articles.

68
0:03:04.692,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Here's a great article about an important election race that's happening.

69
0:03:08.176,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It talks about the candidates, written very well,

70
0:03:10.529,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but no information, no follow-up, no websites for the campaigns,

71
0:03:13.78,000 --> 0:03:16,000
no information about when the debates are, where the campaign offices are.

72
0:03:17.329,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Here's another good article,

73
0:03:18.782,000 --> 0:03:21,000
about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit,

74
0:03:21.86,000 --> 0:03:23,000
without any contact information for the campaign.

75
0:03:24.598,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The message seems to be

76
0:03:26.146,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that the readers are most likely to want to eat, maybe read a book,

77
0:03:29.581,000 --> 0:03:31,000
maybe see a movie, but not be engaged in their community.

78
0:03:32.368,000 --> 0:03:35,000
You might think this is a small thing, but I think it's important,

79
0:03:35.53,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because it sets a tone

80
0:03:36.95,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport.

81
0:03:43.423,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Heroes: How do we view leadership?

82
0:03:45.692,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Look at these 10 movies. What do they have in common?

83
0:03:48.379,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Anyone?

84
0:03:51.298,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They all have heroes who were chosen.

85
0:03:53.396,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Someone came up to them and said, "You're the chosen one.

86
0:03:56.135,000 --> 0:03:58,000
There's a prophecy. You have to save the world."

87
0:03:58.433,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And then they go off and save the world because they've been told to,

88
0:04:01.759,000 --> 0:04:02,000
with a few people tagging along.

89
0:04:03.342,000 --> 0:04:04,000
This helps me understand

90
0:04:04.522,000 --> 0:04:07,000
why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders --

91
0:04:07.573,000 --> 0:04:1,000
because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about.

92
0:04:11.121,000 --> 0:04:13,000
A heroic effort is a collective effort,

93
0:04:13.658,000 --> 0:04:14,000
number one.

94
0:04:15.188,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Number two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous,

95
0:04:18.58,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end.

96
0:04:20.786,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's an ongoing process your whole life.

97
0:04:22.872,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But most importantly, it's voluntary.

98
0:04:24.673,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It's voluntary.

99
0:04:26.115,000 --> 0:04:28,000
As long as we're teaching our kids

100
0:04:28.502,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead,

101
0:04:31.948,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or someone tells you you're part of a prophecy,

102
0:04:34.198,000 --> 0:04:37,000
they're missing the most important characteristic of leadership,

103
0:04:37.251,000 --> 0:04:38,000
which is that it comes from within.

104
0:04:38.962,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's about following your own dreams, uninvited,

105
0:04:42.86,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and then working with others to make those dreams come true.

106
0:04:45.86,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Political parties: oh, boy.

107
0:04:48.259,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points

108
0:04:52.776,000 --> 0:04:53,000
for people to get engaged in politics.

109
0:04:54.727,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Instead, they've become, sadly,

110
0:04:57.016,000 --> 0:04:59,000
uninspiring and uncreative organizations

111
0:04:59.926,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups

112
0:05:03.86,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that they end up all saying the same thing,

113
0:05:05.932,000 --> 0:05:08,000
pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear

114
0:05:09.052,000 --> 0:05:11,000
at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas.

115
0:05:11.86,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And people can smell that, and it feeds cynicism.

116
0:05:14.64,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

117
0:05:20.984,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Charitable status.

118
0:05:22.452,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.

119
0:05:26.23,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change,

120
0:05:28.785,000 --> 0:05:31,000
because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices

121
0:05:32.281,000 --> 0:05:34,000
are completely silenced, especially during election time.

122
0:05:35.188,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Which leads us to the last one, which is: our elections.

123
0:05:38.956,000 --> 0:05:39,000
As you may have noticed,

124
0:05:40.148,000 --> 0:05:42,000
our elections in Canada are a complete joke.

125
0:05:42.279,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We use out-of-date systems

126
0:05:43.794,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that are unfair and create random results.

127
0:05:46.119,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Canada's currently led by a party

128
0:05:47.86,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that most Canadians didn't actually want.

129
0:05:50.332,000 --> 0:05:53,000
How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote

130
0:05:53.971,000 --> 0:05:55,000
when votes don't count in Canada?

131
0:05:56.272,000 --> 0:05:59,000
You add all this up together, and of course people are apathetic.

132
0:05:59.664,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's like trying to run into a brick wall.

133
0:06:01.748,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now, I'm not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out

134
0:06:05.089,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and explaining what's in our way.

135
0:06:06.713,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Quite the opposite --

136
0:06:07.89,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care,

137
0:06:12.477,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but that, as I said, we live in this environment

138
0:06:14.86,000 --> 0:06:17,000
where all these obstacles are being put in our way.

139
0:06:18.748,000 --> 0:06:21,000
As long as we believe that people, our own neighbors,

140
0:06:22.223,000 --> 0:06:24,000
are selfish, stupid or lazy,

141
0:06:25.677,000 --> 0:06:26,000
then there's no hope.

142
0:06:28.064,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But we can change all those things I mentioned.

143
0:06:30.399,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We can open up city hall.

144
0:06:31.86,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We can reform our electoral systems.

145
0:06:33.616,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We can democratize our public spaces.

146
0:06:35.617,000 --> 0:06:36,000
My main message is:

147
0:06:37.413,000 --> 0:06:38,000
if we can redefine apathy,

148
0:06:39.115,000 --> 0:06:41,000
not as some kind of internal syndrome,

149
0:06:41.161,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement,

150
0:06:46.589,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and if we can clearly define, clearly identify what those obstacles are,

151
0:06:52.176,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles,

152
0:06:55.791,000 --> 0:06:56,000
then anything is possible.

153
0:06:57.069,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Thank you.

154
0:06:58.253,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Applause)

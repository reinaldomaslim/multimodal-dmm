1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because of their tall stature, their complex structure,

3
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.

4
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I used to climb trees for fun all the time

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees

6
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and forests, through the medium of science.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.

8
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,

9
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
called the canopy, "the last biotic frontier."

10
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,

11
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and share with you what canopy researchers are asking

12
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science.

13
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Let's start our journey on the forest floor

14
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of one of my study sites in Costa Rica.

15
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Because of the overhanging leaves and branches,

16
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
you'll notice that the understory is very dark,

17
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
it's very still.

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy,

19
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,

20
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but rather showing you a very short clip

21
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
from a National Geographic film called "Heroes of the High Frontier."

22
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
This was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica

23
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like

24
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to climb a giant strangler fig.

25
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Music)

26
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Growling)

27
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Rustling)

28
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field,

29
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted

30
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to make their way and their life in the canopy.

31
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations

32
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.

33
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity

34
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and tell you about the ants.

35
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists --

36
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
people who describe and name animals -- have named.

37
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy.

38
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
One of the reasons I tell you about ants

39
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist

40
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did --

41
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.

42
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We've had two children, August Andrew and Erika

43
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and actually, he named ants after them.

44
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us.

45
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But my passion -- in addition to Jack and my children --

46
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
are the plants, the so-called epiphytes,

47
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
those plants that grow up on trees.

48
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.

49
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But rather, it is their leaves that are adapted

50
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.

51
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
These plants occur in great diversity,

52
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
over 28,000 species around the world.

53
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They grow in tropical forests like this one

54
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state.

55
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.

56
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,

57
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
as they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,

58
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
both in the temperate zone and in the tropics.

59
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And these mosses, generated by decomposing,

60
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
are like peat moss in your garden.

61
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water.

62
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
One of the surprising things I discovered

63
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,

64
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
what you'll find underneath them are connections, networks

65
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of what we call canopy roots.

66
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
These are not epiphyte roots:

67
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.

68
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent

69
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor.

70
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested

71
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.

72
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We've done stripping experiments

73
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
where we've removed mats of epiphytes

74
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and looked at the rates of recolonization.

75
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly

76
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and that they would come in encroaching from the side.

77
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time --

78
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
over 20 years -- to regenerate,

79
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
starting from the bottom and growing up.

80
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And even now, after 25 years,

81
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
they're not up there, they have not recolonized completely.

82
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I use this little image to say

83
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
this is what happens to mosses.

84
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
If it's gone, it's gone,

85
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom.

86
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

87
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So, recolonization is really very slow.

88
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
These canopy communities are fragile.

89
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy

90
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
of the intact primary forest,

91
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.

92
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today

93
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.

94
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We know it's a lot,

95
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but we do not yet know the answers to how much,

96
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,

97
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem.

98
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers

99
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy

100
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that Tarzan and Jane were interested in,

101
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but rather that they foster biodiversity

102
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles,

103
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and they also help to keep our global climate stable.

104
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me

105
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems,

106
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you would also see scenes like this.

107
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting

108
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and forest fragmentation,

109
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy

110
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has

111
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
when it is not disturbed by humans.

112
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I've also looked out on urban places like this

113
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.

114
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
People who grew up in a place like this

115
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees

116
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and forests, as I did when I was a young girl.

117
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This troubles me.

118
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Here in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,

119
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions

120
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and trying to figure out how we can answer them.

121
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And especially, you know, as a small brown woman

122
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country,

123
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
far away from the areas of power and money,

124
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?

125
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
How can I reconnect people with trees?"

126
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Well, I think that I can do something.

127
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I know that as a scientist, I have information

128
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,

129
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
inside or outside of academia.

130
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And so, that's what I've begin doing,

131
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.

132
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We consult to the media about canopy questions;

133
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we have a canopy newsletter;

134
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we have an email LISTSERV.

135
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,

136
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the beauty of the canopy,

137
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the necessity of intact canopies,

138
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to people outside of academia.

139
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make --

140
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
those videos and so forth --

141
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
you know, they don't reach everybody,

142
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia,

143
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to.

144
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Treetop Barbie is a great example of that.

145
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
What we do, my students in my lab and I,

146
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village,

147
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses

148
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and we send her out with a canopy handbook.

149
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And my feeling is --

150
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Applause)

151
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Thank you.

152
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Applause)

153
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
-- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit

154
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to become an ambassador who can carry the message

155
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing.

156
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We've also made partnerships with artists,

157
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty

158
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of trees and forest canopies.

159
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects,

160
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
which is the generation of Canopy Confluences.

161
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds,

162
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms;

163
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy,

164
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.

165
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
The results have been fantastic.

166
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I'll just give you a few examples.

167
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao

168
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department

169
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
at Rhode Island School of Design.

170
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences

171
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.

172
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We've had dance people up in the canopy.

173
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Jodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,

174
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.

175
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They made a fabulous dance called "Biome."

176
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They danced in the forest,

177
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,

178
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and also linking up with environmental groups,

179
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to go to different cities and to perform

180
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the science, the dance and the environmental outreach

181
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that we hope will make a difference.

182
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We brought musicians to the canopy,

183
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and they made their music -- and it's fantastic music.

184
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We had wooden flutists, we had oboists,

185
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we had opera singers, we had guitar players,

186
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and we had rap singers.

187
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And I brought a little segment to give you

188
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
of Duke Brady's "Canopy Rap."

189
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Music) That's Duke!

190
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Applause)

191
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
This experience of working with Duke

192
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.

193
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth --

194
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,

195
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I don't have a hope of getting to --

196
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.

197
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So I engaged Caution, this rap singer,

198
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.

199
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,

200
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Caution would rap on it,

201
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and suddenly that branch was really cool.

202
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And then the students would come into our sound studios,

203
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
they would make their own rap songs with their own beats.

204
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
They ended up making a CD

205
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
which they took home to their family and friends,

206
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
thereby expressing their own experiences with nature

207
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in their own medium.

208
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart,

209
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and it involves an economic and social value

210
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
that is associated with epiphytic plants.

211
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
In the Pacific Northwest,

212
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting

213
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
from old-growth forests.

214
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
These mosses are taken from the forest;

215
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists,

216
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.

217
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It's a 265 million dollar industry

218
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and it's increasing rapidly.

219
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
If you remember that bald guy,

220
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks

221
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest

222
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is going to take decades and decades to come back.

223
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So this whole industry is unsustainable.

224
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
What can I, as an ecologist, do about that?

225
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,

226
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild.

227
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,

228
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that would be great.

229
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women --

230
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who don't have access to nature,

231
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
who often have a lot of time, they often have space,

232
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses --

233
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
would be great partners.

234
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And they have become excellent partners.

235
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The best I can imagine.

236
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
They were very enthusiastic.

237
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Applause)

238
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.

239
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,

240
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which, to tell you the truth,

241
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.

242
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design

243
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in order to grow these mosses.

244
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We've been successful as partners

245
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
in figuring out which species grow the fastest,

246
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.

247
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,

248
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.

249
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.

250
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We gave talks once a month,

251
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and that actually ended up implementing

252
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons --

253
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
organic gardens, worm culture, recycling,

254
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
water catchment and beekeeping. (Applause)

255
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Our latest endeavor,

256
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
with a grant

257
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
from the Department of Corrections at Washington state,

258
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.

259
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves

260
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog

261
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.

262
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So they will raise them -- in captivity, of course --

263
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.

264
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And they will have the pleasure, many of them,

265
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop,

266
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
helped nurture, move out into protected wildlands

267
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild.

268
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And so, I think for many reasons --

269
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
ecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual --

270
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
this has been a tremendous project

271
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and I'm really looking forward to

272
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
not only myself and my students doing it,

273
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.

274
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.

275
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I'm trying to help researchers move more outward

276
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to have their own partnerships

277
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with people outside of the academic community.

278
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,

279
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.

280
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together

281
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and make an opera about AIDS.

282
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate change

283
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
that would really make you clap your hands.

284
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.

285
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times,

286
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
it is time for scientists to reach outward,

287
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.

288
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests

289
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
with the tools of science.

290
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
By making these partnerships that I described to you,

291
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart

292
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to have a greater understanding,

293
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to make other discoveries about nature and myself.

294
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
When I look into my heart, I see trees --

295
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
this is actually an image of a real heart --

296
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
there are trees in our hearts,

297
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
there are trees in your hearts.

298
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
When we come to understand nature,

299
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
we are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.

300
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
In these partnerships, I have also learned

301
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that people tend to compartmentalize themselves

302
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
into IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,

303
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but when we share nature,

304
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
when we share our perspectives about nature,

305
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
we find a common denominator.

306
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Finally, as a scientist and as a person

307
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and now, as part of the TED community,

308
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
I feel that I have better tools

309
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature,

310
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
to make new discoveries about nature --

311
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and about humans' place in nature

312
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
wherever we are and whomever you are.

313
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000

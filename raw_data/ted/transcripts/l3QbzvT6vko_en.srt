1
0:00:09.39,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I had grown up around a lot of teachers

2
0:00:22.95,000 --> 0:00:27,000
my mom was a teacher my sister became a

3
0:00:24.54,000 --> 0:00:29,000
teacher and after college so many my

4
0:00:28.2,000 --> 0:00:3,000
friends went into teaching and so many

5
0:00:29.61,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of my friends that were teaching in city

6
0:00:30.81,000 --> 0:00:34,000
schools were having trouble with their

7
0:00:33.42,000 --> 0:00:36,000
students that were keeping up at grade

8
0:00:35.73,000 --> 0:00:37,000
level on in the reading and writing in

9
0:00:37.29,000 --> 0:00:39,000
particular they would talk to me about

10
0:00:38.55,000 --> 0:00:42,000
this and say you know what we really

11
0:00:39.96,000 --> 0:00:44,000
need is just more people more bodies

12
0:00:42.719,000 --> 0:00:47,000
more one-on-one attention more sort of

13
0:00:45.09,000 --> 0:00:49,000
hours more expertise from people that

14
0:00:48.12,000 --> 0:00:51,000
have a skills in English and could work

15
0:00:50.07,000 --> 0:00:55,000
out with these students one-on-one so

16
0:00:51.78,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when I moved back to San Francisco and

17
0:00:55.109,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we went to this building and the idea

18
0:00:56.91,000 --> 0:00:59,000
was to put McSweeney's quarterly that we

19
0:00:59.19,000 --> 0:01:02,000
published twice or three times a year

20
0:01:00.359,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and a few other magazines we're going to

21
0:01:02.219,000 --> 0:01:05,000
move it into an office and we were going

22
0:01:03.51,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to actually share space with a tutoring

23
0:01:05.94,000 --> 0:01:08,000
center so we thought where have all

24
0:01:08.19,000 --> 0:01:11,000
these writers and editors and everybody

25
0:01:09.78,000 --> 0:01:11,000
sort of a writing community coming into

26
0:01:11.31,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the office every day anyway

27
0:01:12.57,000 --> 0:01:15,000
why don't we just open up the front of

28
0:01:14.549,000 --> 0:01:17,000
the building to students to come in

29
0:01:16.14,000 --> 0:01:19,000
there after after school get extra help

30
0:01:18.21,000 --> 0:01:21,000
on their written homework so you have

31
0:01:19.56,000 --> 0:01:23,000
basically no border between these two

32
0:01:22.1,000 --> 0:01:26,000
communities SEP 4 the landlord said well

33
0:01:24.42,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the space is zoned for retail you have

34
0:01:26.25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to come up with something you've got to

35
0:01:27.42,000 --> 0:01:31,000
sell something you can't just you know

36
0:01:29.67,000 --> 0:01:32,000
have a tutoring center so we thought

37
0:01:31.619,000 --> 0:01:34,000
haha while we were renovating this place

38
0:01:33.299,000 --> 0:01:36,000
somebody said you know really kind of

39
0:01:35.34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
looks like the hull of a ship and

40
0:01:36.509,000 --> 0:01:41,000
somebody else said well you should sell

41
0:01:38.1,000 --> 0:01:44,000
pirate supplies so this is the pirate

42
0:01:41.85,000 --> 0:01:45,000
supply store and then right behind it we

43
0:01:44.369,000 --> 0:01:48,000
set up this space which was the tutoring

44
0:01:46.649,000 --> 0:01:49,000
center so right there is the tutoring

45
0:01:48.719,000 --> 0:01:51,000
center and then behind the curtain was

46
0:01:50.31,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the McSweeney's offices where all of us

47
0:01:52.14,000 --> 0:01:54,000
would be working on the magazine and

48
0:01:53.399,000 --> 0:01:56,000
book editing and things like that and

49
0:01:54.719,000 --> 0:01:58,000
what we were trying to offer was every

50
0:01:56.64,000 --> 0:01:59,000
day with one-on-one attention the goal

51
0:01:58.829,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is to have a one-to-one ratio with every

52
0:02:00.42,000 --> 0:02:03,000
one of these students and so you know

53
0:02:01.89,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it's been proven that 35 to 40 hours a

54
0:02:04.289,000 --> 0:02:07,000
year with one-on-one attention a student

55
0:02:06.329,000 --> 0:02:09,000
can get one grade level higher so we

56
0:02:08.1,000 --> 0:02:11,000
started off with about 12 volunteers and

57
0:02:09.81,000 --> 0:02:13,000
then we had about 50 and then a couple

58
0:02:11.94,000 --> 0:02:15,000
hundred and we now have 1400 volunteers

59
0:02:14.43,000 --> 0:02:18,000
on our roster it became this sort of

60
0:02:16.29,000 --> 0:02:19,000
weird happy accident so all the people I

61
0:02:18.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
used to know in Brooklyn they said well

62
0:02:20.129,000 --> 0:02:23,000
why don't we have a place like that here

63
0:02:22.069,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a lot of them had been you know former

64
0:02:23.39,000 --> 0:02:26,000
educators or would-be educators so they

65
0:02:25.43,000 --> 0:02:28,000
combined with a lot of local designers

66
0:02:27.019,000 --> 0:02:3,000
local writers and they just took the

67
0:02:29.209,000 --> 0:02:32,000
idea independently and they did their

68
0:02:30.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
own thing they didn't want to sell

69
0:02:32.359,000 --> 0:02:36,000
pirate supplies they didn't think that

70
0:02:34.549,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that was going to work there so knowing

71
0:02:36.829,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the crime-fighting community in New York

72
0:02:39.439,000 --> 0:02:45,000
they opened the Brooklyn superhero

73
0:02:41.629,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Supply Company and this is La the Echo

74
0:02:45.5,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Park time travel Mart whenever you are

75
0:02:47.599,000 --> 0:02:52,000

76
0:02:51.319,000 --> 0:02:54,000

0:03:07.909,000 --> 0:03:11,000
usher in a new era of participation in

85
0:03:10.31,000 --> 0:03:14,000
our public schools so we created a

86
0:03:12.439,000 --> 0:03:16,000
website it's called once upon a school

87
0:03:14.629,000 --> 0:03:17,000
this site will document every story

88
0:03:16.909,000 --> 0:03:19,000
every project that comes out of this

89
0:03:18.169,000 --> 0:03:21,000
conference and around the world so you

90
0:03:20.599,000 --> 0:03:22,000
go to the website you see a bunch of

91
0:03:21.769,000 --> 0:03:23,000
ideas you can be inspired by and then

92
0:03:23.209,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you add your own projects once you get

93
0:03:24.68,000 --> 0:03:26,000
started we hope that you will take the

94
0:03:25.939,000 --> 0:03:28,000
lead in partnering your innovative

95
0:03:27.62,000 --> 0:03:3,000
spirit and expertise with that of

96
0:03:29.03,000 --> 0:03:32,000
innovative educators in your community

97
0:03:31.34,000 --> 0:03:33,000
always let the teachers lead the way

98
0:03:32.689,000 --> 0:03:34,000
they will tell you how to be useful

99
0:03:33.889,000 --> 0:03:36,000
there's a million ways you can walk up

100
0:03:35.449,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to your local school and consult with

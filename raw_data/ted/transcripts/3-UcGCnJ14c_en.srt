1
0:00:13.489,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Throughout the United States, there is growing social awareness

2
0:00:17.532,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that sexual violence and harassment are far too common occurrences

3
0:00:20.953,000 --> 0:00:22,000
within our various institutions --

4
0:00:23.311,000 --> 0:00:25,000
occurrences often without any accountability.

5
0:00:27.374,000 --> 0:00:29,000
As a result, the Me Too movement is upon us,

6
0:00:29.512,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and survivors everywhere are speaking out to demand change.

7
0:00:32.833,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Students have rallied against sexual assault on campus.

8
0:00:35.834,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Service members have demanded Congress reform the military,

9
0:00:39.711,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and workers ranging from Hollywood stars to janitorial staff

10
0:00:43.693,000 --> 0:00:45,000
have called out sexual harassment in the workplace.

11
0:00:47.359,000 --> 0:00:49,000
This is a tipping point.

12
0:00:49.857,000 --> 0:00:53,000
This is when a social movement can create lasting legal change.

13
0:00:53.974,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But only if we switch tactics.

14
0:00:56.509,000 --> 0:01:,000
Instead of going institution by institution, fighting for reform,

15
0:01:01.047,000 --> 0:01:03,000
it's time to go to the Constitution.

16
0:01:04.909,000 --> 0:01:07,000
As it stands, the US Constitution denies fundamental protections

17
0:01:08.637,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to victims of gender violence such as sexual assault,

18
0:01:11.829,000 --> 0:01:12,000
intimate partner violence

19
0:01:13.068,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and stalking.

20
0:01:14.492,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution,

21
0:01:17.973,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which prohibits state governments from abusing its citizens,

22
0:01:22.03,000 --> 0:01:24,000
does not require state governments to intervene

23
0:01:24.6,000 --> 0:01:26,000
when private parties abuse its citizens.

24
0:01:28.001,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So what does that mean in real life?

25
0:01:30.319,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That means that when a woman calls the police from her home,

26
0:01:33.607,000 --> 0:01:35,000
afraid that an intruder may attack her,

27
0:01:36.231,000 --> 0:01:39,000
she is not entitled to the state's protection.

28
0:01:40.873,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Not only can the police fail to respond,

29
0:01:43.508,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but she will be left without any legal remedy

30
0:01:45.963,000 --> 0:01:47,000
if preventable harm occurs as a result.

31
0:01:49.182,000 --> 0:01:5,000
How can this be?

32
0:01:50.859,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It is because the state, theoretically,

33
0:01:53.922,000 --> 0:01:56,000
acts on behalf of all citizens collectively,

34
0:01:57.304,000 --> 0:01:59,000
not any one citizen individually.

35
0:02:00.873,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The resulting constitutional flaw directly contradicts international law,

36
0:02:05.693,000 --> 0:02:07,000
which requires nation-states to intervene

37
0:02:07.986,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and protect citizens against gender violence by private parties

38
0:02:11.313,000 --> 0:02:12,000
as a human right.

39
0:02:13.733,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Instead of requiring intervention,

40
0:02:15.95,000 --> 0:02:17,000
our Constitution leaves discretion --

41
0:02:18.152,000 --> 0:02:21,000
discretion that states have used to discriminate systemically

42
0:02:21.268,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to deny countless victims any remedy.

43
0:02:25.062,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Unlike what you may have seen on "Law & Order: SVU,"

44
0:02:28.258,000 --> 0:02:3,000
justice is rare for victims of gender violence.

45
0:02:31.52,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And even in those rare cases where law enforcement has chosen to act,

46
0:02:36.422,000 --> 0:02:39,000
victims have no rights during the resulting criminal process.

47
0:02:40.593,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You see, victims are not parties in a criminal case.

48
0:02:43.81,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Rather, they are witnesses;

49
0:02:45.762,000 --> 0:02:46,000
their bodies, evidence.

50
0:02:48.15,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The prosecution does not represent the interests of a victim.

51
0:02:52.315,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Rather, the prosecution represents the interests of the state.

52
0:02:56.368,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And the state has the discretion to dismiss criminal charges,

53
0:02:59.861,000 --> 0:03:,000
enter lax plea deals

54
0:03:01.501,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and otherwise remove a victim's voice from the process,

55
0:03:04.913,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because again,

56
0:03:06.273,000 --> 0:03:11,000
a state theoretically represents the interests of all citizens collectively

57
0:03:11.688,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and not any one citizen individually.

58
0:03:16.204,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Despite this constitutional flaw,

59
0:03:18.056,000 --> 0:03:2,000
some victims of gender violence have found protections

60
0:03:20.646,000 --> 0:03:21,000
under federal Civil Rights statutes,

61
0:03:22.538,000 --> 0:03:23,000
such as Title IX.

62
0:03:24.51,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Title IX is not just about sports.

63
0:03:26.786,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Rather, it prohibits all forms of sex discrimination,

64
0:03:29.559,000 --> 0:03:31,000
including sexual violence and harassment

65
0:03:32.314,000 --> 0:03:35,000
within educational programs that accept federal funding.

66
0:03:36.101,000 --> 0:03:39,000
While initially targeting sex discrimination within admissions,

67
0:03:39.804,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Title IX has actually evolved over time

68
0:03:42.173,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to require educational institutions to intervene and address gender violence

69
0:03:46.724,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when committed by certain parties,

70
0:03:48.847,000 --> 0:03:52,000
such as when teachers, students or campus visitors commit sexual assault

71
0:03:53.263,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or harassment.

72
0:03:55.103,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So what this means is that through Title IX,

73
0:03:58.32,000 --> 0:04:02,000
those who seek access to education are protected against gender violence

74
0:04:02.536,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in a way that otherwise does not exist under the law.

75
0:04:05.977,000 --> 0:04:08,000
It is Title IX that requires educational institutions

76
0:04:09.614,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to take reports of gender violence seriously,

77
0:04:11.961,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or to suffer liability.

78
0:04:14.421,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And through campus-level proceedings,

79
0:04:16.568,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Title IX goes so far as to give victims equitable rights

80
0:04:19.764,000 --> 0:04:2,000
during the campus process,

81
0:04:21.553,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which means that victims can represent their own interests during proceedings,

82
0:04:25.882,000 --> 0:04:28,000
rather than relying on educational institutions to do so.

83
0:04:30.165,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And that's really important,

84
0:04:31.921,000 --> 0:04:34,000
because educational institutions have historically swept gender violence

85
0:04:35.524,000 --> 0:04:36,000
under the rug,

86
0:04:36.699,000 --> 0:04:38,000
much like our criminal justice system does today.

87
0:04:40.279,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So while Civil Rights protects some victims,

88
0:04:42.569,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we should want to protect all victims.

89
0:04:45.274,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Rather than going institution by institution,

90
0:04:48.018,000 --> 0:04:51,000
fighting for reform on campus, in the military, in the workplace,

91
0:04:51.512,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it's time to go to the Constitution

92
0:04:55.086,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and pass the Equal Rights Amendment.

93
0:04:57.59,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Originally proposed in 1923,

94
0:04:59.854,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the Equal Rights Amendment would guarantee gender equality under the law,

95
0:05:04.01,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and much like Title IX on campus,

96
0:05:06.441,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that constitutional amendment could require states to intervene

97
0:05:09.622,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and address gender violence

98
0:05:11.593,000 --> 0:05:13,000
as a prohibitive form of sex discrimination.

99
0:05:14.547,000 --> 0:05:17,000
While the Equal Rights Amendment did not pass in the 1970s,

100
0:05:18.352,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it actually came within three states of doing so.

101
0:05:21.164,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And within the last year,

102
0:05:22.909,000 --> 0:05:25,000
at least one of those states has ratified the amendment,

103
0:05:26.174,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because we live in different political times.

104
0:05:29.338,000 --> 0:05:31,000
From the Women's March to the Me Too movement,

105
0:05:31.648,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we have the growing political will of the people

106
0:05:34.055,000 --> 0:05:36,000
necessary to create lasting, legal change.

107
0:05:37.34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So as a victims' rights attorney

108
0:05:38.916,000 --> 0:05:4,000
fighting to increase the prospect of justice

109
0:05:41.275,000 --> 0:05:43,000
for survivors across the country

110
0:05:43.58,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and as a survivor myself,

111
0:05:46.358,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I'm not here to say, "Time's Up."

112
0:05:49.038,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I'm here to say, "It's time."

113
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It's time for accountability to become the norm after gender violence.

114
0:05:54.823,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It's time to pass the Equal Rights Amendment,

115
0:05:58.094,000 --> 0:06:01,000
so that our legal system can become a system of justice,

116
0:06:01.873,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and #MeToo can finally become "no more."

117
0:06:06.518,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Thank you.

118
0:06:07.693,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Applause)
